> UI for people who do not distinguish between flow communication and stock communication, to make stock communication on flow communication.
- >  [[The value of "text = stock communication]] is not appreciated by those who live by [[the value of "text = stock communication]], if it doesn't look like stock communication, TEAMS is optimizing for this.
- >  [[(Internet) chat]] to a subtle design for digital natives who want flow communication.


- > Because the UI is of a culture that wants DMs to fly by the seat of their pants, I think it's a good tool to take traditional internal politics and slide it along with it.
- >  teams is a very good UI, better email to migrate the company with the existing email culture as it is.
    - > However, the UI is extremely difficult to use for a company that already has a chat culture

- [[Flow and Stock]]
[[Microsoft Teams]]
