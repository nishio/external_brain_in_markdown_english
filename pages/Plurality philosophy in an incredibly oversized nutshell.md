Plurality, the book
- Plurality: the future of collaborative technology and democracy, co-authored by Glen Weyl and Audrey Tang, attempts to redesign 21st century collaboration while reconciling freedom and democracy.
- Vitalik Buterin's field experience in crypto assets and governance led him to the realization that a mathematically optimal mechanism was not possible and the need to incorporate a variety of connections.

Define Plurality in one sentence?
- A social philosophy that recognizes and fosters the flourishing and cooperation of diverse socio-cultural groups."
- Four elements
    - 1.[[megapolitics]] : advanced digital democracy that crosses the chasm between conflict and centralization.
    2. atmosphere of plurality: do not forcibly extend the single model, but take [[ties between individuals]] as the main subject.
    3. mechanism design: a mathematical technique in which "connections" as well as individuals are primary objects.
    - Practice in Taiwan: Tang's GovZero/vTaiwan is an example.

Megapolitics (Technocracy/Libertarianism/Purality)
- [[Technocracy]]: AI + elites plan, tend to value efficiency over freedom.
- [[Libertarianism]]: maximize [[exit rights]] and private ownership, risk of coordination failure and conflict.
- Plurality: Net democracy to aggregate broadband intentions and avoid bipolar failures.
- Differences from Balaji's Network State
    - Balaji is "cultivating new communities externally".
    - Tang is a fast feedback loop that "forks and merges" into the administrative mainstream.

A World View."
- Conventional economics assumes competition, perfect information, etc.
- Multiple models need to be stitched together
    - Gödel's incompleteness, chaos theory, fractals, and other forms of complexity.
    - The "overlap of intermediate groups" rather than individuals creates individuality ([[Simmel]]).

Differences from Libertarianism
- Plurality also emphasizes "utilization
    - Building higher-order institutions that not only allow for diversity but also maximize mutual benefit.
- Example: Allow users to combine message filters to protect fine-grained freedom to leave.

Difference from Democracy
- Degressive proportional voting: highly correlated votes are discounted to √N.
- Vision beyond the nation-state: Designed on the premise of transboundary public goods and digital citizenship.

Recommended Technology
- Identity: multifactor identity by social relationship "intersection" rather than single biometrics.
- Plural Money / Property: Harberger tax extension and community currency to combine partial common rights + public goods market.
- Voting: Correlation-corrected voting and pair-wise QFs to reduce the over-impact of united votes.
- Conversations: Extend Polis and Community Notes to extract cross-cluster consensus statements.
- Post-symbolic & Immersive Tech: Aged experience VR and other sensory sharing to propagate understanding and empathy at high speed.

Positioning in contemporary ideology
- While many movements are leaning toward issue specialization and leader dependence, Plurality reiterates the principles.
- Triangle model: of principle, task, and leader, coordination in principle is the most scalable.

Compatibility with Exponential Future
- Public Goods Funding + Limited Ownership does not combine technology hyper-acceleration and widening inequality.

Compatibility with Excellence / Expertise
- Prediction market + Plural assistance to ensure diversity while selecting "superior knowledge".

Candidate Applications
1. SNS: Community Notes x Forecast market for misinformation measures.
2. user protection software: decentralized filter market.
3. blockchain public goods: subsidize coordination between L2 competitors.
4. network states/pop-up cities: internal governance and external coordination.
5. public broadcasting: Decentralized funding allocation to reduce bias.
6. local public goods: Experiment in high-density knowledge communities such as university towns.

summary
Plurality is "the reconstruction of freedom + democracy with connection as the primary object.
It is a comprehensive framework that avoids single-model worship and combines technology and institutions to simultaneously avoid conflict, power concentration, and stagnation.
