Civilization is self

I was thinking about the question, "Mr. Nishio, you aren't interested in politics, are you?" I was thinking about the question
- Simple is Yes
- I'm interested in [[increased intellectual productivity]]."
    - "[[I'm]] not interested in which monkey will be the boss monkey in an island nation in the Far East."
- While this is an increase in personal intellectual productivity, I think it's simply "[[the]] desire to be strong."
    - [[desire to strengthen the self]].
- I'm not sure how this [[leads to]] "progress in [[civilization]]," right?
- I was thinking about this and realized that
- Isn't it no longer "[[civilization]] is [[self]]"?
- [The protein body and the information in it is just a temporary cache.
    - Related:.
        - [[Accessism]]
            - [[The body is a cache.]]
            - [[Union with the Permanent Transcendent]]
- If this is the case, then a situation in which the totality of open-access information is harmed is equivalent to being "harmed in one's own body.
- When this happens, it's an attack on my body to have a dictatorial regime and [[burn]] information about the past that is not good for them.
- In this regard, even if Japan is at peace, it is NG if book burning takes place in other countries, and it is also NG if information that has not yet been fully digitized is destroyed due to war, etc.
    - Digital scanning of cultural assets is helpful for preservation.
    - [[The toxic meme of the "right to privacy.]]

It's a very far-fetched expression, but I think it's consistent with a lot of things.

next:  [[Direction of progress of civilization]]
