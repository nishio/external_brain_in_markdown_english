- [[scalar growth]] and [[jigsaw-like growth]]

- scalar growth
    - Image of growth as blocks accumulate
    - I'm only thinking of the value of the block itself.
    - I don't think about my relationship with them.

    - [[jigsaw-like growth]]
        - Pieces of [[jigsaw puzzle]] flow in, and only the ones that fit well remain.
    - You can't know in advance whether the pieces that flow in will fit together well or not.
        - Whether or not [[be suited for]] is not an attribute of the jigsaw puzzle alone.
    - It is determined by [[Relationships]] with the pieces you already have lined up.
            - [[Attributes of relationships rather than single attributes]]

relevance
    - [[growth]]
    - [[learning]]
