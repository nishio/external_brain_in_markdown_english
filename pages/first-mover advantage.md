title: "first-mover advantage"
---

- The stronger the [[WTA]]-like situation, the stronger the influence of first-mover advantage.
- The advantage depends on the imitator's cost of imitation and the predecessor's cost of research.
- If easily imitated, the imitator has an advantage
    - Predecessors will no longer bear the cost of research
    - So we grant monopoly rights through patents.
- When imitation and research costs are comparable
    - It does not particularly serve as a barrier to entry.
    - A set of monopoly and public disclosure through patents contributes to lowering the cost of imitation.
- A situation where advantage is even more advantageous.
        - [[network effect]]
    - Imitation alone does not produce the utility of network effects.
        - Example: If a competitor launches a service with the exact same functionality as Twitter after Twitter becomes widely used, no one will move to the competitor's side.
    - Some kind of differentiation can cause people to move.
        - For example, it used to be possible to speak freely, but now that the rules have become stricter, it has become uncomfortable.
            - [As we saw in Why do social networking sites rise and fall?
