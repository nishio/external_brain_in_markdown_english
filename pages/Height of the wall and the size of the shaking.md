    - When we were talking about the concept of [[tulip]], I thought, "Huh?" I felt uncomfortable.
- High and low walls are not objectively observable, relative concepts
- The "height of the wall" is not a personal characteristic, but a metaphor with an external factor-like quality.
- When the shaking is great, even high walls are exceeded
- I think [[shaking]] is more of a personal characteristic.
    - [[multi-power]]
