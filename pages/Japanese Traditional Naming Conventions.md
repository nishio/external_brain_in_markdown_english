Even those who value cultural diversity often ignore Japanese naming conventions out of ignorance. To address this, I created an easy-to-understand image.

While it is perfectly fine for Japanese individuals here to voluntarily use the reverse order, common among English speakers, to avoid this explanation cost, it is not preferable for any specific culture to impose the reverse order on people from other cultures.
