title: "Speed of knowledge obsolescence"

    - [[obsolescence]] There is knowledge that is hard to do and knowledge that is easy to do.

- The kind of knowledge that is hardly obsolete even five years later.
    - How did you learn that?"
    - If you put in as much time as I do, in five years you'll know as much as I do."

- If it's hard to become obsolete, if it's obvious, if it's easy to learn, if the demand is clear, people will learn.
    - So it's either not obvious that it's not easily obsolete, or it's not easy to learn, or the demand isn't clear.
