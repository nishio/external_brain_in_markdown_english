title: "Even if a new continent is discovered, not everyone will emigrate."

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1657618902644584448) Just because a [[new continent]] is discovered doesn't mean we all have to [[emigrate]].
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1657620972072226818) Especially when the [[social system]] of the new continent is still in the trial-and-error stage, it can be perceived as "[[a]] dangerous place" by the inhabitants of the old world. When people who have moved to the new continent say, "This is a wonderful place, everyone should come," they are perceived as [[cheaters]] trying to lure them to a [[hazardous]] place. So you don't have to invite them.
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1657621585766006785) People who [[move]] to the [[new world]] should enjoy living in the new world and transmit the [[pleasure]] of their lives. If the [[attraction]] of the new world exceeds the [[anxiety]] cost of the change to the new world, people will naturally move. And of course, there are people who do not want to move to the end, and there is no need to worry now about how to deal with such people who will arise in the future.

    - [[What if a new continent is discovered?]]
    - [[Hides the gate, but shows the brilliance inside the fence.]]
    - If you don't have to hide it and it doesn't come in, don't hide it.
    - It's a low resolution to think the boundaries of the community are one.
            - [[There is more than one boundary.]]
        - [[Dual organization and legitimate peripheral participation]] would be fine.
