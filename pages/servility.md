- [The seven prudences (pride, overpride, pride in excess, forbearance, pride in excess, pride in excess, pride in excess, pride in base, pride in base, and evil pride) are analyzed in the "Mahavairocana" and the "Sei Yidamaka Ronji" (Abhidharma treatises), and all have the same root, "egotism through comparison.
- In [[Theravada]], based on [[Sthanipata]] and others, all three comparisons of "superior, equal, and inferior" are considered to be pride.
    - I am better than him (seyyamāna), I am equal to him (sadisamāna), I am inferior to him (hinamāna) - all are binding.
- In Buddhism, pride is not a problem of "condescension" per se, but rather the **"structure of comparing superiority and inferiority around the self. The teachings of the seven prudences and the three kinds of pride see not only "superiority" but also "inferiority" and "equality" as rooted in the same vexation, and show the way to "become free from comparison.
