- I thought [[Cost of Diversity]] didn't convey what I wanted to say, so I illustrated it.
    - [[the majority]]'s perception of the current situation is out of sync with reality.
    - Red circles are placed where you think is best for the range of your observations.
    - But in reality [[minority]] is forced to pay the cost ("far ... .")
- Proposed correction: moved the red circle to the optimal position (center of gravity) for the whole
    - But for a minority, it's just a drop in the bucket.
    - Majority that did not observe the minority feels "far away".
        - This is what I wanted to say in "[[Cost of Diversity]].
        - The "cost of diversity," as the majority calls it, is simply a cost that has not been observed before
        - And they think they've paid the cost, but it's not at all sufficient to meet the needs of the minority.
- The ideal state is not "moving the red circle to where it belongs," but "increasing the red circle itself."
    - To use a specific example, it's not about what kind of work you do, but about how you choose to work.
            - [[Cybozu's Human Resources System]]
            - > 2007-2018 Selective Personnel Systems
            - > Initially 2 classifications, later 3, then 9 in 2013, ending in 2018 with the ability to set up each person individually.
    - This would allow for the participation of those who have been in the minority because of the costs imposed on them.
        - Blue X markings are increasing.
        - For example, people who could not work 9:00-5:00 or 7:00-3:00 will be able to work by diversifying their options.
    - relevance
            - [[A uniform three-day weekend ignores diversity.]]
            - [[Mandatory regular leave also low discretionary status]]
