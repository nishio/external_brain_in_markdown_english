It was great to be able to go back to [[SBIR]] and [[Bayh-Dole Act]]. Then, I followed the trend of [[Koji Omi]] and [[OIST]].

I hope that I will be able to leave behind the fact that I have been working on [[metascience]] from this perspective. I think it had such an impact in the future that it opened up a new field.
