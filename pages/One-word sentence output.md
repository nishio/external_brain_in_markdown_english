    - In [[Inverted index and pointing]], I wrote that what is needed for pointing behavior is a mapping from observation to location, similar to the inverted index needed for search engines
- Consider [[one-word sentence]] output as the next developmental step after pointing behavior
    - Primitive as an algorithm
        - Finds the position (document ID) from the observed words and selects a word in that document for output.
    - This would use the transposition of the mapping W from observation to location
    - [[AutoEncoder]]
- This would eliminate the need for what was once a "place" to be discrete.
        - [[Location Continuity]]
