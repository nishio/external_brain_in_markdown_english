title: "Overcome the hassle by making it a habit to look back."
---

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Claude/icon' alt='Claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The following is a summary of past discussions about [[looking back]], focusing on nishio's opinion.
- Since there is no comparison, it is difficult to determine whether looking back is a hassle.
- Looking back is like [[brushing your teeth]]. It may seem tedious, but do not hesitate to do it or not, and do it habitually.
- It is obvious that if we do not look back, it will not be good for us in the long run.
- Deciding "to do" instead of "to do or not to do" every time can reduce costs.
- It is essential to verbalize what you have thought about, what you have spent time on, and what results you have achieved in your work. Without looking back, it is impossible to report appropriately.
    - [[verbalization of results]].
- Failure to look back may result in a lower evaluation.

Other participants commented that looking back is tedious, that although it is tedious, the fun outweighs the tedium, and that it has become a habit. Others said that they lose a sense of time if they do not look back, while others said that looking back at the past itself is enjoyable.

- Kind of like "toothpaste."
    - If you ask me if it's a hassle, it's more of a "hassle," but if you ask me if I'm not sure if I want to do it or not, it's more like "no, I'm not sure, I'm just going to do it.
    - If you don't look back, you'll have "periods of not looking back," and if you don't brush your teeth, you'll have "teeth that haven't been brushed," neither of which will cause major problems immediately, but it's obvious that it's not good in the long run, so I guess I'll brush my teeth.
- When "to do or not to do" is the subject of decision-making, there is a cost for every decision, but when "to do" is decided, there is no cost.
    - "Do you want to brush today? Or not?" I don't even think about it.
- I've been thinking a lot about it, but I'm starting to think it ultimately comes down to "that's my job.
    - It is not the type of work where you do what you are told to do, but the type of work where you do what you decide to do, so reporting "I did this" is essential to the business.
    - If I don't look back, I would have to report something like, "This week...I've been busy with a lot of things! So, it is impossible not to look back.
    - It is a natural part of the job to be able to verbalize what you think and what you spend your time on, what results you have achieved by doing so, and what results you may achieve in the future, or your reputation will be damaged.
