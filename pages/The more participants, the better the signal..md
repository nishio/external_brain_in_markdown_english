>  "With careful design, we have found that the more people we reach, the higher quality signals we get. This is very counterintuitive, because 10 years ago people thought, 'Once you have a certain number of participants, the tool stops working,' but now we have language models and so on, and the more data, the better. Things have really changed."

Explanation (main points)
- Conventional view that multiple participants were thought to "lower quality
    - It used to be thought, "If there are too many people in digital democracy and civic participation, won't it just create too much noise and not work as well?" It used to be thought that "if there are too many people in a digital democracy or citizen participation space, there will be too much noise.
- In fact, "the more, the more sophisticated the signal."
    - The use of language models (LLMs) and other tools has made it easier to organize, visualize, and analyze large numbers of opinions in an appropriate manner. As a result, it is easier to obtain "good signals.
    - More participants → richer data → more sophisticated analysis for detecting supermodularity → better quality.
- Focus on the "counter-intuitive."
    - This is known as "counterintuitive. Normally, we tend to think that an increase in the number of people will lead to chaos, but the important lesson is that if well designed, the benefits can be reversed and expanded.
- Key Points: Careful infrastructure design and technology
    - Participation design (voting methods and visualization tools) to better handle diverse voices and technology such as robotics and language models are providing a boost.
    - Such a design allows for "large-scale, constructive dialogue and voting" and facilitates obtaining good signals from a large group of people.

In short, the key point is that "counterintuitive" is the key to overturning the preconceived notion that it is easier to aggregate opinions when there are fewer participants, and that, if designed well, "good signals" can be derived as the number of participants increases. The implication is that the key is "counterintuitive" in that, if designed well, the more people, the better the "signal".
