Practice testing and distributed practice, which were considered highly useful, were also discussed in [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]].
- Testing: [[(3.4.1) Testing is a means of memory]].
- Spacing out learning: [[(3.5.1) Review after forgetting]].
- Practice testing: Self-testing or taking practice tests over to-be-learned material
- Distributed practice: Implementing a schedule of practice that spreads out study activities over time

Those with medium usefulness
- Elaborative interrogation: Generating an explanation for why an explicitly stated fact or concept is true
    - Explain why it is right.
- Self-explanation: Explaining how new information is related to known information, or explaining steps taken during problem solving
    - Explain the relationship to other information and the derivation process
    - Writing a commentary in [[Scrapbox]] is going to be a commentary on how it relates to other information.
- Interleaved practice Implementing a schedule of practice that mixes different kinds of problems, or a schedule of study that mixes different kinds of material, within a single study session
    - Mixing different types of learning objects
