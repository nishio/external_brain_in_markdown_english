- Local Exchange Trading System, or LETS for short, is a local currency system for exchanging goods and services within a community. LETS started in Canada in the 1980s and is used in many regions around the world.

- LETS typically focus on one region or community and allow transactions among its members. This is intended to stimulate local economic activity and enhance social cohesion.

- The system works as follows
    - Participants list the goods and services they can offer. This may include handmade products, special skills or expertise, or general labor.
    - These goods and services are traded in a local currency created by LETS, rather than in regular currency. This allows participants to purchase goods and services from other participants using the currency.
    - Transactions are generally based on credit, and borrowing and lending are usually regulated by community rules.

- The main advantages of LETS are
    - Stimulate the local economy: Local currency is used locally and encourages the exchange of local products and services.
    - Strengthening Communities: LETS provides opportunities for people to connect and support each other.
    - Mitigating the effects of financial crises: Local currencies may help protect local economies from general financial system problems.
    - Equal access: LETS allows people with little cash to exchange goods and services.

- However, LETS also face challenges and problems. They include difficulties in administration and organization, determining appropriate values, lack of liquidity, and lack of participation.
