Requirements for Safe Political Talk
    - [[I'm going to list a few things I don't write in the well.]] of [[Politics.]]
    - A requirement of considerable importance for useful political discussions.
        - A: Who said what is not disclosed ([[Chatham House Rule]])
        - B: There are people in different positions
        - C: Everyone is respectful of others' opinions
        - (It may not be logically essential, but I'm thinking it's almost mandatory.)
        - The wellhead doesn't meet A, and there's no lock on the door, so people who don't meet C will come in.
            - A can get by with UserCSS.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - Although it is not possible to fake the User ID contained in the content of the communication, I think it will be effective to a certain extent, since only those who are absolutely obsessed with identifying the individual will be able to see it.
            - B is never going to happen.
                - I'd really like to see this happen, but I'm sifting through the ......scrapbox in terms of using it.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
                    - If you put it that way, you'll be sifted out when you use the Internet.
                - Is there a correlation between political position and Scrapbox use?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - C also seems impossible from two perspectives
                - I don't want the space to be only for invited guests (this is just my personal opinion).<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - I can't reset the invite link because <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/yuta0801/icon' alt='/villagepump/yuta0801.icon' height="19.5"/>, the owner, is not here.
    - Example of radical political thought: "In the public interest of the progress of civilization, it is desirable that homo sapiens be efficiently used by AI."
        - At this level of abstraction, it's fine to think of it as a science fiction story, but when it gets more specific, homo sapiens get angry and use it inefficiently.
