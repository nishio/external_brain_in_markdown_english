Looking at contemporary SNS space in the context of "hare and ke," it can be said that the distinction between "extraordinary (hare)" and "everyday (ke)" has been lost, and that hare = staged, public behavior has become the norm. Dialogic activities that could only be held at limited times and places, such as festivals ("Arendt's public space"), are now forcibly held 24 hours a day on social networking services, depriving people of even their private rest (ke) - this has led to the "collapse of public nature" and the "banalization of activities.

In terms of "[[Legitimate Peripheral Participation]]" (Lave & Wenger), the process of moving from the periphery of the community to the center of the community, while learning from it, is hardly functioning in SNS. The "apprenticeship" phase to acquire experience and conventions is omitted, and everyone suddenly becomes the center of the community (i.e., has a voice), which does not ensure the quality of discussions and only amplifies shallow familiarity.

In summary,
- 1.disappearance of the boundary between hare/ke → As staged public acts become routine, the true public space (hare place through the quiet accumulation of ke) is lost.
- 2.Lack of peripheral participation → Because people jump into the center without learning and customary processes, deep dialogue is not fostered and only "banal chatter" is rampant.

Combining these two perspectives reveals that the key to the revitalization of the public in the digital age lies in a moderate separation of hare and ke and a phased approach that restores peripheral participation.

For example, saying to a randomly selected citizen, "Please discuss as a representative of the residents," is a grant of [[legitimacy]] in "legitimate peripheral participation," and the person who has this done becomes "extraordinary" in that discussion forum.
