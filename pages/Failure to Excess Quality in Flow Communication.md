- #Flow and Stock
    - Slack is a chat, not a UI suited to organizing information
    - It's not a place to spend the cost of writing in the first place, because it will drift away soon after you've put the effort into it.
- #Guerrilla warfare between superiors and bottoms up
    - Slack would have made it easier for each member of the organization to disseminate information
    - Picking it up well would have made bottom-up possible.
    - Information dissemination costs] have jumped because of the atmosphere created by accountability and other factors that make it difficult to write in a cursory manner.
    - Slack's advantages are gone.
- Atmosphere that does not allow for messy writing
    - How did this atmosphere come about?
    - Excessive quality requirements for written materials for internal communication.
    - Similar to the process by which a product comes to have excessive quality #Excessive Quality

- There are those who interpret that being a chat means "write fast and short" and being a wiki means "anyone can rewrite", and there are those who don't interpret it that way, and when the latter are in a position to decide how to use the tool, they decide to do it the way they are used to.
    - For example, this case study, "Don't do real-world synchronous communication in asynchronous chat," argues

        - On the other hand, time is wasted in this exchange because the hand is stopped at the first notification. It assumes the speaker's accustomed method of "first comes the requirements."
