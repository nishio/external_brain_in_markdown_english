Place the book's table of contents in Scrapbox
- Book Table of Contents on Scrapbox, I started making a few by hand to try it out and instantly hated it.
    - Create a UserScript that converts a bidirectional link to a one-way link?
        - [[Table of ContentsReading]] よくやる<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/erniogi/icon' alt='/villagepump/erniogi.icon' height="19.5"/>

    - I think this is a situation where there is only a "path" and the actual content is in the book and cannot be placed in Scrapbox because of copyright.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - They're taking advantage of the "discovery" effect of connecting roads.
        - On the other hand, what I'm trying to do now is to present a table of contents to the reader based on the assumption that all the content is on Scrapbox.
    - There is certainly a difference between capturing only the inductive path of content and capturing the entire content.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
- The concept of "link" in Scrapbox, if you ask 100 people who have no experience with Scrapbox, more than 90 of them will think it's a one-way link.
- So in that sense, Scrapbox is an "easy to create two-way links" system.
    - It's hard to represent bidirectional links in a tool that is primarily one-way links, so it's not going to get done.
- [Japanese translation of Scrapbox Reader [https://scrapbox--reader--nishio-vercel-app.translate.goog/nishio/(6.2.4)_Parable,_metaphor,_analogy?_x_tr_sl=en](https://scrapbox--reader--nishio-vercel-app.translate.goog/nishio/(6.2.4)_Parable,_metaphor,_analogy?_x_tr_sl=en) &_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US&_x_tr_pto=wapp]
    - I'm using Scrapbox Reader to display the human translation of "The Art of Intellectual Production by Engineers" in Scrapbox, and then using Google Translate to convert it into Japanese.
        - The logic is that publishers complain when the content of a book is put directly on the Web, but they cannot prohibit users from reading English content translated by machine.
    - I have Vercel configured to return responses without blocking, so "loading" appears in the translation results.
    - I wonder if CSS can do something about the blank lines being skipped.
    - Did I follow the link and it's /en instead of /nishio? Needs to be debugged

    - There you have it, [[unexplored list of names]].
- Today's Diary
    - 2I fixed the title of the translated page with Pomodoro and it says "Already exists."
        - There was already a translation!
    - I want an app that overcomes the heartbreak of "I've translated 4 more pages, great, I want an app that affirms penguins praise me!

    - However, I have a page with two different translations, and I don't dare throw out one of them, so the need for merging was born [[negative workload]] ...
