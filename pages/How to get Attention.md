        - Music charts are money, right?
            - What was originally supposed to start as a visualization of the amount of "people" paying for a product has been transformed by the creation of a lifestyle where one fan buys multiple CDs.
- Rally and march
    - Size of audience for street speeches, number of participants in demonstrations
    - The "number of bodies gathered on the spot" is a persuasive factor and increases the value of the press.
