> Social relational capital is a term that refers to "[[trust]]" held toward others, "[[norms of reciprocity]]" expressed in terms such as "having it all", and "[[networks]]" that are "bonds (between people)" between people. It creates "[[cooperation as a group]]" that is difficult to value in the marketplace.

- Social capital = [[social capital]].
- Network = [[human network]] = knowing the other person, being able to talk frankly [[psychological safety]].
- Collective collaboration = [[teamwork]].

A state in which these are present in the company leads to higher productivity than a state in which they are absent.
Therefore, we consider it a type of capital similar to "having money or production equipment" (so-called [[capital]] or [[financial capital]]) or "having knowledge" ([[knowledge capital]]).

Although the literal translation [[SOC]] is sometimes chosen to avoid misunderstanding because it is sometimes mistaken for social infrastructure such as water supply.
