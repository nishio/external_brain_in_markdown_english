[Mabo on Twitter: "Struggles of a 3-year-old and his parents with the 'why-why period' (1/2)..."](https://twitter.com/yoitan_diary/status/1397190271524380674?s=21)

When I saw this, I thought, "Of course that's just a matter of paraphrasing one word into another," but then I thought that there are cases where the same kind of response would be used in a listening chat system.
Would it be better if we could step back and look at the situation from a bird's eye view and understand that these conversations are sterile? Let me try to verbalize what is happening in this situation.

The reason why this cartoon example is so sterile is that the language remains abstract all the time.

The cartoon says "word factorization shindo".
- But what we are doing is like a mathematical expression: "Here is $x^2 - 1$. Substituting $y$ for $x$ yields $y^2 - 1$. Substituting $z$ for $y$ yields $z^2 - 1$..." and so on.
- It's just a barren repetition of meaningless mathematical transformations, and no matter how many times you repeat them, you can't factor them out.

Why did you think it was cute?" I did not think about "Why did I think it was cute when I saw a child acting with a true-to-life Anpanman doll? This is the reason why the discussion was not grounded in reality.
He thinks he can answer immediately without thinking properly, so he hastily responded with the word "innocent," but as a result, he has cut off what he really should have thought about and is in an unanswerable ditch.
The child asks, "Why did you find this situation 'cute'?" and is asking questions about "you" but is not facing those questions.
