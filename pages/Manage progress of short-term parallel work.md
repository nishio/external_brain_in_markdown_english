Manage progress of short-term parallel work

- Current Considerations Regarding [AI Task Management System
- It is beneficial in some ways, but it is not good because it causes "more tasks in the process of consulting to reduce the pain of tasks" unless it becomes more accurate, at least with regard to the problem of "[[it is hard when there are several AI assistants running in parallel]]" that I started to create in the first place because I felt the pain.
- A situation where you need to manage the progress of parallel work in the short term, perhaps "[[write on a notepad and erase with strike-through]]" is the classic and most powerful means.
    - It would be a good idea to put the "vague descriptions" and "carry-over tasks that were not completed in a day" in the notepad into the AI task management system at night.
