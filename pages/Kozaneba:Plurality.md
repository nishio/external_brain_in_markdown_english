> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1645705731105226752?s=20): Regarding "plurality", which I thought I didn't know what it meant, the word as a handle in my mind at the moment is "plurality through digital technology". I'm not sure what you mean by "plurality".

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1645713847578423297) Notes on what I don't understand: what happened on the [[vTaiwan]] platform when Uber pacted with Taiwan?
- Example of [/tkgshn/pol.is being used in practice](https://scrapbox.io/tkgshn/pol.is being used in practice).
    - [Hacking ideology: pol.is and vTaiwan | by Paula Berman | Hacktivism](https://words.democracy.earth/hacking-ideology-pol-is-and-vtaiwan-570d36442ee5)
        - [[Polis]]

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1645753836852871174?s=20): I've experienced "[[pol.is]]", I see. I can guess how it works, but I feel like it's a good use of it.
- [[Polis]]
- > [@0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1645802995660247040?s=20): @nishio Changing the subject, this inspired [DeCartography

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1645755663799447555) What I don't understand: the relationship between [[Polis]] and vTaiwan
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1645802674808553474) Is the system almost the same?
- > [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1645802918539575299) It is a relationship called vTaiwan using Pol.is. For example, [[Radical X Change]]'s [[RxC Voice]], and similarly, Pol.is is embedded.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1645803298912616455) So Polis is open source, so it's used as a component in many places.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1645719836406976512) So vTaiwan did this on a national level, which I drew up on 3/29.

- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1645721294401605632) It says "reshape how we govern the public and private sectors."
- >  As a research department member of a groupware company, I have always considered the mass of "municipal employees" in a company or even a municipality as an organizational boundary, but if you consider [[local government]] and its local residents as one team, it becomes the same form.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1645722551925243905) When we talk about "[[mobile voting]]", if we consider the granularity of the voting target as a country, it is hard for most Japanese people to move out of the country because of the language hurdle. However, if you consider the granularity of Japanese municipalities within Japan, it is not difficult, and it is already being done. [[Akashi City excess inflow of 9,000 people]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1645786071391944704) "[[broad listening]]" that allows "millions of people to hear the extracted essence of the distribution of opinions of their peers" COOL !!!
- > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1645805175612014597?s=46&t=gkSZtjGEtUZPO0JCzBxCBw): I'm not sure why I suddenly get so excited when I see that what I felt was a "useful business concept" at the Plurality stage is now "broad listening". I am essentially interested in "enhancement of human intellectual ability".
- > Better consensus-building" can be achieved if humans' "ability to recognize the opinions of many" is enhanced.
- > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1645806155124600833?s=46&t=gkSZtjGEtUZPO0JCzBxCBw): Because humans have a low "ability to recognize the opinions of many", we find "enemies" in differences of opinion We tend to think of each other as a minority or an idiot. If we can strengthen this ability, we will be able to build a better consensus. This is indeed collective intelligence.

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1645740673675698176?s=20): [[dictatorship]] rule by [[single]] and [[singularity]] AI I wonder if the movement toward **republicanism** governance by [[mechanism design]] of better "[[social choice]]" and "[[consensus building]]" with the enhancement of "[[digital]]" technology by "[[several]]" humans in a "[[diverse]]" position as an opposing concept to the "[[singularity]]" of AI, which is far smarter than humans. republicanism] movement for better governance through [[mechanism design]]?

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1645807494118375424?s=46&t=gkSZtjGEtUZPO0JCzBxCBw): Being in a peaceful Japan, where the identity is not held by the government, the freedom of assembly I know in my head that it's a difficult situation where freedom of assembly and freedom of association is important, but it's hard to empathize with the sense of urgency.
