title: "Stuck in the formality of a previous era."

I tried to clip [[tokoroten]]'s picture because it was interesting, and while I was at it, I developed a contextual tweet, but it's also interesting that tokoroten didn't pick up on any of the stories over there.
- Might split pages in the future.
    - I also think that [[Liberation from the legacy format of the book]] is necessary.

>  It's an analogy that I talk about in various places, but the current situation is like "smartphone games before Pazudora came out," with only shadow games where the screen is big enough to display large cards, or wooden puzzle apps that can be played using swiping. The former doesn't take advantage of the touch screen and the latter doesn't take advantage of internet communication.

If they could break free from that, a large market would open up, like the native social games that have been around since Pazudora, but they don't know where to focus their attention and break free from existing forms of expression and media, so they are all still searching.
