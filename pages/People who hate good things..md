title: "People who hate good things."
---

Some people, when they see that others have "[[nice things]]", instead of wanting those "nice things" themselves, they [[hate]] the "nice things".
- As I was writing this, I realized it's also related to [[sour grapes]].
    - This [[unobtainable]] "good" is considered "not good" [[cognitive distortion]].
    - Discuss how harmful it is
    - I also see a lot of "[[not worth the money]]" arguments.
        - If you feel that way, just don't buy it, so why are you so eager to insist? Oh, I'm talking about if you really want it.
        - Worthless.]" by those who don't use it as a general statement is a bad argument because it means "I'm just not experienced enough to find a way to make it worthwhile."
- I find the nuances of "hate" a little different.
    - Also related to "[[The opposite of love is]] not hate but indifference."
    - Don't be indifferent, hate, this is some kind of [[attachment]].
