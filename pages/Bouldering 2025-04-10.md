- It's 1:00 p.m.
    - If you're lazy, you'll use up all the time you've got.
    - I think "[[idly]]" is a little different.
        - The thoughts were happily rolling around.
    - "If you're not careful..."
- I left home!
    - Have lunch and go to Novolok Shibuya, then go to [[Code for Japan]] and play bodgeball.
        - [[Open StarTer Village]]
    - I'm going to buy a [[body sheet]] (deciding that if I'm going to meet someone after [[bouldering]], I might as well wipe my sweat off).
- After eating lunch, it is 14:00. More time has passed than expected.
- I've arrived at Shibuya, but I don't have as much time as I thought I did.
        - [[Shibuya Stream]] Lost in front of
        - I get lost in Shibuya no matter how many times I go there.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/カイト/icon' alt='/villagepump/カイト.icon' height="19.5"/>

        - Oh, no!
- It's going to be 15:00 after all.
    - I end up only being active for about two hours.
    - I looked up the route to my next destination and it was an unexpected "7 minute walk.
    - 15:05 Roller start
    - Although the 8th grade is easy, it's grueling when it's overhanging.
        - [https://lotw.fun/projects/20680](https://lotw.fun/projects/20680)
        - I slipped on my right foot.
    - 15:19 Roller up to level 8 is done, let's dabble with the rest.
        - So far, I'm already zeher.
- I was playing with the beginner wall all to myself, but then people started showing up.
    - Well, I did four 7th grade and it was zealous, so I took a break.
- 15:39 Class 7 completed Slab or overhang has more impact on the difficulty than 6 or 7...
    - Muscle Strength Issues
    - I'm getting the feeling that we're clear, but not "dangerously" clear.
        - (a) plain<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/takker/icon' alt='takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I guess today's challenge line is to see if I can complete all 6 levels in time!
    - Oh, no.

        - This is a hold that you hold in your grip, but I don't have the strength to hold it.
            - Maybe the key is not the grip, but the direction in which you pull on the hold.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/takker/icon' alt='takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - Hanging with your body weight increases vertical drag and allows you to hang without using your grip.

                        - Writing the human body is difficult
                - I see<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
                    - Clear with spirit
                    - Xeher in one bottle.
                - Interesting!<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/はるひ/icon' alt='/villagepump/はるひ.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I'm climbing 28 in an hour.
            - 29 bottles.
            - Time Attack.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/takker/icon' alt='takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - From the description, it looks like you're getting a little out of breath, so next time it would be better to slow down and take a good break in between.
        - I can't do it at all anymore, it's a muscle problem.
            - I did a slab assignment on the main wall and made it to 30.
            - I still have 30-60 minutes left, but it doesn't feel like it's a matter of time w
- A large number of inexperienced people flowed in, like a college club, let's go home!
    - Everyone is avoiding the overhangs, so that's all they have to do.
- Surprisingly, everyone left.
- I recovered a little and was able to add one while I watched the college kids.
- It's time to move on to the next destination.
    - Vertical grade 7 and relatively marginal.
