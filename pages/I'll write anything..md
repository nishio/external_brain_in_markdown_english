title: "I'll write anything."

In Jiro Kawakita's [[KJ method]], he talks about "collecting everything and then finding the structure.
    - [[might have something to do with it]] I'll write about anything.
    - [[From a 360-degree viewing angle]] Gather data and make decisions based on it.
- This area is very much in the context of [[careful deliberation]], "[[there appears to be]] a connection."
