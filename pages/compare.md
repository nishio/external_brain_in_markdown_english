title: "compare"
---

I use the word especially to show [[analogy]]. In many cases, I compare similar things to describe what I want to say. It is good to find patterns. See [[(0.2.2) Compare and find patterns]].

However, there are also differences. I described this pattern of thinking on [[(1.5.1.3) Focus on the difference]].
