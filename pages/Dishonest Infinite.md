Summary (key points first)
In the Japanese-speaking world, the term "insincere infinity" is used not as a philosophical term derived from Hegel, but mainly by those who reinterpret it as a metaphorical expression in the Web3 and political tech communities. In particular, it is frequently used in the four-quadrant model of "sincerity/dishonesty × finite/infinite" proposed by [[Shogo Ochiai]] (@shogochiai) and his surrounding community, and has spread to Team Mirai supporters and critics, blockchain-related events and individual bloggers. The following is a list of major senders and examples of usage.

1. core originator

1.1 Shogo Ochiai (sg / @shogochiai)
- He posted several tweets that problematize the "︎ (upper left) = dishonest infinite" in his own four-quadrant model. ([X (formerly Twitter)](https://twitter.com/shogochiai/status/1922892163995599211?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    - I guess this is the first.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - > [shogochiai](https://x.com/shogochiai/status/1920582237570875603) [[pension]] and other institutional designs implicitly have "[[infinite]]" in their logic, but as soon as they meet any of the following conditions: they cannot be infinite in the first place, [[ borrowing]] from future generations," and "vulnerable to [[black swan]] events. We call this a "dishonest infinite." And the next institutional design will do the same thing.
- Some of his statements are light-hearted in developing the concept, such as "[[Immortality as an insincere infinity]], that's nice." ([X (formerly Twitter)](https://twitter.com/shogochiai/status/1922891894478053681?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

1.2 tkgshn / 0xtkgshn

- He presents a critical framework of "an argument that says nothing = an infinity of dishonesty" with the example of Akio Hoshi's critique of human rights theory. ([Cosense](https://scrapbox.io/tkgshn/%E4%B8%8D%E8%AA%A0%E5%AE%9F%E3%81%AA%E7%84%A1%E9%99%90?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

3. implications of the concept (reinterpretation in the Japanese-speaking world)
1. modern replacement of Hegel's "The Evil Infinite
    - It has the same root in that it criticizes [[the attitude of endless outward flight]], but it is used more as a metaphor than as a philosophical rigor.
2. anti-patterns of policy and technology development
    - It functions conveniently as a label to point out the condition that keeps saying "it will get better someday" without showing a concrete finished version.
3. web3/ai risk context
    - It is a widespread warning against positions of [[uncontrollable risk]] such as "[[Accelerationism]]" and "[[Infinite growth]]". ([ICP Japan 〖Official/Official〗](https://www.icp-japan.org/post/ai-crypto-deai))
4. critical words for discussion attitude
    - He calls statements that only superficially present "correctness" without substance "insincere and endless," and urges sincere and finite proposals. ([Cosense](https://scrapbox.io/tkgshn/%E4%B8%8D%E8%AA%A0%E5%AE%9F%E3%81%AA%E7%84%A1%E9%99%90))

4. summary and observation points
- In effect, coined words around sg spread through Twitter, Scrapbox, and blogs.
- As the four-quadrant diagram is shared as a visual memo, others easily cite and transform the concept.
- In the future, there is a possibility that this term will spread beyond Web3 and political tech as an anti-pattern term in policy evaluation and project management.
Thus, "insincere infinite" is a keyword that has evolved uniquely in the Japanese-speaking online community, and by following the source and examples of usage, lines of values and criticism among the community can be seen.
