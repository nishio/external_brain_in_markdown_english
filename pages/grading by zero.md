### Summary of notes
.
The "rank by zero" allowed for the efficient representation of large numbers by introducing a symbol indicating their non-existence.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The note is directly related to the fragment "rank by zero". They both illustrate the same concept and agree that the introduction of the symbol indicating non-existence allowed for the efficient representation of large numbers.

### deep thinking
This note illustrates the evolution of mathematical representation and its importance. The introduction of zero has dramatically improved the representation of numbers and the efficiency of computation. It shows that new concepts and tools expand the possibilities of thought and expression.
