I thought that the [[negative capability]] is related to the ability to withstand the increase in uncertainty, as opposed to the decrease in uncertainty over time in the normal process.
    - [[Uncertainty cone]]

Therefore, the [[mass media]], which has [[mass acceptance incentives]], accelerates [[sabotage]].
    - [[Pleasing the masses is evil.]]

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1819663463335301565) I didn't have that perspective, but it's interesting. I mean, for someone who foresees a future where after [[0 -> 1]] it grows like a [[Rolling Snowball]] to 100, investing 10 to create 1 is justified, and since you invested 10 to trigger the creation of 100, 100 is yours. Someone who doesn't see the future expects a return of 12 for the effort of 10.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1819664389143929284) So those people cannot invest 10 for 0 -> 1. On the other hand, they don't understand the action of investing 10 for 0→1, so they try to enter after 100 and fail, and then they hoard hate by deeming it not [[fairness]] and the fault of [[vested interests]]. It is simply [[too late to enter after it is clear]].

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1819665205556854868) It is a simple probability theory that 0 → 1 can be achieved at a cost of 10 by doing 10 things that cost 1 and have a higher probability of becoming 0. However, if you have the idea that "effort should be rewarded", "actions that have a higher probability of becoming 0" will seem irrational, and this idea is what is keeping you away from 0→1 success.
