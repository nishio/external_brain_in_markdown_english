Blind Card Candidate

2024-06-10
- [[The Ideal as Extreme]]


---
- [[Resolution Stage]]
- > This is something that should be separated into multiple cards.
- 2022-02-17 Split it up, I'll look back at it after a while and decide if I want to put it in a blind card.

- [[A series of pictures of two people saying different things]]

- [[Unclear dichotomy]]
- 2022-02-17 Not really a "blind spot".

`old title:  [More X, more Y.] `:  [[Fill the lake with a glass of water.]] ✅
- This could clash with the "resolution phase."
    - does not seem to do
- Maybe "The Lake and the Cup" would be better to put in the headline.
- This heading may be confused with [Two non-orthogonal axes
        - [[Two non-orthogonal axes]] is another candidate for a blind spot card.
        - ✅

- [[Assumption that it is a circle]]
    - Would you prefer [Assume that what we don't observe is the same.
    - [[Spiny spikes in higher dimensional space]]

- [[Axis, not set]]

- [[Systematization of the unknown]]

2022-02-17 Adoption
:

```
31  [Both "is X" and "is not X" are compatible.] 
	 [What you thought was one concept is two nested concepts] 
 	2022-02-17 Almost adopted the above because the content is almost the same
32  [familial resemblance] 
33  [Two non-orthogonal axes] 
34  [There are multiple ways to compromise.] 
35   [Move the good stuff.] 
	 [Not reduced, but moved out of observation range.] 
```

### Summary of notes
.
We examine the applicability and relevance of each of the concepts listed as candidate blind spot cards. In particular, we believe that "stages of resolution" should be divided into multiple cards, and we evaluate "unclear dichotomy" as having less of a "blind spot" feel. We also note that "more X, more Y" may conflict with "stages of resolution".

### Relation to Fragment
.
The fragment "Stages of Resolution" is related to the discussion of "Stages of Resolution" in the note. The note considers that this concept should be divided into several cards, and the same consideration is made in the fragment.

### deep thinking
The selection and division of blind spot cards is an important means of broadening one's perspective on problem solving. Each card offers a different perspective, and when combined, they provide deeper understanding and new insights.
