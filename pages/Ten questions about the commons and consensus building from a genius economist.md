The most powerful vision of the commons is the one Nobel Prize winner in economics [[Elinor Ostrom]] named "[[polycentric]]. The idea is that the commons with the broadest scope are at the same time the most limited, facilitating the formulation of fundamental rules that allow for the emergence of many other commons. In practice, there will be many layers of communities that overlap each other, each democratically governed, forming a network of communities that will be the basis of our lives and in which identity will be defined by the communities in which we participate just overlapping each other.
