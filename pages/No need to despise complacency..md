from  [[live life to the fullest]]
No need to despise complacency.

There is no need to call it self-satisfaction and despise it when you are satisfied doing what you want to do. It is the same as being satisfied with making and eating a delicious breakfast. But there is no need to announce it to society. When you don't feel like it's just your problem, you can ask someone who is living in the same time period, "What do you think? and offer it to those who are living in the same era.
- It may not be society as a whole. It may be a few people close to you.
