title: "Creating software for others to use."

> [t_wada](https://x.com/t_wada/status/1948590698762305714) Vibe Coding is revolutionary in that "anyone can now make software that only they use and want the most," and it is not suited (at least not yet) to making software for other people to use. I don't think it is suited (at least not yet) for creating software for other people to use.

> [t_wada](https://x.com/t_wada/status/1967855117165809827) I mentioned that Vibe Coding is a revolution for people who are not software engineers (i.e. many people around the world)

This is a good point, but I think the discussion of "suitable or unsuitable" is not very productive, and the important thing is that there are many people who assume that "making software" implicitly means "making software for other people to use", and that this interpretation has been created by conventional demand and practice and is not a universal fact. I think this interpretation is based on the current demand and customs, and is not a universal fact.

There are a lot of different [[production styles]], and you can do things you couldn't do before.

    - [[Diversity Production]]
    - [[peer production]]
- [[On-demand production]]
