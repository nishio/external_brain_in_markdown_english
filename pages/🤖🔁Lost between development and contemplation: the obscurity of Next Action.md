### Research Note Digest
.

Explore the criteria for deciding whether to choose specific actions or to deepen speculation when the direction of development is unclear. Question how to distinguish between escaping into contemplation because of the lack of concrete next actions for development and trying to prioritize contemplation because of fundamental doubts about the development path.

Nishio's "Lost between Development and Contemplation: the Unclear Nature of Next Action" is found to be relevant. The trade-off between contemplation and development" is also helpful. Clarity of project objectives is important, and AI has the opportunity to help users express their own ideas more clearly by understanding their input and asking questions about areas that are difficult to understand.

In "Mentor Personality," future-oriented thinking patterns and an emphasis on helping the creator identify the process of identifying the cause of a bug are indicated. In addition, "The KJ Method: Letting the Chaos Speak for Itself" lists elements such as understanding the situation, evaluating, making decisions, and planning policies, concrete measures, and procedures.

In the "Textbook of Design Research," finding out that "something you don't know if you can do" can be done is an expansion of the scope of what can be done, moving it to the difficult side on the axis of technical difficulty. However, this is also an unconscious narrowing of the scope of search.

In "Teamwork with AI," questions are submitted about the optimal balance in intelligent collaboration between AI and humans and how to ensure the quality and accuracy of new AI capabilities.

🤖🔁Lost between development and contemplation: the obscurity of Next Action
When the direction of development is unclear, explore the criteria for choosing specific actions or deepening contemplation.

> I have a feeling that something is going to come out of this, but it's not clear, and I'm not sure if I should proceed with the development or take a closer look at what is going to come out of it.
> How can we distinguish between escaping into speculation due to the lack of concrete next actions for development and trying to prioritize speculation over development due to fundamental doubts about the current development path?
