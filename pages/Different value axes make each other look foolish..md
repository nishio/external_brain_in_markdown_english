When Mr. A looks at Mr. B and thinks he is wasting his efforts on something of no value, it could be because Mr. B has a different value axis than Mr. A.
In this situation, both parties appear to be wasting their efforts on something that is of no value to the other.
Each is taking actions that are the most efficient when measured by their own value axes.
