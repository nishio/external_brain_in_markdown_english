Narrowing the search area

Make it a width-first search. Trim branches early. Space division. Create a quotient space with some equivalence relation and search in it. Identifies nonzero or zero. Binary representation of immovable point numbers, ignoring leading zeros.

### Summary of notes
.
Methods for narrowing the search area include width-first search, early branch pruning, spatial partitioning, creating a quotient space with equivalence relations, partitioning zeros and nonzeros, and ignoring head zeros with binary representation of immobile numbers.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The note and fragment "Narrowing the Search Range" are directly related, as they describe methods for efficiently narrowing the search range. Also, "Wrong Dichotomy" is related to narrowing the search area using the dichotomy of zero and nonzero partitioning.

### deep thinking
It is important to select the appropriate method for narrowing the search area, depending on the nature and purpose of the problem. In addition, when dichotomization is used, an appropriate division method should be selected.

### summary of thoughts and title
.
It is important to select a method to narrow the search area and to apply the dichotomy appropriately.
