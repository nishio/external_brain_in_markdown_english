title: "If only the T in KPT is written, the intent is unclear."

If you write only Try (what to do next) in [[KPT]], it is easy to become unclear about the intention of what you are doing it for.

- [[KPT of Kaizen Journey]] focuses primarily on "the next thing to try that addresses the Problem.

- In [[Cybozu's Problem Solving Method]], "[[The problem is the gap between ideal and reality]].
- What is reality?
- What is the ideal? (At the time of writing this, "reality differs from the ideal" is implicitly expressed.)
- What is the Next Action?
The order is expressed in the following order.
- The [[next action]] is equivalent to Try in KPT, but the intention of doing it (what is the current situation and what kind of ideal do you want to bring it closer to) is clearly defined.
When you look back on it after some time has passed, it is easy to understand why you decided to do this action.
