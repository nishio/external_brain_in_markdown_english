- >  MM Research Institute, Inc. has released the results of a survey on ChatGPT usage trends in business conducted among companies and organizations in Japan and the U.S. The survey, conducted from May 24 to May 31 in the form of a web questionnaire, covered 13,814 employees of companies/organizations in Japan and the U.S. (13,412 in Japan and 402 in the U.S.). The survey covered 13,814 employees (13,412 in Japan and 402 in the U.S.) belonging to companies/organizations in Japan and the U.S.
- >  According to this report, the rate of ChatGPT use in business was only 7% in Japan. In Japan, only 7% of the respondents were "considering using" ChatGPT, while 42% were "aware of it but have not used it," and 46% were "unaware of it," accounting for about half of the total. In the U.S., on the other hand, more than half of the respondents (51%) answered that they were "using" the service, which is the opposite of the result in Japan. The high level of awareness was also evident, with 18% "Considering using," 23% "Know but have not used," and 9% "Don't know.

> Japan ranks third in the world in terms of the number of ChatGPT users (after the U.S. and India, which outnumber Japan in population). This is such a great achievement for a country where English is not widely spoken that it is finally starting to attract attention abroad. It is the only country that the OpenAI CEO has visited twice in the past two months. [https://t.co/eOYkNKtNXw](https://t.co/eOYkNKtNXw)

After a week of worrying, I came up with this answer: "For the time being, don't try to help the people around you and run away as fast as you can, then if you can afford to, help them as much as you can.
