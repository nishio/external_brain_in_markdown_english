>
>  I'm an individual developer myself, so I'm thinking "I hope it catches on in Japan too"...but I think it would take some work to do it in Japan.
>
>  1. the problem that followers are all developers
>  Japanese BIPs have a strong "engineers talking to engineers" structure, and when the target audience for the product is the general public, it's hard to reach the people you want to find in the first place. It's nice, but I honestly don't think it will take hold very well...
>
>  2. wall of anonymous & duplicate culture
>  Main, backstage, guesser...everyone has separate accounts, so it's hard for BIP posts to reach various demographics. Difficult to spread across genres.
>
>  3. concentric circle structure by hobby
>  Japanese SNS tends to create a "strongly closed circle by genre". People who share the same interests may be excited among their "friends," but they do not reach people outside of that circle. If you come off as a publicity stunt, people may distance themselves from you...

> [natsumican63](https://x.com/natsumican63/status/1929445212402901332) That is why it is important to create a theme-specific account, even if it takes a lot of time and effort, to connect and interact with others who share the same passion. I think that's why it's important to create a theme-specific account, even if it takes time and effort.

>  We don't want to scale all at once or create a huge buzz! I don't think it will scale all at once or become a big hit... but by gradually giving shape to the product through dialogue with others, the resolution of the product is greatly improved, and even if similar services appear, the fact that "I am the creator" itself becomes meaningful. This is good for the mentality.

I was able to quickly overcome the barrier of 0 to 10 people right after the release, and the retention rate was very high.

I think it is similar to the difference in the point of support between foreign artists and Japanese artists.

>  For example, overseas, "overwhelming technique and expressive power" tend to be evaluated first, and then personalities and stories are reinforced.
>  On the other hand, in Japan, the "context" of a person's background, personality, and thoughts on what he or she is doing is more likely to attract initial sympathy.
>
>  I think the reason why artists born from recent audition programs are supported is that their efforts and struggles are conveyed as a story, which moves people and makes them want to support them.
>
>  That is why we believe that when implementing BIP in Japan, we should not only present functions and technologies, but also convey our background and thoughts as a developer to our intended user base, in order to create deeper empathy and reach their hearts.
