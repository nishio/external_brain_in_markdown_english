title: "leading question"

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1661193240794796034?s=20): I made this conversation [[Polis]] [https://t.co/SyyDJt1F5B](https://t.co/SyyDJt1F5B)
> [@shinji_kono](https://twitter.com/shinji_kono/status/1661201260111093760?s=20): Can't you do something about that leading question? Can't you just ask a counter-question?
> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1661201564227497984?s=20): it's your subjectivity that makes you think it's derivative, anyone can submit an opinion if they have a gripe!
> [shinji_kono](https://twitter.com/shinji_kono/status/1661202482293538817) Don't you think it's your own flaw that you can't have that feeling yourself?  You know about [[Arrow's theorem]], don't you?
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1661203359024529412) I'm a little confused. You said, "Don't you think it's your own flaw that you can't feel that way about yourself?" Please elaborate a bit more on the part of
> [shinji_kono](https://twitter.com/shinji_kono/status/1661204058596868098) That sounds like Eliza. It is good to think and see about the definability of the concept of objective questions and the accuracy of information obtained from subjective questions only.
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1661204789710196736) I think the word "objective" first appeared here, where did it come from?
> [@shinji_kono](https://twitter.com/shinji_kono/status/1661205207722921984?s=20): of course, that means the question is not objective
> The opposite of inductive.
> Says it's funny that you don't care about those things.
> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1661206402252308480?s=20): I see that you think "objective" ↔ "subjective = inductive" and that asking subjective questions is not a good idea because it is inductive! [[@nishio]].
>  then you are wrong in your thinking. Because everyone is equally able to ask questions and is given an equal opportunity to do so.

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1661227832943722496?s=20): I stopped getting replies, so I thought you were bored with the conversation, but then I realized you were air-ripping me.

> [@shinji_kono](https://twitter.com/shinji_kono/status/1661202764599545856?s=20): you can't be self-contradictory and aim for policy decisions by the majority without knowing the inverse of the Arrow's principle. Triumph of ignorance, huh?
> [@shinji_kono](https://twitter.com/shinji_kono/status/1661203379652300801?s=20): it's a common style to make your point with a question, but something like this
> Hey, hey, hey, everybody thinks so, don't they?
>  at,
> He who has a minority opinion is the enemy.
> I'm not sure what to think.
> I'm not always in the minority, but I'm more often in the minority. Some of it is intentional.
> [@shinji_kono](https://twitter.com/shinji_kono/status/1661210816203620353?s=20): I wrote what I wanted to say in my TWEET, so I don't need people to evaluate it by majority vote. I understand there are people who need to do that.
> [@shinji_kono](https://twitter.com/shinji_kono/status/1661212161195266049?s=20): what do you think of Arrow's inverse logic and polis? To the extent that it's okay because everyone can ask the question equally? I mean the relationship between Arrow's inverse and the procedure of how the result of that question is reflected in society.
> [@shinji_kono](https://twitter.com/shinji_kono/status/1661213857543770113?s=20): of course I wouldn't hesitate to ask the question myself.
> Ah, well, but I guess I don't do questions in POLIS or anything like that because it just confirms that I am in the minority. It is easy to ask majority questions, but even if you do such trivial things.
> [@shinji_kono](https://twitter.com/shinji_kono/status/1661215264623722498?s=20): An example of Arrow's inverse principle in actual politics is the tying bill.
> Senators' votes are often decided on that ground, so they can cuddle and pass bills that the party's leadership wants.
> [@shinji_kono](https://twitter.com/shinji_kono/status/1661215729331601408?s=20): essentially the same as combining multiple question items. Too bad it's so obvious.
> [@shinji_kono](https://twitter.com/shinji_kono/status/1661217575639085056?s=20): the manipulation of the majority vote is an attraction. Maybe until elementary school. There are failures. Success is vain.
> I also think we should try different things and copy what works.

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1661228921067835392?s=20): @shinji_kono I also added the air rip [[leading question]].
> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1661230004087439360?s=20): @shinji_kono "not knowing the inverse logic of the Arrow" is factually incorrect.
> "We don't need a majority vote to evaluate you" You are free to think so. Only those who think it is necessary will do it.
> "The relationship between how it reflects on society and Arrow's inverse principle" Polis is not a tool for social decision making with [[majority rule]].


> [shinji_kono](https://twitter.com/shinji_kono/status/1661212161195266049) What do you think of the relationship between the Arrow's inverse logic and POLIS? To the extent that it is safe because everyone can ask the question equally? I mean the relationship between the procedure of how the result of the question is reflected in society and Arrow's inverse theorem.
> [kuboon](https://twitter.com/kuboon/status/1661232704921423874) polis is not a voting tool, but a tool to know where your ideas stand in the world!
>  When I ask my own questions, it is more fun to ask questions that I can't anticipate the tendency of the answers I get!
> [shinji_kono](https://twitter.com/shinji_kono/status/1661240234074595328) claiming it's not a vote by that name.
>  I see.
>  You can use it however you want.
>  The people who answer are also biased, to the extent that
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1661241994772099073) "Not a voting tool" is an overstatement and "a tool that allows people to vote, but we are not trying to make a social choice based on a majority vote of the results of this vote" is appropriate. I think. So I went through with the "Arrow's inverse logic is -" argument because I felt it was off the mark, but I guess I misinterpreted it as "I don't know", I didn't word it well enough.
> [shinji_kono](https://twitter.com/shinji_kono/status/1661243913590681602) Isn't that what you are doing because you want to change society? Of course, I am looking at it warmly. I used to do it myself.
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1661250561893859328) By "that" do you mean "individual topics"? Or do you mean "activities to increase opportunities to experience Polis"? The latter is done to improve society, the former is not. It's just one of many "topics that people might be interested in" [/japol](https://scrapbox.io/japol).
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1661251686139305984) Also, my main goal is to become more familiar with the system and its operational issues by operating those topics. So, exchanges like this one are very interesting for me to record and discuss as cases that occurred as a result of Polis.
