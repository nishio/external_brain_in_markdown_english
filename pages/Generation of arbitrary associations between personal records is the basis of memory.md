> In a 1992 paper, Michael Buckland suggested that [[memex]] was flawed because Bush did not understand informatics well and had uncommon ideas about cataloging and taxonomy, and that "Bush believed that the generation of arbitrary [[associations]] between individual records was fundamental to memory and wanted [[memex instead of index]]. The result is personalized, superficial, and essentially self-destructive design," he wrote.

- The claims of [[Vannevar Bush.]] are critically mentioned, but my experience with [[Scrapbox]] is,
- between the objective information of records.
- Making personal and subjective associations (= [[associative connection]])
is an important element of memory, I feel, so I guess I agree with Bush.
