<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The word "parochial" is an adjective used primarily in English. The word has several meanings, but the two most common are
- Relating to a local church: In this sense, "parochial" refers to something directly related to a particular local church (parish) or its activities. For example, "parochial church" refers to a local church and "parochial activities" refers to the activities of that church.
- Narrow-minded or localized thinking: In a broader sense, "parochial" is used to describe people and their attitudes that exhibit narrow-mindedness and limited thinking to their own small community or region. This usage implies that people are closed to or uninterested in the wider world and different points of view.
The word is used in either of these meanings, depending on the particular context and topic. In church and religious contexts, the first meaning is often used, while in political, educational, and social discussions, the second meaning is usually used to critically point out narrow or regionally limited views.
