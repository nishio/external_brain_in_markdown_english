title: "Information Management and Motivation"
---

(I came out speaking in Advanced Voice).
[[information management]] and [[willingness (e.g., to do something)]].
As a general statement, I think that when information is lost or missing from human memory, there is a tendency to become inactive because there is no tension at the point of rediscovering it.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

One option, considering the operation at this moment, might be to create a summary of information in a private repository on GitHub and leave the management of it to AI.

Regarding the AI task management system, the current situation is that the public repository contains the source code, the private repository contains the data, and the private data is checked out and used in the public repository, but the reverse is not the case. I think it's the other way around. It would be more correct to install tools from public repositories into private repositories and use the tools from public repositories.
