title: "Do I need to explain the goodness?"
---

- Is it necessary to say "this tool is good" about a certain tool?
- Of course, this is a difficult problem when you make your living by making a living from that tool, but let's shelve that.
- Wouldn't it be sufficient to explain that "this tool does what it does?"
    - Whether it is good or bad, whether they use it or not, is for them to decide.
    - The best tool depends on what they are trying to do.
    - The work of helping them choose the right one for their situation is highly intellectual production and should be charged a consulting fee.
- For example, with regard to programming languages, "this programming language is good" is a religion, isn't it?
- The fact that a tool is good should not be explained in words, but rather told by the good results achieved by using the tool.
- Because it is possible to say "this tool is good" even if the tool is bad, so there is no information content in that utterance.
