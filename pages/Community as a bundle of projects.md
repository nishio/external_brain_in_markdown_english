    - [[Community]] and [[Project]].
        - [[society]] and [[gemeinschaft]]?
- [[clear leadership]].
    - project-like
- [[N vs. N communication channel]].
    - It was a natural part of the physical world.
    - In digital communication, the cost of transmission is the same whether it is one-to-one or N-to-N communication.
    - Do a lot of one-on-one calls and you become the hub of communication.

- This fragment examines the nature of community and the changing nature of communication in the digital age.
    - First, Gemeinschaft (communal society) and Gesellschaft (interest society) refer to social structures based on individual relationships, the former being emotional ties and the latter being a society bound by interests.
    - This fragment requires [[leadership]] in a project-like effort,
    - stating that N-to-N, many-to-many communication is important.
        - I didn't say that.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - This may point to the fact that in the digital age, both one-to-one and N-to-N communication cost the same, making it easier to create [[diverse connections]].
    - Also, the point that by actively engaging in one-on-one communication, the individual becomes the "hub" of communication is an insight based on network theory.

- More of a project than a community in communication style with a clear hub
- It is interesting that this "[[Community as a bundle of projects]]" was chosen as the conclusion of someone who has experienced [[community management]] many times

- The idea of "community as a bundle of projects" differs from the traditional image of "community," emphasizing its nature as a goal-oriented gathering.
    - What is being pointed out here is the perspective that a community is not just one common purpose or emotional tie, but a collection of multiple projects and initiatives.
- The fact that those who have had multiple experiences in community management ultimately choose "bundles of projects" reflects the need for diversity and a wide variety of objectives in our time.
    - This suggests that a communication style in which a clear hub exists functions as an efficient means to produce [[tangible results]], rather than just [[social connections]].
    - In the digital age, project-based management may often be the optimal solution, especially since many-to-many networks can be easily formed.

- Repeated collaborative projects to create small, time-limited, short-lived communities that disappear and then operate them in a fun way.

- The idea of "[[creating]] small, time-limited, short-lived communities that disappear" is a new form of community that differs from traditional [[sustainable communities]].
    - These short-lived communities are characterized by limited duration, clear objectives, and spontaneous extinction after termination.
    - This allows participants to focus on activities in a short period of time and to carry out specific projects quickly.
- It is also interesting to note that the "[[enjoyment of the]] operation" element of these communities goes beyond the project-like nature of achieving an objective and finds value in the process itself.
    - In other words, since the community is supposed to be short-lived, the emphasis is on making the most of each moment and sharing an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.
    - This [[iterative project]] will generate new ideas and connections with people, allowing for flexible and fluid community formation.
