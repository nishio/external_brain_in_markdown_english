2024-09-17 Notes
- [[Community]] and [[Project]]
    - [[Gesellschaft]] and [[Gemeinschaft]]?
- [[Presence of a Clear Leader]]
    - Project-like
- [[N-to-N Communication Channels]]
    - Naturally existed in the physical world
    - In digital communication, the cost of 1-to-1 and N-to-N communication is the same
    - Engaging in many 1-to-1 calls can make you a communication hub

- This fragment examines the essence of community and changes in communication in the digital age.
    - First, Gemeinschaft (community) and Gesellschaft (society) refer to social structures based on personal relationships, with the former being emotionally connected and the latter bound by interests.
    - The fragment states that leadership is necessary in project-like endeavors,
    - and that N-to-N, many-to-many communication is important.
        - That's not what it says <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - It suggests that in the digital age, since the cost of 1-to-1 and N-to-N communication is the same, [[diverse connections]] are easier to create.
    - Additionally, the insight that actively engaging in 1-to-1 communication can make an individual a communication "hub" is based on network theory.

- In a communication style with a clear hub, it is more project-like than a community
- It is interesting that those who have repeatedly experienced [[community management]] choose this "[[Community as a Bundle of Projects]]"

- The idea of "Community as a Bundle of Projects" emphasizes a goal-oriented gathering, differing from traditional "community" images.
    - It points out that a community is not just a single common purpose or emotional bond, but a collection of multiple projects and initiatives.
- It reflects modern diversity and the varied needs of purposes that those experienced in community management ultimately choose "a bundle of projects."
    - In other words, a communication style with a clear hub functions as an efficient means to produce [[concrete outcomes]], rather than just [[social connections]].
    - Especially in the digital age, where many-to-many networks can be easily formed, project-based management might often be the optimal solution.

- Repeatedly creating [[short-lived communities]] that are small and time-limited, and enjoyably managing them as joint projects

- The idea of "creating [[short-lived communities that are small and time-limited]]" is a new form distinct from traditional [[sustainable communities]].
    - Such short-lived communities have a clear purpose for a limited period and naturally dissolve after completion.
    - This allows participants to focus intensely on activities for a short time and quickly execute specific projects.
- Moreover, the element of "enjoying the [[management]]" of such communities finds value in the process itself, beyond the project-oriented nature of achieving goals.
    - That is, because the community is assumed to be short-lived, maximizing each moment and sharing enjoyable and fulfilling experiences is emphasized.
    - This [[repetitive project]] approach can generate new ideas and connections with people, enabling flexible and fluid community formation.
