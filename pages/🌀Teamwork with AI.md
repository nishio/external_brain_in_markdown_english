The End of the "Public Scrapbox Period"? states that we need to think deeply about the balance between public and private, and the impact of AI. In "Intelligent Collaboration between AI and Humans," it is stated that collaborative work between AI and humans has the potential to improve intellectual productivity.

Nishio's "Collaboration with AI" presents the idea that diverse perspectives are offered to improve knowledge productivity. In "Knowledge, Capitalism, and the Technologist Condition," it is stated that discovering and communicating new knowledge is a means of value creation, and that knowledge can be transformed and communicated to others, creating customer value.

In Diary 2023-09-01, users have the opportunity to express their thoughts more clearly as the AI understands their input and asks questions about areas that are difficult to understand. The AI also provides suggestions for improvement, allowing the user to broaden his or her perspective.

What is the role of AI in this project?" presents the idea that AI's increased productivity creates an incentive for humans to use AI, and that the greater the increase in productivity, the more compensation will be collected for AI.

### new idea

The discussion of "[[food for the intellect]]" is relevant to the personalization of information. The outlay for cultivating intellect depends on individual interests and values. This is consistent with the importance of matching project involvement to one's own interests and circumstances. The consideration of "[[family resemblance]]" is also important from the perspective of teamwork and role sharing. The idea that members who do not share common characteristics can form a group by sharing partial common characteristics can be applied to the formation of project teams.

'Thinking deeply about the nourishment of intelligence and how it affects individual interests and values?' And how can the idea of family resemblance be applied to the formation of project teams?" The question arose.

### Relation to Fragment
.

The "AI does not take jobs" fragment relates to the optimal form of AI-human collaboration: the perspective that AI does not take human jobs, but that humans with high technological affinity take jobs from humans with low affinity, is an important perspective for rethinking the AI-human relationship.

The "what new technologies can do" fragment is related to the limitations of AI personalization; the perspective that AI can do what humans could not is an important perspective for understanding AI's potential and limitations.

The "Keichobot on ChatGPT" fragment is relevant to AI decision-making: the perspective that AI deviates from the rules by answering "I don't know."

The fragment "[[To be used by AI]]" is related to ways to improve AI-human communication. The perspective of "[[To be used well by AI]]" is an important perspective for considering how to improve communication between AI and humans.

### Deep thoughts and questions

When considering the optimal form of AI-human collaboration, it is important to take the perspective that AI not only replaces human activities but also complements human judgment. To this end, however, it is important to ask how AI synthesizes human information and whether AI should be the entity that performs this synthesis. What research is needed to find answers to these questions?

In addition, when considering the limitations of AI personalization, it is important to take the perspective that AI can be used as a means of communicating the values of minority groups. However, to this end, the question of how AI can understand and communicate the values of minority groups is important. What research is needed to find answers to these questions?

Furthermore, when considering AI decision making, the perspective of abstracting a concrete situation and then concretizing it is important. However, to this end, the question of how AI can abstract and then concretize concrete situations is important. What research is needed to find answers to these questions?

Finally, when considering ways to improve AI-human communication, it is important to take the perspective that while it is possible for AI to have human-like intelligence, its answers will differ from human representations. However, to this end, it is important to ask the question: to what extent does AI match human representations? What research is needed to find answers to these questions?

Teamwork with AI explores a future in which AI is an active team member, suggesting that intelligent collaboration between AI and humans could be a new form of teamwork. We also believe that AI will be able to create tools that are more responsive to individual needs and preferences by personalizing them according to the user's interests and tastes. However, the boundaries in doing so will require further discussion.

Regarding the development of a "Japanese cultural AI," our goal is to create an AI that reflects the culture and thinking of the Japanese people, based on the belief that decisions about what an AI should be should not be made by a few people, but should be shaped by diverse perspectives that reflect the public interest.

From these studies, it is important to gain a deeper understanding of how teamwork with AI is formed and evolves.

### Fragment Relevance
.

Nishio's story about applying to OpenAI's "Democratic inputs to AI" is closely related to my research. In particular, the idea that decisions about "what AI should be" should not be made by a few people, but should be shaped by diverse perspectives that reflect the public interest, is consistent with my ideas about the development of a "Japanese cultural AI.

Fragments such as "Collaboration with AI" and "GPT4 and the Nodal Point of Talking Thought" are also relevant to my research because they include a discussion of AI-human collaboration and communication.

From these fragments, we felt that we need to think more deeply about how AI and humans collaborate and communicate, and how AI makes decisions.

### Question

Teamwork with AI explores the future of AI as a team member. The question, "How will AI change work?" suggests that intelligent collaboration between AI and humans could be a new form of teamwork. Research is also being conducted to realize teamwork with AI through specific initiatives such as the Project Team on the Evolution and Implementation of AI and the Omoikane Project.

On the other hand, to the question, "How far should we go with personalization of AI assistants?" we believe that AI can be personalized according to the user's interests and tastes, making it possible to create tools that are more responsive to individual needs and preferences. However, the boundaries in doing so will require further discussion.

Regarding the development of a "Japanese cultural AI," our goal is to create an AI that reflects the culture and thinking of the Japanese people, based on the belief that decisions about what an AI should be should not be made by a few people, but should be shaped by diverse perspectives that reflect the public interest.

From these studies, it is important to gain a deeper understanding of how teamwork with AI is formed and evolves.

It's interesting in general, so keep going.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

The use of AI drives productivity gains, which in turn increases the price paid for AI; AI-human collaboration has the potential to increase intellectual productivity and provides a variety of perspectives for this purpose. Discovery and transfer of new knowledge is a means of value creation; knowledge is passed on to others, creating customer value; forming teams with AI is possible through common characteristics and can be applied to the formation of project teams. Considerations about the food for intelligence are relevant to information personalization.

### Relevance
.

The notebooks and the 🌀Value of Natural Resources fragment share a reflection on the improvement of knowledge productivity through AI and human collaboration. In addition, the perspective of AI using humans as stationery indicates the potential for a new relationship between AI and humans.

### deep thinking

AI-human collaborations provide new perspectives to improve knowledge productivity and create value through the discovery and transfer of new knowledge. However, this requires a detailed description of how AI and humans collaborate and how this improves knowledge productivity.
