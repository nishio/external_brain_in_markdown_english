title: "People who claim that brainstorming is meaningless."
---

>  People who argue that [[brainstorming]] is meaningless often cite as an example the 1991 paper by Brian Mullen, Craig Johnson &Eduardo Salas [[Productivity Loss in Brainstorming Groups: A Productivity Loss in Brainstorming Groups: A Meta-Analytic Integration]] by Brian Mullen, Craig Johnson &Eduardo Salas published in 1991. Anyone can read the paper for free by searching for the PDF file.
>  However, in [[A Review of Brainstorming Research: Six Critical Issues for Inquiry]] by Scott G. Isaksen, published in 1998, he says, "No, no, wait a minute. No, no, no, no, no, wait a minute. It's not fair because the brainstorming method used in the study is wrong to begin with. It's not fair.
>  These research results have made a significant contribution in terms of sorting out the causes of team brainstorming that are reducing productivity. I am sure that many companies are aware of the issues identified in these studies, and are covering them to some extent, so I think it is somewhat wild to say that "brainstorming = waste. I think it is a little bit wild to say that brainstorming is a waste of time.
