- We need [[empirical science]] before [[outdoor science]]."
        - Before the phase of "experimental science" in which [[trial and error]] is repeated, a phase is necessary to generate the first "[[hypothesis]]". Jiro Kawakita called this phase "field science. The field science phase consists of "[[exploration]]", "[[observation]]", and "[[idea]]".

    - The [[level of thinking]] and [[experience level]] correspond to the [[bottom]] and [[top]] of my [[pyramid model]].
        - [[What is the bottom in the pyramid metaphor?]]

[I gave a lecture titled "W-type Problem Solving Model of KJ Method and U-Theory, and their respective problem consciousness". - NISHIO Hirokazu's Hatena Diary](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20150519/1432006437)
> The other day, I gave a lecture on what [[U-theory]] is at the Software Engineering Technical Committee of the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA).
> In explaining the [[U-shaped model]] of U Theory, this slide explains "what other [[models]] exist in the first place" and "what is similar and what is different", so you can understand how the [[PDCA cycle]], [[Lean startup]], [[KJ method]], etc. and U Theory are similar and how they are different. I think you will be able to understand how U-theory is similar to and different from [[PDCA cycle]], [[Lean startup]], [[KJ method]], etc. from various aspects.
