> According to author Vieriu, Art42 is a fork of StyleGAN2 and is based on code created by Peter Baylies, who manually selected 1000 paintings from WikiArt to create a dataset and trained a machine learning algorithm. The app itself runs on Cloudflare Workers. The code for Art42 is available on GitHub, and the technical details are summarized here.
