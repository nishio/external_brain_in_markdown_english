[[2023 SNS Considerations]]
- [[Nodal Point of Thought 2023-07-29]]
- If you want to get a megaphone to reach a lot of people, you should stop using Japanese.
- I have enough places to write daily "ramblings that don't need to be recorded" in Japanese.
    - No need to use a new social network for that purpose.
- Scrapbox is currently the best tool for the stock of thoughts that we accumulate and combine, and we have yet to find a better tool than that.

Conclusion, positioning [[Bluesky]] as "a tool to post in English and reach a lot of people.
Japanese Scrapbox -> English Scrapbox -> Bluesky
