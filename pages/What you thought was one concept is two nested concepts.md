- We were talking about a concept, calling it A.
- But it doesn't come across well.
- After digging into why, I discovered that there are two concepts called A
    - Hereinafter referred to as A1 and A2.
- These two are in [[implication]] in [[event space]].
    - in other words
        - A1 then A2
        - A2 but not necessarily A1
- If you do not pay attention to this "A2 but not A1" event, or if it is very rare, A1 and A2 appear to be the same thing
    - As a result, one word, A, calls them both
    - This is a state where the boundary of the concept of A is blurred as shown in the lower left figure.
    - Humans can manipulate symbols without realizing that the boundaries are blurred concepts.
        - Often overlooked unless one is trained to clarify boundaries.

    - [[The usefulness of defining the boundaries of a concept]]
    - This is about whether it is useful to clarify [[Conceptual Boundaries]] or not, depending on the situation.
    - [[Boundary blurring]]
    - This is a lot about organization.
    - In [[Relation Question]], you're asking about the relationship between two concepts, but there are cases where two concepts are [[classified with]] in the first place.

        - [[One-dimensional version of cognitive resolution]]
        - In [[Resolution Stage]], you had the lowest resolution state as [[dichotomy]], but there's even more "identical."

    - [[A set that was assumed to be equal]]
