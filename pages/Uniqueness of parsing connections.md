title: "Uniqueness of parsing connections"
---

Given a function f and a function g whose domain is extended, this cannot be immediately [[class with]].
If the method of extension is not unique, f = g1 and f = g2 but g1 ! = g2.
It is only after showing [[uniqueness]] that one can equate a function f with a function g that is an [[Analysis Connection]] to it.
