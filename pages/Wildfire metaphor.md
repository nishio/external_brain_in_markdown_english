[[metaphor for change]].

Changes that are ready by continued dry conditions and [[triggered]] by [[random]] lightning strikes # Random triggers
- It is the same with [[avalanche]] that changes started with [[small triggers]] become catastrophic when they are magnified and reproduced.
- If you are close enough, you know which direction they are coming from.
    - Not sure if it's far away.
        - The forest [[is]] not a good prospect.
    - [[Surrounded before you know it]], there's nothing you can do about it.
    - differs from [[tsunami]] in that the direction of escape is not self-evident.
- There are fire conditions and burnt-out conditions.
    - The [[fire scene]] is deadly for most players.
    - [[Burned-out areas]] are a disadvantage for one player, but an advantage for another.
