There's nothing wrong with including images created by others in proposal materials, as long as the source is clearly stated.
- A: Include images created by others without stating the source.
    - Not this one.
    - Image search will reveal.
    - I don't think it's an immediate rejection by itself, but I feel that you are a person who is unclear about the distinction between what you have made and what others have made.
- B: "You can only put in what you make yourself."
    - This is not correct.
    - Some schools are so afraid of A that they knock it to the safe side and teach B.
- And then there's the similar question, "Is it okay to use the library?"
    - You can use it. Because Unexplored Junior is not a "contest to build from scratch".
