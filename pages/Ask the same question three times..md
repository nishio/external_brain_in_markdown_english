title: "Ask the same question three times."

Since there are so many very empty replies. So you don't have to say poorly, "Excuse me, but I'd like to check again..." or something like that. They will realize that you are being rude. They don't realize that you are asking the same question over and over again.

May I talk to you now? I think it is because the resident doctors start with "May I talk to you now? By being explicit, they realize that it is rude. They see almost only non-verbal attitudes. For example, if you scold them with a smile, they do not even notice that they are being scolded in the first place.

They don't have the ability to answer "I don't know," so if they can't even answer the question three times, or if they respond with a "hmmm" or if they fool you with an out-of-place laugh, translate it to mean "I don't know," and the conversation will work. If you're not used to seeing it, it looks like a blank laugh.
