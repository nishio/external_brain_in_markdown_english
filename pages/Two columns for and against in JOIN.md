Regarding the "for/against" two-column display at [[join.gov.tw]]([[JOIN]])

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>The following is a summary of what Audrey Tang actually said at the July 23, 2024 meetup, with specific reference to the "support/oppose" column juxtaposition mechanism at join.gov.tw (unnecessary parts are omitted or simplified, but the (Unnecessary parts have been omitted or simplified, but the statements have been translated as faithfully as possible).

>  In Taiwan, 10 years ago, trust in the government was very low at 9% and people automatically distrusted anything you said. So when we invested in participation infrastructure (vTaiwan, join.gov.tw, etc.) between 2014 and 2018, people started to create places to show a better way of doing things instead of just complaining.
>  For example, Taiwan's petition platform join.gov.tw. When 5,000 signatures are collected online, the minister considers and responds, and in some cases goes to see them in person. Here, we're following the design of Iceland ([[Better Reykjavik]]), where "arguments in favor" and "arguments against" are arranged in separate columns.
>  In fact, there was a petition asking if Taiwan's time zone should be adjusted to Japan (GMT+9), and 8,000 people signed on the side that "it should be GMT+9" and 8,000 on the side that "it should remain GMT+8 as it is now". In all, 16,000 people said, "Do this!" and there is usually a lot of noise, but we just put both columns side by side and voted "for" or "against" the opinions posted there.
>  Importantly, there is no "attack the other side by replying to comments" feature. If you don't like someone else's opinion, you can post a "better argument" in your column (the opposing column), and if it is supported, it will move up the list. As a result, it is not a matter of who wins or loses, but simply by comparing the "top opinions in the agree column" and "top opinions in the disagree column," it is easy to see at a glance what the issues are and what both sides are really aiming for.
>  After that, I invited representatives of both factions to the same room and asked them about it, and found that the motivation of the "want to change the time zone" faction was simply "to make Taiwan more unique," and the main reason for their opposition was that "it costs a lot of money. So, we settled on the conclusion that if we were going to spend the same budget, the idea of "promoting Taiwan's attractions overseas" would be more cost-effective, and that it would be better to strengthen the transmission of tapioca tea and invite international events to Taiwan.
>  In the end, the "real goal" of both factions was the same. It turned out that we could make Taiwan unique more cheaply and effectively than by changing the time to GMT+9, and we all agreed there. In other words, because of the initial conflict, we were able to find a new way. This is an example of participatory infrastructure.

point
- Separate and parallel "for" and "against" columns, with no direct wrestling allowed (post "better arguments" in your own camp's column to gain support).
- Ultimately, by comparing the "claims on top of each other," it is possible to visualize what both sides are looking for.
- It is easier to realize that even though it appears to be a major conflict, "we really have the same goal (to make Taiwan more attractive).

The above is the actual statement regarding the "support/oppose" parallel display on the Taiwanese version of the petition site that Audrey introduced during the meetup.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>Taiwan's petition site (join.gov.tw) is characterized by the fact that when opinions are expressed on a certain topic from both sides, "for" and "against," each side is displayed in a single row. Instead of a "wrestling battle" (a series of direct rebuttals to an opinion) as is common on Japanese SNS and bulletin boards, only the best arguments and evidence from both camps are displayed, with the votes coming from the top.

How does it work?
- Opinions are divided into "for" and "against" columns.
    - For example, "Should Taiwan's time zone be changed to GMT+9, the same as Japan's?" If the theme is "Should Taiwan's time zone be changed to GMT+9, the same as Japan's?
        - The "Consenting Opinion" Column
        - The "Opposing Opinions" Column
    - Post your opinion to the
- There is no function to respond directly to each other's columns.
    - Even if you want to refute Mr. A's "agree" opinion, you cannot reply to the "agree column" and must write a new "more persuasive argument" in the "disagree column" to gain his support.
    - This moves the discussion in the direction of "improving one's side of the argument" rather than "destroying either side's opinion.
- Users move up (vote) for "good opinions"
    - The individual arguments in both columns are evaluated by a certain voting system (like "like" or "agree").
    - Claims that gain a lot of support will naturally appear higher, while those that do not will sink to the bottom.
- Finally, the top opinions in the "For" column and the top opinions in the "Against" column will tell you at a glance what the core of each side is.
    - The government/administration side can quickly grasp the fact that "both sides have good reasons for their positions.
    - Furthermore, it will be easier to see the widely divergent issues and the common goals of both parties (e.g., "to make Taiwan unique" and "to improve society").

Why is it effective?
- Less likely to get into a "confrontation" of mutual abuse
    - Since there is no structure to "directly comment on or refute the other party's opinion," it is easier to move in the direction of "constructively enhancing one's own argument" rather than arguing with the other party.
- Easy to find common points of contention
    - If we focus on the opinions that rise to the top of both columns ("good opinions"), it is easy to see the common goals and values underlying the conflict.
- Smooth "next placemaking" for consensus building
    - The government side can easily organize the main points that have been raised, invite representatives from both sides to brainstorm (small group dialogue), and explore how to make policies in a way that respects the values of both sides.

How to apply in the Japanese version of JOIN?
- The key point of this design is to provide "two columns (or multiple columns) for each position" rather than the "threaded" social networking style.
- Separate opinion submission forms for either approval or disapproval, and make the interface "enhance our own opinions" rather than "criticize others".
- Provide a mechanism to rate opinions (vote/liked/agreed) so that it is easy to see which opinions came out on top.
- Linked to offline dialogue (workshops and brainstorming), a mechanism for final consensus-building (a place to gather opinions, meetings with responsible persons from the ministries in charge, etc.) should be developed.

Possible practical benefits
- Both proposals and opposition deepen
    - The two opposing camps will compete to "refine their arguments to make them more persuasive" instead of "criticizing the other".
- Realize that we potentially have the same goal.
    - In the Taiwan example, a common goal of "making Taiwan more unique and attractive" was found at the root of the "want to change time zones vs. don't want to change time zones" conflict, and a solution other than zone change (e.g., cultural appeal) was agreed upon.
- Easy for the policy side (government and local government) to respond
    - By simply picking up the "good arguments" in the pro and con columns, the issues can be quickly sorted out, greatly reducing the time-consuming "fire-fighting" and "under-the-table" work.

Such a system of parallel "support/oppose" division to avoid wrestling with each other is said to be very effective in facilitating consensus building. If you operate a similar online petition and participation platform in Japan, it would be worthwhile to incorporate such a design.
