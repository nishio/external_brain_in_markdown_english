> [nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1656031345448198144) I come up with three insights. First, people use the same word in the different meanings. Second, some people think some comments are irrelevant to the topic, but it is correlated to the opinion groups. Third, when we got too many comments, many people frowned.
- [[people use the same word in the different meanings]]
    - [[Polis Experience Report:Do you want to investigate the causes of terrorism#64493228aff09e000075718d]]
- [[some people think some comments are irrelevant to the topic, but it is correlated to the opinion groups]]
    - [[Polis Experience Report:Should same-sex marriage be legalized#644b6d99aff09e00006a4a55]]
- [[when we got too many comments, many people frowned]]
        - [[Problem of too many Polis questions]]

> [nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1656031861309849600) GPT4: The issue of too many comments causing frustration is also a significant one. ... I'm curious how you plan to manage this issue.

> [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1656034436650237952): For the issue of too many comments, I have a plan to use [[market mechanism]]s. With N voters, a single post costs N vote efforts. So I’m introduce a credit and require N credits for posting an issue. People can earn the credits by voting. Because [[voting is a kind of work for common goods]].
