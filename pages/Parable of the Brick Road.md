title: "Parable of the Brick Road"
---

Work to create a brick road
- With heavy bricks.
- To the point where the brick road breaks off.
- Walking on a brick road
- Repeat placing the brick exactly there.

Whether you think it's fun or not depends pretty much on your personality.
- I'm not having fun.
- I go where I want to go.
- If there's a brick road in the route, I'll use it, and if there isn't, I don't care.
    - If the goal is to extend a brick path, it will not be possible to connect it if it leaves the existing brick path
