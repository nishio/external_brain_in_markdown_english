title: "Provide explicit feedback on missing keywords."
---

- When none of the keywords
    - Now we don't use the keyword "then what happens?" which does not use keywords.
    - However, users who fall into this situation have entered keywords that were not included in the first place, so they answer new questions in the same way and do not improve.
    - Feedback should be given that a response without explicit keywords is not good enough.
- Should feedback be given even when there are few keywords?
    - I did.
    - Immediate feedback when the number of keywords per log count falls below 0.5
        - Since it means less than 1 keyword per utterance.
    - When it's below 1, it's appropriate to combine it with the keywords that are extracted.
        - Specifically, the pace at which feedback is given at the 6th time when there is one keyword per utterance.
