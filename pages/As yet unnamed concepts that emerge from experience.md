- At this point, one can look at the more abstract concept Y and feel that "concept X leads to concept Y"
- A sense of "my experience of that or this leads to Y through X, which has not yet been verbalized."

- Mr. A is convinced that they connect, but Mr. B doesn't feel the same way because he hasn't had the same experience
    - B looks at Y and feels that it is a high level of abstraction and unfamiliar
- Mr. A cannot communicate X to Mr. B. This is because it has not yet been verbalized.
- Mr. A can tell Mr. B about experience E, but it does not connect to Y in Mr. B's mind.
    - An abstraction from a sufficient amount of experience must be created in Mr. B.
        - [[You have to create it yourself.]]
    - However, [[verbal communication of experience tends to lack information]].
