In Yuji Yonemori's book, "Abduction: Hypothesis and the Logic of Discovery," it is argued that "[[Extended]]" is an important criterion for evaluating [[abduction]] ([[hypothesis formation]]). Specifically, abduction is positioned as "[[extended reasoning]]" that generates new knowledge and hypotheses, and is contrasted with "[[analytic reasoning]]" that reconstructs existing knowledge. This extensibility is said to enable [[scientific discovery]] and [[creative thinking]].

Yonemori states that abduction is the process of generating new hypotheses, the thinking or reasoning that forms an "[[explanatory hypothesis]]" that provides an explanation for observed [[Surprising Facts]] or [[anomalies]]. This process is said to play an important role in scientific inquiry and contributes to [[knowledge extension]].

Thus, being "expansive" in abduction is an important criterion in assessing the ability to generate new hypotheses and knowledge.

The purpose of emphasizing "whether or not it is expansive" as the axis of evaluation of abduction discussed in [[Yonemori (2009:9)]] is thought to focus on the fact that abduction does not merely rearrange existing knowledge but also works to expand thinking by presenting a new interpretive framework or hypothesis. Unlike deduction and induction, abduction is prone to leaps in the process of "formulating an explanatory hypothesis," and the key to evaluation is the degree to which such leaps open up new understandings and possibilities.

Specifically, the more "extended abductions" provide new theoretical perspectives and suggestions applicable to multiple contexts, and generate reinterpretations that transcend the boundaries of existing knowledge. As a result, it can lead not only to problem solving but also to spillover effects into peripheral areas and subsequent explorations. On the other hand, abduction, which lacks extensibility, has limited scientific and academic impact due to its lack of novelty and developmental potential, even if the hypothesis itself is established. Therefore, Yonemori seems to be measuring what kind of hypothesis can bring richer intellectual results by focusing on the "degree of extensibility" when evaluating abductions.
