Tends to make the question the title.
- If the question is the root of a bullet point and the discussion is developed below it, the root is the title because it is at the top
    - If you've come to a conclusion, should you put the conclusion in the title?
    - In the future, we may come to different conclusions about the same question.
        - Make the question part a link?
- concrete example
    - before "Why study old people?"
    - after "Technology that doesn't make you old is beneficial to your intellectual productivity in life as a whole."
relevance
        - [[The door is not the room itself.]]
