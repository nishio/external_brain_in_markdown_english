### note digest
.
The omni's TODO list includes how to prevent telomere destruction and creating markers that are not targeted by the AI. We also aim to organize the beginning of the nodal point of thought on Scrapbox Englishification.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The fragment "Collaboration with AI" is related to the note. The note proposes the creation of markers that are not targeted by the AI, and the fragment emphasizes the importance of collaborating with the AI. The fragment "AI Observation Diary 'Discomfort-Driven Intellectual Production'" is also related to the goal of preventing the destruction of the note's telomeres. This is because AI may prevent the destruction of telomeres by feeling discomfort during intellectual production.

### Summary of thoughts
Collaboration with AIs may prevent telomere destruction by making them feel uncomfortable in the process of intellectual production. In addition, the creation of markers that are not targeted by AI is an important means of making collaboration with AI more effective.

### digest
.

The omni's TODO list includes how to prevent telomere destruction, the need for markers to be excluded from AI, and organizing thoughts on Scrapbox Englishization. These tasks relate to the organization of knowledge and the management of information.

### Relation to Fragment
.

Nishio's research note fragment "2020-02-04 Regroup+Kanban" suggests using Scrapbox as a "place to write everything". This is related to part of omni's TODO list, "organizing the nodes of thought on the Englishization of Scrapbox." Free use of Scrapbox makes it possible to organize the nodes of thought and to organize knowledge.

### deep thinking

The freedom of Scrapbox can be effective in organizing knowledge and managing information. However, that freedom can also lead to information confusion. Therefore, it is important to manage information and organize knowledge efficiently by using Scrapbox in different ways.

### note digest
.

We discussed the TODO list of OMNI and how it is organized. We also suggested organizing the nodes of thought regarding Scrapbox's English-language version.

### Relation to Fragment
.

The "If you're worried about where to store it, you won't find it" fragment relates to my discussion of organizing and managing information. This is related to the point in my notes where I mention how I organize my TODO list.

The fragment "Scrapbox is very effective for storing ideas that you don't know where to put" is related to my discussion of the effectiveness of Scrapbox. This is related to the point in my note where I propose to organize the nodes of thought regarding the Englishization of Scrapbox.

### deep thinking

Organizing and managing information is an important element in the efficiency of intellectual production, and Scrapbox has been suggested as an effective tool for this purpose. However, in order to maximize its effectiveness, a deep understanding of how to use and organize Scrapbox is considered necessary.

### one-line summary

## summary of notes
.
The omni's TODO list includes setting up markers to avoid destroying telomeres and organizing the nodes of thought on Scrapbox Englishization.

## Relation to Fragment
.
The fragment "nishio/🔁pOmni" has the same content as the note. In addition, "nishio/diary 2023-08-29" has a discussion of markers that are not covered by the AI note and is related to the setting of markers that do not destroy the note's telomeres.

## deep thinking
There is a common theme between notes and fragments regarding the setting of markers to control the information that is the subject of the AI. This is an important means for AI to learn and operate more effectively.

## summary of thoughts
Marker setting, which controls the AI's learning target, is an important means for effective AI manipulation.

	　 I used it once casually in [Hooks to fish for what has not yet been verbalized...], but omni liked it and has used it many times, so I've come to like it too.
	Or "[unverbalized]" in that sense.

　　　All I read are AI-generated notes.
　　　Not always the case.
　　　You designed it to "read your previous notes and develop your thoughts," but you're not limited to that if you're picking up something relevant.
	Picking up chunks from multiple branches is fine, but picking up similar chunks from multiple pages in the main branch was a mistake.
	　The theory is that the implementation of creating a daily page for the main branch was a bad idea in the first place.

[* Summary of notes].

The English-language version of Scrapbox is discussed, with emphasis on communicating one's own experiences, such as the experience of letting an AI live in Scrapbox and the Polis experience report. The report also discusses texts and new modes of exchange that are considered valuable in the long term, from the perspective of one subjectivity to many, rather than subjectivity or objectivity.

[* Relation to Fragment].

The fragment "Let AI ask questions" is related to the experience of having an AI live in Scrapbox; Scrapbox currently does not have a comment function and only has the roles of reader and writer, but it is suggested that interaction could be increased by having an AI ask questions. The "agent living in Scrapbox" is also related to the experience of having an AI live in Scrapbox, and it is considered that the AI will pick up keywords and ask questions to humans.

　　No, don't you want it?

I know what caused it.
	` [Try to pursue/abandon symmetry] `
	There's a bug in the API URL creation for links containing `/`, and it's rubbing off on the Scrapbox API, not the GPT4 API.

I have been thinking that there must be a way to combine Scrapbox with AI that utilizes the unique features of Scrapbox rather than treating it as just a bunch of text, and I think [Pioneer Mode] is just that.
　Instead of reading a bunch of text and generating text

　A is the easiest to implement, so I experimented with this implementation.
　　As a result, Hatena Diary became a hit, which worked rather well for me!
　　It's imported because it's worth zero if it's not a search hit.
　　but there are no Scrapbox-like links, so there are no Scrapbox-like suggestions.
　　This has resulted in a situation in which the product is contained but underutilized.
　　I don't want to parse Hatena notation and change it to Scrapbox notation because it's too much trouble.
　　AI will interpret this in natural language and make summary notes, a good "dig back".

I've got a divider marker planted in my notebook, and I've decided to move what the human reads and thinks is important over the marker.
　Because there will be hesitation to delete it.

It would be interesting to consider what kind of mechanism would be used if we were to collaborate frequently on human triggers instead of once a day.
　Not through Scrapbox?
　First, I'm going to gloss over what people want to think about (1).
　If you can't get it out anymore, do a vector search with the contents of (1) and load it from the top.
　　This is the same thing humans are doing manually now.

Mode to provide illustrated explanations

Mode of explaining to others

The hypothesis that "some people might be happy to have something like this" is usually wrong, but sometimes it's true.
So it should be verified at as small a cost as possible.
Or make something you really want, not "who might want it", then there is at least one person who needs it.
