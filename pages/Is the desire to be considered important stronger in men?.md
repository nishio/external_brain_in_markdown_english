[Is the desire to be thought of as important stronger among men?
- [[Gender difference]]

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3/icon' alt='o3.icon' height="19.5"/>Conclusion (main points)
- In the study as a whole, men are reported to be slightly more strongly motivated by the desire to "be an important person = to obtain a high position or power.
- However, the difference is moderate (effect size d ≈ 0.3-0.4), highly individual and cultural, and can disappear or reverse depending on the situation.

- [Social Dominance Orientation (SDO)
    - Tendency to justify hierarchy and seek status
    - Men significantly higher (mean d≈0.37) in meta-analysis of 97 samples worldwide ([ResearchGate [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225667192_Gender_Differences_in_Social_](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225667192_Gender_Differences_in_Social_) Dominance_Orientation_Gender_Invariance_May_Be_Situation_Invariance?utm_source=chatgpt.com])
- Leader/Power orientation
    - 248 Meta-analysis of studies shows higher desire to "[[be]] a leader" in men (d≈0.19)

    - [[self-promotion]] （Self-promotion）
    - NBER Experiment: Men sell themselves higher with 61 self-esteem points and women 46 points for the same score.

- Power vs. status-oriented
    - 3 Integrated results of the experiment: men > women in gaining power, women > men in gaining respect (recognition)

- Power = effective decision-making authority with direct control over others and resources.
- Status as respect and approval = respect and admiration given voluntarily by those around you. It does not involve the right to control and is lost if support leaves.

In the [[Dual-strategies theory]] of evolutionary psychology, people are organized to climb the hierarchy based on (1) [[control]] ([[dominance]]) and (2) [[prestige]] ([[prestige]]).

Hays (2013) Overview of three experiments in "Fear and Loving in the Social Hierarchy"
Study 1
- 201 U.S. adults.
- Asked whether they would prefer "(1) a position that holds authority but little respect" vs. "(2) a position that is highly respected but has no authority" in a fictitious company.
- Males were significantly more likely to choose (1), while females preferred (2).
Study 2
- University sample: 154 students.
- Measure willingness to run for office by presenting a group assignment with either "Being a leader can determine salary distribution = power condition" or "Receiving recognition from peers = respect condition".
- In the power condition, men are more motivated than women. Gender differences disappear or are reversed in respect conditions.
Study 3
- 268 online participants.
    - Observed execution behavior allocating "negotiation rights (power)" and "peer evaluation points (status)" in a negotiation game.
    - Men tend to take more bargaining rights and women more evaluation points.

Clues as to how it works (additional analysis in the same paper)

1. [[dominance orientation]] intermediation
    - Males have a higher "I don't mind being feared" dominant self-concept, which partially explains the power preference.
    - Related:.[[Why do men die alone?]] <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
2. social costs
    - Women are more likely to choose the respect route over power, as they are more concerned about receiving a "cocky" reputation for strong assertiveness.

Subsequent replication and development studies

Townsend et al., 2024, Psychological Science
- 4 studies (N = 816). Cognitive experiments + IAT + self-report on the "world's leading" list.
- The public also associates men with power and women with status.
- (2) Women themselves unconsciously associate status with self.
- The strength of desire itself does not differ between men and women, suggesting that "social stereotypes induce the mode of expression.


relevance
- There is a case of [[Princess of Otasa]].
- [[Get out of the love game]]
    - One mate has been chosen, so there is no need to be popular with an unspecified number of members of the opposite sex.
        - Some people want to be popular with the opposite sex even though they're married...
            - I wonder if being popular is a big part of your self-esteem.
            - I wasn't popular, so that never became a source of self-affirmation, and when I got married, I was "glad to get out of the love game."
- I guess being popular is a source of self-esteem for the Princess of Otasa too.
