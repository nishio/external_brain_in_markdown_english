Keichobot reads one page from Scrapbox
- [[Keichobot can read from Scrapbox]].
- A written list of thoughts that are not coherent.
- Long-term projects page

From there, encourage verbalization by asking questions.
- Then do a [summary focusing on Next Action
        - Tried with [Keichobot automatic summarization function
    - This is one way to concretize the ambiguous "summary" of [Summary is an ambiguous concept

Keichobot question pairs are put in omni with fine granularity.
- Keichobot asks questions and elicits
- omni should do what you suggest using past knowledge.
