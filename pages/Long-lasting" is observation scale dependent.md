title: 'Long-lasting" is observation scale dependent'
---

Long-lasting]" is [[observation scale dependent]].
I think that "long [[continued]]" depends on the [[scale of observation]], and that something that has been going on for a long time at one scale is [[generated and disappeared]] at a smaller scale. The same is true of the [[metabolism]] of an organism's cells, or the [[construction of a new shrine]] of the Ise Jingu shrine.
