title: "Human Network Building Algorithm"
---

The idea of "Unexplored as a network formation system" was followed by the question of whether it would be possible to create an algorithm for building useful human networks without relying on the national budget.

roughly
- Create lots of small groups (communities, 30 people at most)
    - Each group is not treacherous.
    - Not all are formal organizations.
            - Encourage [[informal organization]] to feel free to make
    - Not everything is public.
        - Some "gateway" communities can be large or public
- Encourage membership in multiple groups ref. [[parallel work]].
- Information on selfish players is spread to other communities by members belonging to multiple groups
    - This will cause [[Destroying the Prisoner's Dilemma by placing an observer]] and facilitate a mutually beneficial community.
- If the informal organization is not performing well, participants quickly leave and flee to another group
        - [[reciprocal]] Groups where action is spawned survive; communities ravaged by [[selfish]] players cease to exist.
    - Can cleanse itself without explicitly KICKING selfish players
            - [[Disengagement, Statement, and Loyalty]]

- Q: Just having a small group of people did not work. With each passing day, fewer and fewer people joined.
    - A: I don't know the details of the situation, but I guess there was no incentive design for contributing to the group
        - In a properly rotating small group, members act for the benefit of the other members of the group, thereby benefiting from the members' membership in the group.
        - Therefore, there is an incentive to continue to belong to this group.
