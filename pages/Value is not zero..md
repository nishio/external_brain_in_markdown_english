> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1834811677914919422) When you say, "Is there any value in X/Twitter as a source of information?", there's not zero value, but that's like saying, "Is there nutrition in Cup Noodles?" It's the same thing as, well, it's not zero, but it's just that eating it all the time is obviously unhealthy, so you shouldn't do it.
