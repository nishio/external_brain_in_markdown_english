> [SHIMBA_OFFICE](https://x.com/SHIMBA_OFFICE/status/1879781429602922608) I listened to Takahiro Yasuno's conference on the launch of "AI Project Digital Democracy 2030". Some words were difficult for me as an analog person, but Ms. Takae Ito chewed them up and taught them to me!

>  The Taiwanese government's "Join" system, which allows anyone to raise issues on the Web and requires that policies that receive more than 5,000 endorsements within 60 days will be considered, is exactly what we were aiming for.
>
>  We need politics now that does not look only at the people in front of us. We are the voice on the streets, traveling the country. Live voices by phone, email, social networking and YouTube live. We are listening to the voices of the voiceless through broadband listening. We want to create policies by listening to the voices of the voiceless.
>  I'm excited! (Kevin's story)

- >  How can this be utilized in the National Democratic Party's policy making process, I have been instructed to review this in a day and a half. Kevin, you are a people person.
- Yuichiro Tamaki (Democratic Party of Japan)
- > [tamakiyuichiro](https://x.com/tamakiyuichiro/status/1879812625439363181) If we can create a system that gathers the wisdom and power of all citizens to create policies and laws, democracy will be restarted.
- >  I think this project will not only help some loud voices, but also make visible voices that have been difficult to visualize.
- >  I think this will be a very NDP-like initiative, so let's do it.
- >  Let's create new answers together!

Hirofumi Yoshimura, Governor of Osaka Prefecture, Representative of Japan Restoration Association
> [hiroyoshimura](https://x.com/hiroyoshimura/status/1879824020406964591) I like Mr. Yasuno's "AI Project Digital Democracy 2030". We will actually use it in Japan Restoration Association. Broad listening and AI will be utilized for better policies. First, we will target "reforms to lower social insurance premiums and social security reforms" and use the AI system to reflect numerous ideas and voices in our policies. Execution.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1880922534558007468) Three opposition parties have already publicly declared their participation in the digital democracy initiative presented at Anno-san’s press conference. Some politicians are suggesting that this could be a key factor leading to a change in government.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1880922722307559909) Personally, I am not directly interested in ending the LDP administration. If all major parties support digital democracy, Japan will move forward regardless of which party holds power. I think Anno-san’s strategy, akin to a Lagrange point, is truly brilliant.
