- Engage in [[high context]] dialogue with people who are similar to you.
    - Call minorities who don't share the context "poor communicators."
- When you put that person in an environment where the majority of people don't share the context, they become a minority.
    - A minority of people "assume the other party shares the context."
    - Now we become the "poor communicators".
- All programmers communicate with computers using the language of computers.
    - The metaphor of "understanding how computers feel."
    - People who cannot program have poor communication skills with computers.

    - At this time, there is an abnormality in the communication of the type of person who misidentifies the interlocutor as if he or she were a single individual.
