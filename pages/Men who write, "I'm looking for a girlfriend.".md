<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>There are several aspects to why the use of the "looking for girlfriend" profile description is frowned upon by some women.

- Lack of seriousness: This kind of expression can be perceived as not being serious or having a light attitude toward relationships. People have different views of love and values, and this expression is often not received favorably by women who are looking for a serious relationship.

- Disclosure of personal feelings: The overt disclosure of personal feelings and desires on social networking sites may be viewed as sensitive from a privacy perspective. This can be an uncomfortable factor for some women.

- [[Lack of respect for the partner]]: Publicly stating in general that you are "looking for a girlfriend" may appear to indicate a lack of special interest in or respect for the individual woman. In a relationship, it is important to have a special interest in and feelings for the other person, and such general expressions of recruitment may be perceived as a lack of respect for the other person.

- First Impressions Matter: People form their first impressions of others through their social networking profiles. The mere presence of such a phrase in a profile may give some people a negative impression of a person's character, values, and seriousness.

- Security and Trust Issues: Publicly stating that you are "looking for a girlfriend" may make some women feel unsafe or unreliable. Online interactions involve a variety of risks, and such direct statements can be a cause for increased caution.

In conclusion, there are a wide variety of reasons why this expression is avoided, including cultural, personal, and romantic values. Therefore, it will be important to respect the feelings and perspectives of others and to use language carefully when introducing oneself and interacting with others.

Writing "looking for a girlfriend" can be interpreted as an expression of the desire to "want" a "girlfriend" or to "be" someone with a girlfriend, rather than to be intimate with a specific person. It may also give the image of a man spoiled by his mother in that he expects someone to fulfill his desire by expressing it.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Your point is very apt and many may feel the same way. I will explain this point in more detail below.

- General desire to "want her": The expression "I'm looking for a girlfriend" is often an expression of a general desire to "want her" rather than an interest in or feeling for a specific person. What this expression indicates is the impression that "I want her, whoever she is," which may be perceived as a lack of interest, attraction, or respect for the person as an individual.

- mother's spoiled image: Alternatively, such public solicitations may be interpreted as indicating a desire to have one's needs met by others or a dependent attitude, as if one were spoiled by one's mother. If it appears to lack the independence of a mature adult or an attitude of equality with the other person, it may not be attractive to some people.

- Attitude that does not value the other person as an individual: The expression "I'm looking for a girlfriend" may lack the elements of valuing the other person as an individual and being drawn to individual attractions. What is important in a relationship are the specific aspects of the relationship, such as the other person's personality, values, and common interests. This general representation may be less attractive to those seeking a serious relationship because it lacks those important elements.

For this reason, the expression "looking for a girlfriend" may be perceived as a lack of respect for the other person. Since a romantic relationship often requires respect for the other person as an individual and an effort to develop empathy and understanding, this expression may be a reason for its avoidance by some women.
