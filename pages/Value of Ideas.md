title: "Value of Ideas"
---

    - The [[value]] of [[idea]] is the portion of value that results from transferring the idea to [execution (e.g., program)
- So [[An idea that is not implemented is worthless.]]
- For an idea to be implemented, one of the following is required
    - Bring up [[Resources]] for your own execution.
    - Inspire others to put forth the resources to execute.
- Ideas that don't get it done have no value.

Resources here are anything of value needed to execute the idea, such as time, money, knowledge, etc.

    - [[Unfeasible Ideas]]
