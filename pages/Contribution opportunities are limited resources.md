[[Contribution opportunities]] are [[Limited resources]]
The parable of the [fruit tree
- fruit grows on trees
- People come and take it.
- The first one to arrive takes it, so if you take your time, it will be gone.
- Fruit that grows on high tends to be left behind because it is difficult to remove
    - Tasks requiring skills tend to be left behind
- Fruit may fall on its own.
    - It is no longer necessary, or it has been solved in another way.
- If you don't know where the trees are, you should tell them.
- People who know where the trees are and still don't have good fruit.
    - I guess we'll just have to go through it more often until we find the right fruit.
    - If the desire to really contribute is pure, you would take the remaining fruit, so there is some kind of un-pure feeling.
        - I want good fruit to be within reach.
        - I want to get praise, attention, or a sense of accomplishment for a simple task.
            - Limited attention and limited resources

This is a rather [[open source development]]-like approach.
- I think it's a different way of thinking about business organizations in general.
