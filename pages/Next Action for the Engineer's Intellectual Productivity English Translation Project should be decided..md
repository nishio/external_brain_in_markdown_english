<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Next Action for the Engineer's Intellectual Productivity English Translation Project should be decided.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "Next Action" is this "Next Action"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Now that I've roughly finished translating the last part, I'm thinking about what to do next.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "what's next" is that "what's next"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Specifically, I'm torn between making it readable in Reader, reflecting the revised differences in the 4th edition, and doing a paper version of chapters 6 and 7.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "Reader" is this "Reader"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Static delivery mechanism for content on Scrapbox
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "on Scrapbox" is that "on Scrapbox"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>This time, we are experimenting with putting content on a wiki as a different way of expressing knowledge than in a book.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "content" is this "content"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>English translation of book contents
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "book" is this "book"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>The Intellectual Production of Engineers."
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "engineer" is this "engineer"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>me
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  English translation of book contents
- Is there anything else about this "book"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I put it on Scrapbox because it's a book about intellectual production and I think Scrapbox is a useful tool for intellectual production.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  English translation of book contents
- Where is this "book" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Japanese version is available at bookstores, English version is on Scrapbox.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "Scrapbox" is this "Scrapbox"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>There's been over a thousand pages written in the last few years on a wide variety of articles, not just book content.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Where are those "books" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>The English version of the book, once chopped up and placed scattered throughout Scrapbox, so there's not enough navigation to read it as a book, and I'm hoping Reader will do that for me.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It sounds like it's important to say "Scrapbox is good for intellectual production, that's why I put it in Scrapbox", even though that's what the conversation immediately preceding this one winds up being readable. I mean, I see value in things that lead to better intellectual production.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that "Scrapbox"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Scrapbox is limited in its expression, and I thought it would be better to have breadcrumbs for readers, but it's not good enough to do that in Scrapbox, or something, so I was thinking of doing it in Scrapbox Reader.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What do you hope will happen regarding that "Scrapbox"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It would be nice to have book-like navigation without killing the intellectual and creative support that Scrapbox currently has.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to "Scrapbox" for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It would be nice to be able to add that extension to Scrapbox, but the mechanism currently provided does not allow it. I was thinking of creating a book-like navigation in Reader, but that would not satisfy the "without killing intellectual creation support" requirement.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>As for "Scrapbox," can it do that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I can't.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>

- How do you know about this "Scrapbox"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I think we should explore a little more whether Scrapbox by itself can achieve book-like navigation.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is this "Scrapbox" located?
