If you're one of those people who says, "I'm working so hard, but I just can't lose weight in my stomach...", your internal organs are lower than they should be. So, first of all, do this to get your internal organs back to their original position. Your stomach will shrink so much that you will fly away.

I almost had a cramp in the back of my thigh.
