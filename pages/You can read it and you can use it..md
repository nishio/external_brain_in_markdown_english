title: "You can read it and you can use it."

If there can be a state of "[[You may read]]" with respect to text, then there can be a state of "[[You can use it.]]" with respect to software.

First you write software to serve your own purposes, then you release it to the public as "ok to use". This is not different.

Now, if we return this analogy to writing, we get "First the text is written to serve one's own purpose, and then it is published as 'may I read it'".
