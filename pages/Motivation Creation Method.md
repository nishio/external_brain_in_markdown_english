title: "Motivation Creation Method"
---

- Express work in a Venn diagram of "[[want to do]]", "[[be able to do]]", and "[[should do]]".
    - [[Cybozu]] calls this the "[[motivation]] creation method.
    - The concept of what it takes to be highly motivated and "enjoy working".
- I want to, I can, I should.
    - Looking at the letter, it feels exactly the same as [[Recruitment Will Can Must]].

    - The point that was so eye-opening to me while reading [[The Monster that is the Company]] is that it is you, not the company, who decides what you "should" do.
        - [[You decide what you need to do, not the company.]]
    - Example
        - 1: Company has a project that requires full commitment.
        - 2: At home, the wife needs to take maternity leave to support her during the upcoming birth.
    - These two "shoulds" cannot be reconciled, then [[selection]] is necessary
        - [[Choose for yourself what to do from among the things that need to be done]]
    - He tells us to make choices of our own volition and to have "[[preparedness]]" to accept the consequences of those choices.
- The "I'll do it because my boss told me to do it" mentality runs counter to this.

- Other interesting points
    - Affirm that "I want to do" keeps changing.
    - Can do" includes borrowing the skills of others.
        - Use this "Motivation Creation Method" to borrow the skills of others and create motivation for them
