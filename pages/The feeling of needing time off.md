The feeling of needing time off
    - [[Three variables of the game]]
    - >  [[Hurry when you have to hurry]]
- [[busy]]
- Many people are concerned that they are so [[busy]] with [[immediate busyness]] that they are not able to think about [[non-urgent but important things]] from a [[long-term perspective]].
    - I think that people who feel this kind of anxiety are already able to think from a [[long-term perspective]], not from a [[lack of vision]] of [[what is]] in front of them.
        - You already know that the task in [[immediate]] is [Not the only option.
- When there is a certain "task to do
    - We can procrastinate because we're not explicitly told to do it.
    - Even if you're not explicitly told to do it, you can take action now because you need it anyway.
- When one "task X to be done" requires the result of another person's task Y
    - This is not an appropriate headline.
        - It is implicitly assumed that task X is atomic
    - What I wanted to say.
        - You have a choice to do what you can now to progress project X and "wait for the results of Y" or not to take action until the results of Y are available.
