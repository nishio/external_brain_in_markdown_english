- [[chatbot]] utterance
- Use language models created by [[N-gram]], [[LSTM]], etc. as generative models
- Only select keywords and choose a template to fit them in.
    - Choose a template first, then select keywords that meet your requirements and fit them in.
        - [[Template fitting model]]
- Direct citation of the original document

I think the [[direct quotation model]] looks good for making a celebrity quotation bot.
