- This was the age of no computers, so I made a tearful effort to use clips to display the relationships while allowing the labels to be moved later!
- I think the following interpretation would be easy to realize this with the current tools
    - Generally, "relationship" is "one line."
    - The "conflict relationship" is "two-headed arrow ↔."
    - Similar relationships, sets, and sequences are arranged without lines.
