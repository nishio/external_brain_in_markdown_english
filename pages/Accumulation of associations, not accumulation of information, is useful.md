- [[Accumulation of associations]] rather than [[Accumulation of information]] is useful

It is easy to imagine a paper notebook that cannot be searched
- I've worked so hard to write down all this information, and I've accumulated so many notebooks!" and bragging about it.
- Information is accumulating.
- How often is this information retrieved?
- Sometimes associations connect.
    - 'Oh, I feel like I wrote something related to this years ago.'
    - And I can't find it.
        - [[An existence that cannot be found is the same as one that does not exist.]]

Electronic notes are a little better thanks to search.
- (Only if you can put the written string in the exact search keywords.
    - Often slightly shaky notation and missing.
- (and only if there are not too many hits for that keyword to be listed)

What is useful
- For every new idea X, it is good to find a past idea that is related to it
- This is "[[suggestion]]"
- A system in which associations are connected rather than explicit keyword searches, etc., is useful.

- [[Stock of associations]]
