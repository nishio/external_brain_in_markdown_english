title: "I should have X'd beforehand."
---

When discussing future actions, the opinion is sometimes expressed that "X should have been done beforehand.

This is a reference to past actions/non-actions
You can't change the past.
The past of "I didn't X" has already been established.
Now, it's not constructive to discuss whether or not you would do X if you traveled back in time with your memories intact.
