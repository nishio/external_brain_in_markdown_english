> I have never heard of "responsibility to ask questions" before at Cybozu. I guess it means that we have an obligation as participants to ask questions if we feel something is wrong and make it better... When I asked employees why they can practice this at Cybozu, they answered that it is because the more senior people (management and senior staff) practice it, and because they feel that this kind of behavior will lead to good results.
