[U.S. FTC declares non-compete clauses in employment contracts prohibited. Free to rejoin employers after retirement and more - Publickey](https://www.publickey1.jp/blog/24/ftc_2.html)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The [[Federal Trade Commission]] ([[FTC]]) has issued a final rule prohibiting [[non-compete clauses]] in [[contract of employment]]. The main points are as follows

- A company's employment contract with an employee would be totally prohibited from prohibiting the employee from moving to a competitor or competing for work after leaving the company. This guarantees the employee's [[freedom to change jobs]].
- As an exception, the existing non-compete clause for senior managers with annual salaries of $150,000 or more remains in effect. However, new contracts are prohibited.
- The final rule takes effect 120 days after publication in the Federal Register, after which the non-compete provision is no longer enforceable.
- The FTC estimates that this rule will also result in a 2.7% annual increase in new business and up to $194 billion in healthcare cost savings over the next 10 years.
- The U.S. [[Biden administration]] has been pushing for a ban on non-compete clauses for economic development. IT giants such as [[Microsoft]] have endorsed it.

This seems to be an important regulatory reform that will promote employees' freedom to change jobs and encourage innovation and the creation of new businesses.
