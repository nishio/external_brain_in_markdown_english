title: "Plurality and Ken Suzuki"
---

from  [[Namera Conference 2]]
by [[Ken Suzuki]].
- I sense a [[familial resemblance]] between [[Plurality]] and [[lickspittle]], but I think a detailed discussion would be better after I become a little more familiar with Plurality.
    - Solution by Technology" is close to what we are trying to achieve.
    - I even mention security in the [[lickspittle]] phase.
        - Money→resource allocation→voting→security
        - It doesn't look like we're getting there.
    - With the emergence of ethereum, I feel the need to think about the new social contract
    - No need to emphasize the differences.
        - Similarity and family in the eyes of the world
        - It's all about creating partnerships and changing the world.
