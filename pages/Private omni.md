1. note summary: 1.
Comments on the use of the non-public omni included recognition of the value of searching by links, but also commented on the increased need to search by paragraphs and the feeling that the current UI is not appropriate. As to why the need to search from one's own Scrapbox exists and search from other people's descriptions is not appropriate, it is thought that a sense of the ratio of divergence and convergence is involved.
