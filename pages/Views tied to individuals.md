Facebook activity logs are views tied to individuals

This part of Cybozu Office is a view tied to an individual

The "Notification List" screen that many systems have is also a view tied to an individual.

But it cannot be edited or organized after the fact.
Some services are disappearing rapidly.
More and more information centered on individuals is being discarded every day.

We need a place to accumulate information based on individuals who will not disappear.
- I want [[A place to organize information tied to individuals]].
