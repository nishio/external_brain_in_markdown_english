To be seen
cxxx
Doing and being seen Doing.

Things are not what they are, but what they appear to be. Being useful, and knowing how to show that you are useful, is twice as useful. What is not seen is as good as not seen. Even what is right will not receive proper consideration if it does not seem right. The observant are far fewer in number than those who are deceived by appearances. Deception rules the cracker, things are judged by their overcoats, and many things are not what they appear to be. Good outward appearance is the best recommendation of inner perfection.
