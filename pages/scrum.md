- When Scrum was first introduced to the project management field in 1986 (in a paper by Ikujiro Nonaka and Hirotaka Takeuchi), it was noted for its characteristic of "small [[autonomous]] and [[interdisciplinary]] teams working closely together to achieve a goal," like a rugby scrum. In other words, it was unique in that it was introduced as a method to increase speed, flexibility, and creativity through [[mutually overlapping]] processes and collaborative work, rather than a relay system divided into divisions.
