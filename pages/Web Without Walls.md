I will pick out and re-summarize some particularly interesting new insights from Dan Abramoff's presentation:

New Perspectives on Data Survival:.
- Using React's state management example to illustrate "survival" and "death" of data
- Traditional pattern of extending data survival from component to local storage to server
- But even with final server storage, data "dies" with the death of the product.

The new concept of "[[ATmosphere]]":.
- Currently has approximately 500,000 daily active users
- Surprisingly low cost of operating a relay node for the entire network, about $150/month
- Several third-party apps have already been built, including Smoke Signal

Innovative approaches to event propagation:.
- All events are distributed to all interested consumers
- Example: Blueky post can automatically appear as a comment section in the event app
- No need for separate API integration between apps

Learning from the [[Meta Threads]] case study:.
- Citing the strategy of using Instagram's follow graph to launch Threads.
- With [[AT Protocol]], similar strategies are possible for companies that do not have a large social networking site.
- For example, [[dating apps]] can use BlueSky profiles as a foundation

These specific implementation details and operational costs are new information that is not often mentioned in traditional Blueky or AT Protocol descriptions.
