Since the "individual opinion" of a public comment also constitutes an administrative document, the Diet (both the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors) has the constitutional and legal right to request the submission of materials. In practice, it is possible to request the submission of materials in two ways: (1) by resolution of a committee or house [[Article 104 of the National Diet Act]], or (2) by individual members of the Diet [[written questions and answers]]. The following are the basis and examples of the application of the law.

# 1. Constitutional Basis
- Article 62 of the Constitution of Japan ([[Right to Investigate National Affairs]])
- >  Each of the two Houses may conduct investigations into national affairs, and in connection therewith...request the submission of records.  ([Committee Activities (2) National Political Investigations: Diet Keywords - House of Councillors](https://www.sangiin.go.jp/japanese/aramashi/keyword/katudo02.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

This clause is the basis for the general framework that "all records held by the government are required to be submitted. The individual opinions of the pubic commentary are also naturally within this scope.

# 2. Legal embodiment - Article 104 of the Act of Parliament
- Article 104(1) of the National Assembly Act
- >  When each House of the Diet or a committee of each House of the Diet requests the Cabinet, public offices, etc., for examination or investigation to submit necessary reports or records, they must comply with such request.
    - Under section 3, if the Cabinet makes a formal statement that the request "adversely affects the vital interests of the state," it can be rejected, but such instances are very rare.

# 3. Means available to individual legislators - Written Questions (Articles 74 and 75 of the Laws of Parliament)
- If in session may be submitted alone. Cabinet is obliged to respond to the document within 7 days.
- Although it is difficult to approve a letter of intent "purely for the purpose of requesting data" due to precedent, in practice, there are many examples of data being elicited in the form of attached in bulk as reference material to the written answer.  ([(PDF) Written Statement of Questions - House of Councillors [https://www.sangiin.go.jp/japanese/annai/chousa/rippou_chousa/backnumber/2016pdf/20161201089.pdf?utm_source=](https://www.sangiin.go.jp/japanese/annai/chousa/rippou_chousa/backnumber/2016pdf/20161201089.pdf?utm_source=) chatgpt.com])

# 4. Practical considerations
1.### The committee route is more reliable
.
    - Even if you are a member of the ruling party, you can often receive materials immediately if you request them with the board approval -> committee chairperson's name.
2.### Individual routes should be specific in quantity and format
.
    - "All comments submitted (electronic data acceptable), excluding submitter's identifying information." The agency is less likely to "substitute a summary" if it explicitly states that the
3.### stronger than the Freedom of Information Act
.
    - Article 104 of the National Diet Act takes precedence over requests under the [[Administrative Organs Access to Information Act]], and the fee and blackout restrictions do not apply in principle.

## Summary
- Article 62 of the Constitution → Article 104 of the Diet Law, the Diet (Houses and Commissions) can compel the administration to submit all kinds of records.
- Although a set of individual opinions can also be obtained by written request for questions, a committee resolution is the strongest in terms of enforceability and speed.
- Therefore, the claim that "a member of the Diet can demand that all individual opinions of a pubic commentary be issued" is valid based on the above statute and operation.
