- Auto-generated avatars from photos
- I'll try to use it as an icon for a while because it's interesting to see the atmosphere it retains.

- Book Table of Contents on Scrapbox, I started making a few by hand to try it out and instantly hated it.
    - Create a UserScript that converts a bidirectional link to a one-way link?
        - [[Table of ContentsReading]] よくやる<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/erniogi/icon' alt='/villagepump/erniogi.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - [/motoso/contents reading](https://scrapbox.io/motoso/contents reading).
    - I think this is a situation where there is only a "path" and the actual content is in the book and cannot be placed in Scrapbox because of copyright.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - They're taking advantage of the "discovery" effect of connecting roads.
        - On the other hand, what I'm trying to do now is to present a table of contents to the reader based on the assumption that all the content is on Scrapbox.
    - There is certainly a difference between capturing only the inductive path of content and capturing the entire content.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
- The concept of "link" in Scrapbox, if you ask 100 people who have no experience with Scrapbox, more than 90 of them will think it's a one-way link.
- So in that sense, Scrapbox is an "easy to create two-way links" system.
    - It's hard to represent bidirectional links in a tool that is primarily one-way links, so it's not going to get done.
- [Japanese translation of Scrapbox Reader [https://scrapbox--reader--nishio-vercel-app.translate.goog/nishio/(6.2.4)_Parable,_metaphor,_analogy?_x_tr_sl=en](https://scrapbox--reader--nishio-vercel-app.translate.goog/nishio/(6.2.4)_Parable,_metaphor,_analogy?_x_tr_sl=en) &_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US&_x_tr_pto=wapp]
    - I'm using Scrapbox Reader to display the human translation of "The Art of Intellectual Production by Engineers" in Scrapbox, and then using Google Translate to convert it into Japanese.
        - The logic is that publishers complain when the content of a book is put directly on the Web, but they cannot prohibit users from reading English content translated by machine.
    - I have Vercel configured to return responses without blocking, so "loading" appears in the translation results.
    - I wonder if CSS can do something about the blank lines being skipped.
    - Did I follow the link and it's /en instead of /nishio? Needs to be debugged
- I can't recognize my icon as me. w
    - [/nishio](https://scrapbox.io/nishio)のイメージがあるので慣れないです（数日で慣れそう）<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Oh, I can't get used to it myself. w<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Yes, given the examples of others, I got used to it in a few days.
    - Sometimes I have a mysterious feeling that if I don't confuse my cognition, I'll lose my ability to adapt w<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I wonder if this is a necessary ability w<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/kuuote/icon' alt='/villagepump/kuuote.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Certainly those who change icons will be recognized as those who change icons, so when they change, it will be "again," but for those who don't, it will be "I can't get used to it..." for a while.
            - Not "get used to changing icons," but more abstract.[[Ability to adapt to change]] <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - For example, you go to an electronics store because your mouse is broken, and you buy a trackball that you happen to see and return home (true story).
                - I started [[thumb shift]] because Dr. Shiozawa recommended it to me.
                - It is a feeling of wanting to change things when you realize that you have become accustomed to a certain way of doing things and take it for granted.
                    - I see, indeed.[[natural]] 」に気付くのは大事だ<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/kuuote/icon' alt='/villagepump/kuuote.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I looked at the recent gender and age questions, thought about them, and ultimately decided that I was[[I want to be free of my physical body.]] 」と感じてる気がしてきた<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I felt like [using live-action icons simply because they are familiar is inconsistent.
        - Then, a story about creating avatars from photos came up on Twitter, and we thought, "Why not use this as an avatar (icon) for the time being?

- Until this moment, I was thinking, "I don't have a multi-public project of my own making." w
    - There you have it, [[unexplored list of names]].
- Today's Diary
    - 2I fixed the title of the translated page with Pomodoro and it says "Already exists."
        - There was already a translation!
    - I want an app that overcomes the heartbreak of "I've translated 4 more pages, great, I want an app that affirms penguins praise me!
    - However, I have a page with two different translations, and I don't dare throw out one of them, so the need for merging was born [[negative workload]] ...
