> As an example, let us take the aforementioned The Federalist. In this 10th chapter, pure democracy ([[pure democracy]]) is contrasted with [[republican]] government ([[republic]]).
>  According to the authors (Madison wrote Pt. 10), a pure democracy is a state in which citizens come together directly to run the government. In such a state, the common interests and feelings of the people create cooperation and unity, but on the other hand, the interests of the minority may be sacrificed by the majority. As was the case in ancient city-states, violent partisan fights are also apt to occur. As a result, the democratic state is unstable and unable to guarantee individual security and property rights.
>  In contrast, a republic, on the other hand, is a political system that incorporates [[representative government]]. As a result, the government is run by a small number of citizens elected through indirect democracy. Such citizens will have a better understanding of the true interests of the country, i.e., the public interest. Moreover, while pure democracy is suitable only for small countries, a [[republican]] system with representation is feasible for larger nations.
>  Thus, the authors of The Federalist encourage readers to opt for a republic, not a pure democracy.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>Federal Paper No. 10, written by [[James Madison]], is an important text that discusses the issue of "[[faction]] ([[faction]])" as the greatest threat to the maintenance of republican government.
- Definition of faction: a group motivated by common interests or passions to the detriment of the rights of others or the public good.
- Difficulty in removing the cause: The only way to remove the cause of factions is to take away freedom or standardize people's opinions, both of which are impossible and unjust.
- Controlling Effects: Thus, the key is to "limit the influence" of factions, and Madison advocates a large republic ([[federalism]]) to create a system in which diverse interests coexist, making it difficult for a single faction to dominate.
- Advantages of representative government: a small direct democracy is prone to [[tyranny of the majority]], but a large republic with a large area and many representatives makes factional collusion more difficult and fair government more likely.
Thus, "ensuring diversity through a large republic" and "pursuing the public good through representation" are the solutions to the factions offered by Madison.
