- 1: As the size of the organization grows, one person cannot handle the information generated by each individual.
- 2: So people created [[layered structure]] #Hierarchical organization
    - Middle management is the information intermediary structure.
    - Information from top management is conveyed to subordinates by middle management, and information from subordinates is summarized by middle management and conveyed to top management.
    - This allowed the organization to expand in size, but slow and distorted information transfer became a problem.
- 3A: The development of information transmission methods has made it easier to deliver information issued by top management to all employees.
- 3B: But even in this era, top management cannot handle all information, so middle management is needed
    - The problem of slow and distorted information gathered at the top still remained.
- 4: Natural language summary creation by LLMs will bring information to the top without human intervention.
    - From the top, "I can see things I couldn't see well before [[glasses]]" and "[[Ability to]] see the wider picture."
        - Similar to what is called [[broad listening]] in the context of [[Plurality]].
    - From the bottom, the top could come looking [[panopticon]] at any time?
    - Since it is the top management that feels this is most necessary, the introduction of a system to make this possible is promoted from the top down.

The power of technology will render obsolete the "dynamics of creating [[Brownian tissue]]" spoken of in "[[teal organization]]" and accelerate changes in organizational structure.

Considerations that have not yet been put together
- Will the "glasses to see the whole organization well" that the top management has acquired be given to many of the employees as well?
        - [[access right]] issues exist, different people have different "information" that they are allowed to see.
    - Needs are high.
        - Absorbed by human craftsmen with special talents doing [[in-house information curator]] work.
        - It takes "information to which everyone has access" as input and produces one type of "for everyone" curated output
        - This is where [[Diversity Production]] comes in, depending on individual access rights and interests.
