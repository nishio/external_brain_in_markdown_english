title: "When something is disappointing, it's your fault."
---

When you [[expect]] something and it's not what you expected, it's not that that's bad, it's you with the "false expectation".

It's not [[let-down]], but I'm [[disappointment]].

To blurt out that something was a disappointment is to double down on the shame of having had false expectations and now attributing that error to others instead of to yourself.
