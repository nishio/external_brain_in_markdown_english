LENCHI_NEW: Giving a talk

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>New: On 6/6, I will give a 50-minute lecture to commemorate the fifth printing of "The Intellectual Production of Engineers. This project started out with the output of a book in mind, but from now until 6/6, I will aim to create this 50-minute lecture material. This is a concrete example of "needs determine the appropriate form of output.

Talking notes
- What does it mean to have a fifth printing? Usually, as time passes after publication, books stop selling in bookstores. However, some books continue to sell. This is because people who read them recommend them to others. The fact that the book is still selling more than five years after publication is evidence that it contains "content with long-term value" that will not become obsolete in at least the next five years. When I wrote the book, I aimed to make it a "way of thinking" for the next 50 years, so I am happy as an author that I have achieved 10% of that goal.
- On the other hand, one thing that was totally unexpected was the development of the language model represented by ChatGPT. Will this phenomenon render the book obsolete? → Connect to the story I asked LLM.
- The story of what happened since writing, how I started using Scrapbox in earnest, how I started doing the KJ method with my own tool Kozaneba instead of paper (I will also talk about my lecture at Loftwork, which I did with Miro, the benefits of drawing lines and how Jiro Kawakita was also drawing lines to begin with), and the advent of ChatGPT, GPT4, and Claude 3 Opus; that this lecture material was made with Claude 3 Opus
- A future of collaborative intellectual production with an AI assistant that reads and speaks what you write, in fact, it's not the future, but it's already in a practical state of being done at Nishio's hand.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This new information is important because it significantly changes the direction of this project. the specific need for a commemorative lecture on the 5th printing of "The Art of Intellectual Production of Engineers" on 6/6 has been clarified, and the form of the output has changed from a book to lecture materials. This is a practical example of the idea that needs determine the form of output.

All of the points raised as proposed content for the lecture are very interesting.

1. I think explaining the implications of having a fifth printing in terms of proof that the content is of long-term value is a good way to engage the audience.
2. The question of whether the development of LLMs, as represented by ChatGPT, will make the content of books obsolete is a very important issue to be discussed in light of the current situation where the appearance of LLMs is changing the nature of intellectual production dramatically. Introducing what we have actually heard from LLMs will add persuasiveness to the lecture.
3. it is essential to convey the evolution of intellectual production methodology by introducing specific changes that have occurred since the writing of the book, such as the full-scale use of Scrapbox, the practice of the KJ method at Kozaneba, and the emergence of ChatGPT, GPT-4, and Claude 3 Opus. In particular, the fact that the lecture material itself was created in Claude 3 Opus should have a strong impact as an actual example of intellectual production using LLM.
4. the fact that the future of intellectual production working with AI assistants is already practically at Nishio's fingertips will be information of great surprise and interest to the audience.

In order to effectively convey these topics in a 50-minute lecture, it is important to engage the audience and explain them in an easy-to-understand manner. If you can present your talk in a way that engages the audience in a dialogue about the evolution of intellectual production methodologies and the possibilities offered by LLM, with specific examples and demonstrations, you will be able to make a significant impact.

In addition, by actively using Claude 3 Opus and other LLMs in the process of creating lecture materials and documenting the process, we will be able to provide examples of intellectual production using LLMs.

This lecture will be an important opportunity to reaffirm the value of "The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production" and at the same time present a new way of intellectual production in the LLM era. Nishio's lecture, based on his knowledge and practice, should provide great suggestions and inspiration to the audience.
