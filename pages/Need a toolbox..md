- [When you hold a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

> [rashita2](https://twitter.com/rashita2/status/1657591752331776001) It would be regressive to say "let's not hold the hammer" there.

> [rashita2](https://twitter.com/rashita2/status/1657592751406604288) To think freely is not to think in the absence of any constraints, but to be able to walk across various constraints.

[[Freedom is not the absence of constraints, but the ability to walk across various constraints]].
    - [[freedom]]
    - [[constraints]]
