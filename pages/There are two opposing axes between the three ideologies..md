- Two opposing axes of what is depicted in [intersecting group

> ⿻The dynamic, networked, and adaptive underpinnings of rights and operating systems support democratic inquiry and the evolution of application environments, respectively. And this is in stark contrast to the political and technological monist perspectives embodied in the ideologies of libertarianism and technocracy. Libertarianism is based on a strict and "immutable" set of clearly defined historical rights, emphasizing primarily the private property of individuals and the prevention of "violence" that challenges these property relations. In this view, rights are abstracted or detached from both other rights and the social or cultural context in which they arise, rights belong only to individuals at the atomistic level, and technological systems must insulate these rights as thoroughly and completely as possible from change and social intrusion. Technocracy, on the other hand, is rooted in notions of "purpose," "utility," and "social welfare" functions that the technological system is designed to "match" and maximize. Libertarians view rights as absolute, definite, static, and universal, while technocrats view rights as mere obstacles or burdens in the pursuit of definable social interests.
