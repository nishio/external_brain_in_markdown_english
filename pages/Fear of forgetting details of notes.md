p.118
- > The point memos are cut into pieces and [[spatially rearranged]] into a semantically comprehensible diagram, not just a single column in chronological order. In other words, [[structuring]] them. This process, to my surprise, brought back vivid memories even after a week, or even a year or more. Moreover, even the unwritten related details are fleshed out to some extent.

In other words, Jiro Kawakita's subjective [[memory recall]] was improved when he [[Jiro Kawakita]] took notes [[spatially reconstructed]] in pieces, rather than taking notes [[one-dimensional text]] in chronological order, due to anxiety about forgetting details. Jiro Kawakita] subjectively [[Memory recall]] was improved.
This is probably [[Craik&Tulving 1975]]'s effect that the more cognitively sophisticated you are, the more your memory will stick. The act of trying to write down as much incoming information as possible on the spot is not cognitively sophisticated. The process of taking it apart and structuring it is cognitively sophisticated because you are thinking about meaning.
