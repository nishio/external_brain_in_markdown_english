Experience the following in the manufacturing process
- Sometimes things don't work out the way we initially thought they would.
- We learn something new by making it.
- Hard work doesn't always pay off.

Common "experience of manufacturing" even in different fields, which serves as a basis for common communication and thought.
- There is a [[empirically self-evident]] series of [[axioms]] among those who share this experience
- People who don't have this axiom can "get it in their heads" but feel "shallow" compared to those who have actually experienced it.

The term "[[basic knowledge]]" has the nuance that "[[basic]]" is "[[knowledge]].
- In reality, however, the [[easy to reproduce]] part of the knowledge can be made up later,
- Isn't [[Cannot be duplicated]] [[experiential knowledge]] like this "[[manufacturing experience]]" the real foundation?

    - [[Ph.D. can be in any field.]]
