### Digest of Research Notes
.

Through a process of trial and error, we have explored the idea of cutting off unnecessary branches and leaves to create a straight path. However, this process is not always linear, and sometimes it is important to find the right way to cut and focus from the perspective that "doing the wrong job quickly does not produce results" (i.e., doing the wrong job quickly does not produce results).

The fragment "[[Cutting branches and leaves]]" also points out that excessive cutting of information can hinder viewers' understanding. On the other hand, the "Shadow of the Word" fragment offers the perspective that discarding branches can cause leaves to fall apart. This illustrates the danger of losing sight of the essential message in the process of organizing information.

In addition, "More Advanced Techniques of Keichobot" demonstrates an approach that avoids cutting off branches and instead delves into them to gain new insights. This is related to the "new shoots from dead trees" fragment, suggesting the possibility of generating new knowledge and understanding from failures and difficulties.

Finally, "Never give up until you succeed" emphasizes the importance of persistence and creativity in finding solutions through a process of trial and error. This is related to the fragment "If you don't accumulate, you will go around the same place," which indicates that the accumulation of knowledge and experience is the foundation for finding new perspectives and solutions.

Taken together, these perspectives indicate that the process of trial and error is not merely a matter of pruning off branches and leaves, but also of finding the right focus, digging deep, and accumulating, which has the potential to generate new understanding.
