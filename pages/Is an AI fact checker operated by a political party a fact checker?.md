title: "Is an AI fact checker operated by a political party a fact checker?"
---

In Nishio's opinion as of 2025-06-04, "Strictly speaking, we should probably say [[debunking]], but if we say debunking in the current situation in Japan, it would not be understood and it would be inevitable to say, 'In short, you mean fact-checking! The UNESCO document also says that debunking is a part of fact-checking, so I guess that's OK. I guess so.

[[fack-checking and debunking]]

Maybe from the point of view of "fact-checkers in the narrow sense" who call only "fact-checking by a third party" "fact-checking," "AI fact-checkers operated by a political party are not fact-checking!" But since there is no consensus on the condition of "by a third party," I don't think those who use the term in the narrow sense have the legitimacy to crack down on those who use it in the broad sense (such as UNESCO).

[In terms of "third-partyness," the latter is more third-party than "fact-checking by a human who calls himself a 'third party' but cannot verify what is in his mind" and "fact-checking by an algorithm that is publicly available and can be verified by anyone. In 2025, we are still in a transitional period, so there are still some shortcomings, but in 2030, in a digital democracy, AI fact-checking will become a form that can be triggered by any person.
