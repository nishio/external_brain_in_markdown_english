title: "You know it, but you don't understand it."

- We all know that [[limited resources]] will be [[depleted]] if we compete for them, and that the value of [[easy to reproduce]] resources will go down to zero, as if it were a matter of course at the abstract layer. However, it depends on people whether they can use it for [[concrete decision-making]] or not. If you can't use it for [[concrete]] [[decision-making]] and generate [[benefit]], then you may know it, but you don't [[understand]] it.

- [[Knowledge that can be applied]]
    - [[application]]  /  [[knowledge]]
