- [[bridge]] I'm thinking about the phenomenon that value is created by doing
    - [[connection]]

- [[People who belong to more than one organization]]
- It's the people who are bridging.

- [[Bridging Communities Communities]]
- Bridging Communities.
- [/villagepump/operation to put acquaintances in a personal Scrapbox](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/operation to put acquaintances in a personal Scrapbox).
    - The phenomenon of personal Scrapboxes turning into bridges between different communities

Scrapbox
- Pages that use keyword X as a link are connected to each other by [[2 hop links]], although the page for keyword X itself does not exist.
    - Keywords bridging pages
- A page for keyword X can be created after the fact.
    - Bridging page
- External Links ([[External Links]])
    - Currently, only when explicitly linked.
    - The good news is that reverse linking occurs.
    - It's a good thing that reverse links are not visible to the average user.
