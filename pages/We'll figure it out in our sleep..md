- > I'm reading Audrey Tan's book and it says that you input information before you go to bed and when you go to sleep and wake up, the solution is ready in your mind, too cheat, lol!

There are those who think this is a cheat and that normal people don't do that, and there are those who think it's not normal.
- Those who have experienced it think it's something we all go through; those who have never experienced it think it's not normal.
        - [[Grounding through experience]]
- I'm the one who has experienced it, so I'm wondering if there are people who have never experienced it at all.
    - For example, I can play a fighting game until just before I go to bed, and when I wake up, I can perform aerials (combos in which I connect moves in the air) at a high rate, which I couldn't do until yesterday.
    - I program until I'm about to fall asleep, and then I wake up in the morning and come up with a great design or get a bug out that I've been struggling with.
    - I've had that experience countless times, so I thought "[[developing in my sleep]]" meant [[natural]].
- Interesting what makes this difference.
    - Personally, I believe that if you pack a lot of information in during the day, it gets sorted out during the night.
