title: "summarize information"
---

- [[考えをまとめる]]
    - directly translated: [[summarize]] ideas
        - I feel [[incompatible]] with the selection of the word "[[ideas]]"
        - "information" fits
        - "how to summarize information" and "how to make ideas" are similar patterns
        - Time series:
            - gather concrete information (= [[information gathering]])
            - → summarize them (= [[pattern discovery]] / [[structure discovery]])
            - → [[make ideas]]
