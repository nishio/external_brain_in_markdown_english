I'm starting to think that if you push capitalism to its limits, the big powers like the U.S., EU, and China will be at an advantage, and smaller Japan at a disadvantage.

The bigger the power, the bigger the lower class, the easier it is to expropriate them.

>  The U.S., China and the EU [[productive population]] are increasing, while Japan's is rather decreasing. This is the cause.
>  Based on demographics, China will enter a period of decline in the next few years.

If [[exports]] do not grow enough to compensate for this, growth will not be possible.

However, it takes a change in mental models to take on new challenges instead of maintaining the status quo, and people with mental models who think they can succeed by doing things the way they have in the past are getting in the way.

The only options are to develop high value-added industries that can be exported abroad, or to make money through "tourism," which is the selling off of daily life.
