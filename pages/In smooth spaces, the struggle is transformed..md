<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This sentence corresponds to the next sentence in the last paragraph of the text.

"Of course, smooth spaces are not in themselves liberatory. But the struggle is changed or displaced in them, and life reconstitutes its stakes, confronts new obstacles, invents new paces, switches adversaries."

In other words, smooth spatial space space itself has no inherent power to lead to liberation. In smooth space, however, the struggle changes or moves to another place. It is also stated that life faces new stakes (stakes) in smooth space, confronts new obstacles, creates a new pace, and replaces enemies.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This is because smooth spatial space has different characteristics than striped space.
- A smooth space is a space that does not have a fixed center or direction and is constantly changing. Therefore, power relations are not fixed, and [[struggles]] can easily become fluid and unpredictable.
- Smooth space is based on tactile and rhythmic principles rather than visual and metric organizing principles. This also allows forms of resistance to unfold in the dimension of physical movement and sensation rather than direct confrontation.
- Smooth spaces are non-territorial spaces that are not bound by territorial boundaries such as nations. Therefore, struggles are not fixed in one place, but are likely to move and spread to other places.
- In a smooth space, it is difficult to establish a [[clear conflict structure]] (e.g., dominant/dominated) as in a striped space, and the distinction between friend and foe tends to become blurred. This can be expected to make the struggle more diverse and complex.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>Deleuze and Guattari do not cite specific examples, but in light of their discussion, the following examples might be considered.

- [Nomadic Resistance: [[nomads]] resist the territorial domination of the state by moving around instead of settling down. Their movements are fluid and unpredictable, making them an [[elusive threat]] to the state.
    - [[guerrilla warfare]]: Guerrillas have an asymmetrical fighting style as opposed to the military forces of a state. They do not have a fixed base, but rather fight with flexibility and mobility, making their movements fluid and unpredictable.
- Resistance in [[cyberspace]]: resistance on the Internet can unfold beyond the constraints of physical space. [[Hacker groups]], for example, can move freely and carry out attacks on power without appearing to do so.
- Artistic Activism: The avant-garde resists existing values by creating new forms of expression. Its activities are constantly changing and have the unpredictable power to disrupt authoritarian control.
