title: "Deletion Functions"

- Click on a sticky → [[Balloon Menu]] → [[Delete]].
- When you click on a group, it opens and closes.
    - Open and close, but also serve menus?
- Pass?
    - Balloon menu with lasso selection

    - Implemented by [[Lasso selection → Delete]].
    - If the balloon menu from the lasso selection can be used to delete the sticky, there is no need to delete the sticky itself.
    - but I think [[Sticky note click to open/close, not balloon menu]] is fine.
