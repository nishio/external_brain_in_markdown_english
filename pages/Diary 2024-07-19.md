> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1813970437355049371) I thought I bought a caffeine-free nutritional drink on Amazon that I can drink before bedtime to relieve fatigue, but it didn't arrive, I thought I just put it in my cart and didn't buy it ( You're tired.)

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1813978600296833048) I didn't even put it in my cart, and when I tried to reorder it from my past order history, I didn't even order it in the past (must have bought it at the drugstore).


> [kaneshun1014](https://x.com/kaneshun1014/status/1813847855121289318) I was able to support Takahiro Yasuno's campaign for Governor of Tokyo for a month and wrote a NOTE reflecting on it.
>  Please also see the photos of the island where we went to put up the posters!
>  "A month of photographing Anno, visiting the island, and distributing leaflets! A look back with photos of the island."

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1813948930163687599) I didn't know that the island was close enough to come up with the idea the day before so it was surprising, maybe I'll go sightseeing when I get settled~!
> [kaneshun1014](https://x.com/kaneshun1014/status/1813954209001381918) Yes!
>  There is also a boat from Tsukishima,
>  Also, from Chofu, you can fly to the island in 30 minutes, which is very convenient.
