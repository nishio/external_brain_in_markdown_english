July~August in 2024, first in early July.
    - Originally scheduled for [[Daimine Climbing 2024]].
            - [[Daimine Climbing 2024 Reflection]]
    - Mr. Anno's campaign for Governor of Tokyo is over.
- The two collided, and I got off the mountain and immediately took the bullet train to Tokyo to see the preliminary vote count.

There was a dense schedule of events related to [[Funding the Commons Tokyo 2024]] between July 23 and 26, and in early August, I reviewed the Japanese translation of the Plurality book that came out soon after I finished organizing the huge amount of input from those events, and then there was the midterm camp for [[Facing the Ocean 2024 Yokohama]] and the midterm camp of the Junior Institute of Non-Exploration.

This slap in the face and the time left before we could look back caused a "I don't know what to look back on" situation, resulting in a long period of salting away.

Busy with the rage of the Tokyo gubernatorial race.
- TTTC Turbo" released on 6/27
    - Release is a misnomer.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

- Also wrote "The Future of Digital Technology for Democracy" on July 4
- Refreshments on 7/6 at "Daimine Mountaineering 2024".
- Team Yasuno's Election Campaign Review (KPT)" was released on July 8, and election-related activities have come to a close.
- Plurality Video Shooting" on 7/9.

Want to move forward/leave undone
- Questions and additions to Talk to the City study session and viewing of other sessions
- Watch Hayashi's video
- Writing TTTC related patch articles (compiling articles on TTTC, organizing Minor Votes and Polis cases, etc.)

Considerations for Building a Broad Listening Environment
- Scatter (Python environment) has many troubles, while Turbo, which runs on a browser, is easy to use but difficult to identify the cause of errors.
- I feel that the solution is to "run the script in Google Colab and share it in an error state".

summary
- In the first half of July, he was extremely busy in connection with the Tokyo gubernatorial election, while also actively writing and shooting videos on "Broad Listening" and "Digital Democracy". In the future, he plans to continue to improve documentation and write articles on TTTC and Plurality, as well as continue his trial-and-error efforts to make the broad listening environment easier to handle.
