from  [[pomodoro technique]]
- Repeat cycle of 25 min work → 5 min break [[art of doing business]].
    - A few more detailed steps
        - set
            - 25 minutes work, 5 minutes rest
            - 25 minutes work, 5 minutes rest
            - 25 minutes work, 5 minutes rest
            - 25 minutes work, 30 minutes rest
        - Repeat this set.

The above explanation of the "five-minute break" is a mystery that arose in the process of popularizing the Pomodoro Technique.[[ritual]] <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- It's explicitly denied in the 2010 [[Introduction to the Pomodoro Technique]].
    - I went into it in 2012 saying that it was spreading the wrong interpretation, but it just keeps spreading.
            - [[Length of breaks in the Pomodoro Technique]]  (2012-11-11)
            - > To quote from "Length of breaks" on p. 152.
            - > >Should we [[time-box]] breaks as well? Will it prevent a long, unprotected break? The answer is no. The answer is no, because you have to be mentally ready when you start your next pomodoro.
    - I'd read about it, but I'd completely forgotten about it.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/miyamonz/icon' alt='/villagepump/miyamonz.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I'd forget about it, and I'd want to take a break, so I'd usually rest for more than five minutes.
    - I thought it wasn't good that I kept slacking off after five minutes, but I guess it was natural.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/yosider/icon' alt='/villagepump/yosider.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - The author, Francesco Sirillo, says that his own experience was just right for him to work for 25 minutes and take a 5-minute break.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/suto3/icon' alt='/villagepump/suto3.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I'm sure you all can find just the right allocation for yourselves, like
            - [[Oversimplification.]] Or perhaps some important information fell through the process of summarizing?
        - The Pomodoro part should have said, "Try it yourself and find out if 25 minutes is good for you," and yet, "25 minutes is the rule!" Like.[[ritualization]] をしてしまう<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

parable<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Saying "I have a hard time concentrating on my work" to someone who has a hard time concentrating on his work is like saying "I need to work for 25 minutes and take a 5-minute break" to someone who has no muscle strength and wants to improve it is like saying "I need to squat 25 times and do 5 pull-ups" to someone who has no muscle strength and wants to improve it.
    - That's absurd...
    - You wouldn't feel at ease if you turned the timer on during your break.
- > because by the time you start the next pomodoro, you must be mentally ready.
    - This means, "Rest until you feel ready for the next 25 squats."
- He also says, "Let's first measure how many pomodoros I can do in a day."
    - This is because the length of the break can be extended or interrupted and the pomodoro interrupted.
    - You're not observing reality well enough to assume you can do a mechanical process like "25 minutes activity, 5 minutes break."
        - [[spreading false rumors]] のしくみに似ているかも <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/suto3/icon' alt='/villagepump/suto3.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Simple, easy-to-understand information tends to spread easily, even if it is wrong.
