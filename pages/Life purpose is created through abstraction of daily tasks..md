title: "Life purpose is created through abstraction of daily tasks."

- They say, "We need to clarify [[the Purpose of Life]]," not create a new one.
- What do I consider good and what do I want to avoid in my daily routine tasks?
- What is [[gradual clarification]] by observing it.

- [[abstraction]] ：
- You said, "I had choices A and B, and I chose A. Why is that?"
    - Clarify the "part of Option A that you feel is intrinsically valuable" in Option A.
- If it's A and B, you pick A. If it's C and D, you pick C. What do they have in common?"
    - Clarify commonalities between the preferred alternatives
- Why not B's and D's?"
    - Clarify what is being interpreted negatively.

- [[Values are verbalized bottom-up.]]
