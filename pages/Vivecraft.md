I bought a cable and Vivecraft's 1.18.1 support is out, so I'm going to try it.

        - correct

When I went into the Micra in VR, [[LELIEL]] was so big, and when I got in the water, I couldn't go up, and I was in a daze about what I was going to do in the water, taking advantage of the creative mode.
- Seems the fact that he was sitting down to play put him in a Micra crouch.

I took a screenshot of my microscopic experience in VR, but it doesn't convey anything. It's like this image is stretched 180 degrees into a hemisphere, covering the edge of my field of view. The sphere is simply huge, and the blocks under your feet are definitely the size of a meter.

- When I fell down the rainbow pipe, I had full visibility and the screen was not updated fast enough, so I lost a lot of SAN value!
- [[Enderman Animation]] is like being in the front row of a theater.
I'm not sure if it was the performance of the machine or something in the configuration, but sometimes the view was so choppy that it was quite tiring!

- It became clear to me why the visibility shift is a [[snap-turn system]].
    - Because that's where I first felt the gap, "Oh, that's how you operate?

[[Vivecraft]] Explaining the VR adaptation of Minecraft: amazingly immersive with the introduction of shadow mods! []](https://blog.endstart.net/article/vivecraft.html)
[Playing Minecraft with Oculus Quest 2 - Kotobanoutakata](https://ktb.hatenablog.com/entry/2021/01/05/235329)
> Error message on black screen after Minecraft starts up.
>  To be activated from the oculus screen.

- I don't understand why, but it looks like SteamVR needs to operate the activation from the Oculus side.

Opening the desktop in OculusLink is black.

Visible.

Today's Summary
- I launched SteamVR via OculusLink and launched Vivecraft with the connection status indicator showing -> I was able to get an immersive menu screen, I launched Micra on the VR space!
- It's a wireless connection, so it's choppy due to lack of bandwidth and I can't figure out how to start the game, one break until the cable arrives.
