title: "Is it a contrarian value to avoid a sense of seriousness?"
---

Human beings have a "desire to be considered a significant person" by others, and [[philosophy of Lao-tse and Chuang-tse]] explains that "it is not good to be pleased with being considered a significant person by others" (e.g., [[staying awake on the eve of the 57th day of the sexagenary cycle (to prevent the five elements from reporting one's wrongdoings)]], the first half of [[philosophy of Lao-tse and Chuang-tse]]). of the sexagenary cycle (to prevent the five elements from reporting one's wrongdoings)").

I think it is not equal to give up "[[sense of important people]]" after having obtained it, as Lao Tzu did, and to consider it unnecessary without having obtained it. The latter may be [[sour grapes]] or [[reverse values]].
