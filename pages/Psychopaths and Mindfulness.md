> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1570388568144752640) After reading this manga again, I realized that the basis of the work seems to be [[Zen (Buddhism)]] and [[mindfulness]].
>  Instead of acting in the futile act of regretting and worrying and suffering due to a past that cannot be changed,
>  Live in the present based on a past that cannot be changed
>  The way it is portrayed is thorough.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1570390460354691074) Aside from the elf Freelen, humans are mindful thinkers across the board.
>  There is seriously no one who is bound by a past they can't change (even Zain tried to stay in the village when he appeared?)
>
>  It's damned interesting to reread Freelen from this perspective.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1570394520017317888) The first class wizard exam is a good example of mindfulness,
>  Teams trust others but never expect them to trust them, and never try to change them (because they cannot be changed).
>  In addition, there is seriously no indication that those who lost regret it at all, the perception is that it can't be helped, that they were weak.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1570395970697048064) I think what's amazing about the funeral freelens is that they perfectly depict that [[psychopath]] and mindfulness are two sides of the same coin.
>  Neither of them are exactly the same in terms of "not being stuck in the past and living in the present.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1570404558593208321) Funeral freelens, even biological reactions to pain, are full of no-reaction scenes, as they are futile.
>  Because there's nothing beneficial in making a fuss about the pain.
>
>  It's a tremendous mindfulness (psychopathic) piece where all the characters see themselves as frames, seriously.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1570412848014323712) In a modern story, it may no longer be offensive to use a character trapped in the past as a trickster to advance the story
>  You look like a fool who is living a cosmopolitan lifestyle.
>
>  Cost-effective way of life = mindfulness, psychopathy
>  I feel like it's supposed to be.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1570444053883523072) freelen, I just reread volumes 1 through 9.
>  I knew it. Mindfulness is the base of all the characters' thinking.
>  "Don't get stuck in the past, live in the present."
>  "'Pain' is merely a reaction felt by the body, and reacting to 'pain' is futile; the other higher self observing the 'pain' does not 'hurt'."

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1570445340268204032) For example, this page in volume 6, Fern should be angry, but she realizes that it is futile to be angry, so her reaction is "That's good to know. That's good.
>  This doesn't usually happen unless you've been trained in the mindfulness of the futility of being trapped in the emotion of anger.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1570447182557515776) "'Pain' is just a reaction that the body feels, and reacting to 'pain' is futile, and the other higher self observing the 'pain' does not 'hurt'."
>
>  I wonder if this is because it's based on an RPG-like world, just fewer hit points for the character, and it doesn't hurt the "player" who is observing it.
>  structure

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1570577666868379649) Ah, so even "old age" is subject to mindfulness in this work.
>  We all realize that we cannot change the fact that we are getting old, and that it is futile to suffer in the grip of old age.
>
>  You've been sticking that in my face since episode 1.
