title: "People who do not tolerate failure will not be able to fail."

> [@voluntas](https://twitter.com/voluntas/status/1626507118798082048?s=20): i think the problem is that if you don't allow [[failure]], the non-tolerant side can't fail.

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1626509848417554432?s=20): "[[People who do not tolerate failure.]]" is "[[What can't go wrong]]" I don't understand the downside of "[[What can't go wrong]]?" I'd say.
