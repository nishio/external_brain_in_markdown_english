Reddit is a platform for users to post and discuss freely, and its main feature is that anyone can create "[[subreddits]]" dedicated to each topic. This is in line with Audrey Tang's idea of "[[opening up agenda-setting authority to people]]," in which individual users create their own topic spaces (e.g., r/foobar), increasing the freedom of information transmission.

Reddit also employs an "[[upvote]]" and "[[downvote]]" rating system for posts, which attracts attention through user voting. This system allows high quality content to stand out and, as a result, effectively concentrates the attention ([[attention]]) of the entire community.

To summarize briefly:
- Anyone can create a topical space.
- Everyone can create subreddits that reflect their interests and opinions, and individual agenda setting is democratized.

- Attention-Gathering Mechanisms.
- Popular posts are voted by users to appear at the top of the list, naturally attracting "attention" and forming a topic of conversation.

This system of free community formation and attention economy is a major attraction of Reddit.
