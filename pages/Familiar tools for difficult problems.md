title: "Familiar tools for difficult problems"
---

When thinking about difficult problems, using unfamiliar tools can make it difficult to solve what is solvable.
Makes the problem even more difficult.

But new tools are more efficient when they are learned.

If this is the case, then we must consciously try to solve problems with unfamiliar tools that are not so difficult that they can be solved quickly with tools we are familiar with.
