The identity of [[Atman]] and [[Brahman]] is a central concept in [[Vedanta philosophy]], found primarily in the Indian [[Upanishad (sacred Hindu treatises)]] literature. This teaching, also expressed as "[[Atman-Brahman]]," refers to the idea that the individual [[self]] (Atman) and the [[ultimate reality]] of the universe (Brahman) are essentially identical. This understanding is at the heart of Indian philosophy's non-dualism, which states that the ultimate purpose of each individual being is to realize this oneness.

# Atman
Atman, a concept usually translated as "self" or "[[soul]]," refers to the essential, unchanging part of an individual being. Atman is distinct from the body, the senses, and thought, and is considered to be an eternal entity that transcends life and death. This "self" is the essence of the unchanging truth common to all life forms.

# Brahman
Brahman is the fundamental reality or [[absolute being]] of the entire universe. It is the origin of all things, the building block of the universe, and the universal law or principle that governs the entire universe. Brahman is formless, attributeless, and beyond words and thoughts.

# Identification of Atman and Brahman
.
The Upanishads teach the identity of these two concepts. The most famous expression is found in the phrase "tat tovam asi" (it is you) in the [[Chandogya Upanishad]]. This indicates that the individual Atman and the [[cosmic reality]] Brahman are essentially indistinguishable, and teaches that [[the individual being is ultimately identical with the entire universe]].

This concept aims for the individual to understand the true nature of the Self and experience ultimate oneness beyond the individuality and differences in the everyday world. Through [[meditation]] and philosophical insight, the individual realizes that the Atman within the self is Brahman, which is the path to [[moksha]].

This teaching is one of the most profound insights in Indian philosophy, showing the path to personal spirituality and ultimate freedom.
