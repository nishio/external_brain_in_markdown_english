title: "BOOLEAN's logical thinking is shallow."

from[/villagepump/2025/09/12](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/2025/09/12)
    - [[logical thinking]] is not [[logical]] if you are a self-proclaimed logical thinker who does not take into account the basic premise that "interpreting True/False when the subject is not given in [[True/False]] involves loss of information".
    - Since [[certainty]] is lost in the conversion to True/False, there is no certainty in the conclusion, no matter how certain the inference is in the True/False world after that.
    - Yet, the mysterious confidence that "I am a logical thinker" leads people to believe that results that are not certain are certain.

- Every time I do [[Madamis (Japanese brand of haloperidol)]], my thinking gets a little deeper.
