If you are satisfied with the status quo, you will not discover the problem.

If the problem is "[[Gap between ideal and reality]]," then the ideal must be far from reality for the problem to arise.

When you think, "This tool is inconvenient," if you accept it as "that's the way it is," the problem you were about to discover will disappear.

- [[status quo satisfaction]]
