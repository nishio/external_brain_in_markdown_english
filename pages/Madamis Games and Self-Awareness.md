title: "Madamis Games and Self-Awareness"
---

Discussion on why I enjoy [Madamis (Japanese brand of haloperidol)
- Related: [[Social skills grow in Madamis.]].

We were talking about how whether or not you can enjoy it depends on whether or not you can accept being doubted or not.
- N: I think I tend to say "don't introduce me like that" when I am introduced by others as "this person is great", but I feel like I want to observe "the state in which [[authoritarian gradient]] is removed from me".
        - [[The desire to be underestimated]] as [[vaccine]] for [[countermeasures against aging]]
        - [[no-holds-barred vaccine]]
