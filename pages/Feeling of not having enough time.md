title: "Feeling of not having enough time"
---

I feel like I don't have enough time, but it's not that I don't have enough time physically, but that my [[sense of anxiety]] of not having enough time prevents me from [[concentration]], or that my [[Task Dependencies]] increase or my [[Efficiency]] increases by thinking that I should proceed more efficiently because I don't have enough time. Task Dependencies] or work-in-progress tasks are increasing due to the lack of time.
