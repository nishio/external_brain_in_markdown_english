An anecdote about [[Zen (Buddhism)]] monks of the Meiji era, [[flatland mountain]] (Haratanzan)

>  One day they came to a stream without a bridge.
>  A young woman stood a short distance away, staring at the stream with a troubled look on her face.
>  "I will carry you on my back."
>  With the woman on his back, Tangshan stepped into the creek and successfully helped the woman to the other side of the river.
>  Then, once on shore, he quickly went on ahead, leaving the woman to thank him.
>
>  Not at all at ease was another fellow trainee who was watching this.
>  "What is a Zen monk in training doing carrying a woman on his back?"
>  The thought never left my mind, and my anger at Tangshan's actions was forever smoldering.
>  It didn't go away for a while after we both started walking again, and the agony continued.
>  And eventually I couldn't bear to keep it in my mind, and I opened my mouth in a reproachful way to Flat Mountain.
>  "What was that? You are a trainee, aren't you? What was that about giving a young woman a piggyback ride?
>
>  Then Flat Mountain showed a surprised face and immediately started laughing.
>  "I put that woman down long ago and you're still carrying her on your back. Ha-ha-ha."
>
>  Which one was [[attachment]] to the woman?
