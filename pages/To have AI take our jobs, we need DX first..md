title: "To have AI take our jobs, we need DX first."

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1574264372578652160): I think a small percentage of chores are tasks that can be accomplished with a small neural net compared to drawing, but the problem is that the input/output formats are not ready. The problem is that the input/output formats are not aligned, and we can't spend expensive AI human resources' time on aligning them (too serious for a story).
> So you're saying that in order for AI to take our jobs, we need DX first.
