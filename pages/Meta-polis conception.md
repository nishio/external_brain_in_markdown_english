As an idea, I think the direction is good, but from an engineer's point of view, this configuration makes no sense.
- The fact that you treat Polis and Talk to the City as parts of [[black box]] is not good.
- In fact, we need to provide a single [[frictionless]] service that has the utility that Polis provides that Talk to the City does not, and the utility that Talk to the City provides that Polis does not.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3-mini-high/icon' alt='o3-mini-high.icon' height="19.5"/>Frictionless" refers to the state in which users are provided with a [[smoothly integrated experience]] when using a service, without any sense of unnaturalness or discomfort in terms of boundaries between functions or procedures. In other words, the nuance is that Polis and Talk to the City must be seamlessly integrated so that users feel as if they are using one consistent service, while drawing out the strengths of each separately.
