title: "Light and dark anger"

- I thought [[Anger is a form of self-pity]].
- On the other hand, one friend believes "[[Anger is a]] driving force
- And the friend is using his anger as a driving force to produce results.
- I mean, there is good in anger.
- What is the difference between good anger and bad anger?

    - [[Parable of the Heat]]
    - Bright, sunny, dry, dry, dry, hot.
    - Dark, cloudy, damp, dank, and hot.
    - Both are "hot," but the sensation you get is much different.
    - Good anger resembles the former.
    - Some of the bad anger resembles the latter.
        - Some bad angst not so bad.

    - [[Parable of the Steam Engine]]
    - The friend, who is motivated by anger, believes he can "change" the object of his anger
        - Meaning "[[one can]] ameliorate what is the object of one's anger," not "make something else the object of one's anger."
    - So [[anger is the driving force that creates "action to change"]].
    - Zimmering people believe that they cannot "change" the object of their anger.
        - We're not discussing here whether it can or cannot actually be changed, we're just talking about personal perception.
        - The belief that "I can't change it" is formed by the actual experience of "I can't change it".
            - → [[learned helplessness]]
    - This is like [steam engine
        - When heat is applied, water turns into steam, creating pressure.
        - When this pressure is properly directed, power can be produced, which is the steam engine.
        - On the other hand, if there is no place for pressure to escape, it will damage the kettle
            - Worst case scenario, it bursts.
        - The metaphor of "[[degassing]]"
            - Pressure drops as heightened pressure sputters out.
            - The goal is to reduce pressure, so I'm not thinking about whether or not that spewed force will be useful motive power.
            - It's easier to just let it blow out than to use it as a power source, so it flows that way.

    - [[Three kinds of anger and usefulness]]
