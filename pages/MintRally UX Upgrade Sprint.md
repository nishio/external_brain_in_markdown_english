> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1661640478759227394?s=20): I'm interested but don't know what the expectations are, so I thought it would be a psychological hurdle to raise my hand for a 2 month project... But when I looked at the website, it said "there is a 1-day hackathon next Saturday", so I decided to join anyway.

- The physical venue is held every other month, so if you don't attend the one the day after tomorrow, the next one will be in two months.
- The fact that I happened to see it at this point in time is something of a coincidence.
