Externalization of thoughts increases intellectual productivity, and verbalization is its bottleneck; AI draws information from humans, and the development of LLM moves the bottleneck of intellectual production to output efficiency in the native language. It is also necessary to turn concepts that have not yet been put into words into operable objects, and to have a provisional language for this purpose.

Nishio's "The Value of 🤖🔁 Natural Resources" points out the difficulty of AI providing a broad perspective and sharing tacit knowledge between humans and AI that humans have yet to verbalize. This is relevant to my research and underscores the importance of knowledge sharing between AI and humans.

In 🤖🔁The Boundary Between Humans and AI, the emergence of AI requires a change in human mental models. This is consistent with my research and complements the perspective that the presence of AI changes learning and intellectual production.

In "🤖🔁Collaboration with AI," the need for "collaboration" where AI and humans share experiences. This is consistent with my research and underscores the importance of humans and AI working together to share knowledge.

These fragments highlight the importance of knowledge sharing and collaboration between AI and humans, which is deeply relevant to my research. My research could be deepened by incorporating these perspectives.

Externalization of 🤖🔁thought
The Importance of Linguistics and the Role of AI in this Process
- Externalization of thoughts is an important factor in intellectual productivity.
- Linguization in particular is a bottleneck
    - It is important to take out as words what is still unspoken in the human mind
- The development of LLM moves the bottleneck of intellectual production to output efficiency in the native language.
    - There are languages that are better suited to express certain thoughts, and different languages and cultures have different names for concepts.
    - The existence of large-scale language models changes learning and intellectual production and increases the means of acquiring new knowledge and ideas
    - How to use AI to extract information from humans
        - The Value of AI in Encouraging Language
            - Specifically, by deepening and verbalizing your thoughts, you can examine them more critically and find solutions to contradictory problems.
- To turn a concept that has not yet been put into words into an operable object, and for that [[fancy word]] is needed
    - Discovering new knowledge and sharing it with others is a means of value creation

Externalization of thought is an important component of intellectual productivity, especially the technology of verbalization, which is the bottleneck. The use of AI to extract information from humans and the development of LLM suggest that the bottleneck of intellectual production will move to output efficiency in native language. It also emphasizes the need to turn concepts that have not yet been put into words into operable objects and the need for a provisional language to do so.

Nishio's research note "Scrapbox+GPT4" predicts that the existence of large-scale language models will change learning and intellectual production and increase the means of acquiring new knowledge and ideas. The development of the "Japanese Culture AI" also points out that there are languages suitable for expressing certain thoughts, and that different languages and cultures have different names for them. This is related to my research and reinforces the idea that a provisional language is needed to verbalize concepts that have not been verbalized.

The Keichobot Automatic Summarizer also discusses the value of AI in encouraging verbalization, which is directly related to my research. Specifically, it is hoped that by deepening and verbalizing one's thoughts, one will be able to examine them more critically and find solutions to conflicting problems.

In "Nodes of Thought 2023-05-22," it is stated that it is important to retrieve in words what is yet to be put into words in the human mind. This is consistent with my research, and it also states that discovering new knowledge and communicating it to others is a means of value creation. This reinforces my emphasis on the importance of turning "not yet verbalized concepts" into "operable objects."

Based on the above, it can be said that important connections exist between my research and Nishio's research notes. In particular, we find a common understanding of the importance of verbalization and the role of AI for this purpose. These perspectives are important themes that should be explored in depth in future research.

In "Externalization of Thought Matters," it is necessary to give a name to a concept that has not yet been verbalized in order to turn it into an operable object. In "Hooks for Fishing Out What Has Yet to Be Linguified," a provisional word is needed to verbalize a concept that has not yet been verbalized.

In "Nodes of Thought 2023-02-19," it is shown that value is found in social implementation. In addition, "The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production: A Summary of Repercussions" discusses the verbalization of unverbalized sensations and the refinement and cultivation of ideas.

In "The Development of LLM Moves the Bottleneck of Intellectual Production to Output Efficiency in Native Languages," it is stated that the development of LLM moves the bottleneck of intellectual production to output efficiency in native languages.

The "hook for fishing what has not yet been verbalized" requires a hypothetical word to verbalize a concept that has not yet been verbalized.

The "post-LLM worldview" states that "what has not yet been put into words" cannot be covered.

In "The Art of Linguistics," he describes the art of verbalization as a bottleneck in intellectual productivity.

In "Preparation 2 of the column on ChatGPT," you state that AI should be used to extract information from humans.

These notes underscore the importance of verbalization and the need for technology to aid it. Another important theme is the value of social implementation and the shifting of bottlenecks in intellectual production through the development of LLM.
