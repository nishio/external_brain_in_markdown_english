Your reflection on information gathering, particularly in the context of AI and technology, is insightful and highlights several important concepts.

- [[Intermittent Reinforcement]]: This is a psychological concept where behavior is reinforced at irregular intervals. In the context of information gathering, it suggests that the occasional reward of finding valuable information can lead to an overestimation of the value of continuous searching. This can be especially relevant with the ever-expanding information available on the internet and through technologies like AI.

- [[Internal vs. External Exploration]]: Your distinction between internal and external exploration is quite profound.
    - Internal exploration involves introspection, reflecting on what you already know, and understanding your own thoughts and feelings.
    - External exploration is about seeking new information and experiences from the outside world.
    - The metaphor of searching for keys under the streetlight illustrates the inefficiency of external exploration when done aimlessly. It suggests the importance of having a focused approach or a clear goal in mind when seeking new information.

- [[Aimless Wandering as Entertainment]]: While wandering without a specific goal can be entertaining and sometimes [[serendipitously fruitful]], it's important to recognize its limitations in terms of productive information gathering. Entertainment and relaxation are valuable, but they serve a different purpose than focused research or learning.

- [[The Importance of Calmness in Information Gathering]]: Your self-reminder about the necessity of calmness resonates deeply in today's fast-paced, information-rich environment. The anxiety of trying to keep up with every development, such as OpenAI's movements, can lead to a scattered approach to information gathering, reducing its effectiveness and potentially leading to information overload.

In the context of AI and your interest in this field, it's crucial to balance the excitement and curiosity about new developments with a mindful and purposeful approach to information gathering. Recognizing when to pause, reflect internally, and approach information gathering with a clear and calm mind can lead to deeper understanding and more meaningful insights. This approach aligns well with the philosophical aspects of technology and AI, where contemplation and critical thinking are as important as staying informed about the latest advancements.
