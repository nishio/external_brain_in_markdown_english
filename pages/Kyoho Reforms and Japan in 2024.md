common feature
- Measures aimed at stabilizing the economy
    - In the Kyoho Reforms, [[Tokugawa Yoshimune]] implemented a policy of thrift and development of new rice paddies in order to rebuild public finances.
    - In Japan in 2024, economic policies to cope with a declining population and budget deficit are being discussed (digitalization, regional development, etc.).

- Use of new technologies and knowledge
    - During the Kyoho Reforms, sweet potato cultivation was promoted by [[Konyo Aoki]], and famine control measures were advanced.
    - In 2024, AI and DX (digital transformation) will be used to improve efficiency and solve problems in society.

- Response of the people's will
    - Yoshimune established a "[[comment box]]" to reflect the opinions of the general public in his policies.
    - In 2024, attempts are being made to develop policies using social networking and citizen participation platforms.

(points of) difference
- Issue Scale
    - The issues of the Kyoho period were regional and agriculture-centered issues such as shogunate finances and famine.
    - In 2024, Japan faces global challenges such as the global economy and climate change.

- Governance Structure
    - The Kyoho period was centrally ruled by the bakuhan system.
    - In 2024, under a democratic system, the diverse voices of local governments and citizens will be important.

- Evolution of Technology
    - The Kyoho period focuses on agricultural technology and logistical reforms.
    - In 2024, advanced technological innovations such as AI, biotechnology, and space exploration are underway.

generalize
While the Kyoho Reforms show respect for the will of the people and attempts to stabilize the economy, which are common in modern Japan, there are significant differences in terms of the scale of the task and the level of technology. A global perspective and the use of technology are more important for modern policies.
