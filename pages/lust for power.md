lust for power
Before civilization, [[strength]] and the possibility of living were tightly coupled.

- [[Lust for Life]]
lust for power

necessary
It stirs up a desire for strength beyond what is necessary.

competitive environment

Some religions seem to consider sports a form of warfare, which is undesirable, but they may have a point in that it stirs the desire for strength.

I'm reminded of [[will to power]] after writing this far

to be sorted out
- Desire to beat others
    - The power to win over others
- Desire not to be killed by natural threats
    - The Power to Win Threats
- Whether others are a threat

I thought when I was doing [[BeatSaber]].
- Where does the desire to compare scores with others and get the observation that we are better than others come from?
    - In the first place, the occurrence of the desire to "get the expected observation" is itself the cause [[of the pain of not getting what one seeks]].
- Isn't the scoring of actions a drug in itself, a poison that attracts and later torments people?
