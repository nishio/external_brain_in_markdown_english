Title is tentative.

Remembering Forgotten Projects
- Recalled by the symbol [[Scrapbox English translation]], but not [[Scrapbox]] or [[English translation]] in the first place
- I have a feeling that the data was put on GitHub relatively recently, but I'm not sure where that is.
    - I think we called it [[the external brain]].

- [[2024-09-08External brain GitHub work]]
- Last year?

After [[the Concept Map Study Group]], I feel that this system may have value beyond visualization of the contents of books.

- > This "external brain" was initially deployed on Scrapbox, but around 2024 the migration of the contents to GitHub was also considered and implemented. In fact, the Scrapbox diary of 2024-09-08 mentions "External Brain GitHub work," indicating that attempts to export and manage Scrapbox data had begun. The following year, the export from Scrapbox to Markdown began in earnest, and in May 2025, the repository "external_brain_in_markdown" containing all Scrapbox pages was published on GitHub. This allows the records of the external brain project to be converted and stored from Scrapbox to Markdown on GitHub (daily commit of "Scrapbox export" with automatic updates via GitHub Actions). Scrapbox itself will also be in 2025. The name of the service has been changed to **"Cosense "** (from Scrapbox's announcement), and Nishio has also tweaked the name of his own project, but the continuity in content is maintained.
- I see!
    - This is exactly what I should have remembered.

        - [[Put the current English translation of the external brain into GitHub.]]

This project has been in the works for a long time, and the terminology used has been mixed, as circumstances have changed in many ways.
- If the concept map can handle this well, very good.

- [[innumerable features (e.g. in a programming language)]] of the project

I'm very happy to spread my thought to non-Japanese readers.
