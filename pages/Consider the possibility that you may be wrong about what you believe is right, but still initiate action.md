Consider the possibility that you may be wrong about what you believe is right, but still initiate action


> To [[roti]]'s [[liberal ironism]] is a project to push religion into the private sphere, isn't it? Uno-san's idea may or may not be a little different.
>  Uno I think my understanding of [[pragmatism]] is different from [[irony]]. Putting beliefs in parentheses does not mean that they should be shoved into the private sphere. Rather, what I wanted to say in "Democracy-" is the importance of considering the possibility that you may be wrong about what you believe to be right, but still initiating action in your own practice. That's where I think I've gone a step further than in my previous book.
>  East That seems to have something to do with the interest in [[Tocqueville]].
>  Uno Tocqueville believed that in a democratic age, there is no longer a common religion that people can all believe in. Nevertheless, a situation in which everyone does not share any beliefs creates all sorts of difficulties. In this sense, it is still better to have a religion. However, I myself do not have a faith that I can believe in, and Tocqueville continued to worry about that. I think I may be projecting a bit of myself onto him.
