- [[Font Awesome]] icon can be specified for IconButton of [Material-UI
- The position of the help button has been repositioned.

When pasting Scrapbox content into Kozaneba, I want the image notation to be an image.
- However, when Kozaneba was created, "Scrapbox image = Gyazo", but after that, the Scrapbox side started to swing between Gyazo and Scrapbox Files in each project setting, so the design needs to be changed.
- I wasn't able to paste the image in the first place, even with a single URL paste, but that was relatively easy to fix.
- It would be nice if we could get this to work for multi-line imports as well.
