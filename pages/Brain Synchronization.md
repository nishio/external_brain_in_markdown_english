> [_daichikonno](https://x.com/_daichikonno/status/1142575124840714240) The paper shows that the brain activity of two mice during collaboration is naturally synchronized.
>  The surprise is that synchronized brain activity could predict future behavior.
>
>  This paper is "a brain that is not physically connected", but I would like to investigate what would happen if the brain were directly connected to the brain.
>  I am very excited about the possibilities of brain-brain coupling.
