title: "Those who oppose more choices."
---

- Why would anyone object to having more options for something they have already chosen?
- Some people see value in the "[[sense of security]]" of their choice being the overwhelming majority.
- When there is only one choice, the overwhelming majority choose the same one.
    - There are quite a few people who create choices.
- The more choices we have, the more we lose that sense of security.
    - Because you're confronted with, "You weren't in the majority, you were just given only one option."

context
- Seniors opposed to selective surnames
    - [70% in favor of selective married couples' surnames, deep-rooted value among older men that "other couples should have the same surname" - Lawyers.com](https://www.bengo4.com/c_23/n_12024/)
    - > What is unique is that when asked "disagree," the option "I prefer to have the same surname as married couples. Other married couples should also have the same family name. 14.4% of respondents chose this answer, more than any other generation or gender, with 20.5% of men in their 40s and 23.4% of men in their 50s.

I think there are probably more of them than you think, and they basically oppose any change that would be like "let's allow people to freely make multiple choices in this situation" because it would be confusing.

However, for them, it may be a problem to lose the "sense of security" that their choice is something like "the ironclad choice supported by the overwhelming majority".
