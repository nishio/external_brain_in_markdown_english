title: "The wise man should be self-sufficient."

from [[The Art of Worldly Wisdom]]
The wise man should be self-sufficient.
cxxxvii
The wise man should be self-sufficient.

He who was all of himself carried all with him when he carried himself. If the universal friend can represent to us Rome and the rest of the world, let man be his own universal friend, so that he is in a position to live alone. Who would such a man desire if he had no more lucid intellect or delicate taste than himself? Then he would be dependent on himself alone, which is the highest happiness and resembles the Supreme Being. A man who can live alone resembles a beast in nothing, a wise man in much, and a god in all.
