title: "What you can't do."
---

- It's important to know that [[I can't]], that I don't have [[the skill]] at this point.
- Better to know, of course, than not to know.

On the other hand, not having the skill "at [[the]] present time" is due to insufficient [[investment]] to acquire that skill in "[a past (i.e. a personal history)"
- [[You can't change the past.]]

So we should focus on what we need to do "[[present]]" to have that skill in "[[future tense]]".
- [[What to do now]].
