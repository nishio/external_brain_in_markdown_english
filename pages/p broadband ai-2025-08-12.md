What is a "Strong Opinion Group"?

- Demonstration of "This is what a strong opinion group is all about."

In the case of large data sets, there are 400 or so dense opinion displays, so it's essentially absurd to label them all.

Fixed aspect ratio issues

    - Much better.

- Well, this seems inherently impossible.

You can see this experimental version here.

We have been thinking about how to take advantage of this new view, and now
- Reporting Screen: Admin
- All Reports List Screen: Admin
- LISTED REPORTS LISTING SCREEN: Anyone
- Report Screen: Anyone
but I'm wondering if we need an "administrator's report screen"? I'm starting to get the feeling that we need an "admin report screen".
Switch between various views on the administrator's report screen, change default settings, etc., and then "publish with these settings".

It is not correct that a mouse hover on a cluster brings up a detailed description of each point of the components, but it is correct that a mouse hover on a cluster brings up the details of the cluster and a click on the cluster brings up a narrowed-down view of that cluster.
(but you will need to use the back button)

Because it is limited to two layers, it is necessary to divide the data into 20 labels in one layer when there are 10,000 data or so. Essentially, the upper limit of labels that can be drawn is determined by human cognitive ability, and it would be correct to increase the number of layers when there is a lot of data so as not to exceed that limit.

If you think about the usefulness of the smartphone view, the current system of presenting information in hover is fundamentally wrong to begin with.
Putting in the HOVER listener seems to be the cause of the performance degradation in the PC version as well.
Should it basically be in menu form when clicked or tapped?

Maybe the area map should be the first thing shown in the phone view?
Maybe even on PC (in the sense of reducing the initial waiting time).
