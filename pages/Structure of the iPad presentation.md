Composed of "[[Intellectual production techniques of engineers and physical education-type classes]]".
- Connecting AppleTV to a projector via HDMI
- Connect from iPad via AirPlay
    - Wireless connectivity will allow you to roam the venue as you please.
    - Do I have to be in the same wifi? I thought so, but there is no need to be in the same wifi, it seems to be shared via Bluetooth.
    - I prepared an adapter in case it doesn't work well and I need to use a direct cable connection.
- Presentations in Keynote for iPad
    - I thought about using Keynote or PDF files in Dropbox, but I couldn't figure out how to flip through them slide by slide.
        - It's turned into a scroll.
        - I seem to remember it being done before, but am I imagining things?
    - I thought what AirPlay could do was "mirroring the iPad screen", but you can use the presenter tool normally.
- Search within a book in Dropbox
    - I have a PDF of "The Engineer's Guide to Intellectual Production" on my Dropbox.
    - I downloaded it locally and opened it.
    - Searchable by content
- (web) browser
    - Keep extra tabs closed.
    - Scrapbox was opened in advance.
- Timer (standard)
    - For sinking time measurement
- Handwritten notes with Notability
- Internet connection tethered by iPhone.
- Recorded with an iPhone voice memo in the breast pocket
