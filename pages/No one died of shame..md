["No one has ever died of shame" Euglena Izumo Mitsuru Izumo stresses that startups must "speak up first" : Asahi Shimbun GLOBE+](https://globe.asahi.com/article/14961679?fbclid=IwAR0vm30sFg4jIxUOur23bp5hn2HHvlNiMHmFDE7BeUxN3NS3xrSj8wLBrKM)
> Well, it would be very uncool if we were saying this and Green Beetle failed, wouldn't it? It would be really uncool, really embarrassing. But, you know, it's really embarrassing, but it doesn't mean I'm going to die.
>
>  What I am trying to say is that being embarrassed is something big, and being ridiculed when you make a mistake is not as big a deal as you might think.
>
>  By the time you get to the next day, you don't even remember what the greenbulb was. If you say something big and make a mistake, people don't remember that at all, and [[only he/she]] feels embarrassed.
>
>  I am confident in this, because I have been really embarrassed by Midori Mushi, but I don't know any of my friends who say they died of embarrassment (laughs).

>  If you have a desire to create this kind of society, you should not say so until you have raised, say, 140 billion yen, but rather, "Let's create this kind of society together. If you have an opportunity to say something like, "Let's build this kind of society together," you should say it as often as you can. I want you to speak out with an open mind, not with the fear of having your ideas stolen.
- [[It's not "I'll tell you when it's done."]]
- [[Not "What if someone steals my idea?"]]
