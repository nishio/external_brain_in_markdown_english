    - [People who don't need to be persuaded.
        - It's [[tautology]]-ish, but I thought [[Dare to write the obvious]] was important, so I wrote it.
        - I changed it to "don't try to convince people you don't need to convince."
        - A little less tautological.
    - [[natural]] And yet we often forget.
- When others have an opinion that differs from one's own, one often feels as if one has to convince them of it.
- Others are often "[People who don't need to be persuaded.

- If others have [[different opinions]] from you, it often "doesn't matter".
- If someone has an opinion that differs from yours, it does not mean that you have been denied the right to hold that opinion.
- There is no need to feel as if your existence is threatened and to be defensive.
    - Related: [[Dissent does not exist.]] / [[Not defensive in online discussions]].

- Don't spend money on trying to convince people who don't matter.
    - The cost should be spent on persuading a very small percentage of "those who need to be persuaded".
    - What determines if someone needs to be persuaded or not?
    - It is whether or not the person's opinion will affect the probability and timing of achieving the [[Target]] that you want to achieve.

- When is persuasion necessary?
- > It is whether the person's opinion will affect the probability of achieving the [[Target]] that you want to achieve and the timeframe for achieving it.
- It's when they have [[Rare resources]] that they need to achieve what they want to achieve, and they need you to provide it for them.
- I've been using the word "persuasion," but I think I'd have a broader perspective if I thought of it as "[[negotiations]]."
    - Not only by verbal persuasion, but also by [[exchanging]] resources that we can provide, or by pointing a weapon at them and threatening them.
        - Threatening to put up a weapon is an exchange for "safety"; it does not have to be you who threatens your safety; there is also "I will protect you from outside enemies." [[interchange format B]].
