Super summary below:
- Academia tends to reward "popularity/narrative" over "correctness," slowing progress.
- As an alternative, we propose "idea futures (prediction markets)": researchers and anyone else interested bet on scientific propositions, treating prices (odds) as de facto expert consensus. Betting incentivizes caution and honesty.

The framework of the mechanism
1. define mutually exclusive claim sets (questions) and issue and buy and sell conditional assets such as "X if A".
2. at the time of liquidation, the agreed-upon judges will make a percentage decision (e.g., 98% for A).
3. the cost of judgment is covered in advance by a small dilution of assets, and any shortfall is made up by an "audit lottery".
4. an "appeals market" to be reviewed at a later date in a separate trial, and an economic incentive to the integrity of the referee.
5. publicly register transaction history and calculate reputation scores based on performance.

Assumed scenario
- Continental migration theory: the market records and reflects in prices according to the basis of the minority theory, and is rewarded with a later correction.
- Room temperature fusion: market prices are a more aggregate progress indicator than news reports.
- Neutrino mass: Funds are allocated in the form of grants for "which questions" rather than "to whom".
- Toxic peanut butter: corporate manipulation of information is countered by skilled investors in the market.

Possible Objections and Responses (excerpts)
- Illegality/gambling criticism: legal quota in the UK, even zero-sum, with social value of price information and risk transfer.
- Thin market and lack of interest: build thickness with automatic market makers and subsidies.
- Judgmental ambiguity/unconvergent beliefs: managed by wording, unjudged options, and due date design.
- Wealthy influence: the market is not a "vote" but an act of risk-taking - if you are reckless, you lose your money.
- Moral hazard: Natural science-centered and high-risk propositions are restricted.
- Rumor and advertising manipulation: Prices are driven by skilled workers; misinformation is reflected in grades and eliminated.

Implementation Strategies
- Start small, running alongside existing systems (in the UK, starting with areas that are easy to judge).
- Trial with reputation game version without money → Demonstration of predictive power → Expansion with grants.

Expected Benefits
- Direct incentives that reward "accuracy" over "popularity."
- Consistent visible consensus supports policy decisions.
- Research funds are attached to "questions," not to "people," so a variety of methods can be tried.
- Price integrates a wide range of knowledge including different fields and amateurs.
- Function as an insurance policy (hedge) against technological risk and as a reputational indicator for researchers and institutions.
In short: a blueprint to marketize science decision-making and increase the speed of integrity and convergence by making betting prices the motive and the record - a blueprint.
