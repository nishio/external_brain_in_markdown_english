> [kamo_hiroyasu](https://x.com/kamo_hiroyasu/status/1838786502635196548) "Don't confuse [[early ripening]] with [[genius]]. On the side of those who have trouble understanding that "the vast majority of precocious children are not particularly geniuses", the use of the word "[[gifted]]" is sometimes annoying in itself.

> [kamo_hiroyasu](https://x.com/kamo_hiroyasu/status/1838978113629524235) We are trying to alleviate the inconvenience and disadvantage that precocious children suffer because of their precociousness, but some people will say, "He's a genius, he can handle it by himself. It is extremely annoying. It is extremely annoying.

> [kamo_hiroyasu](https://x.com/kamo_hiroyasu/status/1839169255889109387) I'm also annoyed by the prejudice that "precocious children are not good". The majority of [[precocious]] children are not geniuses." The majority of [[late-]]mature children are also not geniuses. The majority of children who are neither are also not geniuses" just.
