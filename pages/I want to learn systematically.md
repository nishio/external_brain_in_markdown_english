title: "I want to learn systematically"

What does "[[systematic]]" mean when people say they want to "learn systematically"?

- To include all the necessary knowledge without omission?
        - [[exhaustive]]
- That the development of the explanation can be understood if one has a proper understanding of "what was explained before there"?
        - [[No leaps and bounds.]]

Aside from whether an exhaustive, leap-free education is realistically possible, would you really be happy if it were offered? It would be quite a time investment, though.
