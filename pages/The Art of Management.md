title: "The Art of Management"

- The [[main point]] of management is "to understand and respond to customers' [[needs]].
- It's nothing new, [[natural]].
- But there are many people who talk about new "tricks" because there are customers in the world who want to be taught new "tricks.

- It's like dieting.
    - Serious exercise or reducing excess calories is "the norm."
    - People who don't want to do it seek "new ways," and "new ways" are invented and offered in response.

- If you want to learn efficiently, you should first ignore all such "stupid customer media" information.
