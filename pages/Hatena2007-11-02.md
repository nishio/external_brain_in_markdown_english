*1193966950*I'm not feeling well.
Ahhh, cold...

*1193969844*Drugs

*1193975845* How to write org.
If we call the time it takes for the sun to circle the galaxy one ginga, I have only a few milligingas left in which to be active. Therefore, the system should not be a system that cannot rotate without my movement. It must be a system that continues to work even when I am gone.

Mm-hmm.
Let's go to another dentist...
