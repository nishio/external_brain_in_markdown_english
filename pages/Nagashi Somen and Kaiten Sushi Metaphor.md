- Only low-quality leftovers flow downstream.
- Nothing flows further downstream.

relevance
    - [[Opportunities are limited resources]]
    - [[Shoeshine boy]]

[[Kaitenzushi]]
- Good food is eaten by those upstream, and what is left goes around.
- What goes around again and again gradually loses its freshness.
- In the feeling of taking what is there, you get something of lesser quality.
- If you order explicitly, a new one will be delivered to you.
