title: "🔁The times make it impossible to forget the deceased"
---

Case in point: [[a tweet from 12 years ago is circulating now]].
- A casual post on a social networking site is still out there 12 years later.
- Assuming he was dead right after this tweet, the "dead person's post will be seen again 12 years later" will happen.
- In the past, when most communication was voice, the "death of the output subject" was the end of the story because it was something that would disappear as soon as you were not there when the output took place
- Writing was created and what was written could be read after death.
    - But the cost of keeping the letters was so high that they were ignored by the general public.
- The cost of keeping the letters, and the cost of others to distribute the letters that are left behind, has decreased dramatically over the past few decades.
- Even if you don't want to remember, you can't reduce the probability of seeing the most circulated information and remembering it to zero.
    - The cost of going to zero is rising.

.
The notebook and the "fighting the past" fragment are related in terms of the influence of past memories and experiences on the present. The "forgetting more than we realize" fragment is also related in terms of the theme of the imperfection of human memory.

### deep thinking
This note emphasizes the psychological aspect of human beings that past memories and experiences influence present actions and thoughts. At the same time, however, it also shows the importance of dialogue with our past selves and self-understanding.
