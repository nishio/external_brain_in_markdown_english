title: "Do not persuade people who are not your intended target"
---

Suppose you create a product and present it to the audience, and the audience says that they do not feel the product has value.

If that audience is not your intended target, don't bother.
I don't even have to explain what it's worth.
The effort to explain value should be used for the intended target.

When Gunosy came to Unexplored, I tried it out and didn't really feel like continuing to use it. However, Gunosy was successful after that. I just wasn't the intended target.
Gunosy was observing the behavior of their intended target audience and improving their products based on the data. There was no value in the opinions of people who were not their intended target.

This experience helped me understand that I was not the intended target when Telorain came unexplored.
