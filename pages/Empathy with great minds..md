Empathy with great minds.

Empathy with great minds.

- It is a heroic quality to identify with [[hero]]. It is like a natural miracle of mystery and exploitation. It is a natural intimacy of mind and heart. Its effect is such that vulgar ignorance sniffs out witchcraft. Respect is born, favor is born, which sometimes reaches affection. It persuades without words, it acquires without earning. This sympathy is sometimes active, sometimes passive, but both are equally happy, and the more so, the more sublime. Recognizing, discerning, and utilizing this gift is a great art. No energy is sufficient without the beneficence of nature.
