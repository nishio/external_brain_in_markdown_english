title: "Ignorance is a resource"

> [0xfene](https://x.com/0xfene/status/1822200742762938634) I felt somewhat sorry to consult with senior managers because I was inexperienced and had nothing to give.
>
>  Then, from a senior manager,
>
>  "Don't worry about being young, it's worth it."
>
>  I was so impressed with what I was told. I then decided to use my youth to rely on my seniors.
>
>  Probably not worth it,
>
>  ・Only young people know the information.
>  ・Potential to grow and GIVE in the future
>  ・ While consulting, the senior's own brain is also reorganized.
>
>  I wondered if it was something like that, but I think it was probably just something kindly said to make it easier for me to ask for advice. I suddenly felt grateful for the entrepreneurial ecosystem that genuinely gives without thinking.


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1822200742762938634) I thought that before this young and not so young, "ignorance is a resource" in the first place. [Knowledge produces bias, but [[unlearning is many times more difficult than learning]]. So [[ignorance has value]]. Ignorance is common, but the reaction only occurs where [[ignorance and knowledge make contact]], so [[ignorance approaching the interface has scarcity value]].


> [terfno_mai](https://x.com/terfno_mai/status/1822275980008067201) Only ignorance that can be changed from "ignorant state to having knowledge" would be a resource.
> [terfno_mai](https://x.com/terfno_mai/status/1822275982952202752) No matter how much less costly than unrarn, unrarn is not free either. I think this takes practice. You can't use your ignorance as a resource by just keeping ignorant all the time.
> [terfno_mai](https://x.com/terfno_mai/status/1822275985691045957) of a person who is constantly practicing to change to a state of knowledge = larn about any and all areas of which he or she is ignorant. Ignorance is a resource.
