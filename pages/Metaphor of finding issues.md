- Many people don't have the experience of discovery, but I'm not sure they would get the analogy to discovery.

- Many people are thinking, "This is not good..." but what exactly is wrong with it [[verbalizing]] Take time to verbalize what is not done.
- This is what is required before the "[[Issue Resolution]]" phase
- It's never "just something you come up with by accident."

    - [[Maybe "discover" is not the right word.]]
