- [[Identity Design]] of [[Cybozu Live]]: Comparison with [[Discord]] from the viewpoint of [separatism

# What is splinterism - people have more than one personality for each situation
The concept of "### [alter-personalism
" as discussed in modern philosophy and thought is the idea that within a single person there are different personalities (alter-persons) for different relationships and situations (1).
The traditional view of the "individual" tends to focus on the "one true self" that cannot be changed, but the concept of "bifurcationism" changes this idea. People have different faces depending on their environment, such as work, family, and friendships, and all of these multiple personalities are considered to be the ### "true self"
.
In other words, people naturally behave and show different personalities depending on the situation, and this in itself is not a false identity such as "wearing a mask," but is the true self in all cases. This perspective ### each person lives multiple selves (personas)
 affirms the identity of each role, such as "hobby self" or "work self.

# How Cybozu Live works - designed to use different profiles for different groups
[[Cybozu Live]]] anticipated this concept of "ego-oriented" identity design, and with the "### [Multi-profile
" feature added in the 2010 update, users could register multiple profile information and show them to other users or groups, such as "for work" or "for private use" (2) (2)

Below is a summary of the main challenges with Discord's single account design: 1.

- Identity exposure problem between different communities: Since profile information is shared between servers, it is easy for people to be exposed as the same person even in places where they do not normally interact, such as the hobby and work communities (6) As a result, users are more careful about what they say and how they disclose themselves, making it harder to reveal their true selves (a contextual conflict).
- Complexity of operating multiple accounts: Identity theft effectively requires the use of separate accounts, which makes it time-consuming to switch and manage logins (6) Discord has recently begun to provide an account switching function, but users still have the burden of creating and maintaining multiple accounts themselves. (6) Discord has recently started to offer an account switching function, but users still have the burden of creating and maintaining multiple accounts by themselves.

Thus, Discord's ### structure that traverses all communities with one unified identity
 is designed to make it difficult to separate private and public, hobbies and work, etc. ### It is difficult to separate personalities
. As a result, it is difficult to play different identities in each community, and users are forced to defend themselves by creating anonymous accounts when necessary.

# Cybozu Live's foresight - Thinking through modern identity management
Cybozu Live's multi-profile design was ### extremely visionary
 in light of today's trends in identity management. The need to use multiple faces, one for work and one for pleasure, is becoming more and more apparent today. In the business chat area, for example, Slack uses a design with separate profiles for each workspace, which has been pointed out as a major difference from Discord (6) Slack allows users to change their display name and profile for Company A and Company B, allowing a single (6) Slack allows users to change their display names and profiles for Company A and Company B. It is as if a single user has a separate identity for each workplace. Furthermore, even in the general use of social networking services, the use of multiple accounts is becoming the norm. According to one survey, more than 60% of people in their teens to 60s have multiple accounts on social networking services, with 96% of people in their 20s having a back-up account (7). (7) This indicates that ### people are in reality active in separate identities for different communities and purposes

Looking back under these circumstances, Cybozu Live's design that allowed users to switch profiles on a group basis from the beginning was truly anticipating modern needs. Users could have multiple personas under a single account and use them according to their relationships, thus enabling ### both privacy and self-expression without the burden of adding more accounts
. This is also a practice of the concept of "not wearing one mask in all situations, but accepting each situation as one's true self" (1) Cybozu Live, so to speak, provided a platform for each user to ### digitally manage multiple alter egos within themselves and switch between them depending on the situation
. (1) Cybozu Live provided a platform for each user to [* digitally manage multiple alter egos within themselves and switch between them depending on the situation.

### In conclusion, Cybozu Live's identity design was unusual at the time in affirming the multifaceted personalities of its users, and was a progressive attempt to avoid the "context collapse" that is a problem today
. A system that allows each community to have its own alter ego, rather than a centralized identity as in Discord, contributes greatly to the psychological safety and privacy protection of users. This concept is gradually becoming more important in modern service design, and Cybozu Live was very unique and significant in that it was implemented about 10 years ago. (2) (4)
