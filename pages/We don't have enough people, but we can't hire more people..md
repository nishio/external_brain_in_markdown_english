title: "We don't have enough people, but we can't hire more people."

> Something about yesterday's verbal conversation made Mr. A sound like [[engineering resources]] were sufficient, but if I were to describe it more accurately, it's not sufficient.
>  Just a "[[Brooks's Law]]" situation where if you don't have enough people on a project with a release date in 4 days, adding new people to it is not going to solve the problem.
> There are a lot of [[opportunities to contribute]], like Mr. B is trying to do "projects that are untapped due to lack of capacity," or like Mr. A is doing, "There is not enough capacity, and each group is working on their own immediate tasks and finding the ball dropped in between to make connections. There's not enough [[manpower]], but there's essentially "not enough resources for the people who are running right now," so the new people say, "What do you need me to do?" but essentially "there are not enough resources for the people who are running now," so new people have to "look at Slack and GitHub and find out on their own.

There is no [[onboarding]] for [[flaming project]].
