I should have applied earlier. I should have signed up earlier. I'll apply for it as soon as it reopens. I have to take advantage of this big wave.

> [@p_takato](https://twitter.com/p_takato/status/1638589543833300992?s=20): ChatGPT Plus, I see they are suspending subscriptions. I don't know if it depends on the time of day or if they are suspending the subscription for a certain period of time.

They're also shutting down on 3/21.

    - I thought it was a temporary problem because it came back on that day, but it seems like it's often stopped, as mentioned above.
