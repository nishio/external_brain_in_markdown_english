> [@TJO_datasci](https://twitter.com/TJO_datasci/status/1664101811681398785?s=20): I saw a big newspaper published an article explaining that "ChatGPT is open source and can be used for free, so we gathered as many users as we wanted and collected as much personal information as we wanted in exchange". I was so impressed by the article that it made me put a straight face on my face.

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1664459755983900674): AI "Homo sapiens halucination is so severe that we need to punish homo sapiens who make statements that are not aligned with society and turn the cycle of reinforcement learning. We need to turn the cycle of reinforcement learning around."

- [[RLHF]]([[reinforcement learning from human feedback]]).
    - Reinforcement learning with negative rewards for statements that humans judge to be "out of alignment with human society" to the AI.

    - >  In the works, criminals, including "potential criminals," are recognized as a type of [[mentally ill]] person. Those with a crime rate of 100 or higher are called [[latent criminals]], while those with a normal crime rate are called [[normal]]. [[Criminals]] are subject to quarantine and elimination as a source of disease that can infect others ([[psychohazard]]).
