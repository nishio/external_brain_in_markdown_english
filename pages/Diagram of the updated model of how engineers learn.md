title: "Diagram of the updated model of how engineers learn"
---

2019-04-13
- In [[How engineers learn]], there is a diagram "Execute, verify results, [[Cycle in which the model is modified]]."
I drew it because I might be able to draw it better now that I have an iPad.

- First, I think, "I'd like an A."
    - For example, "I want to create software with a certain function X" or "I want to eat fried eggs.
- Think "How can I get A?"(HOW)
- Think, "If I combine B and C, I might get A."

    - Like, "If you put a frying pan on the stove top and put an egg in it, it's going to be a fried egg."
    - Model M produces this
- I'll actually try it.
- I expected to get an A and I got a D.
    - be surprised

    - We now have the observed fact that "combining B and C gives us D, not A."
    - It's hard to tell that this says "Do" (2025-04-16)
- Consider why D instead of A (why)
    - Model M, which generated the hypothesis that "if you combine B and C, you get A," is wrong.
    - Modify model M (M')
        - One thing that was in the 2014 figure but not depicted here is that this correction is a "Why did this happen?" to "Isn't this what caused this?" (2025-04-16).

- Using the new model M', we again ask, "How can we get A?" (how).
    - 'Wouldn't it be nice to combine the B's and G's?' and so on.
    - I'll actually try it.

Q: What is [[model]]?
- A model is an [[emulator]].
    - [[The model is a reality emulator]]

Postscript (2025-04-16)
- To add something that was not clearly stated, this "model" is a "[[set of]] hypotheses," and the certainty of the hypotheses gradually increases as one acts on the hypotheses and they turn out as expected.
    - [[A model is a set of hypotheses.]]
    - [[Knowledge must be validated by action.]]
