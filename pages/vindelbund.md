> Wilhelm Windelband (May 11, 1848 - October 22, 1915) was a German philosopher. He was a professor at the University of Heidelberg and a representative of the neo-Kantian school.

> I have also devoted efforts to the problem of drawing the line between [[natural science]] and [[cultur]] (also called [[mental science]]). Natural science uses a [[law-abiding]] ([[nomothetisch]]) method. That is, natural science describes its subject through [[law]], [[fitting into any situation]]. In contrast, the [[cultur]], which is concerned with the [[one-time only]], the [[individual]], and the particular, uses an [[individual descriptive]] ([[idiographisch]]) method.
