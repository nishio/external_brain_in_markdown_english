- [[Aesop's Fables]]
The story of the fox who wanted to take the grapes but couldn't and said [[poor loser]], "They must be sour grapes.

I consider myself [[what was not obtained]] to be [[worthlessness]].

The opposite of "[[The fish that got away is always bigger]]" and perceives the unobtainable as smaller.

- [[cognitive dissonance]]
[Sour grapes - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%99%E3%81%A3%E3%81%B1%E3%81%84%E8%91%A1%E8%90%84)

Sometimes you actually eat it and it tastes sour.
- There is a way to tell the difference between sour grapes and sweet grapes, but if you don't know how to do it
    - Sour grapes are left where they are easy to get.
    - If you eat the grapes where they are easy to get, they are sour.
    - This is a member of the "[[Deteriorated copies spread]]" crowd.
- Knowledge can sweeten the pot, but we don't know it.
        - [[Dried astringent persimmons]] Like that.
        - > The sugar content of sweet persimmons (persimmons that are not astringent) is around 16 degrees, but [[astringent persimmon]] has a sugar content of around 20 degrees. When this astringent persimmon is dried, the astringency and water are removed, and the sugar content reaches as high as 50 degrees.
            - [Why choose Shibu persimmons for dried persimmons? They actually have a higher sugar content than sweet persimmons - WeatherNews](https://weathernews.jp/s/topics/201910/170125/amp.html)
        - Everyone is happily picking persimmons, so I picked some myself, ate them straight away and said, "Astringent!" I picked a persimmon myself and ate it as it was.
