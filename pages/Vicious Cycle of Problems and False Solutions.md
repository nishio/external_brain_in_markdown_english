- [[Problem Solving Compendium]]  p.389
    - [[pseudo-resolution]]
        - The act of trying to solve a [[question (e.g. on a test)]] and instead reproducing the problem.

- situation
    - Something problem X is continuing.
    - I'm doing solution Y over and over to solve the problem.
- explanation
    - I did Y, but X continues."
        - From this observed fact, it is obvious that Y is not the correct solution (Y is a false solution)
        - but for some reason, some people keep repeating Y as if it were a solution.
                - [[Insanity of doing the same thing over and over again and hoping for a different result.]]
    - If this Y reproduces X, [[vicious circle]] occurs
