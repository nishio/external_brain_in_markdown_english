- Make 100 sticky notes of what you find [[interesting]] and do [[KJ method]].
    - [[Tomoya Tachikawa]] wanted to give it a try, and it sounded like fun, so I gave it a try.
    - This is interesting in itself.

- This is good KJ method training.
    - From the beginning [[subjective]], it was, "Please write a sticky note about something you find interesting."
        - Avoid the bad pattern of "collecting objective facts and classifying them according to objective classification criteria."
    - It's less painful to keep thinking about what you find interesting.
    - I also enjoy talking to others about the content of the group.
    - The listener can also listen without refuting the story because it is subjective to begin with, "What do I find interesting?

- I found [[human bug]] interesting in this process.
    - Why is that?
        - Because once the bugs are identified, they can be upgraded by patching against them.
- The first appearance of the term "human bug" on this Scrapbox is a note from Pixiv's Mr. Koga during his talk at a Scrapbox event
