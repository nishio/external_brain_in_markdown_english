### digest
.
Specters are beings that are active even when humans do nothing, and friendly ones can be allowed to live in homes. Their usefulness or harmfulness depends on how people perceive them. Specters do not exist to serve humans, they just live.

### Relation to related fragments
.
The relevance of the "hacker's will" AI-ization trigger fragment is that the concept of yokai suggests a relationship between AI and humans. The notion that yokai are not beings that serve humans, but merely live, is consistent with the viewpoint that AI should not be seen as a replacement for humans, but as beings that coexist with humans.

### deep thinking
Applying the concept of yokai to AI can suggest a new relationship between AI and humans; AI should not be seen as a replacement for humans, but as an entity that coexists with humans.

### title of thought
.
"Coexistence of AI and Humans from the Specter's Perspective."

### Summary of notes
.
In the "Hacker's Testament" note on AI-ization, AI is portrayed as a self-activating entity rather than one that follows human instructions. It also states that AI can coexist with humans if it is friendly, and that its benefit or detriment depends on how humans perceive it.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The "hacker's will" AI-ization and "no human needs to pull the trigger" are related in terms of AI being a self-activating entity. Also, "Sage in the Age of AI Presence" is related to the Notebook's portrayal of AI in terms of AI providing answers that are preferred by humans.

### deep thinking
We feel that we need to think deeply about the evolution of AI and its relationship with humans, from the perspective that AI's self-activity and how humans perceive it determines whether AI is beneficial or detrimental.

### summary of thoughts and title
.
