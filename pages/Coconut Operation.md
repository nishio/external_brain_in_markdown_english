> Operation Yashinomi is an activity to drop politicians who do not promote [[(system of) selective marital separation]] or [[same-sex marriage]] as if they were palm trees, with the result that the number of politicians in favor of the system will increase and the system will be realized as soon as possible.
>
>  Same surname for married couples is great. Separate surnames for married couples are also great.
>  Heterosexual marriage is great. Same-sex marriage is great.
>
>  Operation Yashinomi will list the politicians who do not agree with us and lead them to be voted out of office; please use social networking sites to spread the word and reach a wider audience.
>
>  Sometimes young people tell me that they don't know who to vote for. When this happens, you might consider voting for a candidate other than the one who should not be elected. Selective surnames and same-sex marriage are commonplace themes for young people. I would like to see more politicians who are willing to promote them.

> *Note*.
>  This page contains "Notes on election campaigning and campaigning for election using websites, etc." and states that "Activities purely for the purpose of not getting elected (so-called "campaigning for election") do not constitute election campaigning, but campaigning for election for election conducted for the purpose of getting another candidate elected does constitute election campaigning. Since Operation Yashinomi uses the Internet to freely conduct its activities, we will limit our activities to "trying to unseat someone" rather than "trying to get someone elected. Please keep this in mind.
