Villagers who stay and those who move
There's about three patterns to the people who move.
- A: [[Tourist]].
- B:  [[trader]]
- C: [[hunter]].

Until now, expressions such as "[[traveler]]" have not clearly distinguished between A and B.
- Is the purpose of the person to see something new?
- Is the goal to make a profit by bringing something from Village B that is new OR lacking for the villagers in Village A?

Books are like cartoons that have been penciled in and Cosense notes are like rough pencil drawings

The prototype is almost complete. They plan to solicit people who want the game through crowdfunding.

Some people have special resources.
- For those who don't have access to that resource, it's not even on the brain as an option.


When talking to another person, the listener does not know the information network that the speaker knows, so the listener does not know the information network that the speaker knows.
- The first chunk of information network we talked about makes the decision.
- If you're a person who's extremely patient and listens until the other person is done talking, you might be able to give them enough information.
    - The average person does not.

It's interesting because it depends on the topic where the other party decides it's a lump and reacts.
- They only reject quickly for certain keywords.
    - Phenomena observed by more than one person
- Negative reaction to "board games, crowdfunding."
