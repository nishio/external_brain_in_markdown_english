title: "The trap of representing a Venn diagram as a circle"
---

- [[Venn diagram]] is a notation for [[overlap]] of [set
Since there is no constraint that the boundary of a set be circular, drawing a round line is [[The bias of easy drawing]].
Drawing with round lines adds restrictions to the expression that did not originally exist.

Like the diagram of [[IKIGAI]].

When C expands, point P, which is A and B, is a single point and retracts, so it may seem that it will contact A or B alone first, but this is a phenomenon that arises from the restriction that the boundary of the set is circular.

This is what happens when P is drawn with a wide area instead of a point.

Which perception is more appropriate depends on the contrast, but it is [[bias]] to be biased toward one or the other.
