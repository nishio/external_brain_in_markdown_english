1. panel overview
- speaker
    - Ryota Kanai (Araya, AI Startup / AI Alignment Network)
    - Jimmy Chan (fabd)
    - [[Cui Jia Wei]] (related to gov and Taiwan, V-Taiwan)
- theme
    - Toward Better Artificial Systems: from Governance to AI."
    - Democratic use and governance of AI, technological and social risks, and initiatives in each country and organization were discussed.

2. the V-Taiwan initiative (Mr. Cui Jia Wei)
- V-Taiwan Features
    - Emphasis on people-centered and citizen participation
    - Open and transparent proceedings and records (published on the web)
    - Progressive use of technology tools (both online and offline)
- Four Stages
    - Proposal stage: Citizens and government submit issues, stakeholders and issues
    - Online Opinion Gathering: Gathering a wide range of opinions from stakeholders
    - Face-to-face deliberations: Hybrid format (live streaming + face-to-face discussions)
    - Consensus building/implementation: recommendations to the government and legislation
- track record
    - Won OpenAI Grants and collaborated with Chatham House
    - Civic Assembly on AI with diverse participants (engineers, lawyers, journalists, indigenous peoples, gender groups, politicians, etc.)
    - Publish reports of consensus reached on citizen participation (clustering opinions collected with AI tools)
- Main Implications
    - Balancing expertise and plurality: the importance of argument design
    - People-centered or technology-centered: Need to reconsider, including means to close the digital gap
    - Wary of concentration of big business and government power: How citizens, non-profit organizations, DAOs, etc. can be empowered is key.

AI Alignment Network (Mr. Ryota Kanai)
- What is AI Alignment?
    - Research and activities to "enable AI to act in accordance with human values and objectives
    - Misaligned goal setting and evaluation metrics for large-scale AI (sophisticated models) may adversely affect society in unforeseen ways
    - Developers, researchers, and society must work together to build consensus
- issue
    - Risk of monopolization amid accelerated development competition (led by giant corporations and specific states)
    - Multinational and cross-cultural "differences in values" and "differences in ethical standards."
- Direction of Efforts
    - Promote research and discussion not only in Japan, but also in cooperation with Taiwan, Europe, and the United States
    - Addresses both technical issues (e.g., how to understand the inner workings of black-boxed models) and social design issues (democratic control)

4. perspective from fabd (Mr. Jimmy Chan)
- Sharing the concept of "[singularity
    - AI evolution is exponential, human thinking is linear â†’ Irreversible balance of power shift can occur
- Importance of Objective Function
    - The setting of the "objective/goal" itself, which AI executes, determines its impact on society.
    - A consensus building process is needed to determine who will represent how objectives will be set
- Relationship with [[DAO]] and [[DCC]] (Decentralized Cooperative/Collective)
    - To avoid centralization of technology and power, it is important to have a system that allows more individuals and organizations to operate technology in a shared and decentralized manner
    - In addition to large-scale models, small-scale and specialized models can be treated as "public goods," and an approach to interconnecting them can be considered.

5. axis of conflict between large corporations/government and open source
- Meta's open source policy vs. closed OpenAI
    - Meta's policy is to open up large scale models and encourage community-driven improvements
    - OpenAI offers services for users while setting out to be closed to ensure security.
- European regulations (DMA, etc.)
    - Legal requirement for interoperability of platforms and AI models to prevent monopolies
    - Risk diversification and democratic control through "audit and disclosure requests" by the government
- What individuals can do
    - Lobbying (policy advocacy)
    - Organize and utilize their own specific data (e.g., creating glossaries of terminology in their field of expertise)
    - Trial of open source and P2P technologies

6. general summary
- Democratic and decentralized AI governance is key
    - The case study (V-Taiwan) is a useful model for involving diverse stakeholders and deepening discussions through both online and offline methods.
    - Efforts to balance technical and ethical aspects, such as the work of the AI Alignment Network, are important.
- Countering the risk of large corporate and government monopolies
    - Open sourcing, interoperability, and policy audits are leading approaches
    - Empowerment through new organizational forms such as DAOs and DCCs
- Objective Function Setting (Objective Function) / Shared Values
    - As AI becomes more sophisticated, human "consensus-building processes" and "ways of reflecting values" will become increasingly important.
    - Need to expand social and political consensus building beyond technology development
