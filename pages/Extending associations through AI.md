title: "Extending associations through AI"

[[HyDE]] generates AI responses to questions
- The finding that even if this is wrong, it is more useful than a vector search on the question itself

- The [[Conflict Resolution Diagram]] traces back to the first opinion expressed and what the requirements are.
- This can be brainstormed by AI.

- [[Listen to the problem, not the solution.]]

- [[Cumulative effect of ideas]]
- Ideas come from a collection of concrete data.
    - This is the same as AI making associations from a set of concrete user inputs
    - Associations can be controlled by prompts.
        - You can generate an answer to something that is a question.
        - You can generate requirements for what is an opinion.
        - You can generate a problem for something that is a solution.
        - You can generate solutions to what is a problem.
    - They don't have to be right.
        - It's just an association.
    - It doesn't have to be a one-to-one correspondence.
        - Can be zero or more than one.
- If there is a commonality between the "ideas" created in this way, it is "[[Achievement of inclusiveness]]".

A and B are connected by the similarity of association X from A and association X' from B
    - [[associative connection]]
