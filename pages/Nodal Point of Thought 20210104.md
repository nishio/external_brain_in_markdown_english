I started working on it after first putting up sticky notes that said "Activities for 2020" and "Things to do in 2021," which is a typical "mistake of categorizing [[top down]]."
It is not right to form a group from the beginning in the form of "what to do in 2021" because a network/tree grows up by organizing 2020 activities and new things to do exist in scattered places as shoots of that tree.
(time line of clear [[verbalizing]] shoots and then plucking them and arranging them).

- [[The network of information is initially a tree]]
