title: "People who pretend to have"
---

- There is person A who pretends to have X when he really doesn't.
- Person B, who does not have X, cannot identify whether A really has X or not

For example.
- Some people don't know much about cryptocurrencies but pretend they do.
- Some people pretend to be rich when they don't have money.
- Some people pretend to be smart when they are not.
- Some people pretend to be popular when they are not.

- Socially harmful because when people who don't understand X want to understand X, they are confused if they listen to "people who don't understand X but pretend they do"
- In some cases, you may not even realize that you don't really have X.
    - Mr. A says something random, "X is YYYY," and the serious Mr. B takes it seriously and believes it, saying, "I see, X is YYY, and Mr. A, who knows a lot about it, told me so, so he must be right.
- I think we should adhere to the principle of "[[Knowledge must be validated by practice]]" when it comes to knowledge.
