title: "The strategic process is a dialectical political process"
---

[[MOT Knowledge Creation Management and Innovation]] [[Ikujiro Nonaka]] p.43-44
> The strategic process is [[dynamic]], [[chaotic]] and [[inconsistency]]. The methodology required in such a situation is not one of passive adaptation without reason or passive compromise with logical dichotomies, but [[dialectics]] that extracts [[dynamic order that nullifies dichotomies]] and [[practical sublimation of contradictions]]. Contradiction is an everyday occurrence, and it is [[phronesis]] with [[practical syllogism]] that keeps its direction by chaining the best intellectual performance toward the good in each case. It is [[practical reason]] that mediates the particular and the universal with a small premise (medium range), and it is exercised tirelessly.
> In reality, this process is a [[political process]] that realizes goals through [[social interaction]] with others, and the basis of this process is [[political judgment]]. Political judgment is exercised through understanding the feelings of others in everyday verbal and non-verbal communication, empathy, perception of emotional nuances, and consideration of the timing and limits of intervention between oneself and others [[Steinberger, 1993]].

[[a dynamic order]] that [[nullifies]] dichotomies.
- [[binary opposition]]
