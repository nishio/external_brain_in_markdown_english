title: "Inexpensive, intelligent labor"
---

- I gave [[Agriculture, Industry and Knowledge Industry]] to GPT4 to extract the key concepts and got the following output
> Inexpensive, intelligent labor
I noticed that this is not only limited to humans, but the GPT4 itself is "cheap, intelligent labor"!
