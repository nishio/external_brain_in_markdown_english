title: "Creating a Custom Tote Bag: A Personal Journey"

2021-10-21 My wife told me to replace my worn-out tote bag, so I thought, why not make one myself?

2021-11-05 It's done.

- It was supposed to take 3 weeks, but it arrived in 2 weeks.
- Maybe it would be better to make it smaller and tile it.
    - I enlarged the main image to fill the main display area and filled the surrounding with padding images, but this causes the image to fall into the fabric's bending zone.
- The gray might need to be a bit darker for the print data.
    - Instead of changing the original image, maybe I can adjust it with a tone curve.
- I'll use it myself for now, and if it breaks, I'll make the next version.
- Wife: "It's more durable and cheaper than I thought."
    - "The pattern goes all the way to the bottom, so dirt might be noticeable."
        - Observing tote bags in the world, many have dark colors on the bottom.

    - Tried [[C3: Computer Created Cats]] and found "Having tiles of a fixed size like 512×512 is versatile and convenient!"
        - This version used images of varying sizes, so the line thickness varies.
        - If written with the same thickness on tiles that are multiples of 512×512, layout becomes easier.
        - Large images that are hard to place might be better left out.
            - First, consider if it can be drawn at 512, and if not, consider if it can be drawn larger.
    - Sometimes asked to explain each diagram, but it's difficult to do on the fly.
        - It would be good to create a page on Scrapbox linking to the source pages of the images used and include a QR code.

:

```
Look for a site that makes it when you upload an image
  https://www.printful.com/jp/custom/bags/totes/all-over-print-tote
  17''x33''
  150DPI
    2550px x 4950px
  [Convert PDF to PNG]
   r300 for 1656px
  Is this dpi?

Gather pictures that seem to convey meaning without text
	[Mounting Comes from Anxiety]
		[Neither Accept Nor Reject, But Redirect]
	[Top of the Monkey Mountain]
		[Looking Down Comes from Narrow Vision]

Ah, better to do this on Kozaneba than write it here

[Things I Want to Do and Things I've Done Before]
It seemed good to summarize this type of discussion, but currently it's mixed with Japanese or quotes from elsewhere, making it inconvenient

[Changing Words Expands Misunderstanding]
[What Was Thought to Be One Concept Is Two Nested Concepts]
["Being X" and "Not Being X" Coexist]

[Blind Spot Cards] might be good?
While organizing, I found many "Patterns of Human Miscommunication," so I summarized those

I thought it said it would be printed in Japan, but when I uploaded the image, it said it would be sent from Latvia. The delivery time is about 3 weeks.
