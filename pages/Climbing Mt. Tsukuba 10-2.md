Decided that lunch could be bought at a convenience store at the station.
- Action food is not so important either, but I'll include a calorie mate.
I put my rain gear in.

impressions
- After all, an uncle in his 40s should buy stock.
    - I might buy a collapsible stock and a bag to hold the stock.
- Even at the Mt. Tsukuba level, my right knee hurts.
    - Or squatting.
