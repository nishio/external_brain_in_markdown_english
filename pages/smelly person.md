title: "smelly person"

Comparing a certain human characteristic X to a smell

- Smelly people are less likely to notice that they stink.
- People around smelly people often do not point out the "smell" but simply keep their distance
- Some people "smell" even at a young age, due to unhygienic lifestyle, etc.
- The parameters of the system change as we age, making us more prone to odor even if we maintain the lifestyle we had when we were younger.
- Self-care can make it harder to smell as you age.

I used to call this trait X "[problems caused by the elderly (esp. gerontocracy, and elderly people's control over the young)", but this trait X can also be caused by young people I was wondering if there is a better term for this.
    - [[Not old people, but human bugs.]]
    - But calling them "human bugs" seemed to stretch the boundaries of the concept too far.
- This time the expression is not "stinking old," but simply "smelly."
    - The key point of this concept is that "smelly people are less likely to notice that they smell," not that age matters.
    - For example, there are "young women who wear too much perfume and smell bad.
    - Until now, the word "old" has been too closely coupled with the age thing because of the "old" in the word "old".
- I don't think "stinky" is better than simply "stinky" because it's significant to separate that from the rest of the world.
