If we can explain it in such a way, maybe we can have "common values" that this is necessary not only with Japan but also with other countries around the world.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1677527267394846720) I took my thinking one step further and realized that it is, in other words, "AI chatbots as representatives of minority groups".
>  Minorities are concentrated loads when trying to create understanding through one-on-one dialogue. Because majorities are more numerous.

>  The chatbot will grow into a better chatbot as community members discuss whether this answer is good or bad, whether there is any additional information, and so on.
