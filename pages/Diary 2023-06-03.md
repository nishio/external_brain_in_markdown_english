explanation
In response to the statement "[[Japan is]] a machine learning paradise" and the rebuttal "a paradise where [[intellectual property]] can be stolen": "Japan is a machine learning paradise.
- What is "[[property]]" is defined, enforced, and sometimes limited by the government
- The driving force is to maximize [[the public interest]].
- It's not about maximizing the power of content owners.
- Read "[[Free Culture]]" by [[Lawrence Lessig]]!

> The key point is how to positively nurture a "market culture" of continuing to produce results for the market, although the "innovation culture" is more proactive and less upper-limit relationships when the scale is small and the "family culture" becomes stronger when the scale is stable.

> [@yuiseki_](https://twitter.com/yuiseki_/status/1664950028455264256): In the first place, I feel that it is very difficult to arouse the interest of a large number of people in a complex or complicated subject, even if it is important. The next most difficult thing is to get a large number of people to understand the issue and express their opinions. The next most difficult part is to find a point of view that many people can agree on. I think this is the order of things.
