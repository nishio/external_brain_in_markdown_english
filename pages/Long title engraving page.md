from [/villagepump/I need some good naming for "multiple links connected and wrapped pages"](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/I need some good naming for "multiple links connected and wrapped pages").

I don't know what to call it.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/icons/わからんど/icon' alt='/icons/わからんど.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
- [/takker/wrap page with multiple links connected](https://scrapbox.io/takker/wrap page with multiple links connected).
- If anyone comes up with a good name or knows the name, please let me know.

- Is it easier to connect later if you separate them into keywords, or bet on

- This is the kind of guy I'm talking about.

    - to "stop using the legacy protocol of conversation.
    - I thought the combination of "conversation" and "legacy protocol" was interesting, so I made a link to "The Legacy Protocol of Conversation."
    - I opened "The Legacy Protocol of Conversation" and thought about it for a minute, but couldn't think of anything in particular to write about.
        - But if we leave it as is, [[Future Connections]] is unlikely to occur (because the link string is long).
                - [[CD]] is small
        - So I wrote the title as it is and used it as a link for "shorter keywords".
            - That's the objective.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - If I had found something to write about and did write it, I would have similarly made "conversation" and "legacy protocols" the links.
    - Plus, you mention "legacy protocols" on the "Legacy Protocols" page.
        - [/nishio/legacy-protocols](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/legacy-protocols).
        - The "legacy format" is placed here by association, leading to "liberation from the legacy format of books".
- So, I'm thinking "[[Long title engraving page]]" or something like that.
    - Compared to "multiple links connected to a WRAP page," the timeline of the action is reversed.
        - Create a page with multiple short keywords attached to it.
        - Whether to distinguish time axis orientation

- Oh, I'll make this one.
- It's a natural occurrence in the structure.
- Even when making a link with more than one word in a verse, there is a hesitation about where to chop it up.
    - If you want to do it systematically, it is safer to make it longer first and then [[WRAP page with multiple links connected]].
