There's a lot to report.
- Report [work done
- Report [Results obtained
- Report [Current Status
- Report [[problem you're having]].

As for [[the release of the Japanese translation of the Plurality book]], I didn't do anything at all, and I learned about it when I heard from Mr. Takabe that it had been released, but I'll put it in my weekly report.
- I thought it was appropriate to report it as "results obtained" or "current status" of the Plurality project, even if there was zero work done, since it was discretionary work to begin with and not paid for the work done.
- Even the unexplored juniors ask creators to report weekly, but if they don't share what they are expected to report, it tends to be a report of "work done".
- Even if you report the work you've done, it's SO WHAT, so in terms of providing mentoring, I'd like you to report the outstanding issues, but I'm not going to get that across unless you tell me so.
    - You tell them, but they don't get the message.
