title: "Can large organizations move only slowly?"

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I would like to have a better resolution of understanding regarding the [[rough observation]] that [[large organizations can only move slowly]].
Why is it so? Is it really so?

relevance
- [[Social maintenance system is slow.]]
    - [[slow-moving business]]
    - [[Fast and Slow Worlds]]
        - [[late (e.g. "late at night")]]

Why do large organizations move slowly?
- Increased complexity of the decision-making process
        - The [[layered structure]] is multi-layered and takes time for everyone to reach consensus and coordinate.
        - [[risk aversion]] oriented and requires careful consideration.
- The number of stakeholders
    - There are many stakeholders inside and outside the organization, and everyone's interests must be reconciled.
- Adherence to existing structures and processes
    - The more successful the experience, the more likely they are to follow past practices and rules (path dependence).
            - [[path dependency]]
- Delayed information transmission
    - It takes time for information to reach upper management, making it difficult to respond quickly.
- rigidity of resource allocation
    - Lack of flexibility in moving resources (personnel, budget, time).

Is it really "moving slowly"?
- Case-based evaluation
    - In crisis management and competitive situations, large organizations may be able to respond quickly (e.g., in response to disasters, economic mobilization in times of war).
- Partial speed
    - While slow overall, some departments and project teams may move quickly.

How to increase resolution
- Observation and Classification
    - Categorize specific cases (decision making, resource allocation, execution phase) where the organization feels slow and analyze the factors.
- Validate best practices of larger organizations
    - Examine cases of rapid decision making (e.g., Apple's product development) and compare characteristics.
- Quantitative evaluation of scale impact
    - Analyze the correlation between organizational size and project speed.

Important Question
- Is organizational "slowness" a problem? Or is it [[trade-off]] for [[stability]] or [[accuracy]]?
- What factors can be improved ([[simplified decision-making processes]], [[decentralized delegation of authority]]) and what factors are structurally unavoidable?
