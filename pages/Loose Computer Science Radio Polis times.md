- Good story w
    - [[Social networking sites are]] making us aggressive!
    - The true nature of man is evil.
- That's a lot of resolution for a lesba.
    - You start getting N=1 cases, and those cases are heaping on the W.
- [[16 Personalities]] is the same as JAPAN CHOICE.
        - [[Diagnosis of 16 types of political orientation]]
- If you use [[public opinion map]] of JAPAN CHOICE, the group will be named by AI!
- The Extremists Who Pretend to Be Righteous" sounds interesting.
    - He said roughly the same thing: [[political conflict]].
- "Extremists will be less visible." important.
    - Polis is a tool that reminds us that the world is not so extreme.
- I tend to "observe" and do things that I don't interfere with, but Mr. Horimoto is good at interfering and looking for the right answer.
    - Maybe I should do the same.
- I like w Polis point w
    - Smart people who like to poach and use their wits in the prediction market can make money.
    - I think it's more efficient than collecting Ponta points.
- AI finds points of disagreement and writes comments.
- Moderation is too hard for WW.
    - People who want to argue, but can't argue, harass me.
- Polis moderation is too much work for me to do, but if I could do a good job of it with AI assistance and such, maybe it would be better.
    - I mean, is that the [[IIDOBATA system]]?
- I see what you mean about "[[social networking sites]] drawing attention to the group, not the individual."
        - [[Existing social networking sites focus on the individual, but Polis focuses on the group, not the individual.]]
- Lesbah Aspects
    - Uh, [[says something that could win, hiding his true feelings]].
- [[refuting them is only sterile]].
    - Just today I was summarizing something related: [[The Harmfulness of Defensive Rebuttals]].
- I see.
- "[[To build consensus, we must focus on the group]]" I see...
- It's the company's fault, but it's become a division of "stamp (craftsman) v.s. the person who was forced to put a stamp on it", I see.
- The "stamp" is divided into "business stamp" and "cultural stamp" with higher resolution.
- People who don't like anime icons and people with anime icons also seem to accelerate fights because of the icons.
- Is Mr. Narita's book a representative example of digital democracy?
    - That book is the [[Integrated Technocracy]] position in [[Ideology in the 21st Century]], so it is placed in a different place than [[digital democracy]] in those three categories.
- Mr. Yasuno's description of being part of a community depends on where you place the boundary between the in-group and the out-group.
    - Well, but maybe it is Plurality-like to blur (smooth) the boundaries and make various people feel somewhat like friends.
- It's hard to know how to create an incentive to use Polis.
- Talk about population bias.
    - Don't think the QV will solve the problem of a large number of organizational votes coming in.
- It's soft.
- I see.
- I don't read through travel guidebooks.
- This is likely to be agreed in Polis w > I want to pay the entrance tax by card.
