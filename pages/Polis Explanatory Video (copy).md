Are you recording this?

SF prototyping, in short, what is it?
- Have future stories created using ChatGPT.
- For what?
- To create a better basis for discussion
- Prevent discussions from becoming "groundless" and "dogfights" by sharing a worldview.

What is Polis?
- (Polis screen should be put up from the beginning)
- Polis is a system that collects the opinions and feelings of a large number of people and analyzes them in real time.
- This was developed to understand people's feelings more efficiently than questionnaires.
- By looking at the best and worst futures, you can see the range of futures, and within that range, how will you act?

Polis Key Features and Demos
- (Introduction of functions, showing actual Polis screens.)
- Let's take a quick look at the screen.
- Visualization of comments that divide sympathy and opinion on the content of the post.
    - Readers actually read the AI novel and wrote or voted on what they thought about it.
    - In the novel, the AI digs up traumas from the user's past.

        - Do you find the experience of users having their own pasts dredged up by AI frightening?

- Ability to vote on short sentences submitted
    - Let's actually vote!
    - Yes, No, I don't know
    - Q: What are the criteria for voting on short texts submitted in Polis?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Don't think too long and answer more and more by feel.
        - If you don't get a quick "yes" or "no" from the text, you can choose "I don't know".
        - This is a tool to collect "how people feel!"
        - The fact that you don't get a good no right away means that you haven't yet developed an idea about the issue, which in itself is important data!
            - For example, if there are many "don't know" responses to a poll, it suggests that people may not have had the opportunity to learn much about the issue, etc.

Participants can create their own voting targets.
- It is important for participants to be able to create their own voting targets, not just vote for a target that someone else has decided.
    - Taiwan Digital Minister Audrey Tan calls this "[[opening up agenda-setting authority to the people]]."
    - This is what you will experience in the workshop that follows.
    - Some people may not know what to do if they are completely free, so in this workshop we will ask "What ideal image would you like to achieve?" and "What could you do to achieve your ideal?" and "What are the things you could do to achieve your ideal?
    - You voted yes to what you posted.
        - So please ask yourself if you agree or not before you hit the submit button!
        - If the group work didn't result in a consensus, then each person can post their own opinion!
- This workshop is set up to allow anonymous voting and posting, and the management doesn't even know.
    - Submissions are shared instantly without filters or moderation
    - You can change it with these settings, and this time, with the best of intentions, we've set it up so that you get the most out of it.

Specific Application Examples
- This Polis system is used in Taiwan, for example, in the policy-making process.
- For example, when Uber entered Taiwan, some citizens were in favor of Uber and some cab operators were opposed. vTaiwan, a system that brought a large public debate and initial conflict, but later opinions were generated that were supported by both camps, which were then implemented by the Taiwanese government.

- [[Seeing is believing]], [[One eye-witness is better than many hearsays]].
    - It's more important to experience it for yourself than to hear a hundred times about this stuff.
    - We find SF prototyping with ChatGPT and voting with Polis useful
    - I'm looking for ways to communicate this "usefulness" to more people, and ways to combine it in various contexts to create better "usefulness."
- What follows in this workshop
    - After this, you will all use ChatGPT, a generative AI, to generate future stories!
    - Based on this, we will rotate the iteration twice: Group Discussion -> Polis -> Group Discussion -> Polis
    - What the final product will be is still an unknown unknown to everyone, but I am sure we will see something born from the discussions of everyone here!

summary
- Polis is a tool that helps you understand "the opinions and feelings of many people" to aid in consensus building and decision making
- Used around the world as a tool in democratic decision-making and finding community consensus
    - [[One eye-witness is better than many hearsays]]! Experience it!

Are there any instances of utilization that were particularly successful or yielded surprising results?"
- I'll put this up in the reference space.
