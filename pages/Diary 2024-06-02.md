> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1796947238444499403) It just occurred to me that [[Talk to the City]] extracts opinions from raw sentences in the first step, which means that once the AI reads and extracts them, it should be possible to cluster "raw sentences" in different languages. So, it should be possible to cluster Japanese and Korean Wikipedia articles on Hideyoshi's invasion of Korea as input.
