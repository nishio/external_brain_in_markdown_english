- Understanding is a staircase function, and one day you just know.
    - I've had a lot of experiences like that.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/imo/icon' alt='/villagepump/imo.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/kuuote/icon' alt='/villagepump/kuuote.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - [embryo - the phenomenon of being able to do it one day 1](https://embryo-nemo.com/643/)
        - I remember shokai mentioned it in an old article.
        - [Scrapbox improves efficiency! The case of shokai, a super remote worker (first half)](https://blogja.gyazo.com/entry/2017/01/30/180913)
            - This is exactly what I mean. It "comes" to you when you do things differently, or don't change the way you do them, or don't give up, or just keep doing things as you go along.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/erniogi/icon' alt='/villagepump/erniogi.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - Maybe the "appropriate" part is the core, surprisingly.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/imo/icon' alt='/villagepump/imo.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - Even if you don't have a strong sense of learning, I get the sense that increasing the amount of time you're in contact with them has its own benefits.

- I remember seeing the same topic elsewhere, but does anyone know?
    - Content: (Effort|Workload) and (Progress|Achievement|Ability) are non-linear
    - I remember [/nishio](https://scrapbox.io/nishio) definitely had it.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/issac/icon' alt='/villagepump/issac.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Maybe not, but in chapter 2 of [[The Road to Super Engineer]], there was a story about pinball.
            - Non-linear in the way scores rise.
        - Also, there's a story similar to [I'm a good painter because I'm a good observer.
        - [[Increased skill in using tools leads to a more detailed perception of the world]] これかな？<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - I remembered it from [[New doors opened.]] but the name was changed.
        - The original name sounds more nonlinear.

    - [[percolation]] ([[percolation]])
    - > When there are a large number of isolated nodes (sites) scattered in space, and these nodes are connected by a connected edge (bond), a localized small-scale network is initially formed in a scattered manner. If we continue to connect these small nodes with an appropriate probability, the entire network will suddenly become a connected mesh structure when the probability exceeds a certain level. In the case of conductive connected edges, an electric current flows from one end to the other.

        - [I think that "small local networks are formed in a scattered manner," and "if they continue to be connected with a reasonable probability," "suddenly the whole network becomes a connected mesh structure.
