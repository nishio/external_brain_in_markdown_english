> The Nishio Family Today
>  I "finished chapter 1!"
>  Wife: "Have you started on chapter 2?"
>  I "didn't!"
>  Wife: "Just do one line!"
>  I see, is there any reason why we have to do 1 pomodoro?

- Translation, a task that can take months to complete, was split into 25-minute [[pomodoro]] segments because "[Task is too large.
- And yet, before you know it, it subconsciously turns into a mistake like "if you want to perform it, you have to do one pomodoro".
- People unconsciously make [[tasks]] bigger.
- Because it's easier to [[postpone]] with an excuse.
- Pomodoro is also a "means" and "tool", not an "end".
- Remember, the goal is to make the translation go as fast as possible.

    - Similar to [If you don't have the MP for 25 minutes of magic, just hit 3 minutes of magic.
    - This is a "no motivation to start before the work begins" condition
            - [[Work Excitement]], so "start doing something related" is beneficial.
    - In this case, I have [[sense of accomplishment]] and [[feeling of satisfaction]] after finishing a task that takes many pomodoros to get to the end of the task.
        - Not to be satisfied with that state of affairs, but to take it one step further.
        - Never be satisfied with the status quo.
