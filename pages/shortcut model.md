    - [[Short extracts from books]]
    - Model of what might be appropriate as a [boundary
    - This should have been "after the punctuation mark" without the need for machine learning.
- Model whether it is appropriate as a cutout target
    - Less than a certain length
    - No mismatch in the number of corresponding items (e.g., parentheses)
- That's what's missing.
    - Sometimes [[demonstrative]] or [[conjunction]] is added at the beginning of a sentence to refer to a previous sentence.
    - I can use pattern matching to remove the one attached to the beginning.
    - It's a little difficult to have directives in a sentence.
    - Later, it's also difficult to find cases where there is no meaning left if you remove it.
