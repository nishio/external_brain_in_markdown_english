As a first step, it is essential to establish "[[an]] information verification infrastructure". Specifically:
- [[Indicate primary source]]:
    - Each piece of information will be linked directly to public announcements, official documents, original video sources, etc., so that anyone can refer to it. This makes it clear at a glance "where the information came from" and allows users to confirm the information on their own.
- Simplified presentation of [[verification guidelines]]:
    - Provide a short guide (e.g., "Is there a link to official information?" or "Is it corroborated by a third-party organization?") to which users can quickly refer to basic decision criteria. A rudimentary checklist is fine.

The development of this "source presentation + simplified guide" is the preliminary step to accepting more complex [[fact-checking]] systems and evaluations from different perspectives. The first step is to create a transparent information access environment where everyone can immediately begin fact-checking.
