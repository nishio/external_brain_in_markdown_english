- Contains [[quinine]], so it fluoresces blue in [black light
- Purchased here [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3cSyfc2)
- I bought it because I was thinking of doing a science experiment video on YouTube.
- I'm satisfied with my own experiments and no longer motivated to make YouTube videos.

Tastes like [[tonic water]] with a distinct bitterness, not bad.
- I wonder if this unique bitterness is quinine, because quinine has a strong bitter taste.
