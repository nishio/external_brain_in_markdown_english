[Employees in Asia are spending the most time looking busy at work](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/14/employees-in-asia-are-spending-the-most-time-looking-busy-at-work.html)
> Workers in Asia are spending the most time on “performative work” — in other words, focusing on appearing busy more than doing real, productive work.
>  That’s according to a new global survey from Salesforce subsidiary Slack and research firm Qualtrics, which pulled data from more than 18,000 desk workers, including executives.
>  Performative work includes “spending a lot of time in meetings where ‘teams present achievements’ rather than making decisions or addressing issues,” said Derek Laney, Slack’s “technology evangelist” for Asia-Pacific.
> The survey found that employees from India (43%), Japan (37%) and Singapore (36%) reported spending more of their time on such work than the global average (32%).

>
>  ・ A significantly higher percentage of highly productive workers automate their work, with 65% of highly productive workers automating their work and 40% of less productive workers automating their work.
>
>  ・ Productive workers bring a sense of well-being and productivity impact, with nearly half saving between 3.5 hours and half a day a week.
>
>  ・ Automation is having a positive impact, but only 45% of managers are driving automation and only 27% are using AI.
>
>  Apparently. We should make more use of AI...
