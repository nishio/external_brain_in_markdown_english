> As of April 22, 2024, it will be possible to establish a limited liability company-type DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) in Japan.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1771441739208749550/quick_promote_web/intro) "From April 22, 2024, it will be possible to establish a limited liability company-type DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) in Japan I think that people who are not sure about "From April 22, 2024, it will be possible to establish a DAO (Distributed Autonomous Organization) in the form of a limited liability company in Japan" probably don't understand "From 2008, it has been possible to establish a general incorporated association in Japan", but since there have been no problems for 15 years, it should be left as it is.
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1771443098825961643) I happened to be on the board of directors of a general incorporated association, so I learned how it works, but it's knowledge you only need if you're going to create it yourself or be on the management side. It's knowledge that you only need if you are going to create your own or be on the management side.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>You have discussed various perspectives on the limited liability company type DAO. The main issues can be summarized as follows
1. why was a limited liability company chosen instead of a civil law partnership?
- Suggests that associations may be better suited for avoiding [[unlimited liability]], the need for [[legal personality]], [[pass-through taxation]], etc.
- On the other hand, there are also advantages of a limited liability company, such as the advantages of fundraising through the limited liability company's [[members' rights scheme]] and the possibility of [[articles of incorporation autonomy]].

2. is a legal entity really necessary for a DAO?
- Opinion that a legal entity is unnecessary given the nature of DAOs, which should be operated autonomously.
- On the other hand, some may require a legal entity for ease of external activities.

3. the intention behind the institutional design
- Questioning the history of the "[[corporate DAO]]" in the rulemaking discussion.
- On the other hand, some believe that the first priority is to create the reality of economic activity, and that this will be a stepping stone to [[autonomous DAO]] legislation.

4. do we really need to fear unlimited liability?
- Pointing out that a properly designed DAO would not have a problem with unlimited liability.
- On the other hand, there is also the opinion that the [[psychological resistance]] of the general public cannot be ignored.

It is interesting to see the active discussion going on about the ideal form of DAO and the legal system design to realize it. I am very interested in the ongoing lively discussion about what a DAO should be and how to design a legal system to realize it. I was able to get a glimpse of this through the tweets you mentioned.

> [noly_sugii](https://twitter.com/noly_sugii/status/1787907850418921635) I've been studying up on the limited liability company type DAO, but the more I look into it, the more I find it confusing and hard to accept. ...
>  I think the attempt to organize DAOs in accordance with Japanese law is quite legitimate, but I wondered why you did not make the recipient a "civil law association".
>  One thing I don't think DAO would need a legal entity.
>  Another point is that when profits are distributed, there is no corporate tax, but pass-through taxation.
>  Another point is that the union contract can decide to allow decisions to be made based on the number of tokens held.
>  The unlimited liability of the members could be a disadvantage, but if smart contracts are the main focus, wouldn't the "DAO owes a debt" event never occur? One point I think.
>  All of these seem to me to be more flexible than a limited liability company type DAO.
>  Apparently, there was a DAO rule-making hackathon, and there were a number of people who wanted DAOs to have a legal entity. There were many people who said they would like DAO to have a legal entity.
>  But does a DAO need a legal entity?
>  Yes, a limited liability company is more familiar and easier to understand, but it's a DAO to begin with.
>  Well, you know, I think the people involved in the rulemaking process haven't gotten their heads out of their asses from conventional organizational theory.
>  It seems that a lot of people I know are involved in rule making, but I can't shake the feeling that it's not quite right.
> [noly_sugii](https://twitter.com/noly_sugii/status/1787908735987524080) And while I complain about it, I guess it's easier to convince people that a limited liability company-type DAO is the way to go because it's easier to understand how it operates from the outside. I think so.

> [shogochiai](https://twitter.com/shogochiai/status/1787957683070660802) ・Effectively alleviate the situation where a limited liability company's scheme of members' rights was an electronically recorded transfer right.
>  ・Improvement of organizational arrangements for credit cards, domains, etc.
>
>  This alone is of great merit, so I'm meditating on the later branches as a phasing theory.

> [noly_sugii](https://twitter.com/noly_sugii/status/1787981134896464329) If it was difficult to create those advantages in a civil law partnership or an association without rights, why not an LLP? I think it would have been better with an LLP.
>  I believe the most important thing for DAOs is "pass-through taxation".

> [shogochiai](https://twitter.com/shogochiai/status/1787986801044672769) Limited liability company membership scheme is only available to limited liability companies
>  In addition, I personally would like to avoid pass-through taxation in a self-governance DAO, and I would like to avoid a situation where a member is subject to taxation if he/she withdraws the budget voted on by the self-governance association.

> [noly_sugii](https://twitter.com/noly_sugii/status/1787988467487826101) If you could tell me why it had to be employee rights, I might understand.
>  I wanted to take a vessel to which I could contribute money as an initial source of funds without taking the form of securities. Is that what you mean?

> [shogochiai](https://twitter.com/shogochiai/status/1787990012564545592) I don't think anyone can explain why. I think it "came to pass." To be more specific, at the time of the LDP rec (DAO Hackathon), the direction of "corporate DAO" was decided upon.
>  I'm not interested in corporate DAOs, so I only see it as a step toward [[autonomous DAO]] legislation.

> [noly_sugii](https://twitter.com/noly_sugii/status/1787990972321943677) I see.
>  If it is an autonomous DAO, then [[association without rights and powers]] would be the best fit. So, if the issue of accounts, etc. is going to come up, why didn't they just allow associations without capacity to register as a personality with only a stamp tax? I think that would be a good idea.

> [shogochiai](https://twitter.com/shogochiai/status/1787991573336404231) > If you are an autonomous DAO, an association without rights
>  I agree.
>  > I wish I had
>  Due to the bias of resources toward corporate DAOs, the autonomous DAO legislation will come much later. Or rather, it may be left unattended. I feel that everything cannot be started without an economic turnaround.

> [noly_sugii](https://twitter.com/noly_sugii/status/1787996099392974882) I'm starting to get some idea of why you want a limited liability company as a vehicle.
>  I still think there is an advantage in the handling regulations around securities.

> [shogochiai](https://twitter.com/shogochiai/status/1787999221951627377) How about collecting money and giving them tokens in the form of SPCs at these hacks?

> [noritaka_okabe](https://twitter.com/noritaka_okabe/status/1788020148919837068) I don't think it will be in a form that is easily accessible to an unspecified number of people since a civil law association has unlimited liability.
>  The choice to incorporate is based on licensing and municipal contracts.
>  Instead, the bus-through advantage would be lost.

> [noly_sugii](https://twitter.com/noly_sugii/status/1788038670181974036) I don't think unlimited liability is such a big fetter.
>  If the contract thing was the issue, you could have used LLP. It's liable and it's a pass-through.
>  But well, LLPs have a tricky thing called duration of existence, so that's a different issue....

> [noritaka_okabe](https://twitter.com/noritaka_okabe/status/1788041987880271918) I understand that there are those who don't care about unlimited liability and those who care very much, and those who care very much are more numerous. I understand that there are people who don't care about unlimited liability and people who care about it very much.
>  Entrepreneurs will generally not care.

> [noly_sugii](https://twitter.com/noly_sugii/status/1788063458073977002) I think it's just the image of the word and you are unnecessarily afraid of it.
>  To begin with, the only time when unlimited liability arises is when settlement is made, and it never arises in the middle of the process, so if a DAO can be created properly, by its very nature, there should never be a time for settlement. If the organization is designed from the beginning with a sustainable structure, it should be able to operate even if there is no longer an operating body.
>  So, if there is a risk that it isn't, I'm not sure you can call it a DAO.
>  Perhaps they do not have such an autonomously managed mechanism like a smart contract. I think that we have to take such risks because we consider a fake DAO that is just a facade to be in the scope.

> [noly_sugii](https://twitter.com/noly_sugii/status/1788066048421601317) So I think the real intention behind the need to make it a limited liability company was something other than to avoid unlimited liability.
>  For example, a limited liability company's membership could be a vehicle for raising a certain amount of money in a private placement without tampering with existing laws and without violating securities laws.

> [noly_sugii](https://twitter.com/noly_sugii/status/1788066473745035567) Also, I hear that articles of incorporation autonomy is possible.
