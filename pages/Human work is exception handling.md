title: "Human work is exception handling"

from  [[Issues in the Recruitment and Employment Systems of Japanese Companies]]

>  The reason for this is that we make many branches trying to carefully answer the various patterns within the 2%.
>  All you have to do is cut them off, but you can't do that because you are too weak to hit and too weak to make claims.
>  I'm too disciplined with my opponents and before I know it, I'm in opposition and have nothing left to offer.
>  >tokoroten: So why is communal skills such a high priority in Japanese companies?
>  Because the work in the field is a mass of tacit knowledge, and it's only in the mind of the senior staff, so you can't learn the job unless you have the ability to ask that guy out.
>  Get to know each other, work together, and learn somewhat.
>
>  because this is considered "workable".

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1548697999861493760) I know this too.
>  The reason people work today is to "make exceptions."
>  Let the machine do the routine work (it's not done, and this is its main task).
>
>  So, I think the exception work is the main one, and I weigh that one more heavily.
>
>  If the routine tasks could be automated, that decision would not be wrong...

> [kurema_makoto](https://twitter.com/kurema_makoto/status/1548706611388039168) I think there are other reasons why people work today: interpersonal interface and decision making.
>  There is information that can only be conveyed by a human being, and even if it is irrational, I don't want to leave decisions involving 100 million yen to a machine.
>  The latter, as well as the former, will not disappear with technological development for quite a long time.
>  And the former is precisely the problem of the communalities.



> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1768928573073797566/history) "[[exception handling is the last job left for humans]]" and "[[AI that has acquired language skills can do the job]]"
>  When the two are combined,
>  "Persuading and asking AI counterparts to handle exceptions" is likely to be the last job left.
>
>  I guess it's time to brush up on my banquet skills against the AI.
