title: "Layers of action and layers of problem solving"
---

- "You studied [[Management]] at Tokyo Tech, but you don't do management?" is a question that makes me feel uncomfortable.
    - There are [[Layers of Action]] and [Layers of Problem Solving
- Comparing to programming
    - The "layer of action" of programming is typically the act of creating a program by tapping on a keyboard in front of a monitor
    - The "problem-solving layer" of programming uses programming knowledge to narrow down the location of the problem and lead to a solution.
- The word management also has layers of action and problem solving.
    - If the question, "Don't you do management?" is a behavioral layer question, the answer is "no" because I do not intend to do a job that specializes in management behavior as a profession.
    - If the question is about layers of problem solving, the answer is "we are already doing it" because we are already using it on a daily basis.

> The other day, I was asked, "You studied management at Tokyo Tech, but you don't do management?" I felt uncomfortable when I was asked that question, but I have been able to verbalize it a little better.
>  Comparing to programming. Programming is typically being in front of a monitor, tapping away at a keyboard. Using computer science knowledge to solve problems" includes that situation, but it happens all over the place. For example, if you connect a laptop to a projector and it doesn't show up well, you might try connecting another laptop to narrow down the problem.

>  The term "management" is ambiguous in that it can refer to a > layer of action, or it can refer to a layer of problem solving. The question, "Don't you do management?" In the former interpretation, the answer is "No," because I don't intend to do "a job specializing in management behavior" as a profession. In the latter interpretation, the answer would be "I already do it" because I already use it on a daily basis.
