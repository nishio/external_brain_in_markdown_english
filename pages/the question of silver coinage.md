the question of silver coinage
Silver coins are cards to pay out 5 gold and 6 gold
- Witches, [[Basics: Guards]], [[Plot: Favorites]]
- Silver coins silver coins can buy 90%5 gold cards in the second round.

elementary level
- Terminal action is about 2~3 pieces for the whole game
intermediate level
- Overbuying villages in an attempt to build a combo, low average gold volume and slow access to 5-coin actions.
- 6If I get money, I buy gold.
- Buy one silver coin in the first round and buy a strong card while the density is high.
    - When in doubt, silver coins
- It's called [[stero]] when it's treasure-centric and has a few strong cards in it.
senior
    - [Expansion after the adventure has high card power.
- Intermediate at Dominion Online with a rate of 45 or higher.
- The challenge is to build the combo efficiently
    - [The silver coin is a curse.
- Deck [[rotational force]] is lowered.
    - It's all about how many times you can use a powerful action card.

Good place to get silver coins.
- special victory point
    - Enclosures, gardens, dukes
        - I'll change it for 4-5 gold.
    - Winning point percentage increases
        - Note that victory points will lose rotation if officials are used by others.
- wasteland
    - Witches, fanatics
    - It is easy to get more curses, and everyone is hard to get 8 gold -> three mountains wither end, and the public domain is a heavenly mountain.
    - Attack first, and when you calm down, silver coins.
- Four-player game, non-combo supply
        - The effect of lowering [[rotational force]] is to slow the decline due to the victory point.
