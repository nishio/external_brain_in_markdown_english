title: "the theory that old people are always old from the start"

> The theory as to why [[problems caused by the elderly (esp. gerontocracy, and elderly people's control over the young)]] occur in large numbers, perhaps "it is not that they have become old because they are old, but that young people who originally had the qualities of old people have become old because they are old. I have a strong feeling that the reason for the large number of [[problems caused by the elderly (esp. gerontocracy, and elderly people's control over the young)]] is not that they have become old because they are old, but that young people, who had the qualities of old people, used to release their desires through "food, exercise, sex, travel, and drinking parties" in their youth, but all these disappeared at once when they grew old, and only vanity, pride and harassment remain.
