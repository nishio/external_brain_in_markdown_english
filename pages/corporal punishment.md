> [ajtpdj](https://x.com/ajtpdj/status/1811743490621211080) Oh, did I mention it was on TV?
>  Pro-corporal punishment and anti-physical punishment debates.
>
>  The affirmative.
>  "If you say it with your mouth, they won't listen to you, so I'll make them understand with their bodies."
>  > If you say something like that...
>  The denialist.
>  "So if we physically punish you now and make you understand that with your body, you'll switch to the denialist camp?"
>  I remember a story where I said, "I'm sorry, but I'm not going to tell you.

> hOoEUrncojynZSF: No matter how many arguments the pro-corporal punishment people make
>  ・Effectiveness cannot be objectively proven.
>  ・ Decrease in the crime rate of the younger generation
>  ・Totsuka Yacht School, a bad example
>  ・ Most of the people saying this are already not in a position to be hit.
>
>  "So, you just want to do violence from a safe distance in the name of justice?" ...


> [pow0604_game](https://x.com/pow0604_game/status/1811985957736054897) Corporal punishment may be effective as a means to "get them to do what you say".
>  But from an "education" standpoint, it sucks.
>  Because even if they hit you and you do what they say, you learn not that you shouldn't do it because it's wrong, but that you shouldn't do it because they hit you.
>  Is this really "education"?

> [ShiworiKagesaki](https://x.com/ShiworiKagesaki/status/1811948901982962086) But there's a sense of social punishment to contain the affirmative.

> [nanasekisaragi2](https://x.com/nanasekisaragi2/status/1812015368183173227) "If you say it with your mouth, they won't listen to you if you lick them, so I'll make them understand with my body."
>
>  That's why wars will never stop in the world.

> [makoto1221](https://x.com/makoto1221/status/1811992450971345180) There was a custom of thanking the older generation for rampant corporal punishment.

> [Nukumoriboy](https://x.com/Nukumoriboy/status/1812024331104325864) Then the naysayers lose.
>  This discussion is about "(1) the effectiveness of corporal punishment in education. It is not a discussion of "(2) making people obey through pain." The affirmative can answer yes to that question and explain the effectiveness of (2) with examples such as torture.
>  The problem with corporal punishment is that (2) is effective for both good and evil, and teachers are not always good.
