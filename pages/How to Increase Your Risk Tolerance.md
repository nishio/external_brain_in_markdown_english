title: "How to Increase Your Risk Tolerance"
---

    - [[How to Develop Resilience]] memo reads.
    - How do we solve the low [[self-assurance]]?
        - How to give [[risk tolerance]] is also similar composition.
    - Innate fear of [risk
    - Fuel [[Excessive risk-taking]] by media coverage of savage survivors
    - Again [[risk aversion]] in reaction to that.
    - An appropriate risk-taking level in the middle is preferable, but how can it be controlled?
        - Buddha's [[Parable of the Strings]].

    - [[risk-taking]] experience
    - The size of the return on success
    - Failure is no big deal.
    - Increasing sample size and understanding
    - Oh, this is totally a [[multi-armed bandit problem]].
            - [[Trade-off between exploration and exploitation]]
