title: "People who think they are inferior to X"
---

Of those who think they are inferior to X, person P, who can incorporate the superior aspects of X, will be superior. Person Q, who thinks he is superior to X, cannot do so. Therefore, P is superior to Q.

- Variations on [wisdom to realize one's own ignorance
- Substitute "others" for X and you're talking about people who can learn from others.
- Substituting "AI" for X connects to the 2024 present context.

- [[Rational mysticism]]
