title: "Yasukazu Nishio's Scrapbox -> Yasukazu Nishio's External Brain"
---

2024-09-03~04

This X was initially launched on a service named [Scrapbox
- So I called it "[[Scrapbox by Yasukazu Nishio]]" without thinking much about X.

Unexpectedly, however, Scrapbox changed its name to Cosense.
- 2024-05-21  [[Scrapbox→Cosense name change]]
- Domain name remains Scrapbox as of 2024-09-04
    - It's been suggested that this could change someday, but we don't know when that will be.

I have delicate feelings about continuing to call X "Yasukazu Nishio's Scrapbox" in this situation.
- but I have more subtle feelings about changing it to "[[Yasukazu Nishio's Cosense]]".
- Because essentially X has not changed.
    - nonetheless
        - I use [[pointer]] to point to X.
        - [[handle]] to handle the concept of X.
    - Because it is not desirable for external factors to change the name of the company as

The choice between "Yasukazu Nishio's Scrapbox" or "Yasukazu Nishio's Cosense" is [[choosing the wrong two options]] and there should be [The Third Option

I came up with the idea that "[[Yasukazu Nishio's external brain]]" might be an appropriate name for this X.
- At this point, most of you are probably looking at what is hosted at `https://scrapbox.io`.
- But this is not the essence, we think.
- (The first one I wrote)
    - The data behind the scenes is the essence of Yasukazu Nishio's [[external brain]] at the moment, and Scrapbox happens to be the service that was being used for a time because it was suitable for that input/output.
        - It's just a view.
        - It's not the essence.
        - Models and Views
- (Self-Refutation: A brain is not just a collection of data)
    - There is an essential X behind the scenes, and Scrapbox/Cosense is just the view
    - Scrapbox was a very well developed service and contributed very much to the development of Nishio's external brain.
        - The result was an external brain in the form of a [[closed source]] and [[proprietary]] view called Cosense and a model in a database on Helpfeel's server
        - This closed model is not directly accessible to the average consumer.
        - Therefore, "exportable JSON data" can only be regarded as an incomplete projection of the model onto the real world.
        - The real brain cannot directly externalize its contents either, so it can only be an incomplete projection.
    - Texts written in the diary of the same day before writing this page:.
        - Think of Cosense as an IDE for creating JSON in a certain format.
            - This IDE is difficult to operate from the AI.


Future Policies
- Archive the current "external brain of Nishio as data" on GitHub.
    - Do you want to do CC0 as well?
        - Related: [[I want all my works to be CC-0]].
    - Switch mental models to think of the main body as on GitHub, not Helpfeel's database

- The brain is not just a collection of data.
    - Ensure that programs designed and implemented by Nishio himself use that data for intellectual production
    - This "combination of program and data" creates the true "external brain of Yasukazu Nishio.
- Specifically.
    - The attempt to create your own view was done by [[mem.nhiro.org]].
        - I didn't continue to use it myself because it's not particularly better than the Scrapbox view.
            - You wanted to control the details of the view, I know you did.
        - As for programs that do intellectual production based on data, I've been doing machine translation into English and hosting it.
            - [/nishio-en](https://scrapbox.io/nishio-en)
                - Oh, something's stopped.
                - I recently had a credit card renewal, but this was using the DeepL API, and I don't remember changing the settings, so maybe that's why.
        - Based on the [[Talk to the City]] experience, some things are emerging that we want to try.
            - Simply visualizing them as clusters would be interesting.
                - Maybe we need to be able to drill down hierarchically.
                    - Fractal Summary] is also relevant as a hierarchical summary.
            - It is interesting to extract purposeful data through LLM
                - Smart Filters
            - Language conversion is also possible
                - Intellectual production activities that transcend language barriers are coming to fruition.
                    - It may be useful to use [[doodles]] as a hub for the creation of [[nonverbal symbols]], such as [[Doodles by Yasukazu Nishio]].

    - End of [Scrapbox period
    - Beginning of [external cerebral period

2024-09-06 TODO:
    - [[What is this? (~2024-09-08)]], rewrite "This is Yasukazu Nishio's personal Scrapbox", "What is Scrapbox?" , "A guide for those new to Scrapbox" in [What is this?
- That's almost all of it...
