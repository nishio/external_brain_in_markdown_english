Project Liberty is a project that works to make the Internet a better place. It aims to empower users to take control of their data and digital identities, and is developing the following key activities

- Labs: Develop an application ecosystem based on a comprehensive data economy to give users back control.
- Institute: brings together technology, academia, policymaking, social organizations, and citizens to create a healthy technology ecosystem.
- Alliance: Forms a coalition of organizations dedicated to a more just and humane digital future.

In addition, People's Bid is also working to redesign major platforms such as TikTok to give users back their right to control their data.

In November 2024, an event was held with technology, policy, and other leaders to develop a new roadmap for the digital age.
