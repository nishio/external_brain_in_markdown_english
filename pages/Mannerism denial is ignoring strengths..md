> Denying [[self-imitation]] ([[mannerism]]) and ignoring [[My Strengths]] ([[Strong Points]]) are along the same lines, so we have to think carefully.

When I was younger, I didn't want to repeat lectures on the same topics.
- I didn't want to use the same story over and over again.
- I always wanted to create something new.
- Is that still the case?
- I generally turn down things like, "I don't care if I have to use it again," or "I want you to give a lecture on this subject."
    - uninteresting
    - Even if you're told you can use it all over again, you end up making a new one.
    - Customer side doesn't expect it, over-quality causes mismatches.
I don't know why it's easing up a bit now.
    - [[Barbell Strategy]]
        - [[Trade-offs between use and exploration]]
    - Shaking it all down to "do something new" is a full swing to "exploration".
    - Use" the [[gushing forth (e.g., of resources)]] already discovered to ensure minimum stability and use the remaining margin for [[upside]] big [[exposures]].


gushing forth (e.g. of resources)
    - [[Resources]] / [[Gushing]].
