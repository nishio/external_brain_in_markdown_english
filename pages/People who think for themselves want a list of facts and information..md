People who think for themselves want a list of facts and information.

Today's word of the day registry "Kankayo" = "Summarize in brief bullet points."
KANKASE = brief, itemized description." I also added

I registered a word yesterday, "Brief, bulleted description." I've been using a lot of this in the past.
Like @tokoroten said in the context of [[itemization]] [[Mach New Book]] "It's more beneficial to share bullet points than to have them authored in written form."

I've been trying to figure out what happened with sentences -> bullet points, and the bottom line is that if the "speed at which sentences are generated" exceeds the "speed at which humans read sentences," then the overall optimum is to "generate sentences in a format that speeds up human reading speed.

The other, "Summarize concisely with bullet points." is used when I forget to add the "Briefly summarize with bullet points." I use it when I forget to add a "*" or when I want to convert a document that comes from another source to a bulleted style.

People who can think for themselves want a list of facts and information,
I wondered if you meant that people who can't think for themselves want logical development.

Well, but this usage is not an enumeration of facts.
It seems reasonable to start by asking whether you intend to think or want people to think.
It's like I'm deploying a search unit to think with a [[wide field of vision]].

It sounds like there are different preferences for writing in Haskell by dividing it into partial functions or writing it as a pattern match using case of.
From a Prolog point of view, it may be an enumeration of facts, but there could also be a pattern of writing multiple predicates in a row.

In short, my usage is to collect viewpoints as "[[All data is a lie]]" in order to get a "broad perspective" by synthesizing them, so enumeration may be fine.
