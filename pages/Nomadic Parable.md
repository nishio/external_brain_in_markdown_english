Even when we don't know where we should be going, sometimes we know where we shouldn't stay.
- relevance
        - [[Blaming the run is agrarian bias.]]
        - Possibly "[[you]] should run away anyway."
        - Waiting to figure out "[Where should I run to?" will be too late.
    - [[Don't stay.]]
    - run out of grass
        - [[We have to keep moving.]]
- There are times when you should "just [[move]] from there" instead of stopping to wonder, "Where do I go?
    - The thought pattern "stay when you don't know where to go" is a bias in thinking in an environment where [[stop (doing, working, being supplied)]] is advantageous.
