title: "Fortune can only be observed when it occurs."

- People perceive the state in which [[fortune]] does not occur as "[[as always]].

Those who did not take actions to increase the probability of the occurrence of good fortune have difficulty in recognizing that they thereby have a low incidence of good fortune.
- People who are taking actions to increase their [[Lucky rate]] can recognize that the frequency of observed [[Lucky]] increases, so they can learn that "this action is beneficial to increase the [[Lucky rate]]".

- [[Lucky Cognitive Ability]]
