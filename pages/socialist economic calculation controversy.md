- 1.[[Mises]] ([[Ludwig von Mises]], 1881-1973)
    - In his 1920 article "[[Economic Calculation in a Socialist Society]]," he argued that rational economic calculation is impossible in socialism, where market prices do not exist, for resource allocation.
        - In other words, he asserted, "Without the information of market prices, there can be no efficient use of resources.
2.  [[high efficiency]]  ([[Friedrich Hayek]], 1899–1992)
    - Since the 1930s, he has developed his arguments in papers such as "[[The Use of Knowledge in Society, 1945]].
    - He noted that knowledge is dispersed and cannot be consolidated by the central planning authority.
    - He emphasized that the market is a "[[discovery procedure]]" that calculates and coordinates dispersed knowledge through prices.
    - [[Distributed Knowledge Theory]]
            - [[centrally planned economies]] fail → reason is "knowledge dispersion"
        - The information needed for the economy (demand, supply, resources, technology) is scattered among countless individuals and cannot be fully grasped by the central authorities.
        - The market "calculates" and coordinates its dispersed knowledge through prices.
        - Hayek explained this as "market = process of discovering knowledge.
        - Contact with the AI Era
            - It used to be thought that central planning was impossible because of the inability to gather information, but the advent of AI has shaken things up.
            - The market is a "distributed algorithmic computation," but AI appears to be a "super-powerful central computational device.
            - Then the question resurfaces, "Couldn't AI shoulder the calculations that the market required?" The question "Can't AI do the calculations required by the market?
3. the other side (advocates)
    - [[Oskar Lange]] ([[Oskar Lange]]) and others countered that "it is possible to do it centrally using a computer," but eventually Hayek and others' arguments became mainstream.
    - In particular, the collapse of the Soviet Union is often interpreted as a historical reinforcement of the "Mises-Hayekian correctness".

👉 It is Hayek's argument that is more directly related to "[[the market is]] a computational device" in this area.
