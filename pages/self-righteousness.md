title: "self-righteousness"
---

Human self-righteousness refers to the idea or attitude that humans are the center of the natural world and superior to other beings. This principle tends to place the highest priority on human interests and values and considers how they affect other beings as secondary.
- Human self-righteousness can also cause problems in the development and application of AI (artificial intelligence).
    - Neglect of ethical issues: When the dominant mindset is one of human self-righteousness, AI may be developed and operated with a focus solely on human interests and values. As a result, there is concern that AI may not adequately address issues that could negatively impact its existence.
