title: "VR and Design Patterns"
---

I learned it in the context of what is [[design pattern]] (architecture) and [[patterning (e.g. in programming languages)]] in the original family, and I thought I would never use my knowledge of architecture in my future life, but I never thought that [[VR]] would make me think, "Hey, what kind of virtual space should I create? I didn't think I would realize, "Hey, isn't that a design pattern for what kind of virtual space I can create and not get lost?" I didn't think I would realize that.
