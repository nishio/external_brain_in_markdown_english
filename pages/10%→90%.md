title: "10%→90%"
---

If you take something that's 10% and make it 90%, that's a big step forward, but people will say, "Well, it's not 100%.
- Even when those people get to 99%, they say, "It's not 100%.
- I guess my cognition has become strongly biased toward [[looking for negativity]].
    - Synonyms: [[looking for good]].

We're at 90%, wow!" Some people say, "It's been there for a while," when I'm talking about
- 10% before the start is "not 0%", so "it was there before" is True
- So what, we're talking about an 80% increase: ......

I think both of these are a kind of [[0 or 100]], [[all-or-none thinking]], because they don't understand the change in quantity from 10% to 90% and think in terms of 0% and 100%.
