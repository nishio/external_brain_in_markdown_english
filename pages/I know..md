title: "I know."

I know" is better than "[[I don't know]]". However, there is not much difference in knowledge that can be easily acquired through search, because a person who realizes that he/she doesn't know can easily change to "I know". Those who "think one knows" and believe in false knowledge are worse off than those who "[[I don't know]]" because they do not have the opportunity to search for and acquire correct knowledge.
