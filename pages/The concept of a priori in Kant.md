- > The concept of "a priori" in Kant
- >  The eighteenth-century German philosopher [[[Immanuel Canto. Immanuel Canto.]]<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/Kant/icon' alt='/villagepump/Kant.icon' height="19.5"/> argued that philosophy, like mathematics and the natural sciences, must acquire an inevitable and universal way of thinking. And to do so, independent of all human experience, [[Reason itself must be able to determine the framework of perception]]. This is "[[a priori recognition]]" (a priori recognition, which is not mixed with any experiential matter at all, is called "[[unaided perception]]"`[2]`.
    - What kind of perception is totally independent of experience?

- >  According to Kant, [[Hours.]] and [[space]] are a priori concepts. Because these two are concepts that are recognized prior to any empirical recognition `[Note 1]`.
    - >  It is not absolutely self-evident that these two precede each other, but what Kant is emphasizing is that nothing can be recognized as [[pure intuition]] unless these two are given, as long as "[[Ding an sich]]" cannot be recognized.
- >  Note that these two are not naturally imagined times or spaces, but formal ones. They are given to pure intuition because of a new `configuration', as Kant himself supports the metaphor that even though the senses `feel' that the sun revolves around the earth, it does not in fact do so `[Note 2]`.
    - > In this case, by discarding experience and senses, we can obtain a comprehensive judgment that the earth orbits the sun.
- > This space is prior to [[physical space]] (i.e., [[a priori]]). Note also the concern that if [[pure intuition]] is not possible, we fall into [[Humean scepticism]].
