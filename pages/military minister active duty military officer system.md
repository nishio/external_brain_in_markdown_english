[Under the Constitution of the Empire of Japan, only "active duty generals and lieutenant generals (or naval generals and lieutenant generals)" were allowed to serve as Minister of War and Minister of the Navy. This system required the consent of the military in order for the cabinet to be formed, and the military had a strong influence over the cabinet. As a result, the military, which was independent of the government, intervened in politics and weakened ### civilian control
.

On the other hand, ### [[civilian control]]
 is a system that prevents the military from running amok by having civilians (non-military government and parliament) assume control of the military. In democracies, the prevailing view is that the military should follow the policies of political leaders elected by the people, and systems such as the military ministerial active duty military officer system are at odds with this principle. After World War II, under Japan's new Constitution, civilian control was clarified and the military ministerial active duty system was abolished.
