title: "People who want to pretend they were involved in the project."

He says he was involved in Project P.
But the leader of Project P said, "What? Who was that?" He says.

These people are not uncommon.

        - [[I just participated, but I wasn't deeply involved.]]

To identify if the project leader was forgetting and terrible or if that person was embellishing the story, I asked him how he got involved in the project and then asked him some technical questions.
- He was slurred, so I decided he was probably bluffing.
- The people who actually implement it don't get flustered because they've been there themselves.
- You talk as if you've experienced what you haven't experienced, and it's fluff.

I just participated, but I wasn't deeply involved.
- There is a difference in the time cost paid for simply "participating" and "being deeply involved".
- It is good to "participate first" because without "[[participation]]" you cannot make a decision on whether or not you will be "[[deeply involved]]" in the future.
- But it is harmful for someone who "just participated" to act like someone who is "deeply involved".
    - It's the act of stealing the fruits of a successful project without "[[using one's own money]]."
- If you leave these types of people alone, they will think "stolen fruit is good" and stay forever to gain [[legitimacy through continuity]], so it's tricky.
- Should be a quick kick.
