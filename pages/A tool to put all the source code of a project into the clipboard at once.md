- I only use these things once in a while, so I'm like, "What's the name, where did I put it?"
- I can remember by what is written in Scrapbox, but it would be nice if an AI assistant could remember and do it for me.

I mean, I put [[Roo-Cline]] in there, so all I had to do was open it in VSCode and ask Cline.
- There's a slight difference in the way they behave.
    - Roo-Cline seems to try to grep and read it.
        - Can be considered a poor RAG for search
    - The Long Context approach of loading everything into o1 Pro is more advantageous (and o1 is smarter).
