title: "Attachment to a sense of value"

[[attachment]] to [[sense of value]].

Many people are not tolerant of thinking "X is not worth it" for something X that they have come to think is worth it.
- This is [[attachment]], so as an individual, you can just say, "[[Drop the attachment]]," but, well, most people can't do that, so the less strict [[Mahayana Buddhism]] has spread.
    - [[inertia]].

The fact that I have come to believe that I am worth X in the past distorts my sense of value in the present.
    - [[path dependency]]
    - It has a [[Concorde effect]] look to it.

- Difficult to [[unlearn]] the past
    - People without past accumulation are better able to make decisions without [[bias]].
    - A kind of [Ignorance is a resource
