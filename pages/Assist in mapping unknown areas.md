title: "Assist in mapping unknown areas"

- [[question]] : How can a program assist a human in the process of creating a [[conceptual map]] of an [[unknown field]]?

- What is [[Map]]?
- Frequently used in [[Scrapbox]] [[metaphor]] :.
    - 「 [[Roads are connected.]] 」
        - The idea of "[If only we could finally find it.
        - [[People remember places not by latitude and longitude, but by paths.]]

What does "[We know the map.
- You can predict where you will end up if you take this road #predict where you are going #predict
    - It allows you to explore without actually going on the road.
        - This is similar to [[Faster trial and error]] by [[Brain Models]] #model #trial and error
        - [[Discover the pathway]] to the destination by [[Brain Search]], and then follow the pathway to reach the destination #Explore #Pathway
- Does this also apply to [[conceptual map]]?
        - [[The Paradox of Search]]
        - If you know what you're looking for, the problem doesn't exist.
        - If you don't know what you're looking for, there's no way you can find it.
    - I don't understand "[[destination]]" in the case of the conceptual map.
        - If you know what you're looking for, you can find it by searching for keywords.
    - So what is grasping the conceptual map?
        - Possibly related to
                - [[associative connection]]
                - Unlike a physical map, the goal is not to reach a destination.
                    - The goal is to find a connection between two seemingly unconnected concepts
                - [[consistent association]]
                - To create a system that is consistent and large is an end in itself.
                    - [[knowledge consistency]]

I was thinking about it and this was born.
    - [[Scrapbox's Box display is a bundled sticky note]]
