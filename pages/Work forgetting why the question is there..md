title: "Work forgetting why the question is there."
---

    - [[template]] Walking alone
- I feel like I've done some work once I've filled out the template.
- Thinking to fill in is important from a quality standpoint.
    - People who are in the habit of thinking subconsciously think about the meaning of the question when they see a template question statement.
    - If you're not in the habit of thinking, just answer the question and fill in the [blank space
        - They may misunderstand the meaning of the question.
        - They may unconsciously switch to questions that are easier to answer.
        - They sometimes leave it blank, saying things like, "I don't understand the question."
        - Nothing is created by simply answering questions that are easy to answer.

- [[inception deck]] and [[lean canvas]] are good templates, but I don't understand why some people think that just filling them in without learning why they were created will magically create something better.

- An example of [[On the ritualization of means]]?

- [[framework]]
