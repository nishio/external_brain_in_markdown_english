title: "I'm not going to pretend I understand."

If you [[borrowed word]] and "[[acting like one understands]]" to a phenomenon, the development of your thinking about the phenomenon stops there.

Why is this so?
    - [[pretending to understand]] to trick themselves into thinking that the phenomenon has been explained in words.
- But that "word" is "floating in the midair" and "of [[rootless grass]]" and "poorly linked to [[other words]]," so there is no development from putting it into words.

Maybe the words should be, "[[I don't know yet]]" or "[[I'm]] not sure how to put it into words."
