title: "Supplement to Why Invest in Intellectual Production Techniques?"
---

I made a sticky to write in "[Why invest in intellectual production techniques?

    - [[Luddite]] Exercise 1811-1817
    - Is it right to increase production?
    - Socks are more likely to be mass-produced.
    - Increased productivity leads to oversupply.
    - If you are productive faster than others, you get paid more than others.
    - The same behavior by those around you results in no advantage.

- There is no point in efficiently producing something that does not lead to customer value.
    - You can't efficiently produce what your customers don't want.
        - [[Lean Startup]]
- Customer value, not quantity
- Understanding cost of customer value
- As the evolution of programming languages increases the efficiency of program production, the relative importance of the ability to determine "[[what should be made]]" will increase.
- Productivity gains from programming languages have also increased the productivity of the programming language itself, which is a tool for improving that productivity.

- Approach to increase quality and speed by doing the same thing over and over again → exterminated
- Questioning assumptions [[double-loop learning]].
    - The task of questioning assumptions and breaking repetitive loops remains a difficult task to mechanize.
    - Learn unfamiliar areas
    - Ability to learn what no one knows the right answer to yet.

    - Sustained improvement = good?
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/5f056c4f1d97516aa8f0be2ae1c0c70d/thumb/1000)

        - penetrate
            - [[Sustained Improvement]] is good in the beginning when customer needs are not yet being met, but as it continues, it will eventually penetrate the [[Clouds of customer needs]] and come out on top.
        - Until now, "[[what was considered good]]" has replaced "not good" over time.
            - [[disruptive innovation]]

- [[Jobs to be lost to AI]]
