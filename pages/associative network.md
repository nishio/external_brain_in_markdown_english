    - from  [[Knowledge Network]]
        - > The locations of X and Y are not fixed; they approach and move away from each other. If the link is connected when they get closer, they can follow the link and move faster when they move away.
    - from  [[System is a knowledge network that can be raised or lowered in abstraction.]]
        - >  [[Fast movement within the knowledge network]] will reduce the time it takes to search for knowledge
        - > A shorter search time improves the time to find useful knowledge for a given external situation and the probability of success.
