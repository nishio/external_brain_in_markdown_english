title: "anti-big business disease"
---

- The term "anti-big business disease" is likely to be misinterpreted in the delimited position, so good language is required.
- Not "anti (big business) disease" but "(anti big business) disease."

- Of those who begin their careers in large companies, some quit large companies because they cannot adapt to the environment for one reason or another.
- Then join a smaller company or start your own business.
- Matching of types of work per se is simply a way of working
- Preferable that mismatches are eliminated to make it easier to work.
- But if it's just a mismatch resolution, the relationship between large companies and individuals is neutral, but it can be negative.
- Why does this happen?

- A bias that wants to justify your past choices makes you want to pretend that the big companies were bad.
- Argument that the other party was wrong, and therefore you are good.
- Typical [[Sklavenmoral (slave morality, as a philosophical concept of Nietzsche)]] composition
