According to Pareto's theory, there are different mentalities within the [[elite]] class, and there are two types: the "speculator" and the "renter.
- [[speculator]] (speculator)
    - [[Progressive]] and more inclined to seek [[reform]].
        - Emphasis on [[New Ideas]] and [[innovation]] ("[[Class I residues]]" as Pareto calls them).
- [Renter
        - [[conservative]] and have a strong preference for [[stability]].
        - Emphasis on [[tradition]] and [[stable]] values ("[[Class II residues]]").

According to Pareto, a healthy society is one in which these two types alternate in power so that society maintains [[a balance between innovation and stability]].
