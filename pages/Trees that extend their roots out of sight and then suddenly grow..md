title: "Trees that extend their roots out of sight and then suddenly grow."
---

metaphor
- [[Growing roots where you can't see them]].
    - [[grows roots]]
            - [[root (of a tooth, hair, etc.)]]
    - [[roots invisible]]
- [[one moment of sudden growth]].
    - [[Fastest growing]]
        - [[Create an engine for exponential growth]]
    - [[metaphor for vegetative growth]].
    - [[trees and shrubs]]

After some time [[three variables of the game]] connected.
- [[continues to grow roots over time]].
- [[branching out quickly when the opportunity presents itself]].
    - To use a plant metaphor, when a neighboring tree falls and creates a new gap, it is important to quickly extend a branch there and take it first!
        - If we take this back to humans, we're talking about taking that position when humans die, but we're thinking too narrowly.
        - Maybe that's because the land on which plants grow doesn't increase or spread.
        - Reality [[position]] is widening and narrowing
                - [[Take a position before others see the value.]]
- [[The power to grow branches comes from putting down roots.]]
