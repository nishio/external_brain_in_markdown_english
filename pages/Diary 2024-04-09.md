<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The main flow from April 6 to April 9, 2024 is as follows
- Jason Entenmann will be working on editing, updating AI-related images, page layout, updating the cover, adding endorsements, adding an index section, and adding a credits section.
- nishio asked for an up-to-date PDF for indexing, and Jason Entenmann informed him that it is currently being worked on in docx format.
- GlenWeyl directed that the pagination of the text be finalized as a top priority, with the intention of having it completed by the end of April 10, so that indexing could begin on April 12.
- nishio developed a code to extract the text from the PDF and check for the presence of keywords. Hyphenation and line breaks were completed, but it was found that about 50 keywords across pages were missing.
- nishio creates code to search for keywords only within the specified section and outputs only the first occurrence of keywords that appear on consecutive pages, and generates an index.
- GlenWeyl and Jason Entenmann agreed to extend the deadline by one day in order to concentrate on editing the text and providing it to nishio.
