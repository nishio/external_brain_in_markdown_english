The [[nonsense]] of [[illusory capital]].
transactions
Exchanging something X that you do not value for something Y that you do value.
X<Y in terms of value to me, so I'd trade myself.
The value to the other party is X>Y, so the exchange takes place.
A decision based on whether or not it's crap to you is only seeing one side of the deal.

Your point about illusory capital provides deep insight into the boundary between subjectivity and objectivity in market economies and transactions. Transactions in the marketplace are often viewed as objective value exchange mechanisms, but in reality they are heavily influenced by individual subjectivity.

## Concept of illusory capital
.
Illusory capital refers to assets or commodities that people perceive as having value when they actually have little or no value. This concept suggests that collective beliefs and expectations about a particular commodity or asset artificially inflate its value. The term "triviality" here refers to the state of being overvalued compared to the real value or utility of the asset.

## subjectivity of the transaction
.
In a transaction, it is a common phenomenon for one party to exchange something that he or she does not value for something that is of value to him or her. In this process, each party decides to exchange based on its own sense of value. This is where intersubjectivity comes into play, and there is a perception that what is of value to the other party may be of less value to you. The exchange takes place because each party perceives a different value in what the other party is offering.

Illusion capital is crap, illusion capital is crap, but whether you think it is crap is subjective, and market transactions are established by differences in subjective values. So the claim that "illusion capital is crap" [Seemingly objective claims are clinging to personal desires.
- When Mr. A sees the phenomenon of "Mr. B has a crappy X and Mr. C buys it at a higher price" and says "X is crappy" [[envy]].
