title: "Books that affirm majority values are of low value."
---

A book that only affirms the values of the majority is comfortable for the majority as "it affirms my feelings!" But since it only affirms the values that the individual already has, it does not bring any new learning.

Some people are proud of [[the amount of reading]] they have done by reading a lot of such books.

- [[Majority Values]]
- [[Affirmation of values]]
