Speech at [[Nico Nico Ultra Conference]] in 2012

[Why did you make it that far, the developer community's different kind of fighting "Cho-Engineer Meeting" 100 series of engineers, Japan Ruby Association, java-ja: Cho-Engineer Meeting" Report Day1 (2/2 page) - ＠IT [https://atmarkit.itmedia.co.](https://atmarkit.itmedia.co.) jp/ait/articles/1206/14/news129_2.html]
- > "When to realize an idea?" is a difficult question for working people. The number of "someday I'll do it" things just keeps growing.
- > But "I'm not motivated". So he decided to "look for a replacement. Using the [[crowdsourcing]] service "[[oDesk]]", I posted the work I wanted done and received applications from all over the world. Among them, he decided to ask a programmer in Ukraine to work on the UI of the iPad/iPhone app, and asked him to prepare functions that would be called in CG rendering.
- > Nishio says there was much to be gained from this personal experience. He asked himself, "What can I do that I can't do myself? How can I explain to others what I want to do? What kind of parts can I have made and how can I apply them? [How much can I pay?
- > Mr. Nishio himself is a programmer, but he says, "If you ask someone who knows a lot about it, they can do it better than you can in less time than you can. [Knowledge is a valuable resource. And he added, "You get to experience it from a different perspective. What kind of application is not good enough? You can think from the opposite perspective of a programmer". And "I feel the fear of [[globalization]]. In India or Indonesia, the starting salary for a college graduate is 20-30,000 per year, what's different for me?" [[emphasis in original]].
- > Nishio thus says from his own experience, "One way not to get salty is to get people from all over the world to help you. The benefits are greater than expected. Time, motivation, and knowledge are valuable resources," he concluded.

It reminds me of Mr. Teramoto's talk in "[[How was it using Devin? Case Studies and Key Points for Introduction]]" about how when work and one's own project run side by side, one's own project tends to be neglected, and that's what AI agents can do. It reminds me of what Mr. Teramoto said in "Case Studies and Key Points for Introduction".
