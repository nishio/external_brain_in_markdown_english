title: "Deviation from the mean and sample size"
---

    - [[Daniel Kahneman]] "[[fast and slow]] - how do you decide what your intentions are?"
- > (p.160) "A study of the incidence of serious kidney disease in 3,141 counties across the United States found a striking [[pattern]]. Most of the counties with the lowest incidence rates are in rural areas of the Midwest, South, and West, with low population densities and traditionally Republican strongholds."
- However, the same characteristics are also present in areas where the rate of occurrence is high.
- Low population density = small sample size This is just the result of "deviation from the average".

### digest
.
Regarding the results of Daniel Kahneman's "Fast & Slow" study of kidney disease incidence across the U.S., a pattern was observed that while the areas with the lowest incidence rates were rural, the areas with the highest incidence rates were rural as well. This may be the result of "deviation from the average" in areas with low population density (small sample size).

### Relation to fragment X
.
The fragment "What is Learning? Engineered Thinking and Principles," illustrates the importance of hypothesis testing, using the results of Kahneman's "Fast & Slow" study of the incidence of kidney disease as an example. This fragment is directly related to the content of the notebook and shows that learning opportunities arise through the process of hypothesis testing.

### deep thinking
This note and Fragment X illustrate the importance of understanding the impact of sample size and proper hypothesis testing during data analysis. In particular, it is important to note that data analysis in areas with low population densities is prone to large deviations from the mean due to small sample sizes.
