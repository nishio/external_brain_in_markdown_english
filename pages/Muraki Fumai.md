- Research Institute of Carbon Capture Technology offers subs for "HIYASHI" CO2 capture system for home and office use.
- Experts have pointed out problems with the performance of the equipment
- The main criticism is that CO2 emissions during manufacturing and use may be higher than CO2 emissions to be recovered.
- Mr. Kazumi Muraki, representative of the Organization, admits that the calculation of CO2 emissions has not been completed and the method of processing the recovered CO2 has not yet been decided.
- Experts say that it is premature to start subs in a stage where the balance of environmental impact is unclear.
- Mr. Muraki opposes research stagnation, emphasizing the importance of making people aware of the existence of the CO2 capture system.
- Mr. Muraki, 23, has attracted attention since his student days and has served as a member of various ministries and agencies.
- He talks about his vision to make it a large research institute in 30 years.

- The Carbon Capture and Recovery Research Institute (CRRA) launched the "Maitan Supporter" program, which grants advertising space to companies and individuals who have installed the CO2 capture system "HIYASHI", based on the amount of CO2 captured.
- HIYASHI is the world's smallest CO2 capture device invented by the head of the organization, Kazumi Muraki, when he was 17 years old.
- Under the "Maitan Supporter" program, collected CO2 is converted into carbon dioxide miles, which can then be used to promote CRRA on the official CRRA website and CRRA International Television (CITV).
- Within five years, CRRA plans to run public transportation systems on fuel synthesized from CO2 and broadcast CITV on board.
- Aiming to create a system in which CO2 recovery becomes a new "value" and miles are accumulated as "compensation".
- CRRA is planning and preparing to operate transportation by rail, ship, and aircraft
- Supporter benefits include the awarding of certificates and logo placement on the official CRRA website.

- Kazumi Muraki was inspired by Stephen Hawking's adventure novels when he was in the fourth grade and began studying carbon dioxide with the aim of realizing a migration to Mars
- By the time he was a junior in high school, he had completed the basic mechanism of the CO2 capture device "HIYASHI

- HIYASHI" is an alkaline solution that absorbs CO2 and helps improve concentration in offices and schools
- For familiarity, the system is equipped with artificial intelligence to enable conversation and facial expressions.
- Focusing on CO2 reduction by 2030, while at the same time aiming for manned flights to the moon and Mars

- Kazekai Muraki, a chemist born in 2000, has continued his carbon dioxide research despite 10 years of denial.
- In the fourth grade, he became interested in emigrating to Mars and began researching technology to convert CO2, which makes up 95% of the Martian atmosphere, into oxygen.
- Shifted to research on direct capture of CO2 from the air after learning the seriousness of global warming
- As a member of Generation Z, I see this as my own problem living in the 22nd century and not something that is far in the future.
- Because his research was outside the highways of chemistry, he was long incomprehensible and in denial.
- Believing in myself and overcoming denial with a willingness to give it a try, I was selected for a program offered by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, which was a turning point for me.
- The company is working to broaden the scope of chemistry and make it more accessible, including the development of products with familiar names.
- Believing that doing what you love as much as you love will benefit society, and not being afraid to be different from those around you, you are pushing forward.
