title: "Unofficial design"
---

> [@LWITBR1906](https://twitter.com/LWITBR1906/status/1668750981956501505?s=20): Two years ago, I created an "internal Twitter" channel on slack. I was a long-established small and medium-sized manufacturer with a maximal allergy to slack, and in the beginning there was an empty timeline with no one posting but me, and I even made a rule to force everyone to post, but it was full of "made to do" feeling, so it didn't go very well at all. ...

- [[forced posting]].

> [@tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1668879824780394498?s=46&t=gkSZtjGEtUZPO0JCzBxCBw): I'm starting the channel name with 00 and trying to put it at the top of the sort order. I have a bad feeling that I'm trying to be at the top of the sort order.
> I'd like to see something that doesn't matter to me flow through the channel, but it's at the top of the list, so that's stressful for those who work there.
> You wouldn't want a smoking room in the middle of the Oval Office, would you?
>  Then the channel name should start with a z or something.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1668900912457465856) Hmmm, I feel like the definition of "Twitter" is misaligned between the CEO and the employees.
>  Personal Twitter is fine for things like "I'm pooped" or something like that.
>  So, the president's Twitter must sparkle with publicity for the company.

>  It looks like you've been doing it without taking care of that gap and it's been quiet.

By the way, the opening tweet is actually a long folded sentence, and the rest of it says
- > After two years of talking about the significance of this project, more and more people started to follow, one or two at a time, and now it seems that a culture of natural sharing has developed among everyone. If everyone could get to know each other better on a daily basis, the company and work would become more enjoyable. It also depends on our own actions.
- I don't know if it's intentional or just a mistake.
