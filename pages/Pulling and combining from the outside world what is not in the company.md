title: "Pulling and combining from the outside world what is not in the company"
---

>  What [[Cybozu]] has not been able to do so far is having the effect of branches growing all at once by people who are doing multiple jobs. The economist Schumpeter defines innovation as "[[new combination]]. Double-duty is precisely what creates that new combination, isn't it? [Pulling and combining from the outside world what is not in the company" is what innovation is all about. I hope that people will do double jobs in worlds I don't know about and accelerate innovation ([Aono](http://mydeskteam.com/casefile/1887/)).
