Unused knowledge is structured.
- Unused knowledge = fragments that were not used in this presentation material."
- This one was also initially created from a "may use" situation, not knowing if it would be used or not.
- There was a process of structuring before it became clear that "this is used, this is not used".

- Process for preparing materials for this presentation
    - I'm at a loss as to "how do I explain the benefits of grouping?"
    - Injecting information from another source in its entirety
        - Contains "stickies that are very relevant" and "stickies that would never be used as they are in lecture materials.
    - Organize it.

- Fill stickies from maps organized for other purposes.
- Mix it with the sticky notes of this time and spatial arrangement
- You will know if it is beneficial for the purpose of this project, and you will be able to isolate the parts that are not beneficial.
It would be nice if the process could be assisted or information could be recorded that

- Unwanted can be found in [[posterior]].

- Even if not used for this purpose, the structuring task until it is known is useful and should be reused
