Workshop Garden
The effect of the allies gives the mansion and the sesame seeds a +2 win advantage.
Gomazuri's "discard 3 coins for 3 coins" alleviates the problem of a hand full of victory points at the end of the garden strategy.

38:37 come-from-behind win with a stuffed dominion "buy farmland and destroy gold to make it genus" in a 30:37, copper-3 gold-2, 9-coin situation when the opponent from 30:30 buys a genus mansion.

I still think that the versus game is not efficient in terms of "efficiency of learning" because I remember well what I won, but when it didn't go well, I can't reflect well on "why it didn't go well".
