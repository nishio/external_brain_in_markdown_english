Sleeping oracle 2023-08-31
- [[What we know, what we don't know, pretending to understand, trust in honesty]]
- Today's [[oracle that predicts the next day's events]].
- It's like it's fragmented in the beginning, but it's getting more and more specific and maybe getting into a different topic than the main part.
    - I cut out the second half on a separate page.
- I was going to include a specific example, but I couldn't organize it right.
- In terms of unconscious context, it's definitely a [[Yukito Emaya]] connection.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1696885684508766374/quick_promote_web/intro) I'm reading a history book for middle school students. It is clear that I misunderstood the social contract. The social contract is not an exchange style C contract, but an exchange style B exchange.  [[How to Read History]]
- I did a quick search and found a [[hilarious]] description of [Exchange Form D
    - Or post a square diagram of everyone the same way.
        - [When you don't understand it, all you can do is quote it.
- There is a book out there in the style of "Reading "~"
        - [[Read "The Structure of World History."]]
        - [[Read "Power and Exchange Styles" by Yukito Karatani]]
    - In those books, the person himself gives a brief summary commentary
    - From these books, I learned that there is a PDF "[[Introduction to Exchange Styles]]" that can be read online, and a commentary "[[How to Read History]]" for middle school students.
- I trust the ideas of Yukito Emaya in the field of world history, but not in the field of Ethereum.
        - [[paradigm shift]] due to [[alternation of generations]] is likely to occur
