Denominator unknown until 100% understood.
The more time spent, the higher the value tends to be.
This is an inappropriate measure from the point of view of

On the other hand, expressions such as "I read too fast and lost my understanding" are useful.
I was wondering how this gap could be filled,
The denominator here is "comprehension", not "all the information in the book".
It would be more appropriate to think of it as "time."
In other words, isn't it "the amount of understanding gained per unit of time"?
