They both look funny to me.
    - [[Knowledge is a good that belongs to the individual.]] So "grow it" is synonymous with "give me money."
    - It's crazy to think you can get it just by claiming it.
    - If you want to draw investment in nurturing, you need to explain the benefits of that investment.
    - If you can't give it to them, they have to grow up on their own.
    - You don't have the option of not growing up because you can't give it to them, it's only a loss to you.
    - You are responsible for your own development see [[Take responsibility for your own productivity gains]].
- You can raise them and they can quit."
    - Being able to quit is the problem in the first place.
    - Knowledge is a good that belongs to the individual, so it is lost to the company when he quits. Naturally.
    - Changing jobs involves costs of finding a new job, etc.
    - A situation where the person who raised you pays that cost and then moves on to a new job.
    - Grown-up talent is given only inferior treatment compared to their market value.
