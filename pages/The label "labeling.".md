title: 'The label "labeling."'
---

>  Suppose an activist is promoting something, and someone who finds it offensive can point out that it is an old person's activity, while the activist can criticize the activity by saying why is it old? That one would be labeled and be an old person.

This can be done in a simpler form, unrelated to the word old, and it goes like this:.
- If Mr. A says that Mr. B's behavior is 'labeling,
- Mr. B can say that Mr. A's behavior is 'labeled.

from  [[Three elements of senile behavior]]
Labeling as "[[labeling]]"

- It's not a [[boomerang joke]], but it's a structure (should this concept have a name? [[boomerang-like structure]]?
