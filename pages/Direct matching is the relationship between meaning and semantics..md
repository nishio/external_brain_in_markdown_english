title: "Direct matching is the relationship between meaning and semantics."
---

There are expressions that appear to be [[direct comparison]] of symbols and meanings, or direct matching of symbols to symbols.
It's also in "Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning." I have written that many times myself.

This just omits the implicit RECOGNITION.
- Because RECOGNITION links symbols and meanings one-to-one, even if you write something in a symbol-checked style, you can identify what you are referring to without any room for misunderstanding.
