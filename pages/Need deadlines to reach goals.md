title: "Need deadlines to reach goals"
---

- seemingly paradoxical
    - [[Time Constraints]] I think I can make something better without the constraints than with them.
- This "[[I think I can make a good one.]]" is wicked.
- In trying to make something good, we set our goals very far away #faraway goals
    - Need to get closer to the goal to [[reaching]], but [[pride]] and others get in the way
- So it is better to have [[deadline]] as an external constraint
    - [Trying to make things better from the start.

- [[Without deadlines, you're running toward a very distant goal that you won't reach.]]
