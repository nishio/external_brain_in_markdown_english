title: "Maybe we should stop working when we feel busy."

- [[busy]] Maybe that's when you should [[stop working]] when you feel like it.

It's really important to step away from the work for a while.
- [[Task Priority]] is going haywire.

And the first thing that's funny is that the LT preparation for the unexplored night is the top priority, and you've forgotten all about it cleanly.
And you forgot to apply for a day off work.
I've got two messages I need to write with my head, and I need to think about that one.
You forget that, too, and you're handling the requests that come in with top priority, which is obviously not right.

Maybe we should stop working when we feel busy.

I'm thinking about introducing [[jogging]] as a "forced time away from work."
I mean, if I put on a headset and talk while jogging, should I be written down?
