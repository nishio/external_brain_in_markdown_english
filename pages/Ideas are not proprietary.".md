- Probably misattribute

It is likely that someone has summarized and translated Kevin Kelly's ideas (e.g., "[[Information becomes more valuable the more it is shared]]" and "[[Information is a commons-like entity]]") into a phrase that has become widespread.

- [[Stewart Brand]] "[[Information wants to be free]]."
- [[John Perry Barlow]]'s [[critique of intellectual property rights]].
- Kelly himself has expressed the idea of emphasizing the "shareability" of knowledge and information in essays such as "[[Because]] copies are becoming free, we must sell value other than copying" ("[[Better Than Free]]").

This idea is discussed in detail in his book, "What Comes After the Internet," chapter 5, "Access Rights Over Ownership.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>Historically, [[Thomas Jefferson]], one of America's founding fathers, is often cited as a prime example of the assertion that "[[ideas]] are not proprietary. In an 1813 letter, he argued that ideas and knowledge are not exclusively enclosed, stating that "[[t]]he receipt of one's ideas by another does not diminish the ideas in one's possession.

In modern times, [[Richard Stallman]]([[Richard Stallman]]), who advocated the [[free software movement]], [[Lawrence Lessig]]([[Lawrence Lessig]]), who launched the [[Creative Commons]], and **open access Aaron Swartz**, who promoted [[open access]], and others have further developed the idea that "ideas and knowledge should be made public in order to increase the commons ([[shared knowledge]]) of humanity as a whole. These ideas generally lead to the argument that "information is a public good and should not be monopolized only by individuals or companies.
