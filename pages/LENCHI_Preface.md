We are in the midst of a dramatic evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI that understands and generates language, and LLMs such as ChatGPT have the potential to go beyond mere conversation and writing tools to transform intellectual production itself.

For many years, I have been working to improve the intellectual productivity of individuals and teams; in my 2013 book, "The Art Behind Coding," I rethought the intellectual production of programming from the aspect of language, and in my 2018 book, "The Intellectual Production of Engineers," I tried to present a universal technique that is not limited to engineering, but is applicable to all intellectual In 2018, I attempted to present a universal technique that is applicable to all intellectual production, not just engineering.

As an extension of this awareness, LLMs have suddenly appeared before my eyes as an aid, and sometimes even a substitute, for human intellectual production. This should be an opportunity to rethink the nature of intellectual production itself. As someone who has been looking at the relationship between language and intellectual production and exploring its universal techniques, I cannot help but see the advent of LLM as an excellent opportunity to advance my own research in a big way.

In this book, we will explore the possibilities of practically using LLM in our own intellectual production. My skills as a programmer, my curiosity as a researcher, and my sense of language as an author. I, a man of many faces, will share with you the process of exploring a new way of intellectual production through dialogue and collaboration with LLM.

This book is neither a book of know-how filled with examples nor a book of grandiose theories. Rather, it is a record of one professional's struggle to evolve his own intellectual production by "mastering" LLM, and should be called a trail of an experiment to reexamine the essence of intellectual production and create a new form of it.

Now, let's take LLM with us and break new ground in intellectual production.
