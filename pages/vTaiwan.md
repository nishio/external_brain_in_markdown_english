<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>vTaiwan is an online platform established by the Taiwanese government to promote citizen participation. It is primarily used as a forum for gathering and debating citizens' opinions on [[public policy]] and legislation. The platform operates as part of [[open government]] and [[digital democracy]] and aims to improve transparency and participatory democracy.

Specific features include the following
- Collection of diverse opinions: Citizens can freely contribute their opinions and participate in discussions.
- Transparency: the process and results of the debate will be made public.
- Use of technology: Efficient exchange of ideas is carried out using digital tools.

This will make it easier for citizens' voices to be reflected in policy decisions and to engage in a more active dialogue with the government.
