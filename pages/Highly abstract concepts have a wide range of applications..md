title: "Highly abstract concepts have a wide range of applications."
---

Story 1
- So we need to increase the abstraction of [[concrete experience]] and turn it into [[knowledge]].


Story 2
- The higher the level of abstraction, the wider the range of application.
    - If you have a lot of things you want to do and you can't separate them, you'll come up with an abstract solution to be able to do them all.
        - [[I think in high abstraction when I have a lot of things I want to do]].
    - As a result, we are too far away from [[specific requirements]] and have fewer [[decision-making cues]].
- concrete example
    - Obsidian is more flexible for expansion than Scrapbox
    - → "high degree of freedom for expansion" is vague, so make it a little clearer what kind of expansion you want to do.
    - →I want to extend the View.
    - →We want to replace what was originally translated into English and published at a rate of once a day (because there are specific problems with what we do in Scrapbox, such as the inability to do machine translation).
    - → That is, I'd like a place to host things after automatic English translation.
        - I wonder if the same mechanism could be used to host the Japanese version, or if new features could be added along the way.

- [[The higher the level of abstraction, the fewer tools we can use.]]

[[Highly abstract]] concepts [[have a wide range of applications]].
- [[The higher the level of abstraction, the wider the range of application.]]
- The higher the [[abstraction]], the wider the [[application]] range.
