title: "I want to give the new version of Regroup a different name."
---

Regroup is a reimplementation of "grouping," which is inconvenient on paper and can be done electronically, hence the name.
In the new implementation, we felt that the grouping was not good as it is now, and that the current grouping was not the core of the functionality, so we considered giving it a different name.
Next action: Write down the current functionality and clarify what is essential.

- Is there anything else about this "Regroup"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Originally, the focus was on grouping, hence the name, but the more I used it, the more I felt grouping was not the essence.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the "essence" of this "essence"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I'm tentatively reading it now as a tool for organizing my head, but it doesn't feel quite right.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I think it's important to have the freedom to move it two-dimensionally.

- How do you know about this "tool"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>At first, it was a system of writing out and making stickies with this tool, and grouping and bundling them, with the image of the KJ method. As I made and used the previous version, I understood it better, and Keicho started to support the writing out part, especially the folding function.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's good to have a clear head, and probably a lot of extra features now.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's like a receptacle that catches the bits and pieces that come out of your head without spilling.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>You want to write it down and empty it out and focus on other activities because if you keep it in your head, it's a blur.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>First there is.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>by nature

- What do you hope will happen regarding this "tool"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I'm thinking of making a new version, but I feel like it's not a good idea to drag the old name around, and I need a good word to describe what I'm going to make.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to the "tool" for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I guess it's about cutting down on functionality.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What "function" is that "function"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Currently, I've put in too many things that I thought would be nice to have, so maybe I should write them down and organize them.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Writing out the features to be kept: make it a sticky, move it two-dimensionally, draw on it with a pen, zoom, make the sticky bigger, need a different form from the current implementation regarding grouping, making it a block that can be moved together is beneficial, the ability to fold it is inadequate
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is its "function"?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's like stationery, you can use it to help you think, but now it's scattered all over your desk, including the ones that are hard to use, and it's making your desk harder to use.

Right now the pen function of Regroup is broken, so to speak, and the pen is left out of ink, which is not good. For stress-free use, it must be a small number of well-maintained stationery.
