Balloon Menu

- I want a balloon menu near the selection.
- I'd like to get it out,
    - Drawing a balloon menu."
    - The balloon menu will take any event that occurs on the canvas while the balloon menu is out."

- Menu items you would like to serve on the balloon menu
    - Styling, cutting, copying, deleting, grouping
    - Clicking on a sticky
        - deletion

The balloon menu will take any event that occurs on the canvas while the balloon menu is out."
- There is also a way to float the DOM on top instead of writing it in Canvas.
- Same as the Edit Div that comes up from below when adding a sticky.
