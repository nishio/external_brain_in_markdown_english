It is clearer if we take the following as a set

terminology core
- [Pareto optimal (efficiency): There is no room to improve someone without making them worse off (i.e., there is no further "one-sided improvement").
    - [[trade-off]]: A relationship in which the only way to increase one objective (good X) is to decrease another objective (good Y). Costs are expressed as opportunity costs.
    - [[production possibility frontier]] (PPF): the "outer edge" of production that can be reached with a given resource and technology. The inside is attainable but inefficient, the outside is not.

Relationship between the three parties (intuitionized with 2 goods)
1. on PPF = Pareto optimal (production side)
    - At any given point in the PPF, the only way to increase X a little more is to decrease Y. Hence, "making someone better off without making anyone worse off" is not possible, and is Pareto efficient in the production sense.
    - Conversely, points inside the PPF have room to increase both goods at the same time (= [[pareto improvement]]) because of resource wastage.
2. trade-off = PPF slope
    - The slope (absolute value) of the PPF is the marginal rate of conversion MRT = |dY/dX|.
    - This indicates "the amount of Y given up to increase X by one unit" = opportunity cost.
    - Since the PPF usually expands outward (concave with respect to the origin), the more inputs are made, the higher the opportunity cost = increasing opportunity cost.
- Frontier as a "Pareto optimal set
    - From a multi-objective optimization perspective, the "Pareto frontier" of the feasible set corresponds to the PPF: each point on the PPF cannot be "simultaneously outperformed in all objectives" by any other feasible point.

Which points are socially "desirable" (if we include even consumption)
- Which points on the PPF are chosen depends on the preference ([[indifference curve]]) and weighting.
- In the standard model, the social optimum (welfare maximum) is at the point where the **non-discrimination curve and PPF meet (MRS = MRT)**.

important point
    - [[economies of scale]], [[discontinuities]], and [[externalities]] may cause the PPF to be broken and nonconvex, and the strength of the tradeoff may change in jumps.
- Beyond two goods, the PPF is a higher dimensional surface, but the above relationship can be generalized directly.

In short:
PPF is the "outer edge of the possible set" = the Pareto optimal set, whose slope gives the tradeoff (opportunity cost/MRT). Moving from the inside to the outside edge is Pareto improvement.
