title: "unverbalized"
---

Unlanguageized" is an unfamiliar word in Japanese (Google search: 580 results).
I saw GPT4 use it and found it useful as a compact expression of "not yet verbalized".

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The term "unverbalized" literally means "[[unverbalized]]." The term often refers to thoughts, feelings, and experiences that are not expressed through words or language.

Below are the main concepts and contexts related to "unverbalized":
- Senses and Experiences: There are certain sensations and experiences that we experience that, for whatever reason, we cannot or find it difficult to put into words. This is especially true when a new experience or sensation cannot be described in conventional words or frameworks.
- Emotions: Emotions and feelings are always difficult to accurately express in words and sometimes transcend language. For example, deep sadness, joy, fear, and love are often not adequately conveyed by words alone.
- [[Tacit knowledge]]: This refers to [[experiential knowledge]] or [[intuition]] knowledge, which is often difficult to express in language. Examples include physical skills such as how to ride a bike or swim, or the ability to "[[read the situation]]" of a culture.
- Art and music: Art and music are often used as a means of communicating feelings and experiences beyond words. This allows artists and musicians to share "unverbalized" sensations and experiences through their work.

The concept of [[unverbalization]] is very interesting in terms of how people understand and share their experiences, feelings, and knowledge with others. Understanding the limitations of words and language also reaffirms the importance of ways to communicate through [[nonverbal means]].

[[LLM coined the term]].
