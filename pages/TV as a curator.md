title: "TV as a curator"

> [nagise](https://x.com/nagise/status/1805779265537163619) There is a lot of news in the world, and TV only shows news selected by a curator called TV, and the curator's intention is strongly reflected. The curator's will is strongly reflected in the news.

>  I think that's what is called "TV-independence". I think this is what is known as "TV-independence", and that even if certain video content is a pinpoint hit, it doesn't seem to be supported as a whole by the curators.

> [nagise](https://x.com/nagise/status/1805805377751335169) Well, I understand that everyone's interests are so broad that it's impossible to deal with a wide range of general topics in a finite amount of time in the news.
