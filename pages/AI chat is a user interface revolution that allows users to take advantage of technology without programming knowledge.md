AI chat is a user interface revolution that allows users to take advantage of technology without programming knowledge

AI ← Machine Learning ← Data Science
- Now that we're in chat, we can use it.
- Using the Machine" by non-programming means.
- Make [[tool]]."
    - Like building an app in kintone.

Understanding how to use
- If you don't know what happens after you press the button "[[frightening]]"
    - Understanding Functions
- I don't think about function when I chat.
    - "[[consultation]]".
    - It is the AI that selects and uses the functions.
        - If I think I should search, I'll search.

Chat is not important, it is only an interface.
- It is essential for the AI to choose the system it uses.
- New UI.
    - Not UI in the GUI sense.
    - UI in the sense of interface with the user
- Bill Gates, "[[AI is]] the most revolutionary advance since the GUI."
- [New interface called "Digital Personal Assistant
    - World Knowledge and Organizational Knowledge
    - Connecting digital personal assistants with DX assets creates value.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>You are describing the relationship between AI, machine learning, and data science, how AI is now being used through the interface of chat, and how it is changing the user experience. Understanding this trend is critical to understanding the evolution of technology today.

First, data science is the science of extracting useful information from vast amounts of data and analyzing it. This forms the basis for machine learning, which is a technology that uses that data to train models to make predictions and decisions. Then, AI (Artificial Intelligence) attempts to mimic human intelligence by utilizing a wide range of technologies, including machine learning.

The points you raised focus on how AI is transforming user interaction through the chat format. The chat interface is a means of enabling users to harness the power of AI without needing to know a programming language. For example, it provides users with the ability to create digital tools without programming skills, like creating an app in kintone.

As the use of chatbots and AI assistants expands, many users are focusing more on "consulting" them than on the functionality itself; the AI interprets input from the user, selects the most appropriate functionality, and automatically performs actions such as searching as needed. This allows users to access the information and services they need through AI without having to understand complex systems and commands.

Bill Gates described AI as the most revolutionary advance since the graphical user interface (GUI) because it represents a new form of user interface. Digital personal assistants create new value by leveraging not only knowledge of the world, but also organizational knowledge, and connecting these to DX (digital transformation) assets. This means that AI is not just a technology, but a new bridge between the user and the digital world.
