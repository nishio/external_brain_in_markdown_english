title: "People can think without using language."
---

I feel that when people say things like, "Humans think using language" or "It is impossible to think without using language," it is just an introduction to the fact that you can't do it.
    - [[the subject is large]]
    - [[It's just a self-introduction.]]
    - [[empirically self-evident]]
