> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1934892103567585443) [OTC story: Is it appropriate to exclude coverage for asthma medications?
>
>  There is a lot of talk about asthma medications that may be excluded from insurance coverage in the future. Since this discussion may actually include some misunderstandings, we would like to explain this point and introduce "Team Mirai's" policy to "protect patients' health and lower healthcare costs while utilizing technology".
>
>  First of all, many people argue that it is outrageous that asthma medications are taken off insurance, but this may contain a misunderstanding. We are discussing whether or not the drug salbutamol is taken off the list of asthma medications, not all asthma medications are taken off insurance.
>
>  In addition, asthma medications are broadly classified into two types: "fundamental treatment medications" and "interim treatment medications. There is even an estimate that the use of "fundamental treatment drugs" can prevent subsequent attacks in the long term, ultimately saving patients 70,000 yen in medical costs, but they are not popular because they are not effective the moment they are used, and it is not unusual for patients to discontinue treatment at their own discretion. However, it is not popular because patients do not feel the effects at the moment of use.
>
>  On the other hand, "provisional treatment medications" provide immediate relief when used, but they are not a fundamental treatment. If we continue to use only that medication at the time of an attack and do not treat the root cause of asthma, the situation will get worse and worse, making the lives of patients more inconvenient and causing them financial hardship.
>
>  And the "salbutamol" that is said to be getting more expensive this time because it is being removed from insurance is representative of an interim treatment medication. It is not that "patients will be worse off in the long run because their asthma medications will be more expensive" because the fundamental treatment medications will not be more expensive. Rather, it can be said that "the policy incentivizes fundamental attack prevention (which is more beneficial to the patient)" in relative terms, since the fundamental treatment medications remain cheap.
>
>  Of course, cases can occur where "I had a seizure despite the underlying treatment and need salbutamol". Of course, such cases should be covered by insurance. In other words, if we can say that "patients who have seizures despite doing their best to prevent them (usually using fundamental treatment drugs) will be covered by insurance," and "patients who do not do any prevention at all (usually not using fundamental treatment drugs) but receive stopgap drugs when they have a seizure will not be covered by insurance. We believe that it would be a good system for both the patients and the public who pay for medical care if we could do this. And we believe this is feasible with current technology.
>
>  For example, in the calculation of a receipt (like a bill issued by a medical institution), the past data of that patient is obtained using his/her own number, and the co-payment ratio is adjusted according to whether or not a drug for the underlying treatment is prescribed to the same patient.
>
>  Decades ago, when human beings were making decisions on every single paper receipt, it was all they could do to check "whether the name of the disease corresponded to the drug", but now the foundation is in place to make decisions "according to the combination of drugs and the usual prescriptions, only the appropriate people will be covered by insurance". This can result in a solution that both "reduces medical costs" and "long-term wellbeing of patients".
>
>  In addition, I think it could be an advantage from the patient's point of view to be able to buy medication for seizures at a pharmacy, so that if the patient temporarily deteriorates or runs out of medication on the road, they can deal with the situation as a bridge until they can visit a medical facility.
>
>  Rather than discussing "asthma medications" as a single category, it is important to consider the system by examining which medications bring what benefits to patients and what kind of system will ultimately contribute most to the happiness of each patient.
>
>  Team Mirai will use technology to propose a healthcare system that can both reduce healthcare costs with fairness and improve patient health.

>
>  I received a lot of feedback about the post I posted on June 17, 2025.
>
>  Many of them expressed concern about Team Mirai's lack of knowledge in the medical field and its system for reviewing and disseminating information on life-threatening topics.
>
>  Team Mirai aims to "create a Japan where no one is left behind by technology. This study was intended to "contribute most to the happiness of each patient (quoted from the original post)" by seeking ways to facilitate access to treatment with appropriate medications for seizures and long-term management, respectively. In reality, however, there were inadequacies, such as designing negative incentives, which caused many people to feel uneasy. We respectfully apologize and would like to correct the content of this post.
>
>  We deeply regret that our original post stated that those who do not routinely take preventive actions are not covered by insurance (full co-payment), even if prescribed by a physician, and that this was a concern to asthma patients and their families. Team Mirai has no intention to exclude physician prescriptions from insurance coverage, and we reiterate that Team Mirai does not intend to change its premise that physician prescriptions in insurance care should be covered by insurance.
>
>  In addition, the wording of the original post placed an additional burden on those who have difficulty seeing a doctor for a variety of reasons, including physical, mental, and social backgrounds. The idea that it is possible to evaluate the appropriateness of a patient's visit based on limited data such as receipt data is also questionable.
>
>  In the future, Japan's declining birthrate and aging population may make it impossible to deliver necessary medical care to those who need it. As social security costs continue to increase, we certainly need to seriously confront this harsh reality now, in order to find a way to realize a "Japan where no one is left behind" within a realistic allocation of the burden. However, we believe that this study of asthma drugs should not be about cost reduction, but about realizing better treatment for each and every patient.
>
>  We also received a lot of feedback this time on Team Mirai's policy decision-making process and attitude toward policy.
>
>  As a general rule, Team Mirai emphasizes quick decision-making and a willingness to take risks and take on challenges. However, we do not believe that this principle applies or should apply to all areas. We believe that we should be especially cautious in areas that involve human life and health, and we sincerely apologize for the hasty publication of this policy review post.
>
>  Team Mirai will use technology to present a manifesto of specific policies for a secure social security system for everyone.
