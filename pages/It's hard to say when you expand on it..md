- It is compatible to say "it is black" for a certain area and "it cannot be said to be black" for a wider area.
- The A side has accumulated a lot of things to come to the current conclusion, but they don't explain every single dependency, so it's interpreted broadly.
- The B side doesn't know the story so far, so they interpret it broadly and say, "We can't say this part of the story is black."
    - True or False in itself, but it is misaligned.

Generally, the world is a gradient, so it is [[natural]] to conclude that if you widen the scope enough, the conclusion "you can't say" is True, but less informative.]
- Smaller scope, "If we limit it to here, the black will be darker!" "I see, let's use that!" The world is progressing in this way.
- Related: [[Conceptual ability is the ability to limit problems]].
