title: "If you want what you want, you won't be happy anywhere."
---

If you want things to be 100% [[the way you want them]], you're not going to be [[happy]] wherever you go.
- If you change jobs because you don't get what you want where you are, you won't get what you want at your new job either.

- [[the pain of not getting what one seeks]]
- [[misfortune]]
