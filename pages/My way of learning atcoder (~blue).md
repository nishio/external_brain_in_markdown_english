- At the current pace, it looks like we'll converge around the bottom half of the blue.

- [[My way of learning atcoder (~light blue)]] reaffirms what I wrote

AtCoder Problems Statistics

    - Number of ACs increased by 70 questions

        - Except for [[PAST Past Question Practice 202012]], basically only Saturdays and Sundays, no change

I wrote in my last article about the "verbalization of awareness".
- We're still actively working on it.
    - I started to link not only [[Name the transformation technique]], but also the nature of the problem.
    - For example.
            - [[Constraints on the number of vertices 18]]
            - [[Constraints with 10^5 edges]]
    - Not many since we just started doing this.
    - The last issue focused on "deformation techniques."
        - > The reason why I was able to solve ARC106 D this time is because I was able to retrieve and use three techniques from my brain drawer: [[half of the queue]] → [[binomial theorem]] → [[change the order of addition]].
        - There were also more and more "A to B" type of things like [If the sides are 10^5, Dijkstra can use it.
    - The focus was on "transformation techniques," i.e., B
    - But in order to realize that "B is available," we must first read the problem statement and recognize that it is "A."
    - How I became aware of it: [Strengths and "Typical Strengths" of competitive programming - chokudai's blog](http://chokudai.hatenablog.com/entry/2018/04/23/165232)
            - I wrote this in [prototypical ability
            - > Recognizing a problem as "a combination of components smaller than the problem" allows us to view even a first-time problem as "a combination of known components".
            - > When I thought of it as "[[problem transformation]]," I recognized the whole problem as a single component.
            - > Not so, it is important to first divide and recognize the problem
            - It was the right time for me to become aware of the concept of [[problem partitioning]].
    - In order to increase the [[Cognitive Resolution]] of the problem, we are creating [[Concept Handles]] for the problem.

What I've newly started doing
    - [[AtCoder Failure List]]  11/22-
- [[AtCoderEntrypoint]] 12/13-
- Started servicing ABC186 while waiting for it to start.


    - I have been taking the [[Algorithm Practical Skill Test]] at the intermediate level since the first time I took it, and I wanted to move up to the advanced level, so I decided to do the past questions.
    - >  I'm going to take the Algorithm Exam, time-shifted just in time for the end of the exam. Looking back on the last time I took the exam, I felt pain because I couldn't refer to the questions for 2 weeks after taking the exam, I couldn't push the libraries I maintained, and I couldn't write anything I learned in Scrapbox related to the problems. I would rather learn by reading the explanations right after solving the problem. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1336242805115506688)
        - [[PAST Past Question Practice 202012]]
    - The result [[Fifth Algorithm Practical Skills Test]] was also intermediate, so I think my next goal is to make it to advanced level.

    - [[Attributed to the least-cost stream]] organized

landing practice
- The last time I did [[landing practice]], I think I was mainly solving problems around the green and light blue boundaries.
- When I look at the Recommendation now, I see a problem near the light blue and blue border.
- I thought about doing it, but ended up doing very little.
