- [[Definition of efficiency]]
- How can the consequence $x \in X] be efficient under the preference pair [$ \succsim \in \mathscr{D}_I$?
    - $y \succsim_i x \quad \forall i \in I$
    - $y \succ_j x \quad \exists j \in I$
- is that there is no consequence $y$ that satisfies
    - In other words, if any one person can improve without making anyone worse off, that is not efficient.
    - [[social choice function]] $f: \mathscr{D}_i \to X$, if the consequence $f(\succsim)] is efficient under the preference [$ \succsim] for all preference pairs [$ \in \mathscr{D}_I$ $f$ is said to be efficient.
