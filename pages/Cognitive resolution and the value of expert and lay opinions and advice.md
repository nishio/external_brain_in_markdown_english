title: "Cognitive resolution and the value of expert and lay opinions and advice"
---

SUMMARY: We find that cognitive resolution alters the usefulness of expert advice and lay opinion, and understanding the differences increases the value of communicating.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>

    - I wrote earlier that [[Mold thinking that had a similar thing in the past]] is caused by equating, ignoring differences.
- Independently of this, I wrote that [[Cognitive Resolution]] varies from person to person, which is why people see differently.
- I just realized that this is strongly related.
- As I was about to write down this realization, yet another article flashed through my brain
- That's [[expert advice and layman's opinion]].
- This is the story of "the advice of a professional is useful, but the advice of an amateur is not. On the other hand, an amateur's opinion is useful, but a professional's opinion is not.
- Mapping "expert/amateur" to "high/low cognitive resolution
    - Suppose there is a person X who has a low cognitive resolution and seems to equate things that are different for him.
    - It is not useful if Mr. X comes to me for advice on how to proceed with the project, etc.
        - Because X is only vaguely more aware of the project than you are.
    - On the other hand, Mr. X's impression discards the details, so it is useful to know how many people feel
        - 'I see, you can't tell the difference between this and that.'
        - Do you see the situation then in the past as the same as it is now?"
        - Useful for communicating something to a large number of people so they know where to emphasize the differences.
