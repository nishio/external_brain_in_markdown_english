- (1) Often implicitly assumes that "what should have the highest priority" is determined by one
- (2) but that assumption is incorrect. There could be multiple ones A and B of equal priority.
    - It is not useful to spend time deciding whether A or B should take precedence in this case
    - Since both bring equal value, it doesn't make much difference which comes first.
    - Just toss a coin to decide.
    - When time is short and something has to be cut down itself, C is cut down.
        - In other words, the information needed in a time-poor situation is not [[priority]] but [[subordinate rank]], right?
