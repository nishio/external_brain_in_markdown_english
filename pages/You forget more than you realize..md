title: "You forget more than you realize."
---

Human beings [[forget]] many things, but in normal life, we only become [[self-aware]] that we are forgetting when we are trying to remember something and cannot remember it. When I use [[Scrapbox]], I can tell myself that I have already written that in the past, so I can observe that I have forgotten more than I was aware of before.
