### Summary of notes
.
Two perspectives exist on the need for human conversation. One is to find a reason to seek a conversation with a human being, and the other is a perspective in which a conversation with a human being is unnecessary.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The notes and the "Setting the agenda for listening well" fragment share a common theme about the importance of talking to people. The fragment discusses the importance of listening to people and why it does not lead to changes in behavior. This relates to the note's perspective on finding reasons for wanting to converse with humans.

### deep thinking
The question of the need for human conversation reflects the kind of value we do or do not place on communication with others. This is a question that cannot be answered in a vacuum, as it is heavily influenced by individual values and experiences.
