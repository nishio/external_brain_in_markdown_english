    - I don't think we should try to be as independent and small as possible.
- →Therefore, priority is given to realization as a UI.

- My React skills are getting better, so I think I'm ready to do UI creation.
- Besides, [[Automatic font size adjustment for stickies]] has not been implemented yet.
    - →done
    - [[Import multi-line text as individual stickies]]  done

    - [[Make a good icon]]
    - [[Not "edit" but "reuse."]]
    - [[amend to state]]
    - [[Dragging another sticky while in sticky edit mode]]
    - [[New stickies should not overlap with other stickies.]]
