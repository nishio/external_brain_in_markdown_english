Extraction of front teeth has unexpectedly turned into an experiment in "what you can eat when you get older."
- Rice cakes can be eaten if cut into 1/8ths
- Pie crust bread is painful & fragments hurt because it shatters when cut.
- bread rolls are good
- Rice can get caught between grains under certain circumstances.
- You can't pour broth over it and make it shabby.
- I can't drink hot tea.
- Orange juice stings.
