Until the mental hardship occurs and is resolved.

1/18
- The subtitling process is difficult to divide into smaller pieces.
- I'm getting tired.
- Done is better than parfect and finished messy.
    - [/plurality-japanese/Glen in Japan Keynote Japanese subtitles](https://scrapbox.io/plurality-japanese/Glen in Japan Keynote Japanese subtitles).

1/19
- The day before the event, I realized that the document I had prepared to read at the event had been updated three days earlier, and I was not sure what to do with it.
    - [/plurality-japanese/chat page 3#65aa93f2aff09e0000f5c467](https://scrapbox.io/plurality-japanese/chat page 3#65aa93f2aff09e0000f5c467)

- I'm back. I'm tired.
    - Synchronous conversations on Zoom can be useful, but there is a hurdle in sharing that usefulness with people outside of Zoom or with people who are out of sync with the timing.
- I was so sleepy.
- Akihabara at 10:30 tomorrow.

1/21
- I was too excited about yesterday's event to sleep.
- I have another long meeting today at Akihabara at 10:30...
- I woke up safe.
- I returned to the nearest station safely, sleepy and jumpy after every station.

- It's a good day to sleep in, but you're up before 9:00.
    - Just because you're allowed to sleep in doesn't mean you shouldn't get up early, no problem.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - +1 [[規則正しい生活]]！<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - In terms of sleep, it is inadequate!<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- I finally realize when my wife points out that it would be easier to travel today and stay over the night before, rather than take on the challenge of catching the 7:00 a.m. bullet train tomorrow morning without oversleeping.
- As a result, the deadline for getting ready to go out was moved up.
- It's hard on my heart.
    - You can go for the challenge one if you're having a hard time with your mind.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Don't sleep in, because it's pretty hard to get up at 5:00 a.m. to catch the 7:00 a.m. bullet train.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - It's easier to prepare quickly and move on.
            - Oh, okay, [[there are]] two kinds of hardship.
            - The "the potential for failure [[is]] the difficulty of taking care not to fail."
            - "It's hard to leave the familiar warmth of home and go to an unfamiliar place [[away from home]]."
            - I rationalized it to reduce the former hassle, and then the latter.
- Return to human form.
    - I'd lounge around in my pajamas on the hot carpet, but then I'd change my clothes and pretend to be human.
    - It's going to be a song.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/cFQ2f7LRuLYP/icon' alt='/villagepump/cFQ2f7LRuLYP.icon' height="19.5"/>

- I got lunch, tea and [[Chocola BB Hyper]] at a convenience store.
    - What's in the Hyper
- Work is temporarily leaning toward tasks that use MP, and I'm feeling tired.
    - I see, my [[It's hard on my heart.]] = [[Out of MP]]?
    - What is MP?
        - I don't think it's appropriate to stop thinking by describing it as "running out of MP" without knowing what MP is.
        - But you should think about this when you're not out of MP.
        - Because thinking about the hard stuff when you're out of MP is exhausting.
        - [/villagepump/意志の力はMP](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/意志の力はMP)でこの手の話をしている<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - There's a general sense of "making a decision" to pay the cost now and act ahead of time to reduce risk in the long term perspective.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - Are we really depleted of decision-making power, no? A note that
            - The reverse pattern is the result of procrastinating action and taking big risks at the last minute.
- I've secured accommodations, and expect to be able to take the Shinkansen to Nagoya on a weekday at a reasonable price.
- ...
- Now at Tokyo Station
    - Dr. Google: "Nozomi will stop at Nagoya in 4 minutes."
    - I got in! I sat in a free seat! The train departed!
    - Arrive at 19:07, so I set the alarm for 5 minutes before, so I don't have to worry about falling asleep.
- When he lost his human form and melted, he didn't want to be active, but once he took on human form, he started acting like an active human being.
    - Essentially the chocolate one.

1/23-24
    - [[Owase 2024-01-23~24]]

1/25
- I woke up in bed at home, feeling relieved.
- Happiness to laze around in bed.
- I'm starving.
- Eat your usual [base bread
    - I see some of the items have expired...
- Eat your usual [pork cutlet sandwich

1/27
- Somethings replenished by being in the same room as usual, wearing the same clothes as usual, waking up at the same time as usual, and eating the same food as usual.

    - [[backslide no more plans/]]
    - [[There's nutrition you can only get from here]].

1/29
- I took a sigh of relief after all the hustle and bustle from the New Year's holiday and looked at the calendar to see that January was almost over....

1/30
- There is nourishment that [[can only]] come from doing the thought process that comes to mind, not what you have to do.
    - Summary: [[QV is a meaningful mechanism for not voting]].
- Is it nutritional, or was it an unconscious concern that was creating ongoing slip damage?
    - Abnormal: Curse
    - I think lifting the curse was a plus.
