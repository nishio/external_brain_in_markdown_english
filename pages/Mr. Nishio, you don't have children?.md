title: "Mr. Nishio, you don't have children?"
---

Question in the context of "a bet in favor of having children because it creates [[scarcity value]] for children in a [[low fertility]] environment."

When I replied, "Well, my wife would be an older mother" (I'm 43, she's 40), he asked, "What if she has an artificial uterus?" (I'm 43, she's 40).

I certainly wouldn't have any desire to have a child even if I had an artificial womb.


It would simply mean that both couples' desire to have children did not outweigh the cost.

- [[Why is the desire to have children so low?]]
