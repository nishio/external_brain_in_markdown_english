The Delusion of Understanding
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1646873769124990978) When you ask an LLM, "What is X?" and then they look at the explanation you have them write down and say "this is good" or "no" and throw it all away or "let's just use some of it", and for some reason they are currently able to make that decision, but what is driving that decision?
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1646874209912778753) There's also the line "the feelings you are able to judge are simply delusional".
>  Because people often have delusions of "understanding" when they don't.

I'm not sure if writing without LLM would bring better results, probably not much difference in the quality of the final product, but the time saved would be significant.
