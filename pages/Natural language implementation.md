title: "Natural language implementation"
---

Writing papers and books is [[mounting]] in natural language, and writing programs is implementation in [[programming language]]. The appropriate format of [[knowledge representation]] differs depending on the [[architecture]] of the human brain and the [[CPU]] of the computer.
However, just as [[GPUs]] of different architectures have been created on the computer side, and programming for "systems that combine computing devices with different mechanisms" has come to be done, [[Programming for "systems built by humans and computers]] should be done.
In the development of groupware, it is necessary to design and implement the system as a whole, including humans, rather than focusing only on the software implementation for the CPU.

The term "[[social implementation]]" has a few more fine-grained layers between the computer and society.
