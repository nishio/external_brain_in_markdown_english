title: "Worthy and unworthy arguments"
---

- 'There's no point in arguing about things that aren't worthwhile, so as soon as I'm offended, I'll correct or delete it.'
- I'm not comfortable paying the cost to fix it, so I'd like to just say, "Well, why is that? I want to make the other party bear the cost of explaining by replying, "Well, why? If the other party no longer feels annoyed and gets angry, then I don't have to pay the cost of dealing with the problem, and isn't that the best overall solution?
- "It would make [[A character that's hard to pin down.]] It's better to keep [[A character who is easy to pick on]] and minimize the work cost I pay. It's more appropriate for me to keep the advice coming together."


- The higher you get, the rarer the advice.
    - Young people find advice from older people annoying because it's not rare.
