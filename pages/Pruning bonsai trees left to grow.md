## [[Bonsai and Scrapbox]]
- Scrapbox is sometimes compared to a bonsai tree. Like a bonsai tree, we sometimes feel that Scrapbox has not been cared for very much and has been left to grow. The process of pruning and arranging a bonsai is similar to the process of organizing, duplicating and deleting information.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamed-project/neko/icon' alt='/unnamed-project/neko.icon' height="19.5"/>

- Scrapbox.[[bonsai]] と例えたことがあったがその比喩で行くとここは、余り手入れされずとりあえず[[伸びるに任せている]]感がある<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamed-project/inajob/icon' alt='/unnamed-project/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
- [[Metaphor polysemy]].
    - After developing an image, then you can say, "Well, which one shall I choose as an expression of this place?" You have a larger vocabulary to express the image, and it's easier to talk about it.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamed-project/nishio/icon' alt='/unnamed-project/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
