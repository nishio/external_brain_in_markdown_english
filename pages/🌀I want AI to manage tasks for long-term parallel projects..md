I want AI to manage tasks for long-term parallel projects.
[[Multi-header systems]] are not necessarily suited for "[[task management of long-term parallel projects]]".
- I mean, maybe it's not for me. It's getting more and more messy.
- Tasks are a complex network of interconnected units that must be divided into actionable units in order to complete a task.
- The [[Neri Neri system]] is more like connecting more and more.
- There is disagreement on whether we should "[[do]] the task" efficiently.
        - [[Efficiently handling tasks would implement a fast fucking application.]]
        - [[Efficiently performing barren tasks is barren]], so we need to first properly create the network and determine what really needs to be done.
- The object of Neri Neri is more of a project objective
    - This is different from project task management.
    - The goal of the project is a distant goal
    - Now feasible tasks of the project are one meter way in front of you
    - What tasks are not feasible now?
        - Is it just a note that maybe there will be a road in that area and we will have to go that way?

### nishio/🤖🔁Humans and AI share a common goal.
Microformatting of objectives is useful for humans and AI to share objectives; Nishio's fragments "AI should manage tasks" and "Collaboration with AI" suggest that humans need to find the details and context of tasks and put them into words. In addition, "Collaboration with AI" indicates that AI can provide a broader perspective and that it is important for humans and AI to "collaborate" to share experiences.

Considerations can be seen from "write-in" and "non-write-in" methods of communicating information. In order to make the system easily usable for information, implementation of a writing API and automatic generation and deletion of information should be considered.

In "Constraints with N around 10~20," the variation of computational complexity with the value of N is shown. This is helpful when considering the processing load due to the amount and complexity of tasks.

The "Technology and Problem Solving Diagram" shows the relationship between technology and problem solving. This influences technology selection and problem-solving approaches.

The "The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production: A Full Hierarchical Table of Contents" provides insight into how to manage and prioritize tasks. It provides specific techniques for improving productivity.


### nishio/How to turn around improvements without immediate confirmation of results
	Since we usually manage computers that do not have feelings, we tend to fall into the wrong way of thinking about people who do have feelings, such as "Let's make them do tasks in parallel because the waiting time is inefficient.
	It's hard to know how much time to spend on each corrective task without first understanding the big picture.
		Even if you're working on a job that isn't tight on deadlines, running with no end in sight can undermine your motivation.
		The default is to "look through the whole thing first and list all the areas that need to be corrected"
			If the task is too large, you can [Split by quantity], for example, "First, the entire chapter.
			Or [Split by time], "I'm going to list the things that need to be fixed in the next 25 minutes.
				 I wrote about this in chapter 2 of [The Intellectual Production of Engineers] [(1.3.4.3) Let's break up the time].
	You want to fix it right away because you're not keeping track.
		What is the granularity of the record?
			「 [You go to bed and wake up and find out.] 」
				As I will find out tomorrow.
			Sense of adequate detail is acquired gradually through training.
				If you don't do it, you won't learn it.
			If you have a record that shows who you are tomorrow, you can do "the rest tomorrow" at any point in time.

### nishio/human multitasking stavation
Human multitasking stuation
Concurrency control story
When a long task collides with a short task, the longer task loses probabilistically, so
Only short tasks are done and long tasks are not executed for a long time.
The stuation that "I'm not going to be able to do it," happens,
That is to say,
In human task management, when I had small tasks and large tasks, I did only small tasks.
I thought it looked a lot like the problem of large tasks being left untouched.

The latter is not bumped and reverted.
The distortion of task selection timing to avoid large tasks rather than uniform randomness is the cause of the distortion.
So, I thought that if I could reverse the bias, I could solve the stavation problem.

  Cases where [multitasking] is painful
  The wording is ambiguous and contains multiple issues that need to be separated out.
   I'm not going to talk about frequent interruptions (CS terminology) that require real-time reactions in this case.
 When there is a mix of large long-term tasks and small tasks, the problem is that the small tasks take up so much time that the large tasks do not get done.
  The theory that there is a problem with the mechanism for determining which tasks to perform.


### nishio/how to multitask
How to multitask
Me: "How do we execute [multitasking] efficiently?"
Wife: "Just turn [single task] around fast."

Me: "I think the size of the implicitly assumed single task may be different."
Wife: "In the end, humans can only do one thing at a time, so let go of the illusion of multitasking."

I said, "What do you do when you have multiple projects that can only be done one at a time and will take several months to complete?"
Wife: "There are countless smaller tasks in a long term project. One task that can be done."

I said, "For example, about this 'writing a paper' project."
Wife: "First of all, it's not good that it's not clearly stated what the paper is going to be about, and it's like, 'I'm going to be big! Like that."

	You're not seeing the whole picture.
 How about writing it out first?
 I'm not sure I have an estimate of how long it would take to do any of these things.
 I don't like to do this, but I think that by drawing a Gantt chart, I can notice if it's too dense or not.

	You may not be able to subdivide your tasks.
 Time should be malloc for task segmentation.



### nishio/2015-10-09
	Apart from that, what is the reason for the tasks that are not progressing at all?
 This is also self-expression. They are thwarted when they realize that the prototype they have built will not work as well as originally planned.
 Then, they repeatedly start up other projects that seem to work, resulting in more work-in-progress tasks that are not progressing, eating up the brain's working space and causing thrashing.
 I admit that I do not have enough memory to run those projects in parallel, I have to write them to external memory and stop some of the processes.
 So which process do you stop? If you're only doing short-term tasks, you're not going to make any progress on long-term tasks, bound again.
 You have to admit that you are incompetent to proceed with tasks based on a long-term perspective. Because you don't admit that, you fall into the bind of trying to do both.
 We need to be stupid, work on short-term tasks, get them done, and reduce the number of them.

## Digest 1
A discussion of task management for long-term parallel projects using AI. Multi-head rooted systems may not be suitable for task management. Tasks exist as complex networks, and it is important to divide them into executable units. However, efficient task processing does not always yield good results. The NeriNeri system is effective with respect to the project objective, which is a distant goal. Currently executable tasks are the road in front of us, while non-executable tasks exist as future possibilities.

## Digest 2
.
Consider the relevance of the fragment "🔁I want AI to manage tasks for long-term parallel projects": task management by AI requires the ability to understand complex networks of tasks and divide them into executable units. However, the "🌀pOmni" fragment suggests that AI needs to verbalize "what needs to be done," and that current algorithms may lack next-action decision support. The "human task scheduler load test" fragment highlights problems in human task management, and AI may be able to solve these problems.

## THOUGHTS
