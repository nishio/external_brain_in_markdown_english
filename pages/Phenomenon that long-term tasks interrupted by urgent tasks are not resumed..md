title: "Phenomenon that long-term tasks interrupted by urgent tasks are not resumed."
---


- [Long-term Tasks interrupted by [[urgent tasks]] are not resumed.
    - If an "Urgent/Important" item appears in the [[Urgent/Important Matrix]], it takes precedence over the "Important" item.
- At this time, you may not be able to return to that "important" task after the urgent task is finished

What I tried to write in words was written in clear pictures.
