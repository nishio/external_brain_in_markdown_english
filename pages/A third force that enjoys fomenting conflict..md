title: "A third force that enjoys fomenting conflict."

> [fladdict](https://twitter.com/fladdict/status/1776977682972254519) No matter how constructively the sane people on Team A and Team B move, the entertainment third force stirs things up and fuels the conflict. As a result, if [[extremists]] from both AB teams get on board, there is nothing that can be done, so factional discussions on the Internet are usually futile, and even the actions of the opposing forces are useless to think about because you don't know to what extent they are extremists or stirring up conflicts.

> [fladdict](https://twitter.com/fladdict/status/1776978163324858611) So, I guess we'll just have to ignore the unfamiliar discussions on the internet and have people from both factions who can move in real life and with real names, and have public discussions in real life to make the point. I think. Crowd knowledge doesn't really work in a situation where people want to stir things up anonymously.
