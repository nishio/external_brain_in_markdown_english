from [[The Art of Worldly Wisdom]]
Never exaggerate.
xli

It is important to note that one should not speak with exaggeration so as not to contradict the truth or demean one's own understanding. Exaggeration is an excess of judgment that shows the narrowness of one's knowledge and taste. Praise arouses active curiosity and creates desire, and then, as generally happens, if value is not worth the price, expectation rebels against deception and rewards itself by undervaluing what was recommended and the person who recommended it. The prudent approach their work with more care, preferring error by omission to commission. The extraordinary is rare and therefore understates the ordinary. Exaggeration is a kind of lying, and thereby discredits the good sense that ought to be much and more.
