[City council unusually rejects youngest mayor's personnel proposal, stumbles on education reforms it emphasizes (Asahi Shimbun Digital) - Yahoo! News](https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/0ab23c04075e2dd87bf416bb5d5a7ba9b24ff130)
> The vote was 7 in favor, 10 opposed, and 3 abstentions.
> Council members voiced opposition to the proposal, saying that it has little connection to Ashiya, that it is difficult for people living in Saitama to come to Ashiya frequently, and that it disrespects the school board member system.
- [[Mayor of Ashiya City]] [[Ryosuke Takashima]]

> [dennotai](https://twitter.com/dennotai/status/1730738005097525274/photo/1) Adults should not crush a 26-year-old's positive challenge for the future!
>  It is a condition for the success of a project to bring in people with the best experience and track record in that field. I think it is almost an accusation to destroy that by saying "you don't know the area" or "you can't commute from Saitama".
>  I am saddened to think that there is a Shinkansen station and an optical fiber network in Kobe for a reason.
>  I believe that if these rite-of-passage practices by adults are not eliminated, young people will be more likely to abandon Japan.
    - [[remote work]]

> [dennotai](https://twitter.com/dennotai/status/1730739994082574816) Ashiya City's Board of Education is a council system with a chairperson and four members. How necessary is it that all committee members are people who are associated with Ashiya City?
>  If that's what the other commissioners are doing, then that's fine, isn't it? ...
>  As I have posted before, an organization is about [[diversity]] of affiliation, and too much [[homogeneity of members]] is not necessarily a good thing.
    - [[diversity]]

> [DCryptcats](https://twitter.com/DCryptcats/status/1730741345655153078) The fact that there are so many regional differences in education is a problem, and turning away from the development of technology is an affront to civilization......as a small citizen.... I think it's a blasphemy against civilization to turn a blind eye to technological development....

> [akio1218](https://twitter.com/akio1218/status/1730738005097525274) You're laying out what sounds like reasons for opposition, but the real reason for opposition is [[lack of rooting]]. I don't think anyone would say that. I guess they want to tell you to do more rooting around, to go behind the scenes and ask for help.

> [dennotai](https://twitter.com/dennotai/status/1730754040567591313) I see.
>  Well, I don't deny the rooting around, and I do use it to facilitate my work, but it's a shame nonetheless.
>  Since the council is the place to make decisions on [[public opinion on all occasions]], the content should be judged on the spot without rooting out the issue, and I believe that rooting out the issue will be avoided by young people, and the vitality of the area itself will be reduced.

> [akio1218](https://twitter.com/akio1218/status/1730761476355617214) There is no doubt that the root culture can lead to a reduction in the vitality of the community itself. However, this culture has deep roots.
>  Over the decades, people who do not have the power to execute the budget have been asking the executive branch, which has the power to execute the budget, to grant them something like power, or to listen to their requests, as a "barter" for approval and passage by the council in order to have "power similar to the power to execute the budget". Over the decades, this structure has been commonly built up in each region.
>  So, I think these council members who opposed this are sending a message to the mayor that they don't have budget enforcement powers > right now, and they are not in a convenient executive branch that will listen to them, so "if you don't grant us power, we'll vote no, is that ok?" I think they are sending a message to the mayor that, "If you don't give us power, we'll vote no. Is that OK?
>  To begin with, local councils are the places where the Gigaschool concept is discussed by council members who have only touched a mobile phone, so there are many cases where the council itself does not have the literacy to judge the content on its own merits or demerits.

impressions
- You have a rooting interest, just a different target for your rooting interest.
    - The information that the personnel proposal was submitted on the 1st and rejected on the same day is distributed on Asahi Shimbun Digital at 20:39 on the same day.
    - They should have foreseen that it would be rejected and laid the groundwork for a speedy release of the article in that case.
- So, if we work backwards from this, the city council members should be the first to be informed about the proposed personnel changes.
    - After rooting around, they foresaw that the orthodox Plan A was not going to work, so they switched to Plan B: "Use the fact that the vote was rejected to gain media attention.
    - I have not been able to observe whether it was "budget enforcement power-style power" that the City Council members demanded as a barter, but it must have been a condition that the mayor's side could not accept.
- Gaining media attention increases the "public" windfall for city council members.
    - The media is also making the composition "young vitality vs. old people who hinder progress" by using the title "The city council rejected the challenge by the youngest mayor in an unusual way" instead of "What happened in Ashiya City.
        - It's being composed by someone who knows how to get the social media going.
    - This will either result in the personnel being appointed as planned after some time, or, if not, it will benefit future negotiations.
- Overall, I thought that this case study highlighted the intelligence on the part of [[Ryosuke Takashima]] and his ability to accurately set goals and take action.
