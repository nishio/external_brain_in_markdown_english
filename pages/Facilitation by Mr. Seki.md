title: "Facilitation by Mr. Seki"

Seki-san's ([[halsk]]) [[facilitation]].

- [[Parallelism of individuals, not management of multiple people]]
Since there were other people besides me who felt the "goodness" of Mr. Seki's facilitation, I'll take this opportunity to verbalize it, too.
- I was impressed that he repeatedly told the audience several times early on that "[[this is]] not the place to build consensus."
- A timer was used to create time to write on a sticky note, and the [[parallel-threaded output]] was written, rather than the single-threaded output of audio.
- Then the "written stickies" were looked at in a single threaded order, creating a sense that all opinions had been "seen".
    - A few verbal discussions came up on the spot, but because of the stickies, it didn't become an aerial battle, it became connected [[to the ground]] with the stickies.
    - It didn't take endless hours of discussion.

- [[It expands further when connections between ideas are shown.]]
