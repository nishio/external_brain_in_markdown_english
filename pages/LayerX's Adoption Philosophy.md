title: "LayerX's Adoption Philosophy"

- [[Rare is the person who can make a discontinuous change in a business.]]
- [[No one can ever hire scarce talent at a convenient time.]]

> [fukkyy](https://twitter.com/fukkyy/status/1723680713525137906) Just to add, we make very detailed hiring plans, and we never fail to communicate with new hires that they will be in these roles and have these expectations. We are in an uncertain business. We are in an uncertain business, so there are times when we have to change what we do after a hire, but that does not mean we should be careless in our communication (I think 10X probably has the same nuance, just expressed differently).

We will approach this with what Benchmark calls "[[a]] prepared mind. Specifically, we prioritize potential future opportunity losses, risks, etc., and always have a list of 200 of the best people in the market who can solve these issues. We decide who will be responsible for communicating with these people on a daily basis, including the possibility of softening the relationship with them. We have many people who are involved in the management and responsibility of the business, so we always have a "prepared mind" and are not afraid to make a bold offer when an opportunity presents itself.


> [fukkyy](https://twitter.com/fukkyy/status/1723684599866552745) We also focus on training and selection at the same level. We think it is just right to make an organization chart for six months, one year, and 1.5 years from now, and then work backward from there to balance hiring and selection at roughly a 5:5 ratio. This organization chart will change after another 6 months, but even on that assumption, we can make this kind of concrete plan, clarify the image of human resources to be assigned, and then make a few irregular offers in the first quarter.


> [fukkyy](https://twitter.com/fukkyy/status/1723687088372289761) There is some debate as to whether it should even be irregular at this point. As a rule of thumb, a company that is growing several times per year will probably find new issues in the last few months to be bottlenecks for future growth. When a company enters a phase of annual growth of several tens of percent, it will probably focus a little more on improving the accuracy of its planning. If a company is in the phase of blitz scaling, I believe they'll miss out on growth if they don't adopt this irregularity.


> [fukkyy](https://twitter.com/fukkyy/status/1723687772924625386) Also, irregular hiring involves the risk of failure from a probabilistic point of view because it is irregular. Therefore, I think it is necessary for the "executive" to commit to the hiring decision, persuasive explanation when the assignment changes, and [[accompaniment]] until the person becomes active in the company. Not by multiple officials, but by a single, by-name executive who has made the decision. If they don't do that, I still think they shouldn't.
- [[byname committed by one decision-making officer]].
    - [[referral responsibility system]]
