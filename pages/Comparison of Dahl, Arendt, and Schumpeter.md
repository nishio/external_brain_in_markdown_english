A brief comparison of Dahl, Arendt, and Schumpeter is presented.

# Schumpeter's Theory of Democracy
Schumpeter viewed democracy as "a process of selection of political leaders through competition among elites," and he described democracy not as "the realization of the will of the people" but as "a system in which the people elect their leaders by periodic elections.

:
|  | Essence of Democracy Focus of Democracy Role of the People |
| -- | -- |
| Dahl Pluralistic competition system Institutional and procedural (participation and competition) Political participation and opposition |
| Arendt Conditions of human existence in which diverse opinions coexist Philosophical (diversity itself) Expression and coexistence of diversity |
| Schumpeter Competition for power among elites Elite-centered competition and selection Electing leaders (limited roles) |

# point of comparison
.
- Dahl vs. Schumpeter.
- Dahl focused on institutional design that emphasizes active participation and objection by citizens and achieves pluralism.
- Schumpeter limited the role of citizen participation to "[[elite selection]] only" and saw competition as taking place within the elite class.

- Arendt vs. Schumpeter.
- Arendt sees the essence of democracy philosophically as "[[the]] coexistence of diversity" and distances himself from the institutional aspects.
- Schumpeter, on the contrary, takes a distinctly institutional view of democracy and emphasizes the practical operation of an "elite-driven" system.

# Summary
.
Dahl presents a different image of democracy: "the ideal practice of pluralistic democracy," Schumpeter "pragmatic, elite-centered democracy," and Arendt "diversity as a precondition for democracy."
