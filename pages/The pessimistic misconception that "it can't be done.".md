title: 'The pessimistic misconception that "it can''t be done."'
---

- If you are mistakenly thinking "[[be made]]" when in fact you can't, you have a chance to try it and experience that it's surprisingly not possible.
- If you mistake "[[I can't.]]" for "I can't" when in fact you can, you don't have a chance to experience "surprisingly, I can." because you don't try.
- The former mistake is corrected, but the latter is not.
- So the latter mistake is more serious.
- If you don't know which one it is, you should knock it down to the former.
