- The voice effect refers to the phenomenon in which simply being able to express one's opinion before a decision is made increases [[a sense of conviction]], [[a sense of fairness]], [[trust]], and [[willingness to cooperate]], regardless of whether or not one agrees with the final outcome. It is used in research on administrative participation, voice systems within organizations, and labor-management relations.
- The mechanism is explained as an increase in [[procedural justice]] and [[self-efficacy]] of being "listened to/respected," and token participation (venting) and absence of feedback can be counterproductive.

- >  In the early studies, comparative studies between procedures were conducted based on the differences in the structure of procedures, such as whether the parties or the judges submit the claims and evidence under the concept of procedural control.

- > This procedural justice research has led to studies that have shown the influence of a sense of fairness on people's attitudes and behaviors, but it has also led to an investigation into the causes of such influences.
- > In the original procedural justice research, the explanation was that it is still the outcome that people ultimately focus on, and that the reason that party-based procedures feel fair is because they reserve control over the outcome they obtain to make it more favorable to themselves. ...
- >  However, Lind and Tyler, who subsequently confirmed many procedural justice effects, pointed out that some procedural justice effects, such as "[[voice effects]]" independent of the outcome (Lind et al. 1990), existed. (Lind et al. 1990), and unlike the original explanation of procedural justice research, it focuses on the procedure itself, not on the influence on the outcome, and points out the importance of the human factor with the authority figure who makes the judgment, or in the case of a trial, with the judge. ...
- >  One of the characteristics of Lind and Tyler's theory is that it explains procedural justice effects in terms of human relations among those involved in the proceedings, while the structural elements of the proceedings, as in previous studies, are absent.
