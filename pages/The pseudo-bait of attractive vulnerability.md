>  There are people everywhere who think evil, but if they were to think of doing evil, they would use the attractive one as pseudo-bait.
>  If you are thinking of evil, you would raise an attractive pseudo-bait like child protection (because it is more efficient) rather than daring to use an unattractive pseudo-bait (e.g., protection of dirty old men).

In this series of tweets, the following claims are made

- Be wary of those who use pretty words like "for the environment," "for the children," "SDGs," and "end discrimination" to further their personal interests and expand their power.
- We should be wary of those who raise objectives other than financial gain.
- It is important to be skeptical because there are many people in the world who try to gain by deceiving others. However, assuming that everything is a lie runs the risk of falling into [[conspiracy theory]].
- While it is important to think for oneself, decisions should be based on reliable information and knowledge, and conclusions should not be based solely on imagination or intuition.
- People who advocate [[cleanliness]] are often trying to profit without taking responsibility.
- Beware of those who take advantage of the weak and those who talk nicely about them.
- On the other hand, many people cannot distinguish between [[a prudent attitude]] and simply an excuse to slap on a clean slate that they dislike.

Overall, he stresses the importance of thinking critically without being distracted by pretty words, but suggests that it is important to maintain a balance rather than deny everything.

There are some people who are of a certain disposition, and there are also people who aim to expand their personal interests and power by coating them with beautiful words.

I remember seeing words similar to "money can't control them, and they're most likely up to something" in more than one creative work. I get the impression that it's mainly the words of a bad boss, but it makes sense.

> [PKAnzug](https://twitter.com/PKAnzug/status/1782578181117268427) Whatever the case may be, there are a lot of "people who try to gain by deceiving others" in the world, so it is important to "be skeptical for the moment".

>  However, this "skepticism" is also ideally "don't believe it," but sometimes people think it's "assume it's a lie. That kind of thing is conspiracy theory all the way.

> [PKAnzug](https://twitter.com/PKAnzug/status/1782579626491121865) On a similar note, "thinking for oneself" is also ideally "using reliable information and accurate knowledge as a foothold to evaluate without necessarily relying on the 'correct answer' presented to you. However, there are a few people who think it is "deciding the correct answer based on one's own imagination and intuition.  The latter is often merged with "deciding that it is a lie.

> [sacanaace](https://twitter.com/sacanaace/status/1782574544731226331) It's hard to do this show-by, because sometimes words like that are "for people who can't scrutinize". Diversity" was a prime example.

> [PKAnzug](https://twitter.com/PKAnzug/status/1782575904776212948) Oh no, it's a reminder because of the very language we use to control such people.
>  There must be many "people who can be paralyzed if they are not careful, but they can manage if they are careful," so those people should be careful. For those who seem to be hopeless, we have to ask someone around us to do their best.

[[High95]] They want to see how they can exploit the livestock.

> [RastyBlue](https://twitter.com/RastyBlue/status/1783006904043598081) I think one of the reasons why all the "pretty words" exemplified are often used is that you don't have to take responsibility even when you fail to achieve them.

So they changed the phrase to "school lunches for children", and I heard that donations immediately increased.
