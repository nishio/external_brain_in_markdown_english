One Night Werewolf Transcript 2-7 Discussion - AI Summary 2

Tachikawa: The game is progressing at a faster pace than expected. Why don't we have a look back time here?

Nishio: Yes, especially the first game was difficult.

Male Y: At first I was confused because I didn't know the rules. I didn't know how to bluff, so I tried it out and saw what would happen if a werewolf exposed a werewolf. From there I learned that werewolves are exposed. the second time, from the beginning, I didn't say anything and just watched. the third time, I finally realized that it is important to quickly find out who your allies are.

Nishio: While werewolves have an advantage because they know each other, they also have the disadvantage of a small number of people. It is a good balance.

Male Y: Exactly.

Tachikawa: I see.

Nishio: Relationships are different among members, so I think we will have completely different relationships.

Male X: I try to behave as honestly as possible because the relationship will continue after the game.

Nishio: Lying is for games. We need to separate it from reality.

Tachikawa: I think people who lie well when they are werewolves enjoy the game.

Nishio: Indeed. It is a necessary element to enjoy the game.

Male X: Exactly. Some people are not good liars, but I think it's an important part of enjoying the game.

Nishio: In game theory, the optimal solution is for everyone to cooperate in an infinite number of iterations. But reality is finite, so there is a possibility of betrayal. I think it is important to build from small, trustworthy groups.

Man X: I think you are right. The ideal is a society where everyone cooperates. But realistically it is difficult, so we will have to expand it little by little.

Nishio: Yes, I agree. I believe that betrayal in games can help build trust. If you intend to betray in real life, where money is involved, you would not play that way in a game.

Male X: Yes, I think you are right.

It was a good conversation that allowed us to understand each other's humanity through wargames.

Male X stated that he thinks signaling is important, but that too much appealing to people that they are trustworthy can be counterproductive.

Tachikawa brought up the topic of salespeople's stand-up sales talk being difficult to be trusted, citing a commercial by Japanease Takata as an example. Nishio pointed out that the reason may be that too much information is confusing to the other party.

Man X stated that emotionally charged sales talk is sometimes more persuasive than logic. Nishio noted that a majority of people fall for the pattern, while a minority reject it.

Tachikawa analyzed the order in which people accept the usual flow of a mail-order program. Nishio added that some people may reject the program if it deviates from the pattern.

As the topic turned to teaming those who are considering a career change and those who are trying to remain with the company, Nishio offered some suggestions for dealing with differences in objectives. Man X and Man Y pointed out the importance of clarifying differences in values and objectives.

In a software development case study, Nishio explained the difference between project objectives and individual objectives. Tachikawa argued that it is important for the team leader to decide and convince the team of the purpose, but Nishio pointed out that there is also servant leadership.

Finally, the topic of customer matter was discussed, with Male Y explaining the importance of setting decision criteria based on the assumption of a mass customer. The concept of developing new products was also discussed.

The above is a careful and clear summary. He said that he would continue and conclude by playing the wargame again.
