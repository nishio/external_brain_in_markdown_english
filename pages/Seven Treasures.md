title: "Seven Treasures"
---

    - A board game adaptation of [[Seven Habits]] with an RPG flavor.
    - [https://www.makuake.com/project/7habitsrpg/](https://www.makuake.com/project/7habitsrpg/)
    - [[Management Games]] I'm not sure if it should be special or not, I'm not sure about the rules.
- It would be interesting to see if it is well made, but I am a little wary because these games are often connected to bad business.
    - Example: "Rich Dad" cash flow game and multi-level marketing

- > This game is officially licensed by FranklinCovey Japan K.K. and planned, produced and marketed by Nai-Nai-Nai-Baa K.K. and supervised by FranklinCovey Japan.
    - So can we trust them?

- There was information on a previous work by the same manufacturer [7 Keys](https://7habits-gameshop.com/shopping/lp.php?p=7habits-game#lpshoppingcolumn)
    - At 21,600 yen, the price tag is several times higher than similar board games, which is very suspicious.
