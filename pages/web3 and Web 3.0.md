> Web3 first appeared in 2014 as a concept proposed by [[Gavin Wood]], co-founder of Ethereum. He envisioned a [[decentralized Internet]] based on [[blockchain]] technology, where users would regain [[data ownership]] and privacy .
> There is no definite date for the first appearance of Web 3.0, but it began to be mentioned around 2006 along with the concept of the "Semantic Web. This concept refers to the next generation of the Web that understands the meaning of data and provides information intelligently. It was proposed by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] and has become a popular term for the third generation of the Web.
> In other words, Web3 refers to a decentralized Internet based primarily on blockchain technology, while Web3.0 refers to the next generation of the Web, including broader technological advancements, although the two are often used in the same context.

The way [[Web 3.0]] is used today is very different from the third generation in the [[Semantic Web]] sense...
You only say "[[third generation]]" on the name, so the meaning is blurred.

[Web3 - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3)

> Web 3.0 is "an economy in which value is co-created, held, and exchanged on the blockchain using tokens such as cryptographic assets as a medium" (token economy).



- [[Web3 and Web3.0 are different]]
- [What is Web3 and why is Web3 important | ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/ja/web3/)
    - Commentary by Ethreum Foundation
- Ignoring Berners-Lee, he's talking about Web 3.0 and then rephrasing it to Web 3 without giving any particular reason.
- Maybe this is a pattern where Gavin Wood started saying Web 3.0 without knowing Berners-Lee, and after the buzz spread, he was confronted with "No, Berners-Lee said it first," and corrected it.
