Metaphor Examples
    - Tradition is to keep the fire burning."
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I guess that means it's important to protect them so they don't disappear?"
    - Tradition is about preserving the fire, not worshipping the ashes.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I see <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/fully understood/icon' alt='fully understood.icon' height="19.5"/>, you are saying that instead of worshipping the ashes (=classical music), which are a byproduct of the fire and no longer change, we should strive to keep the fire (=composer), which is currently creating new light, alive, and that is what preserving tradition is all about.
        - The "felt meaning" created in Nishio by reading the metaphor has become a new symbol by COMPREHENSION
