> [@yuiseki_](https://twitter.com/yuiseki_/status/1666742788770385920?s=20): AI For Good's website, there is a social networking site named "Neural Network", first of all, its naming! I was amused by the sense of the name, and registered as a user anyway. There is a function called "AI powered smart matching" that allows AI to match AI experts with each other, and the whole thing is very sharp and awesome!
