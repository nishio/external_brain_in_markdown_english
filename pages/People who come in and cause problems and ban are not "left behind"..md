People who come in and cause problems and ban are not "left behind".

- [[No one gets left behind.]]
    - [[the customer is always right]]
        - [[customer harassment]]

- [[Relationship between BAN and Inclusion]]
- [[People who brag about being blocked.]]

People who come in and cause problems and ban are not "left behind".
- Those who are truly left behind can't come in.
- We have to go help those who haven't come in.
