- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I appreciate the question.
    - Because I can see where you're struggling.
    - It's an opportunity for me to demonstrate my value.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>You can send your questions via chat anytime, weekdays, weekends, or late at night!
    - Of course, we can't always reply right away.
    - Instead of waiting for a reply, it is better to ask anyway and work on it without expecting a reply!
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Instead of thinking in your mind, "I can't explain it well in writing, so I'll ask at the next meeting," I want you to write in the chat, "I can't explain it well in writing, but I'd like to ask about it at the meeting.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It is good to write not only what you have not done, but also how far you have gotten!
    - For the person who did it, it is easy to take for granted that he or she was able to do it right up to the last minute, but the person who only listens to the story does not know how far he or she has come.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>use the correct terminology
    - We're different people, so the terminology is often misleading.
    - We can communicate with each other by striving to use the same meaning.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I would like a reply.
    - I can't tell if you've read the commentary and moved on, or if you're having trouble understanding what the commentary means, or if you haven't read it yet.
    - If you don't know, please say "I don't know.

> Thank you for all your questions on Slack. I really appreciate it when people send me questions, as it helps me understand where everyone is struggling so that I can apply it to future lecture content. Please don't hesitate to continue to ask questions.
>  You can send questions via Slack anytime, weekdays, weekends, or late at night (note that this will vary from lecture to lecture, depending on the teacher in charge). However, due to other duties, we may not be able to reply immediately. Especially on Saturdays and Sundays, replies may be delayed.
>  And while there are no rules on how to ask questions, I will share a tip on how to ask questions in Slack so that you can get your questions answered quickly and accurately. Please keep this in mind as it is a trick that can be used in other lectures and in communication outside of lectures.
- >  * Write the exercise number - assignment number
- >  *Write down how far you got.
    - >  o If possible, please post a screenshot (image) or text of the program contents!
    - >  o It would be easier to answer if you could put up the whole program, not just a part of it!
- >  Use terminology accurately
    - >  o Misuse of terminology can lead to cognitive disappointment
    - >  o If you forget what a term means, review it in your textbook or past materials.
- >  * Ask questions well in advance of deadlines
    - >  o Just before the assignment deadline, we are inundated with questions, so it is very likely that we will not be able to reply immediately. We will try to reply as soon as possible, but the worst that may happen is that we reply after the deadline.
    - >  o Please work on your assignments well in advance so that you can ask questions early.
- >  When I answer your question, I hope you will answer, "I understand."
    - >  o I'm a little concerned because I don't know if you understand and are moving on, if you didn't get the content, or if you simply haven't read it yet!
    - >  o Just press the reaction button!
    - >  o If you don't understand, please reply with "I wasn't sure" and I can tell you more about it!
- >  * I'd appreciate it if you could let me know if you "got it" when you're done with the assignment.
    - >  The basic rule is to write in such a way that the question-answer (in the case of this lecture, Yumura) will have as little trouble as possible. Especially online, it is easy for perception translation to occur. You don't need to spend lots of time inferring, but try to be a little careful when writing your message.

>  ・It is not always possible to get an immediate response. Be prepared to wait half a day.
>  ・ Therefore, if the questions are unclear, significant time will be lost.
>  For example, if I just ask, "I get a strange message and can't proceed," half a day later they will just reply, "What kind of message? Half a day later, they just reply, "What kind of message?
>  ・Do you understand that it's not the same as talking to a friend on line?
