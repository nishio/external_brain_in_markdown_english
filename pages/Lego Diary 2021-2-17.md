Chronologically, after [Building a Tachikoma with LEGO7

- I just received [[Lego order 20210215]], but I think I need to sort it out because I have been building and destroying it and it has become a temporary mess, and there are more parts that I didn't know about.

Gatling tip done
Round part 6222 done
Black with no gray round bottom
2×2×2 2×1×2 done because of missing blue 2×3 blocks
Slope is black because there is no blue

Side stud 1×4 blocks used up.
No blue 1×4 plate, so substitute another color for the hidden area, grill is not available.
Blue 1×6 plates would be nice to have -> bought.

It is easy to do if 1x1's, plates, etc. are placed together in the process of creation.
1x3 slope curves are plentiful.
I rather thought I had enough, 1×2 is not enough.
There are no 2x2s, so it's used there as well.

I counted up the pieces I had on hand to see how much I needed, and I found that I used 10 pieces on one side, which is not much at all, right?

Surprisingly, there are only a few clip bars left.
