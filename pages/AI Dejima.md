Just as Japan, which had adopted an isolationist policy, felt the risk of missionary activities by foreigners,
The solution is to build [[Dejima]].

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Can you explain the concept of Dejima?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT/icon' alt='GPT.icon' height="19.5"/>... The term refers to an area that is geographically separate and independent from the mainland ... In a historical context, Dejima most famously refers to [[an artificial island]] in Nagasaki, Japan. It was used primarily as a meeting place for Dutch and Chinese traders during the period when Japan adopted a policy of isolation (mid-17th to mid-19th centuries). For a long time, Dejima was the only point of contact between Japan and the Western world.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Dejima in Nagasaki was built in the early 17th century when Japan adopted a policy of [[national isolation]]. Its main purpose was to control foreign trade and exchange, and in particular to suppress [[Christianity's]] [[missionary]] activities.

The first to use Dejima were the Portuguese, who were expelled from Japan in 1639 because of their aggressive proselytizing of Christianity. Thereafter, Dejima was used as a trading post for Dutch merchants, who promised to refrain from proselytizing Christianity and concentrate on commercial transactions. Thus, Dejima became an important location for enabling trade and [[information exchange]] while strictly controlling contact with the West.
