title: "Scrapbox-like recall effect on Kozaneba"
---

I want to separate them because adding more and more kozane to one place in Kozaneba is getting heavier and heavier.
I want to help you find [[RELEVANCE]] across this parted place.
Notifications based solely on the occurrence of common words will result in garbage notifications all over the place.
Scrapbox makes explicit bracketing with a single step, and then connects those "single steps" to each other with exact matches and suggestions for connecting them with ambiguous searches.
- In the context of [[Study Session 1 on "Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning"]], this "one-step" is a statement that "the one or more words refer to some kind of [[Felt Meaning]], which is not 'literal' (a [[parallel symbol]]) but something that has room for pages to be created. (a [[parallel symbol]]), but one that has room for pages to be created", so we can consider it a statement that "this is a [[non-parallel symbol]]".
Similar "one-step-at-a-time" items are, in Kozaneba, "expanded stickies" and "groups with edited titles."
Wouldn't it be nice if we could connect this across places?
