from [[pIntEn]]
repetition
- The repetition is intentional. I told some abstract concept roughly, and then repeated it in detail.
    - > You are so meticulous, so I know the repetitions are intentional, but I think I will rephrase it so that the progression is clearer.
    - meticulous: pay up-to-date attention
