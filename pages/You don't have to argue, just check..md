title: "You don't have to argue, just check."

- [[rebuttal]] You don't have to do it. [[confirmation]] You do it.
    - Check with [[one's own words]] for [[understanding]] and [tell me if I'm wrong
- >  If someone says something to you, don't argue, just "confirm" it.
- >  ... If you bring a name and the editor warns you about it, you don't have to argue.
- >  I just want to [[understand]] what you just said about my name, so I will check it with [[one's own words]], so please tell me if it is [[wrong]]. Musha-san said that this name doesn't stand up to the character, and the reason why it doesn't stand up is that it is not interesting because the cool guy fights as cool as he is and wins to the end without even losing. So you said you wanted the character to lose once, right? You should ask him to confirm that.
- >  Then I said, "No, that's not the nuance. I said, "No, that's not the nuance. I'm just saying that it's not interesting because it's just cool and doesn't have any weaknesses or sloppy scenes, right?" Oh, well, that's what I meant." ...... If you check the information yourself, even after you get home, you will know what they wanted to say and what you should watch out for next time, right?
