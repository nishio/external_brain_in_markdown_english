Intellectual productivity is the process of increasing the value of the end product per input cost, and it is important to increase the value of ideas. Ideas are replicable resources, and ideas that are identical to existing ideas or that do not generate enthusiasm themselves are considered to be of low value. Ideas are valuable when they are nurtured and refined by investing effort. It is important to create and continue this "good state," which can be likened to a "plowed field.

The relevance of successful intelligence includes maintaining enjoyment and remaining intellectually productive. These are considered the most important objectives. It is also believed that the nature of intellectual production depends on the presence or absence of problem awareness.

Knowledge productivity is not only human; there are also new approaches that profit from uncertainty. To improve knowledge productivity, we need to improve the way we organize and analyze information.

A company is an aggregate of people, and an increase in the value of its people is considered an increase in the value of the company. Therefore, learning is encouraged.

Nishio's research note "Discomfort-Driven Intellectual Production" is relevant to the process of increasing the value of ideas. Also, "Granularity of Information" is helpful as a method to improve the way information is organized and analyzed.
