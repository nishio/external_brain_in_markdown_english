> [patcon_](https://x.com/patcon_/status/1871819409087692818) Hey @nishio this is so great! Mind if I get the link to the codebase? Trying to keep track of forks in [https://patcon.github.io/polis-awesome](https://patcon.github.io/polis-awesome) and sharing on the Polis User Group discord, so that people can share more code and experience :)

- [Awesome Polis](https://patcon.github.io/awesome-polis/?q=Polispilot)

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1871866020752978261) Thank you for information! Here is my report and open data for this project:

>  Separating the front end from the DB and the math server helps a lot!

> [patcon_](https://x.com/patcon_/status/1871927723863806305) Ah thank you so much! but I was also wondering about the fork of the [http://pol.is](http://pol.is) codebase :) i saw that you at one point were pointing a script at a now hidden Polis API endpoint, so thought maybe you were involved in that with
>  Yeah, thanks a lot! But I was also wondering about the pol.is codebase fork:) at some point I saw a script pointing to the now hidden Polis API endpoint, so maybe you are involved in that along with @Mielka_japan?

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1872098270916603974) Our project was a demonstration during the election period, developed within a few weeks, so we didn’t have time to fork and rewrite the Polis code. The frontend was built using Next.js and D3.js, utilizing the Polis server’s API for data retrieval and voting.

> [patcon_](https://x.com/patcon_/status/1872125583796355216) Ah gotcha! So to make sure I understand: you guys just scraped the /api/v3/participationInit endpoint of your self-hosted vanilla polis instance (using your record_api repo scripts), then built that data into your nextjs app that runs [http://japanchoice.jp...](http://japanchoice.jp...)

>  You guys are scraping the /api/v3/participationInit endpoint (using your record_api repository script) of your self-hosted vanilla police instance and running that data japanchoice.jp Have you incorporated it into your nextjs app?

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1872128035773923714) Yes, your understanding is correct that we used the participationInit endpoint of a self-hosted vanilla instance. The record_api was used to log data hourly for post-analysis purposes and wasn’t directly involved in the main functionality of the web service, but the mechanism is
>  Yes, your understanding that the participationInit endpoint of the self-hosted vanilla instance was used is correct. This record_api was used to record data hourly for post-hoc analysis purposes and was not directly involved in the main functionality of the web service, but the mechanism is the same.

> [patcon_](https://x.com/patcon_/status/1872126665712943228) And that app borrows & customises some react components from the polis repo's client-participation viz, but that codebase is private at this time? Truly no pressure, but do you think your d3 customizations might be open sourced? (I am def not implying you need to, to be clear!)

And I assume you ran tttc pieces periodically to generate group summaries? Sorry for all the Qs!)
>  (Finally, do you think the "party accounts" were self-manipulated by the polices and manipulated based on what the team agreed to in each party's responses? And do you think they routinely ran tttc pieces to generate group summaries? Sorry for all the Q's!

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1872132485783617563) Thank you for your interest in our project! We welcome your questions and may update the README of the open data repository later on.

>  We didn't use the Polis client-side codebase at all. Our goal was to replace it with a mobile-friendly interface, and starting from scratch was easier than reusing the existing components. Since we already had a Next.js build process and components for other JAPAN CHOICE services, we leveraged those. This makes it challenging to decouple and share the code. We'll discuss with the team to see if there's anything we can share.

>  Regarding the "party accounts," those were opinion data we created based on each party's manifesto. Good point! We organized the data in a Google Spreadsheet, reviewed it collaboratively, and then used Microsoft Playwright for browser automation to input those into the Polis instance.
>  For the "Political Party Accounts", the opinion data was based on each party's manifesto. Good point! After organizing and collaboratively reviewing the data in a Google spreadsheet, we used Microsoft Playwright to automate the browser and populate the Polis instance.
>  As for generating group summaries, we took inspiration from TTTC but didn’t use it directly. Instead, we used ChatGPT to draft explanations. This process wasn't automated—humans used ChatGPT, reviewed the results by other people, and, once approved, updated the JSON data embedded in the service and deployed it.
