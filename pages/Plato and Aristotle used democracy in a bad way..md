from  [[political cycle theory]]
Plato and Aristotle used democracy in a bad way.

[Theory of political cycles - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%94%BF%E4%BD%93%E5%BE%AA%E7%92%B0%E8%AB%96)
Off topic, but this part was interesting.
>  [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle.]] used the term "[[democratic system]]" ([[demokratia]]) to mean the same thing as "[[popular]] democracy," but [[Polyubios]] used "democracy" (demokratia) in the positive sense, and to describe "[[popular]] democracy" used the term "[[ oclokratia]]", which is also consistent with modern usage.

- [[Aristotle.]] called the normal state "[[republicanism]]" ([[Politeia]])
