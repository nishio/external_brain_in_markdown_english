URL-sharing online conference tool
- Metaphors divided into tables and conversing there.
    - Some functions are suited for purposes such as having people discuss at the table in separate time slots. General announcements during individual discussions, timers, etc.
- Student account creation is required.
    - Looks like we need to prepare in advance so we don't get slammed right before the start.
    - Especially when there are many people with low literacy. There are a lot of messages in English.
- Image and sound quality is poor compared to Zoom

- [[Remo Impressions]]

- If you create an event called `nishiotest', the URL will be `[https://live.remo.co/e/nishiotest`.](https://live.remo.co/e/nishiotest`.)
    - GUESS easy, but where to change?
- This is what happens when someone who is given this URL accesses it
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/e2257e4d6a072c2c2ac8b7435ee4002c/thumb/1000)

    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/e4351e4024566f457d77646a458cc1a7/thumb/1000)
- Once this is done, they ask if you want to turn on the camera, and if you choose not to, they say, "Really?" If I choose not to, they say, "Are you sure?

- The host can press the Present button and can choose to start speaking immediately or count down for 30 seconds
    - 30-second countdown is a good idea.
    - A 30-second countdown appears on the participant screen, which can be used to time the conversation to end.

- Here's a screen shot of the participants while the presentation is being given.
    - You cannot turn your own camera or microphone on or off.
    - I was thinking of a "video conferencing tool like Zoom," and when I entered the room as a participant, I was already in presentation mode, so I thought, "What? How are you going to get a picture of my face? I was like, "Can you hear me? I was in a state of "Can you hear me?

It has a [[sli.do]]-like question poll feature.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/9f478827ffd7af4fe622fdfa3e9ddbde/thumb/1000)
- While listening to the presentation, students can write their questions here or vote on questions written by others.

Whiteboard is Deskle
- [https://deskle.com/](https://deskle.com/)
- Seems like there is not enough testing on the iPad.
    - Selecting the pen tool in Pencil on iPad, the pen tool is highlighted, but when you try to draw, it becomes a screen drag.
        - If you choose the Pen tool with your finger and then draw with your finger, you can also draw with Pencil.

- There is a co-host-like function.
    - I couldn't find it easily and thought it wasn't there.

- No free plan
    - I see a lot of people saying that $50/month is expensive.
    - Whether it's expensive or not depends on the situation, but a lot of people seem to be mistaken.
    - Not "per participant."
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/1a21888d7c0a4f03e596fa29e2b6f191/thumb/1000)
    - Up to 1 event for up to 50 people at the same time for $50/month, up to 3 events for up to 200 people at the same time for $150/month
