title: "A move that is not an immediate response to a bite, but an ear-red one with a big-picture view."

Atari with [[ability that outdoes (shames) one's opponent]] instead of sokutsugi [[big-picture perspective]].

[Honinbo Shusaku Igo Memorial Hall - A Move of Ear Red](https://honinbo.shusaku.in/mimiaka.html)

After the opponent says, "I'm going to take it, I'm going to cut it" (Atari)
Instead of using [[reactive]] time to deal with "don't get taken, don't get cut off."
It is important to find actions ([[ability that outdoes (shames) one's opponent]]) that have a beneficial effect on multiple domains with a [[big-picture perspective]] and play [[proactively]] ahead of time. The metaphor of Go is used to describe this idea.
