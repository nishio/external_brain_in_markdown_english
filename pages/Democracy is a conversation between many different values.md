title: "Democracy is a conversation between many different values"
---

from [[Audrey Tang Keynote for LibreCon 2016]]
- [Inaugural Speech of Dr. Tsai Ing-wen
- He said, "Before, democracy was a clash between two opposing values, but now democracy must be a conversation, a dialogue, between many different values. We need to build a unified democracy that is not hijacked by ideology. We need to build a pragmatic democracy that can respond to the needs of the private sector and civil society in a timely manner. Finally, we need to build a democracy where people value each other and each other's feelings. We do this by just listening, and all the technology, all the open technology, is there to help us listen to each other at large. So keep listening to each other. Thank you for listening to me."
