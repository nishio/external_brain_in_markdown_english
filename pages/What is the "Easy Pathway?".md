title: 'What is the "Easy Pathway?"'

An experiment in which a new concept called [[Easy Path]] is explained by voice while taking a walk, which is then organized in a dialogue with the AI afterwards.

To understand this concept, it is best to begin with the metaphor of the "fog of war."

## What is [fog of war
?
The term "fog of war" refers to situations where information is incomplete, the situation is uncertain, and it is difficult to determine which course of action is best. In the real world, such situations often occur. For example, they can be new ventures in business, new explorations in scientific research, or solving sudden problems in everyday life.

## What is [Easy Pathway
?
The term "easy path" refers to the ability to find an efficient way to reach a destination in such uncertain situations by abstracting experience, intuition, or existing knowledge and applying it to a new domain. This "[the way (of proper conduct, etc.)" is not literal; it refers to a strategy or methodology for problem solving.

## Why is the "Easy Pathway" so important?"
The ability to find the "easy path" is critical to achieving your objectives quickly and at low cost. Being able to find a path hidden in the fog faster than others gives you a huge advantage over the competition. This can be applied to a variety of issues in business, science, technology, or even everyday life.

## How do I find the "easy pathway?"
- Abstraction of experience: generalize one's own experience so that it can be applied to different situations.
- Cultivate intuition: train people to trust and follow their intuition. Intuition is based on [[unconscious insights]] from previous experiences and learning.
- Learning and applying: actively learning new knowledge and attempting to apply it [[to different disciplines]].

The ability to find "easy pathways" does not happen overnight. You can gradually improve this ability by refining your own knowledge and intuition through daily experience. When faced with an unknown situation or a complex problem, you too will be able to find the "easy path".

The ability to be able to do this occurs.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Understood. Let me rearrange your opening statement into a clearer and more understandable form with respect to the "easy pathway".

A person with experience in a particular area can have the ability to find hidden "easy pathways" that have not yet been discovered in different areas by abstracting that knowledge once it is available. This abstraction allows one to generalize a known experience and apply it to an entirely different situation. People with this ability can find more efficient and less expensive paths to reach their goals that others may have overlooked.

This description describes the ability to abstract knowledge and experience in one area and apply it to an entirely different problem-solving arena to find new solutions and approaches. It emphasizes the flexibility and creativity to transfer ideas between different disciplines and find new "easy pathways".

Hint: In the presence of "fog of war" there is uncertainty as to "whether there is a low-cost way through." However, some people can be convinced that a path exists, even if the path itself is hidden and invisible by the fog. This reduces the cost and speed of decision making.

However, some people can be intuitively convinced that "[[a]] path exists" there, even if that path is obscured by fog. This certainty enables them to act more quickly, reducing decision-making costs more than others. This ability is honed by abstracting experience and knowledge and applying it to different disciplines and situations. This is how they are able to find invisible "easy pathways".

This concept emphasizes the importance of the ability to rely on experience and intuition to find a sure path in uncertain situations. This ability enables quick and efficient decision-making and provides an important strategy for overcoming difficult situations.

Organized in this way, we can focus on specifics, such as further questions about this concept or capability, or how this capability can be cultivated. Do you have any specific questions?
