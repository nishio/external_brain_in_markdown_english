- [[A series of pictures of two people saying different things]]
- Mr. A. "I don't think zero is good."
- Mr. B: "However, 100 is not good..."

This diagram is called "0 and 100" so it is easy to see that there are other ideas in between
- Is 30 better, 50 better, or 70 better?
    - This is currently ambiguous
    - Neither A nor B verbalized it.

In reality, "ambiguous and unverbalized options" are difficult to see, which tends to lead to perceptions like "there is a plan A and a plan B".
    - [[choosing the wrong two options]]

[[0 or 1]]
    - [[Continuous value instead of 0 or 1]]

- [[all-or-none thinking]]

- [[The point is balance.]]
