from [[pRegroup2020]]
- [[I want to duplicate a sticky note in a snap.]]
- Click -> [[Balloon Menu]] "Duplicate
    - Duplicate stickies should remain connected to each other.
        - Displayed in the related sticky link

- Mind maps make common marks on branches and leaves.
    - This is in organizing with paper and pen where "select and move" is not possible.
        - Workaround to relate "things that are far apart as a tree but related"
- When there are two related stickies, sometimes it is less expensive to mark them both in common than to move them closer together with a set of surrounding arrangements.
    - Even in Regroup, representations do not always fit in two dimensions, so tools are needed to correlate distant objects.
- It might be interesting to create a temporary view that brings [[cloned sticky note]] placed at a distance to the same position, while respecting the human manual layout data.
    - You don't have to automatically rearrange all the stickies, just the ones around the cloned sticky.
        - Take 5 close stickies of each cloned sticky
        - Project each of them into two dimensions, keeping the distance as much as possible.
    - I wonder if it will be like that.
