title: "Experience is multi-schematic, diary is temporal scheme"
---

- [[experience]] is [[multischemic]] ([[multischematic]]), [[diary]] is [[temporal scheme]] of [[one dimensional]]
- PS: Schema or [[scheme]] or shaky and not good. Meaning something like "structure."
    - I thought about unifying it with "structure," but then I'd lose the connection to this
    - > When symbolizing experience, the scheme is not one way, it is a multi-scheme multischematic.

        - I'll try my best to describe "multi-scheme-like" in Japanese as "any number of possible forms."

The one-dimensionality allows us to concentrate on putting what is in our mind out in the form of letters, without [[decision-making]] about "where to write" or "what kind of structure to use". There is only one "place to write now.

On the other hand, when using it, it can only be pulled out with [[temporal scheme]].
This means that [[paper diary]] would only allow a "look before and after" access pattern.
A slightly ingenious paper diary "[[10-Year Diary]]" provides speedy access to "n years ago today.
- If you are keeping a diary as [[searchable]] digital text, another scheme is mechanically generated that says, "Documents in which a common string appears are related. Let's call it [[string coprime]].

Scrapbox-like bracketing of diary-like writing is to explicitly assign a string co-occurrence scheme to something that was once written out along a time axis. The only difference is that the co-occurrence is judged as "explicitly bracketed" rather than "full text".
Scrapbox is easy because there is no need to "create" categories and tags in advance.

The ability for readers to change the sort order of the Scrapbox home page is a multi-scheme feature. I don't know how many people make use of this feature...
For example, if the entries are ordered by creation date, this would be the same scheme as a diary or [[Blog]].

Scrapbox implicitly records the date and time when a page is created and can be viewed at any time. It is not displayed in a conspicuous place.
Instead, the "title" is in a prominent place, and this title connects to the links in the rest of the text.
