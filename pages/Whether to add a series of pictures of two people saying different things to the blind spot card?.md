Whether to add a series of pictures of two people saying different things to the blind spot card?
- We have some things in common and in a broad sense it is the same set, but I don't think we need to mix them now. The state of mind is much different.
    - This one is the one that goes in when you think, "Oh, I didn't notice" or "Oh, you didn't notice?
    - The other one is the one that goes in when you think, "You know what, they're not on the same page because - you know what?
- It's encompassed in the form of, "Oh, you don't realize why you two are at odds."
    - [[Even if X contains Y, there is no need to call Y X.]]
