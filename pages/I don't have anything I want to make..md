Barriers Standing in the Way of Programming Learners

> [@shokai](https://twitter.com/shokai/status/1508942582788726784): [I don't have anything I want to make. I don't know how to make it.
> [@shokai](https://twitter.com/shokai/status/1508946950317502466): I feel that the quantity and quality of ideas I come up with has increased when I increase the speed of creation.
> Anyway, I recommend making something every week, whether it's a bus stop timetable, a camera that automatically takes pictures of people approaching, or a twitter bot, just think of it like modifying a library or API sample code that you can find anywhere around.

- You need to know "[[way of making]]" in order to come up with the idea of "what you want to make."
    - The more [Belief that we can make it.
    - If you don't know how to make it at all, of course it won't be "[I want to make it.

Can we call it solution-driven?

        - [[Without a hammer, not even a nail looks like a nail.]]
    - This is nice.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/mtane0412/icon' alt='/villagepump/mtane0412.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/くま子/icon' alt='/villagepump/くま子.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - And since `if all you have is a hammer`, this is also a good match, since it can lead to the idea that you should have as many solutions as possible.

Maybe rewriting and modifying the existing UserScript myself was a good way to increase the number of solutions.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
- I found [[emoji selector]] and thought it was awesome and immediately wanted to modify it myself.
    - If you apply the same technique, you will be able to supplement links to external projects as well.
    - The first thing I put on [/takker](https://scrapbox.io/takker) was the test code for this.
- During this modification process, I began to see what JavaScript could do.
- After that, by writing everything from small scripts such as Popup Menu to large scripts such as [[History Slider]] that create UI from scratch, I accumulated a lot of case studies of what can be created using what method.
- Thanks to this, I can quickly determine whether or not I can use JS to make what I want to make.

[Programming beginners tend to worry that they don't have anything they want to make, but in this day and age, it's more unusual for people to be on the side that has something they want to make - Togetter](https://togetter.com/li/1945433)
- In an age of saturation where IT engineers around the world are building apps, it's crazy to be "the guy on the side who has something to build".

        - After that I can now quickly determine if I can make it in JS for something I want to make".
        - You can't [Determine if you can make it.
        - So it feels like everything [["requires a certain level of skill"]].
        - ["You can't do it out of the blue without making something crappy.
