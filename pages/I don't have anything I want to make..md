Barriers Standing in the Way of Programming Learners

> [@shokai](https://twitter.com/shokai/status/1508942582788726784): [I don't have anything I want to make. I don't know how to make it.
> [@shokai](https://twitter.com/shokai/status/1508946950317502466): I feel that the quantity and quality of ideas I come up with has increased when I increase the speed of creation.
> Anyway, I recommend making something every week, whether it's a bus stop timetable, a camera that automatically takes pictures of people approaching, or a twitter bot, just think of it like modifying a library or API sample code that you can find anywhere around.

- You need to know "[[way of making]]" in order to come up with the idea of "what you want to make."
    - The more [Belief that we can make it.
    - If you don't know how to make it at all, of course it won't be "[I want to make it.

Can we call it solution-driven?

        - [[Without a hammer, not even a nail looks like a nail.]]
    - This is nice.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/mtane0412/icon' alt='/villagepump/mtane0412.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/くま子/icon' alt='/villagepump/くま子.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - And since `if all you have is a hammer`, this is also a good match, since it can lead to the idea that you should have as many solutions as possible.

Maybe rewriting and modifying the existing UserScript myself was a good way to increase the number of solutions.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
- I found [[emoji selector]] and thought it was awesome and immediately wanted to modify it myself.
    - If you apply the same technique, you will be able to supplement links to external projects as well.
    - The first thing I put on [/takker](https://scrapbox.io/takker) was the test code for this.
- During this modification process, I began to see what JavaScript could do.
- After that, by writing everything from small scripts such as Popup Menu to large scripts such as [[History Slider]] that create UI from scratch, I accumulated a lot of case studies of what can be created using what method.
- Thanks to this, I can quickly determine whether or not I can use JS to make what I want to make.

    - In the above examplesPopup Menuなどの小さなscriptから 作ってるから そこそこな技量を要求され てはない<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - After that I can now quickly determine if I can make it in JS for something I want to make".
        - You can't [Determine if you can make it.
        - So it feels like everything [["requires a certain level of skill"]].
        - ["You can't do it out of the blue without making something crappy.
