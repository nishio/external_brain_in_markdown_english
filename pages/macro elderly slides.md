> [hukeiro114514](https://x.com/hukeiro114514/status/1952246205272162732) The problem caused by "too many old people" can only be solved by "fewer old people".
>  Don't run away from the cleanliness.

> [hukeiro114514](https://x.com/hukeiro114514/status/1952690017798935001) So far the best idea to "reduce" the elderly without spilling blood is
>  It sounds like you define "old man" starting at "80 years old".
>  If both pensions and long-term care insurance coverage were to start at age 80, fiscal discipline would be maintained for now.
>  If life expectancy increases, just let it slide.
    - [[The challenge is to reduce the probability of a violent revolution against the elderly.]]

> [NihonMiraiKids](https://x.com/NihonMiraiKids/status/1952691472530350306) Raise the definition of old people as the average age increases.
>  This is the most peaceful and rational way to do it.

>  Macro elderly slide.

> [NihonMiraiKids](https://x.com/NihonMiraiKids/status/1952720698457423955) I think the idea of "macro geriatric sliding scale", or "only the top 10% of the population is considered old", is pretty good.
>  The working-age population will no longer have to worry about an increased burden, and above all, it will motivate the elderly to support childbearing.
