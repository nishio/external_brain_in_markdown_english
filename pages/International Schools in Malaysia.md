> Malaysia is known as a "low-cost international school powerhouse" with numerous international schools and relatively inexpensive tuition fees. There are approximately 200 international schools throughout Malaysia, with more than 100 schools in the Kuala Lumpur area alone. Furthermore, new schools are opening every year, so the number of options is increasing every year.

> There are many international schools in Japan, but the cost is extremely high. Generally, the enrollment fee alone is about 1 million yen, and it is not unusual for the annual tuition to reach 2.5 million yen. Including school bus fare and lunch and meal expenses, a budget of more than 3 million yen per year is required.
>  Furthermore, most international schools in Japan have a majority of Japanese students and may not necessarily be an international environment. This slows down the progress of English, and some say that it is not worth paying the high tuition fees.

> On the other hand, some international schools in Malaysia charge an entrance fee of about 100,000 yen and annual tuition of 500,000 to 700,000 yen, making them very cost-effective, even including family living expenses.

They feel that it's expensive, but it's not good value for money because it's all Japanese.
