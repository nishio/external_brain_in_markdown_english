title: "Maintain tests, not code"

> [zach_leee](https://x.com/zach_leee/status/1627847012220809216) senior "Don't just take the code generated by the AI. You have to understand what it says, and then build it in as you go along."
>  "That way of doing things is old-fashioned. You pass all the tests, so it's OK. Think about maintenance? I just have to re-generate it each time, right? (To be honest, my senior's generating ability is not so good...I want to quit this kind of company)

> [s5ml](https://x.com/s5ml/status/1875615781914079475) This is the way it should be. It is not the code that should be maintained, but the test items.
>  The current "it is OK to manage high-level language code and compile it each time, and there is no need to know the contents of the binary that the compiler spits out" will become "it is OK to manage test items and generate code each time + run automated tests, and there is no need to know the contents of the code".
