- Rather than growing smoothly on a known measure of intelligible real values, [[new combinations]] are occurring [[stochastically]].
    - At some point [[the cracks connect and cause major destruction]].
            - [[Even if it makes a hole in the levee.]]

    - No single event by itself is likely to have a significant impact.
        - When the conditions are met [[the pieces fit together]].

- [[Easy-to-understand scale]] / [[Real-valued scale]] / [[Known scale]]
- [[smooth growth]].
