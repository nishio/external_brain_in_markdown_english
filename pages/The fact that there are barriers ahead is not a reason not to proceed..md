story
- As we move forward, we get a better view of what lies ahead.
- Suppose you see a wall ahead.
- If you can't find a way around the wall at this point, that's no reason to stop moving forward.
- Because as we move forward, we will have a better view of what lies ahead.
    - What looks like an impassable wall from afar may actually be a crumbling wall that can be avoided with a slight detour
- If we don't move forward, the wall will remain a wall.

discussion
- Is it true that "if you don't move on, the wall will remain a wall?"
    - Not really, even if you just wait, it can happen that the walls come crashing down for causes other than yourself.
    - Just looking at it from afar, it's hard to tell if it's going to collapse if we wait a little longer or if it's not going to break in the foreseeable future.
- You can't always find a loophole when you get close.
    - that's so
    - If you can think of a more promising path than "going up against the wall," you better do it.
    - When you can't think of anything, it's better to walk into a wall than to choose to stay.

relevance
    - [[Attacking the unfamiliar without looking at it properly.]]
    - Related to the point, "you know when you get close, but you stay far away."
    - [[Examine the shape of the constraint]]
    - A story about an area of uncertainty in the way forward that caused him to take a detour for fear of [[hitting a wall]], but he was actually glad to go straight ahead.
    - [[Inheritance of helplessness]]
        - Find [[Reasons why you can't]] and misinterpret it as if it were a solid wall
    - [[The pessimistic misconception that "it can't be done."]]
    - Misperceptions are difficult to resolve when incorrectly assumed to be "impossible".
    - [[Digging into the Wall of Impossibility]]
    - This seems to be related in terms of language, but I'm not sure how it connects yet.

Expansion of pertinent judgment
- [[You have to get close to the wall to see the hole in the wall]].
    - [[hole in wall]]
