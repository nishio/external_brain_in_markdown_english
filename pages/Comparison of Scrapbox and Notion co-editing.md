title: "Comparison of Scrapbox and Notion co-editing"
---

I've been co-editing with Scrapbox for years, and recently experienced co-editing with Notion, so I'll note what I feel... I'm not familiar with Notion compared to Scrapbox, so "there is no equivalent feature to ~" means "I don't know, let me know if there is".

Notion is useful for collecting a large number of items with a fixed format.

        - Twitter and Github IDs are taken from personal records in lookups.

        - The first field is the record of the profile, or in programmers' terms, the "type", so it can be used to provide input assistance
        - They would use the information in this field to lookup Twitter and other information.

        - What's on this page is being treated as a record.
        - In addition, just by clicking on the link of the name, the linked page comes up from the right side without page transition.
            - I would like to see this feature in Scrapbox!

Unlike Scrapbox, there are no telomeres, so you can't notice when others are editing off-screen.

Scrapbox has a prominent search bar, and there is a sense of focus on making it easier to search.

Scrapbox is bulleted, so you can insert a line anywhere and comment on it.

- Notion allows you to select a string and comment on it.

- It's a divide and con depending on the culture.
    - The style of commenting on the side of the Notion separates the subject from the audience.
        - Some people may feel safer that way (e.g., they can't bear to pollute the text).
    - Scrapbox's "insert line anywhere style" can make the whole thing difficult to read due to sentences inserted by others in the middle of your chunks of text
        - A "no monopoly on blocks of text" kind of culture.
            - Culture that says if you think it's hard to read, then the person who thinks it's hard to read should write a clean copy, and it's not a good idea to restrict the freedom to write anywhere.
            - I think the members of the community need to really believe that they are each other's equals.
                - Otherwise...
                - The "big guy" gets mad at the person who writes to him or her.
                - People who "think they are new" are hesitant to write or

Each Scrapbox page is a separate page
- Notion's "what looks like a page" is sometimes a table record.

    - Is there a page in here about individual events? I think so, but this is a table of events
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/17aff6b6c8833276e85d38f7541d31e3/thumb/1000)
    - In fact, it's right here.

    - The nested structure of the data structure does not match the structure of information as humans think of it.


Notion's editor's cursor comes out line by line.
- Scrapbox is character-based
