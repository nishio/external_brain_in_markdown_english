title: "I am an imposter!"
---

- [imposter syndrome
If the problem is that you are an imposter and you feel guilty because you feel like you are cheating people, then I thought, why not just declare "I am an imposter! I am an imposter!

- If indeed it is an imposter,
    - I'm being honest and stating that I'm an imposter.
    - So I'm not deceiving you.
    - No more reason to feel guilty.
- If not an imposter
    - It is not correct to declare that he is an Imposter.
    - But he's lying, but he's lying in the direction of his own loss.
    - I'm not causing others to lose money.
    - There's no reason to feel guilty because you're reaping the rewards of your own incorrect representations.

I got the idea from the drama, The Umbrella Academy, where the character who was feted as the guru of a new religion confessed in front of his followers, "I am a fraud."
