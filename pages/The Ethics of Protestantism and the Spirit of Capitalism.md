- The spirit of [[Protestantism's ethics]] and [capitalism
        - [[protestant]]
- Written by [Max Weber
- > This is a groundbreaking essay that investigates the historical paradox that the economic ethic of Puritanism, which was hostile to the pursuit of profit, actually contributed greatly to the birth of modern capitalism. This is the starting point of the vast comparative sociological study of religion that Max Weber (1864-1920) devoted his life to. The previous edition has been completely revised to make it even more readable and comprehensible, and an extensive commentary has been added.
