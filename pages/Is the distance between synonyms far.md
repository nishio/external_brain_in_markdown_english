title: "Is the distance between synonyms far"
---

In the vector embedding of words, is it appropriate, as some studies have shown, to make [[antonym]] vectors far away?

    - [[There is more than one conflict.]]
    - It is natural to view this as a reversal of only a specific axis.
- Conflict is also a "relationship" and is "closer" than irrelevant
- The idea that confrontation is a distant thing hinders [[sublation (philosophy)]].

- suggestion
        - [[A is non-A and thereby A]]
