Record references to the phrase "[[broad listening]]"

> [sk_ut](https://x.com/sk_ut/status/1800836228407026091) Broad listening, advocated by Takahiro Yasuno for #Governor, will be key to its acceptance in the government world.
>
>  AI extracts citizens' voices and selects what is really needed. The ultimate direct democracy. Taxes will be distributed in a world where ideology does not intervene, and the profession of politician and elections will no longer be necessary.

> [Btaros](https://x.com/Btaros/status/1800768546919854137) Broadlining, analyzing the comments to the news of the announcement of the runoff, is promising and likely to contribute to democratic deliberation. But the technical execution is ghastly.
(refer to TTTC)

> [Rubyk_D](https://x.com/Rubyk_D/status/1800737966643663109) Do you like a democracy where there is a bias towards those with the loudest voices (or intentionally selective opinions)? Isn't broad listening going to be important in the future? It may be a very tough fight, considering we start by spreading the concept, but I'd like to push for the future.

> [BeVi56174065](https://x.com/BeVi56174065/status/1800154224703271320) Broad listening, you want to hear from everyone? I'm going to go say it.

> [ch468](https://x.com/ch468/status/1800023520761753867) "Mr. Tan praised Mr. Anno's approach of "broad listening broadly. A method that uses technology to gather voters' opinions and reflect them in his manifesto."
>  / AI Engineer Takahiro Yasuno, a graduate of the Matsuo Lab at the University of Tokyo, announces his candidacy for Governor of Tokyo Tokyo Will Tokyoites choose the next Audrey Tan?

> [tachemi](https://x.com/tachemi/status/1800002790808539385) Mr. Anno is the Matsuo Lab, or Audrey Tan is the Minister of Digital Affairs and not the Führer - I share the open source spirit, but the broad listening,

> [bushdog](https://x.com/bushdog/status/1799086268737044955) The Matsuo Institute is one of the most controversial groups in academia and industry, but I have high hopes for Yasuno's policies. There are some rosy visions ahead, but ideas like broad listening and politics-by-technology are interesting. A turning point for an economy and capitalism dependent on population and resources.

> [Syousetsu_K](https://x.com/Syousetsu_K/status/1798864014849741015), so in the end it will be very important to see how his system actually works once the election period starts, and depending on the results, it could be like "Broad Depending on the results, it could be something like "broad listening is worth testing, but it's too early to actually incorporate it into politics".

> [Syousetsu_K](https://x.com/Syousetsu_K/status/1798863168045015235) I got really excited and I said, "Broad listening is the best!　I welcome it with open arms! But the fact is that even the X community notes are starting to pass private sanctions, so I think there is also a danger of getting the masses directly involved in politics.

> [Syousetsu_K](https://x.com/Syousetsu_K/status/1798853067116527957) This broad listening case is a matter that could completely change the very structure of Japanese politics if it's not handled properly. I think that those who are for it as well as those who are against it should be actively involved in this matter!

>  I see that Nishio has also updated us on Broad Listening, with notes in Scrapbox.

>  *Scrapbox is like a wiki that can be used individually or collaboratively (is this description correct?) while linking many pieces of information with related links, etc.

> [Syousetsu_K](https://x.com/Syousetsu_K/status/1798842107442176024) Since broad listening is still a relatively new concept, there are many things worth learning.

>  I think it is a well-known fact that it is very dangerous to simply "decide the opinions of a large number of people by majority vote," although I still think that the person who ultimately makes the decision and steers the ship is important,

> [Syousetsu_K](https://x.com/Syousetsu_K/status/1798835344206643635) Yeah, but can we also solicit solutions to these issues from many people through broad listening, or if the issues cannot be resolved, we can forgo it? Can we do that ......?
>
>  No, this is great, really ......

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1798803439851348105) I looked at the Broad Listening page and thought "I'll link to Polis and Talk to the City as specific technologies" and then I looked at the respective pages and there was no explanation at all! I looked at the Broad Listening page and thought "I'll link to Polis and Talk to the City as specific technologies! I need to improve these pages as well! This is a real example of socially triggered information structuring!

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1798793441847201978) Audrey Tan: "I like the way Mr. Anno combines broad listening, the my number system, and the open source spirit. Mr. Anno is not protesting, I like that very much. I think you are saying that we can change for the better."

> [Syousetsu_K](https://x.com/Syousetsu_K/status/1798728860768559127) My personal impression is that digital elections are about how to deal with the issue of the danger of someone being forced to do something, and AI assistants are a device for catching up. I can't help but feel that the AI assistant is a catchy buzz-gathering device ......, but "broad listening via GitHub" can directly approach the political structure itself.

> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1796401154076881407) Broad listening by LLM, very good for extracting the whole sense of discussion from a large amount of text, so for applications such as visualization of pubic comments. I think it would be good if it were used more.
>  >[nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1796370976730722377) 5957 opinions for 2013 people were extracted from the public comments on AI and copyright collected by the Agency for Cultural Affairs, and analyzed and visualized by AI (Talk to the City). AI (Talk to the City) was used to analyze and visualize them.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1796395791596355715) The mass media, for all their claims to "mass *communication*," often do only one-way "broadcasting" and tend to neglect "broad listening" in the opposite direction. Broad listening" in the opposite direction tends to be neglected. Communication requires listening as well as speaking; AI (LLM) technology can assist with this.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1796394634446586276) Audrey Tang and Glen Weyl's recent book "⿻數位Plurality: The Future of Collaborative Technology and Democracy" #pluralitybook by Audrey Tang and Glen Weyl. In other words, it is not only important to "broadcast" information widely to people, but also to gather information from people.
