title: "Building a Tachikoma with LEGO6"
---

- Following on from [[Building a Tachikoma with LEGO 4]], this is a story about re-building the Tachikoma that I first built in [[Building a Tachikoma with LEGO 1]].
In 4, we made the top half and the carry, so this time we will make the legs.

- I was happy to see that the [[Divide 4 into 3]] pattern made the mouth work too (it didn't in 1), but compared to [original](http://www2p.biglobe.ne.jp/~s-hf/toy/lego/legooli20.htm), 1 is closer.

    - I should have taken a picture in the same pose as the original.

When I was 1, it was [[Technique Block 1 x 2 - Pin hole 1]] + [[Technique Connector Peg]].

- Mouth hole size 4 is closer to the original
- Doesn't look like it needs to be flipped on the peg.
- The length is a little shorter and closer to the original.

Also, I just realized that the original doesn't have a [[wedge plate 3x6]] on the bottom, I assumed that's what both 1 and 4 were.

- Uh, the original is placed 1/2 pitch off.
- I didn't realize it because I assumed the bottom plate was the same shape.

Hmmm, the 1×3 tiles that underpin the legs are not connected to anywhere... a bit unsettling.
