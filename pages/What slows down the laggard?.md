Why is [[laggard]] late?

interpretation
- Products that will eventually reach 100% penetration
- So utility should be higher than the amount.
- So why didn't I buy it in the first place?
- It presumed that utility was not higher than the amount

There are two interpretations.
- A: Each customer's utility estimate is a point estimate, and the estimates vary from person to person.
- B: The customer's utility estimate is a distribution, and which point of the distribution is chosen as the representative value varies from person to person.
- Advantages of B
    - Can express the convergence of anxiety due to lack of information as more information becomes available.
- Disadvantages of B
    - There is no reason for the distribution to be shared across people.
