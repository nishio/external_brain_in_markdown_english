<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/kei/icon' alt='kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's good to have a sense of what to talk about at an internal study session on "Let Chaos Speak."
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/kei/icon' alt='kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the "streak" of this "streak"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's about where you start your story and what you land on via what.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/kei/icon' alt='kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the "story" about?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>One hour story. Oh yeah, I can't decide how to end it because I can't estimate the volume after all.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/kei/icon' alt='kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that "story"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I want to make sure my understanding is solid by doing that.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/kei/icon' alt='kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "I" is that "I"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I'm going to have a study session on the KJ method for another matter, so I want to make sure I understand it well.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/kei/icon' alt='kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "understanding" is that "understanding"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Indeed. To be able to answer questions from the participants and to improve the future lives of the participants who hear the answers.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/kei/icon' alt='kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the "answer" to this question?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It needs to be convincing to the learner.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/kei/icon' alt='kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "participant" is this "participant"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>People who have experience with the KJ method itself, but are not quite sure how to use it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/kei/icon' alt='kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "KJ method" is this "KJ method"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Sure, this is clumsily lumped under the term KJ method, but it's a low-resolution concept, and since KJ method is a means, not an end, maybe it's better to focus on the end.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/kei/icon' alt='kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that "KJ method"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Surprisingly, about 90% of Jiro Kawakita's own works are not KJ method but expedition net
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/kei/icon' alt='kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is that "KJ method"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>First, it was introduced in party science, then it became a long seller with its idea method, various books were published, and 20 years later, "Let Chaos Speak" was released.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/kei/icon' alt='kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>There are many updates to "Let Chaos Speak" compared to the well-read "Ideas", and if more people know about it, those who didn't understand it well at the "Ideas" stage will have a better chance of understanding it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/kei/icon' alt='kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between that "let it speak" and "let chaos speak"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>They're pointing to the same book.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/kei/icon' alt='kei.icon' height="19.5"/>

- What kind of "chaos to speak of" is this "chaos to speak of"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The paper is devoted to talking about W-type problem-solving methods, exploratory studies, and exploratory nets, not just the KJ method.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/kei/icon' alt='kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is this "KJ method"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Distributed in three places, first the narrow KJ method, then the cumulative KJ method, with a light touch on what we do as a group.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/kei/icon' alt='kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is that "KJ method" like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>An easy way out of the fog of blindness, to use Jiro Kawakita's words.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/kei/icon' alt='kei.icon' height="19.5"/>

- What else can you tell us about this "let chaos speak"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I think you are dealing with chaos, or rather, with a large amount of data that is beyond your capacity. If you perceive it as negative chaos, your mind unconsciously shuts out information. By recognizing the large amount of data as "something that comes out of it," or "something that speaks to you," it is beneficial to have an attitude of "What does it speak to me? It is beneficial to have an attitude of mind that says, "What does it tell us?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/kei/icon' alt='kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "chaos" is this "chaos"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Even with the same amount of data, new things are more likely to be created when items that seem to be related are placed close together than when they are shuffled and arranged in a square. and the question prompts verbalization.

- Is there anything else you can tell us about this "chaos"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Chaos is an important key word, so maybe we can dig a little deeper into what Jiro Kawakita says.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/kei/icon' alt='kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is this "chaos"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Not the label itself, but the "shadow" that is "behind" if you want to use a positional metaphor to describe it.

- >  Chaos is an important key word, so maybe we can dig a little deeper into what Jiro Kawakita says.
- How do you know about this "chaos"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>We need to train ourselves to pay attention not to the words themselves, but to what is behind them.

- >  Chaos is an important key word, so maybe we can dig a little deeper into what Jiro Kawakita says.
- Where does this "chaos" come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Those who think of chaos negatively may perceive it as chaos coming from outside of themselves and attacking them. Those who think of chaos positively may see it as a fountain of creativity rising from within. Fountain or plant metaphor.

For some reason, the export to Scrapbox was interrupted halfway through.
