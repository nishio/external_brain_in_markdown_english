title: "Splitting links that are too large"
---

- [[The Problem of Too Large Links]] is a problem that inevitably occurs when the number of pages in Scrapbox increases.

Consider an algorithm to split links that are too large.
    - [[Narrow down your search by crossing keywords]]
    - Easy to implement
    - The link names created are mechanical [[dull and uninteresting]].
    - [[Hierarchical clustering to split links that are too large]]
    - Split into multiple groups
    - What name to give it is delicate.
- Proposal to grow keywords by involving surrounding words.
    - It will be the most human-friendly link name.

Links that are too large are complete graphs
- The problem that inevitably arises when the number of pages to consider an algorithm for partitioning this complete graph increases

What will be the index for optimization then?
- Not to minimize the increase in distance.
    - because if short distance is good, it is best to make all pages the same tag and all complete graphs with distance 1
    - We need to make divisions so that what should be near is near and what should be far away is far away.
