If you can't say that number, don't you have zero credibility?
    - > "Fukushima Minpo conducted the survey by landline phone and the number of respondents was 718," Fukushima Minpo told the SAKISIRU editorial office on the same day. We do not disclose details by age group," and reiterated its intention not to reveal the numbers of 18- and 19-year-olds. He also declined to answer questions raised on the Internet about whether the number of respondents was too small, saying, "We do not answer such questions.
