title: "Realize you are losing your cool."
---

- I'm not good at [[Task Management]], but I've come to [[notice]] that I'm losing [[my cool]].
    - I [[fidgety]] and behaved like I was going to do a little bit and then move on to another task, so I decided it was a [[state anomaly]], and I [[took a step back]].
