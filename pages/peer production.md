"Peer Production" refers to a decentralized production model in which individual contributors work together rather than relying on a centralized organization or hierarchical management to produce a product or service. In this approach, participants contribute their skills, knowledge, and time to a shared resource to jointly create value. Typical examples of peer production include [[open source software]] ([[OSS]]) projects and [[joint editing]] projects such as [[Wikipedia]].

Features of peer production include

- [Non-hierarchical: There is no strict hierarchy among project participants and contributions are voluntary.
    - [[open access]] : Everyone can participate and contribute to the project.
- [Collaboration and Sharing: Participants share knowledge, codes, information, etc. with each other and work together.

[[Yochai Benkler]] highlighted this production model as a new form of [[social production]], noting that peer production has different motivations and incentives than traditional market or organizational production. For example, open source software developers often participate not for monetary rewards, but for reasons of self-fulfillment, contribution to the community, and technical interest or challenge. This approach to peer production has become more influential with the development of the Internet and digital technology, especially in the areas of technology and information.
