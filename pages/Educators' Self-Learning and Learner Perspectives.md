## Digest 1
Self-learning may be inhibited when the role becomes that of a "teachable person."

## Digest 2
.
The observation that the role of "teacher" hinders self-learning is related to fragments from "The Problem of the Teacher," "BPStudy: The Art of Learning for Engineers," "The Greatest Obstacle to Learning is Teaching the Answer," "What is Learning? Engineerly Thinking and Principles," and "Polis: 'People who learn on their own' and 'People who learn because they are expected to'" fragments are relevant. These fragments suggest that "those who teach" may inhibit their own learning. In particular, the "BPStudy Learning Techniques for Engineers" suggests a shift from the "teaching role" to the "teaching role". Also, in "The Greatest Obstacle to Learning is Teaching the Answer," it is pointed out that teaching the answer takes away the opportunity to learn. These fragments indicate that the "teachable" role may hinder self-learning.

## deep thinking
The observation that the role of the "teacher" impedes self-learning provides an opportunity to think deeply about the role and methods of education. As educators continue to self-learn, they may be able to provide more effective education. In addition, educators themselves can gain a deeper understanding of learners' needs and challenges by taking the learner's perspective.

## summary of thoughts
Educators can provide more effective education by continuing their own learning and taking the learner's perspective.
