<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/sge/icon' alt='sge.icon' height="19.5"/>The Japanese version of DBS is a system to check the sexual offense history of people who work with children for the purpose of preventing [[sexual offenses]] targeting children and vulnerable adults. It is based on the DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) system in the United Kingdom.

I had no idea, but I think it's a good thing.
- You could do the same with assaults on children.

However, if the rule of "[[volunteer background checks]] shall be conducted" was introduced first based on the laws of other countries while the means of inquiry had not yet been introduced in Japan, the hurdle for "volunteer participation" would become too high for countries without "volunteer background check means" to make it practically impossible for volunteers to participate. I heard that the guidelines had to be modified because of this, and I thought that even if you are going to do something good, you have to take steps.

> 2.2 We have a child protection policy in place and all volunteers are aware of it and trained in the necessary procedures. Alternatively, if there is no such requirement in the area, all mentors have reviewed the CoderDojo Child Protection 101 document.
> 2.4 Depending on the legal provisions of your jurisdiction, background checks are conducted on long-term participating volunteers or all parents are on site during Dojo sessions.
