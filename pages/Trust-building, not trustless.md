title: "Trust-building, not trustless"
---

The following is a quote from an exchange at [[Meetup with Audrey & Glen]] on the topic of "[[trust-building]], not [[trustless]], is important" and provides some background.

>  We should always want to create trust, not to destroy trust. The term trustless in blockchain originally means ‘you don’t have to trust blindly something that does not deserve your trust.’ That’s what trustless means. But I think it’s quite confusing because what we’re doing with Web3 is to have a more earned version of trust, so we don’t have to blindly trust something that’s not deserving it.”

>  “The new situation is not about no trust. It’s only relatively low trust for the old thing, but it creates a new trust relationship between new institutions.”

(approximate translation)
- Glenn: "I prefer the term 'trust-building' to 'trustless. In Taiwan, support for the government rose from 9% to 60%, but that's more like "gaining trust" than "succeeding without any trust". The word "trustless" as used in the blockchain community originally meant "there is no need to blindly trust something that is not trustworthy," but it is a bit misleading. Our goal with Web3 is rather to create "more earned trust. We are talking about not having to blindly trust, not about destroying trust.
- Audrey: "The new structure doesn't 'completely eliminate trust,' but rather 'builds new trust with new institutions and organizations after suppressing trust in the old structure.'"

Explanation (main points)
- The original meaning of the word "trustless
    - The word "trustless" as used in the blockchain context refers to "a mechanism that allows people not to blindly trust an existing central authority" and emphasizes a "decentralized" mechanism that does not require a central administrator.
    - However, it is easy to misinterpret this to mean "abandon all trust.

- The idea of "Trust-building"
    - The Taiwan case (which increased from 9% to over 60% support) is a successful example of the approach of "building new mutual trust through digital participation infrastructure rather than dismantling existing authority (trustless).
    - It is important to be willing to deepen relationships and foster trust with new governance and communities, rather than tear everything apart or trust no one.

- Conclusion: "trustless" often misunderstood
    - Originally a concept that emphasized "not relying on unhealthy authority," it is easy to give the impression of "not trusting at all."
    - Rather, they argue that "trust-building," which involves clarifying "what to trust and how to trust it," is the way to go.
