In his 1972 lecture "Public Opinion Does Not Exist," [[Bourdieu]] makes three unacknowledged assumptions on which public opinion polls are based
- (1) Everyone has an opinion on everything.
- (2) All opinions are equivalent
- (iii) The framework of the question is self-explanatory.
criticized. In reality, many people have "unformed opinions," and the weight of opinions is disproportionate due to differences in expertise and party affiliation. Furthermore, the way the questions are framed reflects political interests, and power determines "what to discuss.

For Bourdieu, research is a "generative device" that creates the subject itself (the "[[public sphere]]"). When the results are reported, the "voice of the majority" becomes an established fact, and dissenting opinions are silenced for fear of being "isolated. He called this process the action of symbolic power, and warned that the seemingly neutral form of statistics renders political control invisible.

> "Polls are tools of political action and impose the illusion that 'public opinion exists'" ([PDF [https://is.muni.cz/el/fss/podzim2019/POLn4102/um/blok1/Bourdieu_PO_Does_Not_Exist.pdf?](https://is.muni.cz/el/fss/podzim2019/POLn4102/um/blok1/Bourdieu_PO_Does_Not_Exist.pdf?) utm_source=chatgpt.com])

Bourdieu's insights are also pervasive in contemporary online polling and real-time public opinion analysis. The numbers that are made visible define the starting point of the debate, and when algorithms determine the "important topics," the silent "voiceless majority" becomes increasingly invisible. Theoretical frameworks that illuminate this double exclusionary structure are still being provided.
