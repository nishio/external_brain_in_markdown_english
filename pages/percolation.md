- A phenomenon in which when conductive filler is mixed with an insulating material, a network of electrical conduction is formed by the filler, and when a certain percentage is exceeded, the resistivity drops sharply, allowing an electric current to flow.
- A phenomenon in which a resin with low thermal conductivity is filled with a filler with high thermal conductivity, and the thermal conductivity increases dramatically at a certain fill rate.
- When a large number of isolated nodes (sites) scattered in space are connected by a connecting edge (bond), a phenomenon in which a localized small-scale network is first formed in a scattered manner, but when the probability exceeds a certain level, the entire network suddenly becomes a connected mesh structure. If it is a conductive bond, an electric current flows from one end to the other.

The third is a description as a model and 1 or 2 is a concrete example of it.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
