- Specifically, [[Kineto]].
    - Horizontal axis is time of video
    - Vertical axis is time
    - There is a [[time gap]] in the video at a certain time.
        - To solve this, create a [[speed gap]] in the video playback.

- One level of abstraction.
    - There is [[slippage]] in the world
    - Move that misalignment to a different physical quantity.
    - Has the misalignment been resolved?
        - Or was it just moved to a less important physical quantity?

- analogy
    - [[uncertainty principle]].
        - [Uncertainty principle - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%8D%E7%A2%BA%E5%AE%9A%E6%80%A7%E5%8E%9F%E7%90%86)
        - The indeterminacy of position and momentum is [[trade-off]].
