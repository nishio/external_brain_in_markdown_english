Summary (short)
Although society as a whole would like to support child abuse, poverty, etc., the barriers of [[stove-piping]] and [[personal information protection]] in government systems prevent data coordination, and support tends to be disrupted. Therefore, the concept of "using private communities and technology to create a system to help each other in the community and online" was discussed.

Challenge: Administration is too cautious about data sharing and system implementation. IT budgets for the field are small, and rules for protecting personal information are complex.
Directions: (1)
- Platform/Community Building: Develop an online community where children, parents, volunteers, and businesses can come together to collaborate and consult.
- [[Token Economy]]/Points: Increase participation through a system where volunteer/support activities are visualized and contributions are rewarded (e.g., local coins).
- Expansion to government: First, work with small municipalities and NPOs to increase the number of successful cases and expand horizontally.
- Everyone should be aware of the issues involved: Raising children is a challenge not only for parents, but for the entire community. Using digital technology, we can create a society that "finds people in need quickly" and "delivers support.

Explanation (key points)
- Since it is difficult to implement large-scale reforms in a single step into existing government systems, the idea is to first create a "place to pick up problems" on the Internet under the initiative of the private sector, and then to encourage local governments and others to collaborate with them.
- It is expected to create a mechanism for residents and volunteers to post and share information and solve local issues together, and to use technologies (SNS group functions, chatbots, point grants, etc.) to support this process.
- There was discussion about whether visualizing and quantifying the desire to "help" and "participate" would generate ongoing support activities.
- The ultimate goal is "a society where each individual can support each other even when they are weak. Through the creation of infrastructure for child rearing and child support, a new image of community is proposed in which everyone cooperates to solve problems.
