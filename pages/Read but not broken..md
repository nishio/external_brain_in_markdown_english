title: "Read but not broken."
---

- One person's joking answer to the question, "Did you [[finish reading a book]]?
- This is rather interesting.
- in other words
    - The word "read" is a defense of [[Shuhari]].
    - When you do enough "[[babysitting]]", "[[(in gagaku or noh) middle section of a song]]" will automatically occur.
    - If [[(in gagaku or noh) middle section of a song]] hasn't happened yet, then you haven't read enough.
