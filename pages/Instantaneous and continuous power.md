title: "Instantaneous and continuous power"

> [voluntas](https://twitter.com/voluntas/status/1668489299501907968) I think it is because [[instantaneous force]] is judged as [[excellence]] programmer. I think that people who have been maintaining the same product for years with [[continuation]] are also excellent.

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1668941480441036800?s=20): Whether it's considered excellent because it has instantaneous power or [[inefficiency]] because it doesn't have [[continuity]] is ultimately subjective to the person who perceives it. In the end, it's just the subjective view of the person who sees it.

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1668943723441582080?s=20): I don't have the ability to keep going, so I have a technique where I keep a record of what I do on a spur-of-the-moment basis, and then later I have a system that I can refer to and say, "Oh, I did this in 2017, and then I did this in 2021. I use a technique to make it a posteriori a continuity by means of a system that allows me to give references to what I did in the blink of an eye. The following is in my 2018 book on this

I have the impression that what is important from a managerial point of view is to be able to [[continuously earn]] money from a large number of customers through support (including customization).

> [@voluntas](https://twitter.com/voluntas/status/1666326407713275905?s=20): you are right, it is important to make money continuously. But from a programmer's point of view, many people don't like to maintain it continuously (they get bored).

> [@kitar](https://twitter.com/kitar/status/1668488665289596928): I don't have much evidence, but I think that programmers who I think "this person is excellent" are more likely to be bored. It is a blessing to have such a person close to you and to be able to think of a service that is easy to maintain and easy to make money (easy to earn).
