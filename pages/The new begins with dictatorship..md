title: "The new begins with dictatorship."
---

([[natural]] was too much for me to put into words, but now that I've done it again, it looks like a [[paradox]] of good and bad.)

The new begins with dictatorship.
explanation
    - A [[new thing]] begins with a move by one [[first penguin]] P
- In this case, the moving [[decision-making]] is done by P alone.
    - In that sense [[dictatorship]].
- When the "value [[of participating]] in the movement created by P" outweighs the "disadvantages of P's dictatorship," new participants are created and the organization grows.
        - [[Movements are created by followers.]]
    - Naturally [[dictatorship]] will continue until the organization reaches a certain size.
