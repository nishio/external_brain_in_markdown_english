title: "Press releases that the person who wrote them doesn't understand."

> [@litulon](https://twitter.com/litulon/status/1658833871826300931?s=20): [[press releases]] are "grandiose" and written in a way that says, "It's a bit of a lie, but I'm sure the reader will forgive me this much." But this is not in that category. I think it's just a bunch of words [[sprinkled in]] that [[the writer]] doesn't understand.

> [hex_cap](https://twitter.com/hex_cap/status/1658872487462207488) This is very Japanese organizational "technology development". The development background is a list of [[buzzword]] without [[one's feet on the ground]], and the development objective is "[[making efficient]]" first and foremost, and aims at "[[making it]] possible for anyone to make it". The means to achieve this is to rely on external resources. It is a project that seems to have no place for people who work on their own.
> [hex_cap](https://twitter.com/hex_cap/status/1658876383299518464) The people who are planning the project are not themselves knowledgeable about the technology (why?). Therefore, they are not able to "discern the technology" or "evaluate the value of the technology. Since they do not know the new value or the direction in which the technology will grow, they settle for "making what we have now more efficient. Since such people are not good at working with their hands, they think in terms of "bringing in resources from the outside" to "use what we have now.
