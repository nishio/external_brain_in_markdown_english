title: "ferrite"
---

> Ferrite is a general term for ceramics based on iron oxide. Most ferrites are ferromagnetic and are widely used as magnetic materials. Those that exhibit soft ferrite are called [[soft ferrite]] and those that exhibit hard ferrite are called [[hard ferrite]]. Invented by Yogoro Kato and Takeshi Takei at Tokyo Institute of Technology.

- soft ferrite
    - > Because of its high magnetic permeability and high electrical resistance, eddy current loss in the high-frequency range is small, it is used as the magnetic core material of inductors and transformers for high-frequency applications.
- hard ferrite
    - So-called ferrite [[magnet]].
    - → A rare earth magnet consisting mainly of neodymium, iron, and boron, invented in 1984 by Masato Sagawa and his colleagues at General Motors Corporation in the U.S. and Sumitomo Special Metals Company (now Hitachi Metals) in Japan.
