[The first thing to change is Japanese "thinking" Audrey Tan's "transparency" and "diversity": why not do "unprecedented" (Page 1 of 5) - ITmedia Business Online [https://www.itmedia.co.jp/business/articles/2105](https://www.itmedia.co.jp/business/articles/2105) /31/news039.html]

> Do not make "[[no precedent]]" into [[Reasons not to do it]].

> In recent years, the number of Southeast Asian women moving to Taiwan through international marriages with local men has increased dramatically, and 9.1% of Taiwanese elementary schools have children whose mothers are of foreign origin (from 2019 statistics).

> Taiwan became the first Asian country to legalize "[[same-sex]] marriage" in May 2019.

- > In Japan, Taro Kono, who became Minister of State for Administrative Reform in September 2008, established the "[[Regulatory Reform Hotline]]," but due to a flood of opinions, the program was suspended in November and remains suspended to this day. Even if it is revived in the future, the current measures are inadequate.

> Since her appointment as IT Minister, she has been publishing on the Web all the contents of e-mails that come to her official account and her replies to those e-mails, with due consideration for privacy. Her word-for-word recordings of interviews she has given are likewise publicly available. She says it is important for the government to present to society the process by which it makes any decisions
