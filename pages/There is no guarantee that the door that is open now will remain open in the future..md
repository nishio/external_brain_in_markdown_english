There are those who superficially see this as "the [[natural]] word" and those who [have a clear idea of what is going on

Some people see [[an open door]] and think, "Oh, that's a nice door, let's go in [[this time]]," while others think, "Oh, that's a nice door, it might close [[soon]], let's go in [[this]].

concrete example
- Someone said "I'm not sure yet this year, so I'll apply next year" for an event that used to be held annually that involved a selection of applicants.
    - But next year, the event itself will no longer take place.
    - I've seen this happen many times.
        - It could be a change in budget, the spread of infectious diseases, or many other changes.
- I'm thinking of attending an idol event next time someone breaks up with me.

metaphor
    - [[door]]

relevance
    - [[strike while the iron is hot]]
