New Year's Eve!

What did you do last week?
- 12/24
    - >  I have decided to publish the original English version of the commentary on Japanese culture that I wrote for the [[Omoikane Project]] in its English version.
    - > [[Discovering Japan]]
- [[Words as Public Goods]]
    - At first I wrote Common Goods, but Public Goods is correct.
        - [[Difference between Common Goods and Public Goods]]
    - 27~28: It's taking shape.
    - 31: Updated to ver. 2, released via Twitter.
- 27 Pilgrimage to the Pearl of Good Fortune
- 29  [[Age of Atlantis (Day2)]]

I didn't finish looking back on New Year's Eve, so I'm doing it on New Year's Day.
