- [[XY problem]]
> [@ockeghem](https://twitter.com/ockeghem/status/1422750495160954885?s=21): I didn't know it had a name. The XY problem is a communication problem that occurs when "the questioner does not directly ask about the issue X that he/she really wants to solve, but asks about how to solve a secondary issue Y" / "XY problem - Wikipedia".

Questions Not To Ask
How can I use X to do Y?

> A: If what you want is to do Y, you should ask that question without pre-supposing the use of a method that may not be appropriate. Questions of this form often indicate a person who is not merely ignorant about X, but confused about what problem Y they are solving and too fixated on the details of their particular situation. It is generally best to ignore such people until they define their problem better.
