My wife asked me if the Tachikoma was finished, so I summarized the current situation

    - [[1×4 tile leg Tachikoma]] is done except for the carry.
    - I've converted my hands to three fingers to try it out, but I think it's too subtle.
    - Carrie is planning to use a different shape because the parts [[Windscreen 2 x 4 x 3 Frame]] that the original uses are hard to find
            - I'm thinking of taking [[3x3 plate belly Tachikoma]] up a notch in carry.
    - [[1x4 Curved Slope Leg Tachikoma]] is divided into head, legs and carry
    - The challenge is how to close the bottom of the carriage.

I heard that eyeballs are cuter when they stick out.
In the original, they pop out about 40%.
- With a round top, it would pop out 60%, and with a round bottom, the curvature would be too flat, it's a tough call.

Ah, well, there's always the option of a little wanderlust.
