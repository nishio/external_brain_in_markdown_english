title: "Allegory and Symbolism"
---

>  Later, Goethe explains the difference between the self and Syrah in terms of the relationship between "allegory" and "symbol" as follows. There is a great difference between a poet who seeks the particular for the universal, as in [[Syrah]], and one who sees the universal in the particular, as in [[Goethe]]. From the former approach arises [[symbolism]], in which the particular becomes a mere instance or example of the universal. The latter, on the other hand, is truly the essence of literature (Poesie), and it expresses a [[special]] without recalling or directing the universal. Now, he who vividly perceives this particular, without realizing it or only later, has at the same time acquired the [[universal]]."(MR27) It is clear that the latter is what is called by Goethe "[[symbol]]"

- The same is true of [[symbol]] in [[symbolic modeling]], where one approach is to use an [[abstract concept]] to explain something and then use a [[concrete example]] as an illustration, and the other approach is to "gain universality" in [[posterior]] by moving away from the abstract concept and focusing on vividly depicting a concrete [[scenery in one's mind's eye]]. There is an approach that focuses on vividly depicting concrete [[scenery in one's mind's eye]] away from abstract concepts and [[experience]] it to "acquire universality" in the [[posterior]].
- I know some of you may not be familiar with the phrase, "winning the universal."
- If, when having a new experience Y, we realize "Oh, this is similar to my previous experience X," and [[analogy]] produces knowledge that can be applied to experience Y, we know a posteriori that we "had universal knowledge that crosses experience X and experience Y.
    - Whether this universal knowledge is verbalized or not is immaterial.

- I've drawn several times in [[Knowledge of Rootless Grass]] related pictures, but maybe it's not a good idea to draw abstract concepts in the same circle as concrete experiences. Universal knowledge = abstract concepts are not always clearly verbalized at the time of application to new experiences.
