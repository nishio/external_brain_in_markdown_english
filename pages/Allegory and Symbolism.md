>  Later, Goethe explains the difference between the self and Syrah in terms of the relationship between "allegory" and "symbol" as follows. There is a great difference between a poet who [[seeks]] the particular for the universal, as in [[Syrah]], and one who [[sees]] the universal in the particular, as in [[Goethe]]. The former approach results in [[symbolism]], in which the particular becomes a mere instance or example of the universal. The latter, on the other hand, is truly the essence of literature (Poesie), and it expresses a [[special]] without recalling or directing the universal. Now, he who vividly perceives this particular, without realizing it or only later, has at the same time acquired the [[universal]]."(MR27) It is clear that the latter is what is called by Goethe "[[symbol]]"

- The same is true of [[symbol]] in [[symbolic modeling]], where one approach is to use an [[abstract concept]] to explain something and then use a [[concrete example]] as an illustration, and the other approach is to "acquire [[universality]]" in [[posterior]] by moving away from the abstract concept and focusing on vividly depicting a concrete [[scenery in one's mind's eye]]. There is an approach that focuses on vividly depicting concrete [[scenery in one's mind's eye]] away from abstract concepts, and by [[experiencing]] it, "[[acquires]] universality" in the [[posterior]].
- I know some of you may not be familiar with the phrase, "winning the universal."
- If, when having a new experience Y, we realize "Oh, this is similar to my previous experience X," and [[analogy]] produces knowledge that can be applied to experience Y, we know a posteriori that we "had universal knowledge that crosses experience X and experience Y.
    - Whether this universal knowledge is verbalized or not is immaterial.

- I've drawn several times in [[Knowledge of Rootless Grass]] related pictures, but maybe it's not a good idea to draw abstract concepts in the same circle as concrete experiences. Universal knowledge = abstract concepts are not always clearly verbalized at the time of application to new experiences.

- Concrete experience is not segmented in the first place ([[innumerable feature (e.g. in a programming language)]]), so it is not appropriate to draw a circle on the side of experience.
    - [[Story intersections become atoms.]]
        - [[intersection]], it is possible to think about "previous experience", "this experience", "its similarities", etc. at the time of realizing that it is an [intersection
