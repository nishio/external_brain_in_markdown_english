title: "managerial thinking"

The spread of AI will require "managerial thinking" from many people.
    - [[Hacking the Monster Experience of Management]]'s "1 in 10 Managers" got me thinking.
- At this point in time, 1 in 10 people are "managers" of existing forms of "corporate" things.
- Now they're called "[[monsters]]" in the eyes of the majority because they're a minority thought pattern.
- But won't the change in the structure of information transfer brought about by the LLM affect this ratio and invert the majority-minority?

            - [[Plurality and Polis Study Group]]
