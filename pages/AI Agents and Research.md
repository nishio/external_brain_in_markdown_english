Devin and [[research]] are starting to feel like a bad fit.
This means that research is
I want to go step by step, making sure I know where I'm going."
When unexpected behavior emerges, it's an opportunity for discovery."
Whereas the development of
You have to write down in specifications and tests what behavior is correct."
I'll rewrite it here and there to make it behave that way."
So the mental models are too different.

Of course, if you teach a well-prompted mental model for research, it's possible you could do it...

Therefore, the policy is to reduce the automatic research route by Devin.

I think we could outsource the development part of the R&D to an AI agent if we clearly separate the development part of the R&D.
So I think it's a difference in the way they're directed.
