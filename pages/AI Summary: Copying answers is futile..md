- [Copying answers is futile.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This series of tweets points out the importance of the ability to abstract. In particular, the following points are emphasized
- It is not useful to simply copy the answer, but it is important to learn the [[manner of solving]] and apply it to [[New Issue]]. Solving many problems is necessary to learn how to solve them.
- [[management issues]] require [[authority]] in [[resource allocation]]. There is a "[[Chicken and Eggs]]" problem where high competence is required to gain authority, but authority for experience is needed to improve competence.
- As a next best solution, it is useful to observe many problems and their solutions. [Parallel work" and "case studies" of MBAs and MOTs are useful for this purpose.
- Knowledge exchange between organizations should be about abstract "[(key to) solution" knowledge, not raw information; we are not advocating violating NDAs or leaking trade secrets.
- It is good if you can abstract your problem and discuss it with people. If [[ability to abstract]] is high, I can avoid NDAs and talk to people.
- [[Legal thinking]] is a back-and-forth between the concrete and the abstract, and training in the three-stage legal argumentation method helps develop [[the ability to concretize]] and [[the ability to abstract]].
- Some have pointed out that the abstraction capability and [[ChatGPT]] are a good match.

In other words, the message is that it is important not only to know the answer, but also to acquire a methodology for problem solving and the ability to abstract and apply it to new problems. As measures to achieve this, the report suggests observing many examples, abstracting one's own problems and consulting them, and utilizing AI.
