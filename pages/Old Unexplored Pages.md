Due to the renewal of IPA's website, the page at that time is no longer available.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- If you want to see the information at that time, you can use WebArchive, etc.

This page is auto-translated from [/nishio/旧未踏ページ](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/旧未踏ページ) using DeepL. If you looks something interesting but the auto-translated English is not good enough to understand it, feel free to let me know at [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en). I'm very happy to spread my thought to non-Japanese readers.
