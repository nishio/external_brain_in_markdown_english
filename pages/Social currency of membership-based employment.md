    - [[Membership-based employment]] (common in Japan): assignment, evaluation, and promotion tied to organizational membership, not job duties. The "currency" in effect here is not only money, but also the next [[SOC]].
        - [[reputation]] ・ [[credit]]: The power of attracting people who say, "I want to entrust this person with my business.
        - [[reciprocity]] - [[ingratitude]]: Lending and borrowing of help creates future support.
    - Assignments and projects [[access]]: [[right of admission]] to delicious projects, discretion and information.
    - Personnel evaluation and promotion: [[future position]] and [[authority]] expectations.
    - Network/non-public knowledge: can you [[access]] internal [[working knowledge]] and back wiring?
        - [[psychological safety]] ・ [[belonging to]]: the value of not being considered "[[outsider]]" internally itself.
    - [[Reputation visibility]]: Internal awards, newsletters, exposure on internal social networking sites.
