worry about one's life
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1728790969741345101/quick_promote_web/intro) Twice in the space of a few days I was told something like, "I'm surprised that even Nishio-san sometimes worries about life! But what does it mean to be "troubled" in the first place? So I looked up the word in the dictionary and found that it means "to be troubled by an inability to make a decision or find a solution to a problem. It means "to be troubled by anxieties and worries.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1728791386583949627) In other words, "there is only one option and no choice," "when we cannot find a solution, we assume that something appropriate is the solution and act accordingly," "when we cannot find a solution, we act accordingly," and "when we cannot find a solution, we act accordingly. If you are in a situation where you have no choice but to choose one solution, you act on the assumption that the appropriate one is the solution when you can't find a solution, or if you are in a situation where your heartache is not related to the fact that you can't find one solution, then "worrying" may not occur.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1728792842380677257) The first time I was asked, I said, "I have not found a solution at this time regarding the problem awareness that was verbalized about six months ago. This was a question of, "Do you have any ideas for a solution?" From my point of view, I can say that I am implementing "sharing awareness of the problem," a measure that could lead to a solution.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1728793321898656040) The second time I was asked, I said, "I don't know what policy to act on regarding the recently verbalized problem awareness. This is an example where the policy came back with an immediate answer, so I implemented measures that could lead to a solution and obtained the policy.

I think "distressed" usually means "staying in distress", so calling my situation "distressed" seems to be a mismatch. I think "distressed" is a good choice.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1728909277379821796) I went to bed and woke up and a metaphor was born. Worries are like error messages, they exist most of the time you are programming. For those who see the error message and modify the program, it keeps changing.

> [satoru_takeuchi](https://twitter.com/satoru_takeuchi/status/1728910007444619716) This may be a play on words, but I think Nishio's is "thinking". I think "worrying" also has that meaning, but it has the image of "worrying" attached to it.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1728910953402810724) I see. Not "worrying about life" but "thinking about life."

He's written about related things in the past.
