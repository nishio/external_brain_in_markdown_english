title: "prototype theory"
---

> The idea is that the [[category]] that humans actually have is not a classical category defined by necessary and sufficient conditions, but is characterized by [[similarity]] between [[typical cases]] and them.... For example, the word "bird" evokes small flying animals such as crows and sparrows, while ostriches and penguins are out of the typical case.
[Prototype theory - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%83%88%E3%82%BF%E3%82%A4%E3%83%97%E7%90%86%E8%AB%96)

> Certain [[inflection of words (e.g. declension of nouns and conjugation of verbs)]] can be explained as a word sense that was once peripheral but is now used as the central sense. In this case, the prototype of the meaning of the word has moved from A to B. Changes in other areas, such as syntax and phonology, can also be approached from the perspective of prototypes.
>  It should also be noted that prototypes are complementary to "#1961. [[basic level category]]". Prototypes are concerned with the ability or action of being able to recall the corresponding typical meaning or object of instruction when given a word. On the other hand, basic-level categories are related to the ability to recall the corresponding typical word or action when given a certain meaning or object of instruction. The former is a semasiological perspective, while the latter is an onomasiological perspective.
