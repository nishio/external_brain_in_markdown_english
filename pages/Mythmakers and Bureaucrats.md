>  Bureaucracy is complex, incomprehensible and boring
>  Myths are false but easy to understand and support

In Mythmakers, Bureaucrats, and Values (A Human History of NEXUS Information),
- [[broad listening]] is an effort to convert mythographers into bureaucrats in a time when everyone has become a mythographer?
Those who understand bureaucratic protocol can read it, those who don't can't, and even if they were capable, "bureaucracy" is more boring than anything else, and they can't read it.
Therefore, efforts are required to read bureaucratic texts and make them into myths, and this is not being done in the current Broad Listening
The problem is that this is a heavy task for interpreters and report creators, and there are few people who can do this.
So, what is a narrative report? I guess it comes down to "what is a narrative report?

I haven't read NEXUS, so I don't know what the metaphor is.

As usual, Loose Computer Science Radio is good, so here you go.
Myths, stories to make connections between people, can be fictional, money, religion
Bureaucracy, moving people based on truth and executing huge practices through division of labor.

Harari's NEXUS: A Human History of Information explains that the foundation of the "information network" that drives human society consists of two pillars: "myth (a story that everyone believes)" and "bureaucracy (a mechanism for gathering and processing information).
- Myths (stories we all believe)
    - Narratives that "everyone believes to be true," such as national myths, religions, the value of money, and corporate brands, give legitimacy and unity to the cooperation of large groups of people. For example, the Bible is a collection of stories, but it became "the story that unites society" because it was selected, edited, and distributed by churches.
- Bureaucracy (the mechanism for handling information)
    - The "information infrastructure" of laws, family and census records, tax records, maps, schools, and newspapers keeps track of people and resources and ensures that orders and policies reach the people on the ground. Harari describes the bureaucracy itself as a "huge information network.
- The relationship and dilemma between the two
    - Large societies have always relied on "the power of the myth [[of storytelling]]" and "the power of the bureaucracy [[of practice]]," but those who spin the tales and those who manipulate the books often tend to look in different directions. Many institutions, he states, are characterized by what balance they strike between the needs of these two parties.
    - A bias toward either side is dangerous. If only the narrative gets out of control, it is easy to lean toward [[populism]] and tyranny, and if only the bureaucracy gets bloated, it is easy to lean toward ruthless and rigid governance - so a self-cleansing (verification, transparency, error correction) mechanism is needed," he suggests.
- Connecting to the Now (AI)
    - The book also warns that AI could become the new "bureaucracy" (information processing mechanism), which could amplify the myth-bureaucracy dynamic. The overall message is to review the relationship between information, myths, and bureaucracy across history.
