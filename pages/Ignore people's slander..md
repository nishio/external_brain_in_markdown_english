title: "Ignore people's slander."

Ignore [[libel]] of the >person. It is best to respond with [[refusing to comment on]]. Do not appeal to the power of the pen to clear your name. What is written will remain forever, so you are not punishing your enemies, but helping them to keep your name. [There is no revenge better than oblivion.
- [[Baltasar Gracián's Philosophy of Success]]
