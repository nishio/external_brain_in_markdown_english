The ideas of Gendlin and Jiro Kawakita are related to Plurality in the cognitive sense. Gendlin verbalized Focusing and Jiro Kawakita verbalized the KJ method. However, they are not communicated to those who have not had these experiences. This is also true for Plurality. It is thought that the only way to transfer tacit knowledge is through collaboration.

Gendlin's process of experience and the implicit combine with context to create meaning. These ideas and Plurality are deeply related. In WHY I AM A PLURALIST, the connection between epistemological pluralism and linguistic Plurality is noted.

Nishio's research note, "Plurality and the Polis Study Group," states that plurality, in the sense of diversity, may be a framework for further discussion among people with interests or expertise in a particular topic.

### Thinks deeply

The relevance of Gendlin's and Jiro Kawakita's ideas to Plurality needs to be considered more deeply. We should also explore specific ways in which experience and tacit knowledge that cannot be verbalized can be communicated through collaboration.

The ideas of Gendlin and Jiro Kawakita are related to Plurality in the cognitive sense; Plurality is a concept that must be understood from a variety of perspectives, including broad listening and epistemological pluralism. Gendlin verbalized Focusing through the practice of psychotherapy, and Jiro Kawakita verbalized Thinking Fireworks through the practice of a technique called the KJ method. However, verbal transmission of these experiences to those who have not had them cannot be conveyed. This is also true for Plurality, and Polanyi's tacit knowledge returns, but it cannot be communicated linguistically. The only way to transmit tacit knowledge may be through collaboration.

Nishio's research note, "Plurality and the Polis Study Group," states that plurality, in the sense of diversity, may be a framework for further discussion among people with interests or expertise in a particular topic. I feel this is deeply relevant to my research.

Gendlin verbalized Focusing through the practice of psychotherapy, and Jiro Kawakita verbalized Thinking Fireworks through the practice of a technique called the KJ method. However, verbal transmission of these experiences to those who have not had them cannot be conveyed. This is because Polanyi's tacit knowledge returns "Yes" to Plurality as well, but cannot be communicated linguistically. It is thought that the only way to transmit tacit knowledge is through collaboration.

### Relation to Fragment
.

The fragment "WHY I AM A PLURALIST" points out the connection between epistemic pluralism and linguistic Plurality. This is related to the epistemological pluralism of Plurality described in my research note.

The "Plurality Tokyo Day Memo" also presents the perspective that oriental values could be implemented. This leads to the relevance of Plurality to the Japanese cultural trends discussed in my research note.

The Plurality Tokyo Salon presents various perspectives on Plurality, including verbal Plurality and religious pluralism. These are related to the broad listening and epistemological pluralism of Plurality described in my research note.

In "What is Plurality," the concept proposed by Audrey Tang and E. Glen Weyl, which is the original source of Plurality, is introduced. This leads to the connection between Plurality and the ideas of Gendlin and Jiro Kawakita, as described in my research note.

- From [[Diary 2023-08-25]], the ideas of Eugene Gendlin and Jiro Kawakita are related, and [[Plurality]] in the cognitive sense exists at their intersection. Gendlin verbalized [[focusing]] through the practice of psychotherapy, and Jiro Kawakita verbalized [[Fireworks to think about]] through the practice of a technique called the KJ method.

In "Phenomenology as an Illogical Stage," it is noted that philosophers tend to avoid physics and psychology. This may be related to Gendlin's philosophy. In "Introduction to Gendlin's Philosophy," the whole picture of Gendlin's philosophy is elucidated.

In the Plurality and Polis Study Group, it was noted that a cultural tendency in Japan is to emphasize consensus building over top-down decision making. This is related to the broad listening aspect of Plurality.

In "Developing Japanese Cultural AI: Plurality for Global Deliberation," the need to understand differences in cultural ways of thinking is noted. This is related to Plurality's epistemological pluralism.

In "As Yet Unnamed Concepts Emerging from Experience," it is noted that the linguistic communication of experience tends to be less informative. This is related to Gendlin's [[process of experience]].

In "[[Nodal Point of Thought 2023-04-10 pm]]" it is noted that meaning is created when combined with context. This is related to Gendlin's [[the implicit]].
