title: "Avoiding failure"
---

- Why is trying to avoid [[failure]] counterproductive in certain situations?

Consider situations where the speed at which [[knowledge]] is acquired from the environment is important.
- In this case, "quickly doing something with [[uncertain]] results and observing the results" is beneficial in increasing [[knowledge acquisition efficiency]].
    - Because "[[To get a different result than expected.]]" is "[[Knowledge Acquisition]]"
- However, if we avoid "getting a different result than expected" by thinking of it as a failure, uncertain behavior is discouraged.
    - Zero knowledge gained" is achieved without uncertainty and in a stable manner.
