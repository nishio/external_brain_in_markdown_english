> When I went to Denmark for an interview about digitization, I was asked, "You don't think that when the current paper-and-writing process began, everyone could read and write, do you?" I remember being told. Our country is so small that we have no choice but to retain both processes." We will solve the divide problem by subsidizing a substitute scribe."

In digitization, it is not a problem if some people cannot use digital equipment. Rather, jobs will be created to support them.
