title: "Intense discussions on social networking sites"
---

When there are heated debates on social networking sites, it is easy to wonder "which opinion is right?
- It's about hearing both sides and deciding which is right."
    - First of all, this makes the implicit assumption that one of us is right.
        - Often both are wrong.
- Can the cost of making the right decision be justified?
    - The "cost of making the right decision" is in most cases greater than you might imagine.
        - There's no way that information on social networking sites would be enough, right?
        - Critics do not honestly disclose the reasons for their criticism
            - The goal is not to draw the right conclusions in the first place, but to win arguments on social networking sites, which is contrary to the goal of publishing correct information.
- Does my making the right decision regarding the argument bring value to society?
    - No one is asking you to judge.
    - Even if you make the right decision at sufficient cost, no one expects you to do it, so it will not be respected
- People who are involved in a discussion will behave in a way that makes them overestimate the importance of the discussion, because they benefit from being perceived by others as being important
