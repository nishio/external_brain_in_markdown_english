I've been blogging since I don't remember when, but I started writing on Hatena Diary around 2007.
I started using Scrapbox around 2017-04 and officially announced the end of my Hatena Diary usage on 2018-03-07.
    - [[The blog was dismantled and became a social networking site and Scrapbox.]]
    - 2007-10  [[Hatena Diary period]]  2018-03 →  [[Scrapbox period]]
    - 2007-04  [[Twitter term]] →2013-02  [[Facebook period]]
- 2024-09-04 Scrapbox period ends → [[external cerebral period]].

Summary: [[How did you get involved with Scrapbox?]]

Q: Why did you quit Hatena Diary?
- A: The announcement of the end of the service of Hatena Diary seems to be 2018-08-30, but I have been looking for a good place to migrate for a couple of years, foreseeing the end of the service

- > I've been using Scrapbox mostly lately... I have been thinking for a while that it is time to move to Hatena Diary because it is obsoleted, but compared to Hatena Blog, Qiita, Medium, etc., Scrapbox is rather goofy.
    - [[Hatena2017-04-09]]
- > Scrapbox seems to be the most serious within the scope of observation about the direction of how to turn stocked information into structured information.

- [/organize-ideas](https://scrapbox.io/organize-ideas): project I was making around 2017-04
- →I heard the opinion that it's better to put all the projects in one place rather than dividing them into separate projects, so I put them together in /nishio
    - Maybe [[ScrapboxDrinkup]].

- > It has been almost a year since my last post "I've been using Scrapbox lately. Since then, this page has not been updated at all, while articles have been posted to Scrapbox one after another, exceeding 1,000 articles.

[/oculus-go](https://scrapbox.io/oculus-go): I split the project because I thought it could be edited by multiple people, but it wasn't, so I absorbed it

[/intellitech-en](https://scrapbox.io/intellitech-en): [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]], which the publishers wanted to publish in full but were concerned that it would affect sales of the Japanese edition, so they decided to do it in English.

2019-04-11 Page count is now 4000 pages.
