- I selected Web App, but was asked to install a plug-in. Unlike [[Zoom]] and others, it does not seem to work only in the browser.
- Slow screen refresh frequency, sometimes going dark for a few seconds
- [[Lync for Mac]]
- [[Communicator for Max]]

I'm not sure how it lives with [[Microsoft Teams]].
