title: "Employment Priority Pass"

> [idomasae](https://twitter.com/idomasae/status/1762269204672356527) I was surprised to hear from my son, a college student, about the current [[job hunting]] situation.
>
>  For example, if you receive a [[job offer]] from Company A, but then you kick it and go to work for another Company B. In the old days, you would have had an ashtray thrown at you. In the old days, this would be a shuraba scene where an ashtray would be thrown, but nowadays, it is said that in some cases, "[[Priority Pass]]" is given.
>  Now, the "pass" is that if a new graduate chooses a different company, but considers changing jobs or leaves within 3 years, he/she can try again with only a final interview instead of taking all of Company A's mid-career employment exams from the beginning.
>  I see. Although a company may have once missed out on the talent they wanted to hire when they graduated, if they think that they can have their [[newcomer training]], etc. done at another company and come back when they understand a bit of the harshness of society, the cost savings may be rather good.
>  Rather than having a strange sense of pride, "Who do you think you are, choosing that place instead of our place?
>  I think the hit rate for mid-career hires is higher than for job postings. In terms of securing mid- to long-term human resources, I think this will expand in the future.
>
>  I have not been able to catch up with the "Fast Pass", "Priority Pass", and similar "pass-like" things in the labor market, although it may already be "common knowledge" in the world.
>
>  Most students do not expect to spend their entire professional life at a single company. No matter how much they wish to be employed for their whole life, there is always the possibility that the job itself will disappear due to the development of AI technology, etc.
>  Twenty or fifty years from now, not only "how to work" but also the concept of "working" will be completely different from what it is today.
