Misleading profile description
- An employee interview published by one of the companies, who had never been accepted into the Unexplored Junior Program, stated in his profile that he had "been through the Unexplored Junior Program".
- In the text, it was expressed that "First, he will challenge Unexplored Junior, and after that, he will also participate in the different vation program sponsored by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications.

From the inquiry form on the company website
- There is no fact that he was adopted by Unexplored Junior, and the statement "through Unexplored Junior" in his profile may be untrue.
- Is there some miscommunication? We would appreciate it if you could check and make the appropriate corrections.
I sent an inquiry to the effect that

The corporate website representative promptly replied and removed the "through unexplored junior" from the profile.
- From the reply from the inquiry form, it appears that the person in charge of the article was aware that the review had passed.
    - Fact: Applied to Unexplored Junior, passed the application screening and proceeded to the interview, but failed the interview and was not adopted.
    - If you are not familiar with the adoption process of Unexplored Junior, "passed the document review" would be mistaken for "passed the entire review".
    - PS: and I thought that when I wrote this article, I felt that it was my personal responsibility to express myself in a way that would prevent such misunderstandings from occurring. Since he/she understands that he/she passed the application screening but failed the interview, wasn't it his/her responsibility to make sure that this is conveyed correctly to the person writing the article?
- As for "challenging the unexplored juniors," I suppose "submitting an application" is being described as "challenging."
    - That's a very harsh expression.

This type of miscommunication cannot be prevented in advance, so I guess the only thing we can do is to provide feedback as soon as we find it.

I said that it would be a waste of time to make the latter half of the article, "Participation in a different vation program sponsored by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications," look suspicious, even though that program has a good track record.
Then we talked about whether or not "proven" was really true (bush snake).

Ah, so that's what it's like.
This is another one of those "not lying, but it's a bit of a stretch" to describe it as "also participating in the hetero-vation program".
- In the sense that "hetero-vation" is the flag waving, in the broadest sense of the word, "hetero-vation program."
- However, the "hetero-vation" is not the judging process.
- There is an opportunity for realization after company matching (do as you please, style).


When events like this happen, people in traditional technical fields ask, "Why are there so many crypto guys like this?" They say things like, "Why are there so many crypto guys?
- I follow up with, "No, crypto technology is innocent, it's just this person's fault."
- But then again, maybe the crypto industry is structured to have more imposters.
