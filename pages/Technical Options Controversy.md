title: "Technical Options Controversy"
---

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1448219441922076680): When there are technically incompatible options A and B, there are often arguments between "those who use A" and "those who use B", where both sides make fun of the other camp. In fact, there are people in both camps who believe that the situation determines what is the best option. They do not agree with "the opinion that supports one side unconditionally.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1448220995567833092): They don't think of someone who made a different choice B than they did as "not making the right choice A because they are stupid". They think that they made choice B as the optimal solution to a situation different from their current one, and they want to know the reason for their choice and try to become aware of the "situation in which B is appropriate" for them.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1448221745295417347): and keep a friendly relationship with the person who made a different choice B than you, and when you are in a "situation where B is appropriate", have that person teach you the know-how to use B. Ask them for it.
> When these people see someone who insists that "anyone who chooses B is an idiot," they do not feel that they are friends, even though they are also those who choose A. They avoid it because it would be detrimental if they are considered as friends.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1448228576860393472): When I see people of a certain age going into this "vilify the opposing camp" mode, I think, "Oh, they've closed the door to learning," "[[aging population combined with the elderly]] switch has been turned on," and "they are being swallowed up by the trend of becoming old and aging," and I think about what I can do to prevent myself from becoming the same way.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1448229125131411456): and I noticed that you didn't "start belittling the opposing camp", you've been doing it since you were a young student. There is no authority gradient in the student community and everyone is unsure of themselves, so people who are belittled for their choices tend to explain, "No, this choice has these advantages...".

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1448230247992684545): it did not close the door to learning for the "naysayers". In fact, it may have even been more efficient. It would have reinforced the "belittling behavior."

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1448230552599814144): As time goes by, age, titles, and accomplishments accumulate, and inevitably an [[authoritarian gradient]] is created between the younger person and the younger person. In this situation, the younger person does not say back. They just distance themselves, thinking, "He's an old man who doesn't understand the value of B."
> Would you argue back then if you were the same age with no authority gradient? I thought about it, but I won't argue this back either, and I'll tell you why in the next tweet

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1448231135469727750): Because the "drive to talk back when someone belittles your choices" when you were a student was the process of "not having confidence in yourself, feeling that your choices were belittled, and The process of "feeling that one's judgmental abilities, etc., have been called into question, and explaining one's reasons for making the decision in order to recover one's dented [[self-respect]]".

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1448231940125909001): When Mr. A is accomplished enough to generate an authority gradient against younger people, then Mr. A and Mr. B, who are not subject to the authority gradient, are also equally accomplished, and this This is the underpinning of self-esteem, so self-esteem is not dented when the choice is belittled. Therefore, no energy is generated to argue with them.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1448232604541456385): this is a very confusing trap. Because the person is not changing his/her behavior. A certain pattern of behavior contributes to the efficient gathering of information from diverse perspectives when one is young, but as it is, it slowly strangles one with age like a cotton wool, and before one realizes it, one is sucked into a black hole of inescapable senescence.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1448232999967858694): Since the person who was sucked into the black hole is unaware of it as an observational fact, it is possible that I myself, who am unaware of it, am in the process of falling into the black hole. In order to extend the time of falling as far as possible, it is necessary to move the engine against gravity with all my might even now. What exactly should I do?

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1448233398632267782): I don't know what exactly I should do, but for now, when I see someone who makes a different choice than I do, instead of assuming that they are stupid, I should assume that they know something I don't. I guess I should assume that they know something that I don't know.
