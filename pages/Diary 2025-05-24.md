[[Nada School Saturday Lecture 2025]]


I got very sleepy because of the weather, woke up at 23:30.

Creating a contribution opportunity is itself using someone else's man-hours.
- Contribution opportunities are provided, and contributing to them is an act of taking, consuming, and giving what someone else has already given.
- We give because we want many people to have the experience of giving, and it's natural that we can't afford to do so.
- When I am told, "I don't know how to contribute," I feel that I am still very much on the "receiving end.

Create a "good first issue" to create opportunities to contribute to the OSS to make it more popular.
- I'm leaving for humans what would be a quick and easy finish if I threw it to an AI.
- This is [[trade-off between broad participation and speed]], right?
- It's faster to ignore people who don't seem to know what to do and go on with the guns with AI.
