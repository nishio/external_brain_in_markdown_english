- [[Scrapbox]] is interesting as [Forms of Knowledge Representation
    - On the other hand, it is strongly oriented toward "[[Human use]]".
        - [[joint editing]] and [[Technical Tradeoffs]] for mechanically rewritten APIs
    - In this [[trade-off]], the co-editing is selected.
- I want a form of [[for machines]] knowledge representation.
    - Scrapbox is appealing, but it is difficult for machines to handle this
    - Co-editing is not that important in my use case.
    - Then, why not abandon collaborative editing and instead create "[[Something that is not Scrapbox]]" that facilitates [[mechanical updates]]?
    - Compatible with Scrapbox as a data representation format
    - I can export in JSON and import into Scrapbox, or copy and paste on a page-by-page basis.

Forms of Knowledge Representation
- page title
- row
- Whitespace at the beginning of a line expresses hierarchical structure
- Brackets in a line represent links to other pages
- 2-hop links to other pages, even if they don't necessarily exist at the moment.
- Images are useful for people to see, but still a hurdle for machines to see.

About Co-Editing
- Good if commitments are made at a fine granular level.
- Sticky note scrapers are pretty close to this.
- If you interpret a Scrapbox line as a single sticky note, you can treat it similarly.
