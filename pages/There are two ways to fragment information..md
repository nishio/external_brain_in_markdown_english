There are two types of "fragmentary information" in the flow of outputting fragmentary information first and then gathering it after the fact to become larger information.

Let's call them "[[fragmentary text]]" and "[[fragmentary relation]]".
- The method of placing KJ-legal sticky notes in two dimensions is a method of "placing them close together" so that "relationships that have not yet been verbalized" can be output.
- Scrapbox is a method that enables the output of "relationships" by making it easy to create links and links that connect after the fact.
        - [[Stock of associations]]

It is difficult to suddenly output a network of relationships between many "fragmented sentences".
- So, the first step is to output the "fragmentary relationship" that says, "There is a relationship between this fragment and this fragment.
- When they come together, they create a large network after the fact.
