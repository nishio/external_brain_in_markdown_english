title: "Not organized = explained with links"
---

>  Organize > Create and put in sorting boxes, nest boxes, etc., and decide on a fixed position for quickest access.
>  No organization → Explain with links → Texts explain each other, so you can find related links in about 3 clicks if you do a random search and follow the links from the places you recognize.
