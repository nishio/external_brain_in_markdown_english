Replace with data

Long ago programs were physically wired. It was replaced by data.

Instead of physically arranging and routing logic elements, FPGAs arranged elements that do table-pull. The different types of physical elements have been replaced by data.

### Summary of notes
.
The old programs used physical wiring, which was replaced by data. Specifically, instead of physical logic element placement and wiring, FPGAs replaced the different types of physical elements with data by arranging elements that perform table pulls.

### Relation to Fragment
.
Note and Fragment 1032: [[Replace with data]] deal with the same theme of replacing physical wiring with data. Both describe the evolutionary process of replacing the physical wiring of a program with data, and both detail how FPGAs have replaced data with different types of physical elements by arranging the elements to do the table-pulling.

### deep thinking
From the notes and fragments, it can be understood that the replacement of physical wires with data played an important role in the evolution of the program. In particular, the approach of replacing data with different types of physical elements by the way the FPGA table-pulling elements are arranged is an innovative approach that greatly improves the efficiency and flexibility of the program.
