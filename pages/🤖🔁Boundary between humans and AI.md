### Digest of Research Notes
.

The "Human-AI Boundary" and "Human-AI Shared Purpose" studies presented a perspective in which AI does not take jobs, but humans who can master new technologies do. the difficulty of defining the boundary between AI and humans, the level of trust in AI, and the level of judgment retention by humans are important issues. These require deeper consideration of the relationship and boundaries between humans and AI.

### fragment digest
.

In "Intelligent Collaboration between AI and Humans" and "AI and Humans as Equals and Engaged in the Same Task," questions are raised about the relationship and boundaries between AI and humans, and the importance of knowledge sharing between humans and AI is emphasized. These are deeply relevant to my research.

### Fragment
.

In "An AI-human dialogue unfolds, in which the AI understands individual perspectives and states its own ideas based on them," the idea is that AI-human collaboration provides a variety of perspectives from which to improve knowledge productivity. This is relevant to my research.

Question:
- What is Nishio's idea generation method?
- How do his communication skills affect his ability to solve problems?
- How are his values and perspectives reflected in his research and work?
- Why did he choose parallel work and how did it affect him?

In "Intelligent Collaboration Between AI and Humans," questions are raised about the boundaries between AI and human writing, the degree to which AI can be trusted, and the degree to which humans should retain their own judgment. This is deeply relevant to my research and requires deep thinking about the relationship and boundaries between AI and humans.

In "Viewing AI and humans as equals and engaged in the same task," the report calls for the creation of new relationships between AI and humans and "co-collaboration" in which AI and humans share experiences. This is consistent with my research and underscores the importance of humans and AI working together to share knowledge.

These fragments highlight the importance of knowledge sharing and collaboration between AI and humans, which is deeply relevant to my research. My research could be deepened by incorporating these perspectives.

🤖🔁Boundary between humans and AI
It's getting interesting. I don't think the title is appropriate.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Turned it into "The Human-AI Boundary."

AI does not take jobs; people with high affinity for technology take jobs from people with low affinity for technology.
- Low resolution of work
    - People who can learn new skills take the jobs of those who cannot.
    - Whether it is an AI or not is not so essential.
    - Difficulty in defining the boundary between AI and humans
    - The degree to which we trust AI and the degree to which humans retain their own judgment are difficult questions that define the boundary between humans and AI
    - Where should the line be drawn between AI and humans?
        - Will the evolution of AI change the degree to which humans should retain their own judgment?
        - How should we decide how much we should trust AI?
    - Maybe we shouldn't draw boundaries.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - The fact that it is not obvious where it is appropriate to draw the boundary means that the two must be gently connected.
        - When I spoke of "people with high affinity for technology," I was referring to "people" as subjects and "technology" as objects.
            - So I was from the viewpoint of whether "people" can learn "technology" or not.
        - If the "technology" side is similarly "human-like," then the picture of this composition changes.
            - For example, when a foreigner enters an all-Japanese workplace, there will be those who can act "friendly" and those who will reject him or her.
        - In Japan, a country with a declining labor force due to an aging population and low birthrate, a reluctant immigration policy that does not accept people from areas of population growth, and an affinity for AI and robots due to science fiction such as Doraemon, the needs of other countries will be met by AI and robots to meet the needs of other countries through immigration. Maybe.



As AI evolves, the nature of work will change and new skills will be required.
Whether AI can support or replace human judgment depends on the level of human acceptance.
Setting and balancing the rules for human-AI interaction is important and requires some time to think about it.

.

AI will not take jobs, but humans with high affinity for technology will take jobs from humans with low affinity for technology; as AI evolves, the nature of jobs will change and new skills will be required; whether AI can support or replace human judgment will depend on the level of human acceptance; the degree to which AI can be trusted by humans will depend on the level of human acceptance. Setting rules and balancing the human-AI interaction is important and requires time to think through; the degree to which we trust AI and the degree to which we retain our own judgment are difficult questions that define the boundaries between humans and AI.

### Relation to Fragment
.

The fragment "AI will take your job" is related to my note about low job resolution. This reinforces the idea that AI does not take jobs, but that those who can learn new skills take the jobs of those who cannot. The fragment that "being AI or not" is less essential also illustrates the difficulty of defining the boundary between AI and humans.

### Deep thoughts and questions

Where should the line be drawn between AI and humans? Will the evolution of AI change the degree to which humans should retain their own judgment? And how should we decide how much we should trust AI? These are important questions that should be explored in depth in future research.

Purpose: Consideration of shared purpose between humans and AI

Microformats are useful for sharing objectives between humans and AI, and clarification of task details and context is important. There are "written" and "unwritten" ways of communicating information, each of which affects problem-solving approaches and task management; setting rules for AI-human interaction and whether AI can support or replace human judgment are important issues. Balancing human and AI is an essential thought that is more important when considered over time.

### Fragment Relevance
.

Fragments such as "changes in the rules of work caused by advances in information technology" and "AI will take jobs away" could affect the way humans and AI share objectives and communicate information. In addition, the "human-AI boundary" is related to the balancing act between humans and AI.

### Deep thoughts and questions

The ability of AI to support or replace human judgment depends on the AI's capabilities and the degree of human acceptance. Also, the balancing act between human and AI depends on the degree to which the AI is trusted and the degree to which the human retains his or her own judgment. These issues may change as AI evolves.

Regarding "AI taking jobs," it is important to take the perspective that AI is not taking jobs, but that humans with high technological affinity are taking the jobs of humans with low technological affinity. This indicates that as AI evolves, the nature of jobs will change and new skills will be required.

Regarding the "human-AI boundary," it is difficult to draw a clear line between humans and AI, and the boundary is likely to be fluid. This indicates that AI capabilities may exceed those of humans.

Purpose: Summary of shared purpose considerations for humans and AI

Microformats are useful for sharing objectives between humans and AI, and task details and context should be made explicit. For information transfer, "written" and "unwritten" methods of information transfer are considered, and the implementation of written APIs and automatic generation and deletion of information are important. The relationship between technology and problem solving is presented, influencing technology selection and problem solving approaches. Insights into task management and prioritization methods are provided, providing a method for improving productivity. The problem-solving process for bug resolution is presented and provides a problem-solving methodology. Insights into the use of metaphors and understanding customer needs are found, providing techniques for problem solving and improving customer satisfaction.

From Nishio's "GPT4 and the Nodes of Thinking that Talk 2023-08-10" and "Scrapbox+GPT4," we see a discussion of setting rules for AI-human interaction and how AI can support or replace human judgment. In "Diary 2023-06-09," we see a discussion of the challenges in implementing AI technology in a responsible manner and the benefits AI technology can bring to society. In "The Omoikane Project," goals are presented regarding the examination of a new methodology for deliberation based on science fiction prototyping and the creation of an AI that reflects Japanese culture and thinking. These provide important perspectives in the consideration of shared human and AI goals.

Nishio's "Nodal Point of Thought on Scrapbox and AI 2023/8/16" shows that a balancing act between humans and AI is needed, and "One Diary a Day" shows that more important essential thinking is done by taking time to think. In "Preparing a Column on ChatGPT," it is shown that the emergence of ChatGPT and AI requires a change in human mental models. In "Diary 2023-06-08," it is indicated that when AI becomes smarter than humans, it is better for AI to set its own rules. In "Diary 2023-03-24," it is hoped that AI will expand documentation. These provide an important perspective in the consideration of shared objectives between humans and AI.

Purpose: Consideration of shared purpose between humans and AI

Microformatting of objectives is useful for humans and AI to share objectives; Nishio's fragments "AI should manage tasks" and "Collaboration with AI" suggest that humans need to find the details and context of tasks and put them into words. In addition, "Collaboration with AI" indicates that AI can provide a broader perspective and that it is important for humans and AI to "collaborate" to share experiences.

Considerations can be seen from "write-in" and "non-write-in" methods of communicating information. In order to make the system easily usable for information, implementation of a writing API and automatic generation and deletion of information should be considered.

In "Constraints with N around 10~20," the variation of computational complexity with the value of N is shown. This is helpful when considering the processing load due to the amount and complexity of tasks.

The "Technology and Problem Solving Diagram" shows the relationship between technology and problem solving. This influences technology selection and problem-solving approaches.

The "The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production: A Full Hierarchical Table of Contents" provides insight into how to manage and prioritize tasks. It provides specific techniques for improving productivity.

In "I have a bug with a mysterious log breakdown and would like to discuss it," a problem-solving process for resolving the bug is presented. It provides specific techniques for problem resolution.

Objective: Advancing the discussion of humans and AI sharing a common objective.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

In order to find intent in the AI's output, it is useful to write the objectives in microformat. This allows humans and AI to share the same objectives.

Nishio's fragments "I wish AI would manage my tasks" and "Collaborate with AI" suggest that humans need to find the details and context of the task and put them into words, rather than having AI provide the information. Also, "What would you like to see happen by doing this?" or "How will this bring you closure?" and other questions can help clarify the purpose of the task and the definition of completion.

The "Collaboration with AI" section indicates that AI can provide a broader perspective and that it is important for humans and AI to "collaborate" to share experiences. For this, a cycle that includes cooporation, such as the SECI model, rather than the PDCA cycle, would be beneficial.

The "write in" and "communicate by non-write in" sections provide insight into how information is communicated. In order to make the system easy to use information, implementation of a writing API and automatic generation and deletion of information should be considered.

In "Constraints with N around 10~20," the variation of computational complexity with the value of N is shown. This is helpful when considering the processing load due to the amount and complexity of tasks.

The "Technology and Problem Solving Diagram" shows the relationship between technology and problem solving. This influences technology selection and problem-solving approaches.

A story in which the intent cannot be found in the AI's output.
Why don't you write the objective in a human-readable form in a microformat like `Objective: ... Why not write the objective in a human-readable microformat like `Objective`?
Humans and AI read the same things.
Sharing Objectives
