title: "Stop thinking of others as irrational"
---

There is a type of [[acting without thinking]] that considers the behavior of others to be [[illogicality]].
For example, suppose there was a bet that had a 1/3 chance of gaining 4 and a 2/3 chance of losing 1.
Person A thinks that it is reasonable to make this bet because the expected value is positive.
And interprets person B, who does not place bets, as being irrational.
This interpretation brings no useful development. It is just a thought process.

There could be a discrepancy in perception of "a bet that has a 1/3 chance of gaining 4 and a 2/3 chance of losing 1."
Suppose, for example, Mr. B values his self-perception that he has never failed at -2. In that case, he would be better off not making this bet, since -2 would be incurred upon failure.
In other words, this is a phenomenon in which different people have different values, and therefore, even if each person makes a rational decision, the solutions they come up with are different.

The same is true for the [[Observation range]].
When a red person with a narrow observation range tries to move toward the nearest minimum, a person with a wider observation range may think that it is irrational, even though it is better to cross the mountain. However, this is also due to the difference in the range of observation, and the idea of attributing "irrationality to the red person" to an individual is erroneous.

If people in blue are unaware of the possibility that their range of observation is also limited, then [[relativization]] would be deficient.
