title: "People who see a question as a test."

- Some people see [[question]] as [[metaphor]] for [[test]].
We consider not being able to answer a question correctly to be similar to getting a failing grade on an exam.
You can't say, "I don't know." Because it will be [[subtracted]] with a cross.

We consider it [[eligibility]] if it doesn't get a BUTT.
A sterile conversation discussing using [[abstract concept]] in the air. → [[air battle]].
Neither of us knows what the other is saying, but neither of us can say "I don't know".
I pretend to understand and continue the conversation.
In fact, he thinks that if the conversation ends without them finding out that he doesn't "get it," he will pass the test.
What exactly is this AI you speak of?" I cannot ask the question.

What exactly is this AI you speak of?" I cannot answer the question when asked.
They respond with anger, "[[Don't ask stupid questions.]]" or with cynicism, "[You don't even know that.
This is because it is impossible to answer seriously.
They believe that if you admit that you don't know, you lose.
