title: "Thoughts hindered by the constraints of subject existence"
---

The feature of Japanese that the subject can be omitted allows compression such that $(\forall x)(F(x) \rightarrow G(x))] can be written as [$ F \rightarrow G$ if expressed in a formula. In this case, the subject $x$ is omitted. In contrast, English is based on clearly indicating the subject, and grammatical grammar always requires a subject as the structure of a sentence.

These structural constraints of the language prevent English from expressing itself in the same way as Japanese. In traditional Western logic, it is a principle that the subject and predicate are explicitly stated in a proposition. However, as seen in Gen Nakamura's "Symbolic Logical Elucidation of the Emptiness View," Buddhist logic and Indian philosophy allow logical developments that do not insist on such subject fixation. This allows for communication without the need for an explicit subject, for example, in the expression "where there is no fire, there is no smoke.

Also, in traditional Western logic, propositions are fixed by subjects and predicates, and inferences are made on the basis of these. In contrast, Indian and Buddhist logics develop a logic that relativizes the subject and existence itself, which may be considered a contradiction in Western logic, but symbolic logic shows that it is not a contradiction but a new logical development is possible. This points to the possibility that the subject restrictions of the English language structure may limit the scope of logical thought.

Thus, the phenomenon arises that English cannot fully express the meaning that Japanese expresses due to the constraint of subject existence.
