> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1745332884939186597/quick_promote_web/intro) As [[Hannah Arendt.]] said, [[freedom from politics is one of the greatest freedoms]] / This is a lack of freedom that makes people "think about things that are very far from their experience" / so let's use [[mechanisms that make sense for not voting]], like [Quadratic Voting

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1745335612570571158) This was an eye-opener for me, a Copernican turn, and it took me a while to understand it. This is very important, i.e., "young people don't participate in national elections, participate more" is an infringement of freedom, an arrogance of the existing power, and it fails to adapt to the fact that the appropriate "[[public]]" scale is changing due to technological progress!
- [[Public Scale]]

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1745336589872750905) In smaller communities, people are naturally more interested in politics and participate in politics because it is much easier to see how their opinions affect their future >[nishio The current political system is dysfunctional in that people do not care, and a better "[[new democracy]]" needs to be created.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1745337124289908840) I wasn't quite convinced about the connection between QV and [[digital democracy]], but now it makes sense. In other words, QV is a mechanism to ensure "[[freedom from being forced to participate in a subject in which one has no interest]]".
