- A and B are connected by a common feature X1
- Over time, X builds up and grows larger, so that A and B become more deeply connected by a larger X3

concrete example
- Mr. A and Mr. B get to know each other through their common participation in event X1.
- There, we'll have a conversation and discover X2 common interests.
- Attend event X3 of that hobby X2 together.
- In this process, Mr. A and Mr. B become friends.


relevance
- I asked myself why I drew this shape instead of just a Venn diagram of a perfect circle, and realized it was that diagram.
    - Trying to remember the title: [[pivot]] → [[pivot-like conversion]] → [[There is more than one way to summarize.]] → [[axial foot]] → [[Conversion with abstraction as the axial foot]].
