- [[Parable of the Clay]]
- 'Here's some clay. Knead it into [[freedom]] and make something."

- Some people say, "Well... what do you want me to make?"

We shall call the former the free person type and the latter the serious person type.
- Jiro Kawakita and I are both free spirit types, so we tend to say things like, "You can arrange things as your heart desires.
- I honestly don't know how to advise a serious person type.

- [[The Parable of the Free Book and Coloring Book]]
    - People who are puzzled when told they can draw freely in [[general-purpose notebook]].
    - [picture for coloring in (coloring)

- [[Shuhari]]
- People who feel comfortable with molds.
- People who want to follow the mold
- We just need to provide the mold first.
    - However, the type is not absolute
    - Fits the mold
        - Don't break the mold.
