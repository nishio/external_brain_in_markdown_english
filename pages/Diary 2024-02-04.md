In one community, I was like, "Everyone is using [[Cursor]], I'm the only one who doesn't know how to use it!" and then I went to another community and found that not only Cursor, but ChatGPT was used or not used, even though both communities are engineering communities.

I was impatient to register because everyone in the former community was using digital means of payment and I was the only one in cash, but the world was still using cash.

So it's important to look at multiple communities.
