For example, the relationship between a work and its author is one of mutual [[dependent origination]], and according to [[Nāgārjuna]], we should not consider the two entities involved in such a relationship as independent substances. ([[Observing the Creator and the Creation]])

[[Kurosaki Hiroshi]] in [[From Wittgenstein to Nāgārjuna]] describes this mutual interpenetration of meaning as "there is no roof without a house, and no house without a roof," which represents a state of [[mutual dependent origination]].
- He concludes that the philosophy of [[Later Wittgenstein]] is effective in this context. (p.84)

Nāgārjuna himself used the metaphor of "firewood and fire," suggesting that considering the existence of fire without firewood was nonsensical at the time. ([[Observing Combustible and Combustion]])
- However, firewood without fire does exist, and in modern times, we have sources of fire like lighters.
