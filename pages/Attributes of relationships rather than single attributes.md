title: "Attributes of relationships rather than single attributes"
---

- [[Relationship Attributes]] instead of [[Single Attribute]]
[[attribute]] of [[relationship]], not a stand-alone attribute
- [[communication skills]] But we had the same conversation.
Suppose there is trouble in communication between Mr. A and Mr. B.
The incident was neither a problem of Mr. A [[stand-alone problem]] nor of Mr. B alone, but of Mr. A and Mr. B [[Problems arising from the relationship]], and it is not right to blame one for the other.

When the key didn't fit in the keyhole, it wasn't a keyhole problem or a lock problem, it was a keyhole key [[mismatch]] [[Relationship Issues]]

- [[The Parable of the Applause]]
