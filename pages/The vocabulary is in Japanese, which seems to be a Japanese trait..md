title: "The vocabulary is in Japanese, which seems to be a Japanese trait."

I believe that this is a characteristic of the [[Japanese people]] because they are good at using language such as "[[read the situation]]" and "[[the nail that sticks out gets hammered in]]" and their metaphors are precise, and if they cannot use language, it is a common phenomenon and character all over the world. They read the air, and there are [[sabotage]] people.

That's why it's precise. You see, [[stiff shoulders]] is the one that "the word stiff shoulders gave birth to".
