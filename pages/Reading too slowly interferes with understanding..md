title: "Reading too slowly interferes with understanding."
---

> While reading Shigehiko Toyama's "[[The Serendipity of Random Reading]]", I came across the term "[[rhetorical afterimage]]". It is a point of view that if you read too slowly, your understanding of the text will be hindered because the [[memory]] ([[afterimage]]) of the previous sentence remains in the text, which promotes [[understanding]] of the text. This is close to my feeling.
