title: "Those who insist that the heaviest things fall first."

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The analogy "who claims that heavier objects fall first" is emblematic of pre-Galilean physics thinking. In the past, Aristotelian physics widely believed that "the heavier the object, the faster it falls. However, Galileo Galilei showed that this idea was false through his experiments on the Leaning Tower of Pisa, among others, and demonstrated that the speed at which an object falls is independent of its mass.

Here, "those who insist that the heavy things fall first" refers to those who cling to old ideas and do not pay attention to new findings and evidence, and is used as a metaphor for an attitude that relies on past authority and tradition and refuses to change.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It is unclear whether Galileo Galilei experimented on the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The episode is so impressive that it stands alone.
- Aristotle's physics was questioned even before Galileo.
- > In 1554, Benedetti considered the motion of dropping five balls of equal weight simultaneously. In this case, the five spheres reach the ground at the same time. However, if four of the five spheres are connected and considered as a single object, it weighs four times as much as the original sphere. Therefore, both the weight of the original sphere and four times its weight are considered to reach the ground at the same time.
- > (At the latest in 1586) Stevin and others prepared two lead balls, one weighing 10 times as much as the other, and dropped them simultaneously from a height of 30 feet. They concluded that Aristotle's theory was incorrect because they heard the sound of the balls falling only once.
- 1589~1592, Galileo Galilei was professor at the University of Pisa
- see [Galileo's experiment with the Leaning Tower of Pisa - Wikipedia [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%AC%E3%83%AA%E3%83%AC%E3%82%AA%E3%81%AB%E3%82%88%E3%82%8B%E3%83%94](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%AC%E3%83%AA%E3%83%AC%E3%82%AA%E3%81%AB%E3%82%88%E3%82%8B%E3%83%94) %E3%82%B5%E3%81%AE%E6%96%9C%E5%A1%94%E5%AE%9F%E9%A8%93]

I could easily show that "four times heavier things fall four times faster" is wrong, but you're having difficulty showing whether the heavier and lighter things fall at exactly the same time or whether the heavier thing falls a little bit first, due to the difficulty of making the conditions other than weight exactly the same, interesting.
- > In 1612, Giorgio Collegio recorded that objects of the same material and different weights had fallen from the Leaning Tower of Pisa. This was to refute Jacopo Mazzoni, Galileo's friend and critic of Aristotle... Collegio's experiment showed that heavier objects fell faster than lighter objects. Thus, Collegio concluded that Aristotle was right.
