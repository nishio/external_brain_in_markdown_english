title: "The value of my being to myself is higher than anything else I can think of."
---

The [[value to me]] of my existence is higher than anything else.
- Because once you are gone, the "value to you" of everything becomes zero.

Value to society" is an ambiguous concept.
- Because there is no such thing as a "society" ([[incorrect personification of a person]])

If we assume a specific stranger A, "value to A" becomes a meaningful concept.
- This "value to Mr. A" does not equal "value to me. [[You and others are different.]] So.

- I associate this with this, but I think I'm thinking more like "[The list of things I did as an observation fact is this. Whether you rate it high or low is your business, not mine.

    - No, [Self-esteem is canned.
    - Like "[[The value of my existence to me is naturally higher than everything else, because]] once I am gone, the 'value to me' of everything else is zero"?
    - And [[Evaluation by others does not match self-evaluation]], but that's to be expected.
            - [[You and others are different.]] So.
    - Also, maybe you don't see "[[Evaluation by others]]" as a lump concept.
        - Different things for different people.
            - "Rating by Mr. A." "Rating by Mr. B."
            - They're two different things, so there's nothing wrong with them being at odds with each other.
        - This is the one I saw mentioned below.
            - > "I take it as it is, "I wonder if this person evaluates himself that way.

    - >  [[Try to be honest about what others think of you.]] does not mean to try to fit in there, but to take it as it is, "I guess this person evaluates me that way.
    - >  That [[evaluation]] is just that person's evaluation, and if you haven't gotten there, it's not your fault, and there is no logic anywhere that says you have to get there.
    - >  It was also difficult to understand how you could weaken your own voice a little, but it means to go in a different direction (trial and error). Your inner voice may say, for example, "I've received such an undeserved reputation! If I keep going in this direction, I will become a liar! I desperately need to fill the [[gap]]!" You desperately need to fill in the [[gap]],
    - >  "No, no, no, don't be so hasty. If you get crushed, there will be nothing to evaluate. Let's go steadily at our own pace."
