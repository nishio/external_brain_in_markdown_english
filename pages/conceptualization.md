His masterpiece, The New Spelling Classroom (1951), impressed many teachers and motivated them to teach spelling.

Conceptual exploration" is one of the educational methods proposed by Ichitaro Kokubu, and its purpose is to break down abstract concepts into concrete, easily understood forms to help children and students gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter. This method encourages children to grasp the content of learning in a way that is relevant to their own experiences and daily life, and helps them to consolidate their learning.

Specifically, the process includes
- Presentation of abstract concepts: abstract concepts and themes as educational content.
- [Breakdown into concrete examples: The concept is broken down into concrete examples or events that can be related to the students' daily lives and experiences.
- Relating to experience: Through their own experiences and experiences, children and students will understand the concrete examples and further develop their understanding of abstract concepts.

This "Conceptual Coding" method is also related to the "Living Spelling" and "Investigating Spelling" methods that children and students learn through their own experiences, and is central to Kokubu Ichitaro's educational philosophy.

In addition, Kokubu also proposes "concept building" as a counterpart to "conceptualization. This refers to the process by which children and students construct new concepts and understandings through their own experiences and learning. The emphasis was on a cyclical learning process in which students deepen their concrete understanding through "conceptualization" and build new knowledge through "concept creation.

These educational methods of Kokubun Ichitaro aim to promote independent learning and foster deep understanding and applied skills in children and students, and have many implications for contemporary education.
