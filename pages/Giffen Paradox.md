title: "Giffen Paradox"
---

The lower the price, the lower the demand situation.
- [Giffen property - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%AE%E3%83%83%E3%83%95%E3%82%A7%E3%83%B3%E8%B2%A1)

I don't think this is the nature of the goods, but the nature of the situation.
- $x + y = M$, under the constraints of [$ ax + by \le C
- I want to maximize [$ x
- The lower the cost of $y$, the smaller the value of $y$ in the solution ($b_1 > b_2$ in the figure).

- The crux of this situation is that we want to maximize x, but there is an equality constraint on M
    - If it's an inequality constraint, it's the same point of "buy as many x's as you can afford".
