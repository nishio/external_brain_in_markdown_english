title: "The time and effort it takes to see what you have written"
---

Twitter doesn't show my past posts when I open the top page `https://twitter.com/`.
- It's a screen where you can see and post other people's posts.
- Profile page `https://twitter.com/nishio` must be opened

I opened `https://scrapbox.io/` in Scrapbox and was redirected to `https://scrapbox.io/nishio/`.
- How does it work?
- I can see "what I wrote" because this is a personal project.
