> Editors' Summary
> To act collectively, the group must reach a consensus. However, this can be difficult when debaters present very different but valid opinions. We investigated whether artificial intelligence (AI) can help groups reach consensus during democratic debate. The authors trained a large-scale language model called [[Habermas Machine]], an AI mediator that helps small groups in the UK find common ground when discussing conflicting political issues such as Brexit, immigration, minimum wage, climate change, and universal child care It functioned as a Compared to human mediators, the AI mediators were more palatable, generated broader consensus, and less divided the group; AI statements were clearer, more logical, and more informative without alienating minority viewpoints. This study has policy implications for AI's potential to integrate deeply divided groups. -Ekoma Uzogara

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Caucus Mediation" is a technique in the mediation process in which the conflicting parties do not directly interact, but rather the mediator provides a forum for individual discussion with each party. This method often takes place in separate rooms so that both parties can calmly express their opinions, and the mediator moves back and forth between them to reconcile their positions.
