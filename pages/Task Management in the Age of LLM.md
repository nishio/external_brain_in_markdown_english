title: "Task Management in the Age of LLM"
---

Some traditional "task management" becomes obsolete and new ones are created.

The point I want to focus on here is not the execution of a fixed task.

- [[There are two types of task management]]
- > To consider the task itself.
- >  What is the problem and how to solve it
- >  　 [[What to make]]
- >  [[There are so many things involved]] that you have to write it down and look at it.
- >  [Tools that assume one-dimensional communication
        - [[opening sentence or paragraph]]
- [[There are two kinds of plans]]
- > Jiro Kawakita also says, "[[There are]] two kinds of plans" (Hundo book, p. 110), which separates "[[Planning Procedures]]" from "[[Planning Structures]]".
- > It is a plan to create a structure that, if realized as planned, would result in the fulfillment of a matter, a blueprint in the architectural sense, and even if the blueprint is the same, there are many ways to plan the procedure.
- >
- >  In another word, it could be divided like "[[what to make]] (what)" and "[[how to make]] (how)". The root would be the same.

Both Scrapbox support and KJ method support are, in essence, [[strengthening human cognitive abilities to make decisions]].
- LLM has been added to this "method of enhancing human cognitive abilities" over the past few years.

A style that puts everything in the LLM context for now.

Fluffy Tasks

If you let the current LLMs create tasks, they tend to organize tasks in an uninspired manner
- Why.
- My theory that I have no sense of style is wrong.
    - That's it.
- For the majority of [[neurotypicals]], this is an appropriate way to organize tasks, but for me, as a person with special characteristics, this is the worst way to organize tasks because it is "unmotivating".
- To use an analogy, a task like planting a seed 10 times a year that has a 20% chance of being worth 10 times its value in 5 years.
    - You pay a cost of 10 and after 5 years you get 20.
        - This is 15% annual growth, so a very high growth rate.
                - [[Piketty and VC growth rates]]
        - [[Create an engine for exponential growth]]
            - [[Water is dammed up, so we drill a hole.]]
    - [[Tacit knowledge of the meaning of knowing]] guided by
    - I'm convinced it's beneficial to convert A to B, irrespective of what others think.
    - I don't need evidence for this certainty.
    - Knowing empirically that it is beneficial to follow that "confident movement of the mind" (KNOWING).
    - [[Don't make a to-do list ahead of time if you have ADHD.]]
    - This claim may provide an interesting perspective on designing a task management system
