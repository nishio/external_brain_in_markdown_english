[[board game]] on the subject of programming.
- For non-programmers, the explanation is, "It's full of programmer's jokes!" It is not a "flavor is programming" game, but a serious battle of logical thinking skills. You do not need any programming experience or knowledge to play.
- To explain for programmers, programming is really about implementing code to achieve a goal and then making minimal modifications to that code. However, the modification of the code is self-rewriting at runtime; two players rewrite the code to suit themselves, resulting in a competition for resources, like parallel processing.
- "It is a game in which two threads attack each other's threads while two threads rewrite their programs themselves."[tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1327436042643771393)

> It's so funny!
> I bought it because I heard the explanation at the booth and felt it was new, and I hit the jackpot.
> The rules are simple, but the creative complication of manipulating the process to handle the process was amazing.
> Reasoning!

> It's strange how the combination of cards that come up changes what you think each time.
>  It is both like an assembler and
>  Emergence through multiple references of simple actions is like a "dangerous monster".
>  By the way, after the cards are randomly arranged to determine the first and second attackers, it becomes a zero story definite complete information game. (I doubt if it is finite)
