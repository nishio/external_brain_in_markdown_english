title: "Without confrontation, there is no dialectical development."
---

    - No new knowledge in a [[dialectics]] way can be generated unless [[confrontation]] occurs.
- I recall a previous discussion about the [[No Criticism]] rule in [[brainstorming]].
        - [[Banning criticism is for people who shrink from criticism.]]
- Conflict is necessary, but creating conflict with [[argument that something should be done]] without ensuring [[psychological safety]] is harmful [[interpersonal behaviour]].

relevance
    - [[interpersonal conflict]]
    - [[dialectic development]]
