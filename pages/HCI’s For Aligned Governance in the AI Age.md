    - To address the [[AI Alignment]] problem, human coordination needs to be improved, and the AI Objectives Institute is developing tools for this purpose.
- For example, the AI system is being used to simulate a "town hall discussion" that aggregates and analyzes a wide range of opinions from AI researchers to identify common views and issues.
- This allows for the visualization of diverse opinions within the AI alignment community for [[consensus building]].
- Metacaras conducts workshops for policy makers that link scenario thinking with specific indicators for forecasters.
- The creation of an AI alignment system that enhances human coordination skills would benefit both AI alignment and human alignment.
