title: "Liquefaction not summary"
---

- [[liquefaction]] instead of [[summary]].

- I've been looking into [[Summarizing Technology]] for a while now, and I had the sense that what I was looking for was not here.
- Consider what it is.
- The original text is large, and the summary breaks it down into smaller pieces and then picks up some of the pieces.
- What are the criteria for picking up on this part of the pickup?
- This standard is within the individual.
- And yet, the automatic summary picks up on the "criteria shared by all".
    - So you only try to present to humans what you have after you pick it up.
- What is important is the process of clarifying the criteria within the individual.
- Letting the criteria output in the form of "keywords" and returning snippets and links that match them is [[search (e.g. for someone using a search engine)]].
- Reveal the "criteria" that the individual has not yet verbalized by choosing from the options, and make a presentation based on that.
    - This is behavioral [[targeting]] advertising.

    - Use keywords and other information sources used in your search.
- We need [[a system to chew up the long crystallized text into reasonable sized fragments again]].
    - The story is that they thought they should do that first and then build the back-end process.
    - [[Segmentation by BERT]]
