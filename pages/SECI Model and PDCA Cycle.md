- In [[20200423Learn about the Theory of Knowledge Creation in Organizations (SECI Model)]], the relationship between the [[SECI Model]] and the [[PDCA cycle]] was mentioned.
I knew that the claim [[S-PDCA]] was made that S ([[collaboration]]) is necessary before PDCA, but hearing it verbatim makes a lot of sense because it has a lot of ancillary information attached to it.
In short, a plan is made by formalizing and combining unspoken tacit knowledge, so if you don't collaborate and share tacit knowledge in advance, you end up with an "[[Unconvincing plan]]".
