felt meaning / felt sense
- In some cases, it is called "[[felt sense]]" in katakana.

- [[Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning]]
> If you translate "sense" as "feeling", the "meaning" aspect is lost, so it is translated as "sense" here. The word "meaning" is translated as "meaning" here.
