> ... There is a problem that simply reminding users of their past thoughts will cause their thoughts to stay in the same place. I think we should understand the user's thoughts and present new information at the right time and in the right amount.
> ... I feel like it's a good idea to present something you haven't thought of yet that relates to what you're thinking about.

- Water [[extend]] when [[hole]] opens in [[levee]].
- The "dike" in this case is [[the boundary between what we know and what we don't know]].
- Drilling holes in already submerged levees will not spread the water.
- Drilling holes in the levees that have not yet received water will not spread the water.

- [[I can only accept knowledge that is one step ahead of what I have now.]]
