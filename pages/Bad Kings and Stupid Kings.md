title: "Bad Kings and Stupid Kings"
---

We tend to think of a king with bad politics as a bad king, but in terms of "[[Don't find malice in being incompetent enough to be explained away.]]" he is not a malicious king, just a foolish one.

The reason why it is silly is because there was a great deal of distortion and inefficiency in information gathering prior to the birth of the [[LLM]].
So we needed a strong and correct [[insight]] that could infer the truth from little information. Most people don't have this, so their eyes are blinded by [[lack of information]] and they play "stupid politics".

relevance
- [[Wise King]].
