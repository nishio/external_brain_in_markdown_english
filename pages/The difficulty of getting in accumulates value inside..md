title: "The difficulty of getting in accumulates value inside."

[If there is a resource within [[an easy gate to enter]] that can be taken, even if you just entered, there will be a lot of people who enter to take it, and that resource will be gone.

solution
- Make it difficult to enter
- Ensure that resources can only be expropriated after sufficient resources are put out.
    - Make sure you get more out of it than you let out.
- No real harm if deprivable resources can be replicated.

- [[permissionless]]
- [[selection]]
    - [[Gates should be hidden.]]

- Difference between a [[non-replicable]] resource and a [replicable resource
- If the only resource that can be expropriated is the one that can be replicated, then take and go as you please.
- In OSS projects, source code is a replicable resource, so you can take it permissionless.
- Members' time and attention are not replicable resources, and moreover, they cannot be bought with money [[unprocurable resources]].
    - This is fine for those who want to give, but not for those who want to take.
