- Sometimes, people are perceived as if they are a single person, leading to anger over "inconsistencies in statements."
- It's natural for there to be inconsistencies since they are different individuals.
- The error of equating different people is a [[Human Bug]].
    - This occurs because our cognitive abilities are limited, preventing us from considering each person individually.
    - It is the same phenomenon as [[Cognitive Resolution]].
- We used to interpret this as assuming [[A Homogeneous Group of People]], but now it seems we might not even recognize them as a group in the first place.
