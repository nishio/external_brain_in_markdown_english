May be duplicated (2018-04-16)
2018-04-16
- Some people who are new to the [[KJ method]] or the [[Writing Method]] make the mistake of thinking that they should not write the same thing, but this is not the case.
The fact that they write the same thing is a sign that it is important.
It is rare that "the same thing" is really 100% exactly the same.
The expressions are slightly different.
By [[Comparison]] it, a better direction becomes apparent.
This is the same concept as finding [[gradient]] by [[numerical differentiation]].
It creates such opportunities, so [[duplication]] is not something that should be avoided.
You can write as many times as you like about what is important.
