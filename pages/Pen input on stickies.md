title: "Pen input on stickies"
---

    - [[Ability to write arrows]]
    - This is the illustration phase
- It is rather important to be able to enter pen input on a sticky note.
    - The ability to hang directly on the canvas is not important.
- Really?
    - Preparing a sticky note and then writing on it" is one extra step.
    - Draw what comes to mind when you think of it.
    - We can surround them later and group them together.

- Only GroupStateItem can be a parent now, but I wonder if there should be a hasChildren type in the future, since PieceStateItem can have PathStateItem in the future when we can handwrite on stickies.
