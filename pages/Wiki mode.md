A typology of how each page of [[Wiki]] is used. (The world's first Wiki was developed by [Cunningham [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A6%E3%82%A9%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E3%83%BB%E3%82%AB%E3%83%8B%E3%83%B3%E3%82%](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A6%E3%82%A9%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E3%83%BB%E3%82%AB%E3%83%8B%E3%83%B3%E3%82%) AC%E3%83%A0]'s C2 Wiki summarizes it.)
