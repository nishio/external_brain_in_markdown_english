    - Reinventing the Organization --- A Guide to Creating an Organization Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness

- Drucker said [[The knowledge society is not a society of bosses and subordinates.]] The book examines 12 examples of organizations without bosses and finds common patterns.
    - [[Facts and Interpretations]] should be read with care. The second part is a survey of 12 actual cases, and the first and third parts are the author's interpretations based on them. They are not neatly divided, but are mixed, so the reader must distinguish between them.

- One-page summary

- According to the author's interpretation, there are two pre-organizational forms and five post-organizational forms
    - Classifying and naming is beneficial #patternlanguage
- The author interprets the change in the stage of human consciousness as bringing about a change in organizational structure, but I think the evolution of technology is bringing it about.
    - [[How changes in the technological environment have altered the organizational structure]].

- Before organization → [[impulse organization]] # Impulse type
    - Technology capable of hunting large animals
    - The more people, the better.
    - Emergence of a leader to lead multiple people
    - War with other tribes

- Impulse organization → [[adaptive organization]] # adaptive
    - Invention of agriculture: food compared to hunting and gathering [[Increased productivity]] # Food productivity
    - It is not enough to act [[reactive]] to events.
    - We need to understand the calendar and take the right action at the right time.
    - It is advantageous to have a plan, communicate that plan to the masses, and have the masses act according to that plan.
    - Need to communicate information to a large number of people
        - Information and communication technology was not well developed at the time, so information had to be communicated by humans.
            - Birth of [layered organization

- Adaptive organization → [[Achievement-oriented organization]].
    - Even in the agricultural era, there were improvements in tools, etc.
    - Improved tools will lead to [Increased productivity
        - I remember that the windmill mill in Venice was the first patented or something.
    - The Industrial Revolution takes place.
    - A "factory" is born.
    - Early "factories" were hierarchically governed by adaptive organizations.
    - Epochs are Ford's plant and Taylor's scientific management methods.
        - [Scientific management method - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E7%9A%84%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86%E6%B3%95)
        - Ideas for measuring and streamlining human work
        - A quantitative KPI called "work efficiency" is introduced and people are managed.

- Achievement-oriented organization → [[multidimensional organization]].
    - This change is only happening in a small percentage of the population at this time.
    - Advances in Information Processing Technology
        - End employees are now able to disseminate information.
        - It is now possible to have something other than "[[conveying the will of the governing to the governed]]" in which the top management of a small number of people think and communicate.
    - Of the tasks of the middle management level, the communication of information no longer needs to be done by a human being.
        - A form of "top management delivers a message directly to employees.
        - If all the end employees deliver the message directly to the top management, the "summarizing job" will remain because the top management will not have enough information processing capacity and will fail.

- Adaptive, Achieving, and Diversified Organizations are not one in particular, but all are adaptive to the situation.

    - [[evolutionary organization]]
    - Machines will surpass humans in the efficiency of "doing exactly what you are told to do" as automation technology improves.
        - The pressure to "improve efficiency" in achievement-oriented organizations leads to the stripping of that work from human beings.
    - Improved information transmission technology has eliminated the need for people to communicate with superiors.
    - As a result, all employees will be engaged in the job of "thinking about what to do," which used to be done by top management.
