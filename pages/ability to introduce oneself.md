ability to introduce oneself
    - The word [[self-introduction]] seems to be at odds with the rest of the world.
        - [[self-promotion]] Power?
        - [[self-branding]] Power?
    - Each of these could also be interpreted to mean something else.

[[Resource allocation bias]]
- As children, they receive resource distribution from their parents.
    - Attention Distribution
- As adults, we face the fact that others don't pay as much attention to us as our parents do.
        - [[0.3 seconds per person]]
- Only a "few special people" to whom you distribute more resources than average.
    - How to acquire this specialness

People X who give me resources for nothing in particular have a high probability [[cheater]].
- Person Y, who doesn't have many people to give resources to, will think of person X, who gives resources, as special.
- If X makes a bad move, Y will devote all of its resources to X, and will be even more dependent on X because it cannot afford to build a new relationship with X.
