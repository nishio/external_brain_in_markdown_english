Users' [[Kozaneba Reading]] Experiences

# Case 1
.
Let's try [/villagepump/Kozaneba reading](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/Kozaneba reading).
It's done right!
- > To take up the subject of reading texts that are not quite in line with the argument.
    - good
- > I'll start with about 20 sheets (I can't do too many, yannal).
    - good
        - [[Maybe 25 sheets would be a good first step to experience the KJ method.]]

Comments made during the work.
- > When you have a group of sheets of paper, put them together in an order that seems to make logical sense. Then, I fold the edges over and staple them together. This established an idea. I call the resulting series of paper strips "[[small stature]]".
    - I think this part is in this form because Umesao has set the goal of "outputting writing" based on the "fragments of thoughts in my brain" as a kozane.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I think the goal this time is to "improve my own understanding" based on bits and pieces of "other people's writing".
        - So, if we can find a connection between fragments that are far apart in the text, we can consider it progress.
        - Discover one connection, discover two connections, and so on... and gradually the network grows.

A little more detail on the above
- In the mind of the book's author, concepts are connected in a web.
- But in the process of making it into a book, it has to be a one-dimensional string of words.
        - [[Writing is one-dimensional]]
- The connections in the mesh are disconnected, and things that are originally connected and placed close together are placed in a distant position in the text.
- The author tries to somehow express that they were "originally connected" by using indicative words and creating the same or similar words multiple times
- The reader has to reassemble the network based on those clues. If it's easy, he can do it in his brain, but when it gets difficult, it's impossible to do it in his brain.
        - [[mental arithmetic is easier than mental arithmetic]]
