title: "Big Tent"

> Having a big tent doesn’t mean trying to be all things to all people, though. It just means you welcome all people to your party, and allow them to bring their own drinks. We need to lose none of our soul or values by offering others to join us, and we may well learn how to mix a new delicious drink or two.
> This doesn’t come for free. It requires work to be welcoming. Especially if your goal isn’t just to attract more people who are just like the ones who are already part of the community. Lowering the barriers to entry is work we should always take seriously.

(DeepL) [[Pitch a big tent.]] That does not mean trying to be all things to all people. It means welcoming all and allowing people to bring their own drinks. We need to invite others to join us without losing any of our soul or values. Maybe then we can learn how to make new and tasty drinks.
- This is not free. It [[takes effort to be welcome]]. Especially if the goal is not just to attract more people like those who are already part of the community. [Lowering the barriers to entry is a task we should always take seriously.

> and we may well learn how to mix a new delicious drink or two.
- Both DeepL and GPT4 miss read this part. Is the wording difficult for machines to understand?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - It's a highly compressed, high context text.
        - Metaphor: "Allow people to bring their own drinks to the tent so we can learn how to make new drinks."
        - It's "lose none" and "mix", so it's not just saying that what was brought in is new.
    - That by allowing people with diverse values to participate in the community, we may be able to mix our values with theirs and create new values

- [[One method cannot meet everyone's needs]].
