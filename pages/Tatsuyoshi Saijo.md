> His areas of expertise include [[future design]], experimental economics, and environmental economics.
>  Prove [[Maskin's theorem]], the fundamental theorem of [[mechanism design]].
>  Experiments with subjects were initiated and it was found that the Japanese were more "teasing" than people from other countries....
>  Since the three pillars of current society - market, democracy, and science - do not have [[eyes to see the future]], we will start [[designing a society that sees the future]].
>  We define "future possibility" as "the human nature that even if current gains are reduced, if this will enrich future generations, this decision-making and behavior, and even thinking in this way itself, will make us happier," and design, experiment, and practice of social systems that demonstrate future possibility are named [[future design]]. Designing, experimenting, and practicing social mechanisms that demonstrate future potential is named [[future design]]. He has developed various mechanisms and is experimenting and practicing them in Japan and abroad.
