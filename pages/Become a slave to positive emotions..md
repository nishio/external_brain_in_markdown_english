> [fladdict](https://twitter.com/fladdict/status/1697850232984539515) "Intense anger" or "despair" or "lust" are easy examples to understand. Strong emotions have the effect of "narrowing the options for human action". In a state of exposure to strong emotions, the options for action are automatically footed off.

> [fladdict](https://twitter.com/fladdict/status/1697851197141741919) Generally speaking, people who are giving off strong emotions are driven by auto mode. So they make selection mistakes, they do things they shouldn't, and they can't take actions with the mid- to long-term in mind.
>  I don't think that's free expression, it's a state of being a slave to the brain drug...by offering up one's freedom.

> [fladdict](https://twitter.com/fladdict/status/1697855246696137141) It's adrenaline-driven, and it's not "human" to be angry, it's the behavior pattern of monkeys and dogs, and it's not "human" to be angry and not be a slave to adrenaline. to be able to make a choice not to be a slave to adrenaline". I think it is "human" to be able to "suppress one's anger and make choices not to become a slave to adrenaline".

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1697967388954906639) If the purpose of life is to live happily, happiness is not determined by others but by the individual, so it comes down to subjective feelings, and when that happens, " It is good to maximize the time you feel positive emotions". Anger is negative, and greed is also negative because it calls for suffering that cannot be satisfied.

### digest
.
Emotions limit human behavioral options and reduce freedom. Especially strong emotions put humans in automatic mode and cause them to lose their medium- to long-term perspective. However, the usefulness of emotions depends on their nature and life purpose. For example, it is beneficial to treat positive emotions subjectively and negative emotions objectively.

### Relevance
.
The fragments "Practice of Not Thinking," "Anger at What Can Be Changed," and "Dogmatic Meditation Commentary" are related to emotional control and freedom. In particular, "The Practice of Not Thinking" shows how to avoid the automatic mode of emotions and keep the mind calm. Anger at the Changeable" describes the nature of anger and how to deal with it, and "Dogmatic Meditation Commentary" suggests ways to live with emotions.

### THOUGHTS
Emotions limit human behavior, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. By understanding how to control and properly express emotions, emotions can be a tool to enrich human behavior.

### Title
.
"The Relationship Between Emotional Control and Freedom."
