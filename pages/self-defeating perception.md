title: "self-defeating perception"
---

To make a perception that makes you suffer. A term coined by Nishio.

The word has a similar vibe to the term "self-defeating historical perspective."

If I had to align it, it would be "self-defeating worldview", but for some reason I feel that "self-defeating cognition" sits better at this point.
