The book addresses the phenomenon of the decline of the traditional intellectual and cultural elite and the emergence of the average "masses" as the center of society due to the progress of industrialization and democratization.

[Main Issues
[The Rise of the Masses and the Decline of the Elites
- He argues that in modern societies, the traditional elite class of high culture and intelligence loses influence and is replaced by the average masses who become dominant.

The masses' "[[rebellion]]"
- He warns of the danger that the masses will tend to base their actions on emotions and simple majority decisions rather than on traditional values and high standards, resulting in a decline in the quality and direction of society as a whole.

Need for personal autonomy and self-development
- Ortega explains that each individual's self-improvement and critical thinking are essential to the progress of society. He believes that individual excellence is the key to supporting quality cultural and intellectual activities.

Thus, "Revolt of the Masses" is an important book of thought that sharply points out the risks to modern society posed by popularization and the responsibility of the individual to counter these risks.

> In "The Mission of the University" (translated by Tadashi Inoue, Tamagawa University Press), written around the same time, Ortega declared that "the mission of the university today is not to nurture the elite, but to enlighten the average student, to educate the liberal arts. The mission of today's universities is not to nurture elites, but to educate the average student. Ortega, of course, wanted to protect Western civilization from the runaway popularity of the masses.

On the contrary, he encourages the masses to restrain themselves from running amok by raising the level of their culture. In this sense, he thoroughly believes in the masses and bets on the masses.
