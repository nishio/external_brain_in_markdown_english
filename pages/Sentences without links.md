- A document without a [[link]] can only be read by itself when it is hit by a [[search (e.g. for someone using a search engine)]].
    - [[User Needs]] and will read the most detailed state regardless

Documents with links can be read by following the links as needed after being hit by a search.
- If you can predict the content of a link by its title, you can select "links to read" according to your needs.
- For those who are accustomed to "follow the link", it is easy to understand because the information is available in a level of detail that meets their needs.
- For the uninitiated, it feels confusing because they implicitly expect the "content to be complete on one page"

- [[Have Bing AI refer to a specific Scrapbox]] I think this is what was happening in the experiment
- Scrapbox is a "document with links", where the page title is a summary of the page content and the page title is the title of the link
- When Bing AI is applied to this state of affairs, it selects a "relevant one" from among many "linked pages" and goes to read it.

        - Highlighted pages read by the AI.
- So if this kind of search is used, the unit of [[Information Reuse]] is not pages
