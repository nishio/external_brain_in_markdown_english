“[[Inoculation]]” to Resist Misinformation
[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2818667](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2818667)

> The global proliferation of [[misinformation]] and misleading information poses a serious threat to public health by encouraging distrust of vaccines, unscientific therapies (e.g., "natural" therapies), and even the rejection of life-saving medical procedures such as monoclonal antibodies. A prominent response from the medical community has been efforts to disprove misinformation. However, this article highlights why it is more effective to prevent the spread of misinformation than to attempt to correct it after it has spread. To this end, "[[pre-banking]]" (a method of disproving misinformation in advance) can be utilized from the perspective of psychological immunity.

"Inoculation to Resist Misinformation" means "inoculation against misinformation."
- Here, "inoculation" ([[inoculation]]), turned from its medical meaning, refers to "[[psychological immunity]]" in the field of psychology. Specifically, it refers to methods that make people immune to misinformation. This concept is based on the idea that
    - Pre-immunization
        - By pointing out errors and presenting correct information before misinformation is spread, people are less likely to believe misinformation.
    - Strengthening Psychological Tolerance
        - By reviewing misinformation and helping them understand why it is false, they will be less likely to be fooled by similar misinformation in the future.
This is part of a technique called "[[prebunking]]," which represents an approach to taking action before misinformation spreads.
