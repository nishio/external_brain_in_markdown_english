title: 'The fastest course is not the fastest." birth process'
---

- Several people saw [[The fastest course is not the fastest]] and responded "[[Tactics and Strategies]]".

> As I read this explanation, I noticed that I tend to explain [[abstract concept]] in abstract concepts, and I seem to be bad at explaining it by dropping [[abstraction]]. I guess I can't stand the fact that the more I try to explain things concretely, the more I lose precision at the same time (but there are many situations where it's okay to be a little wrong, if the goal is for the other person to understand).

- He seems to see it as "reducing abstraction and likening it to something concrete."
    - It appears to me that the opposing concepts of "tactics and strategy" came first, and then they chewed it up from there.
    - But what I actually did was the opposite.
    - interesting
- I felt the two specific stories were related, so I discarded the muddy parts and explained them.
    - A story about a 360-degree evaluation that doesn't work very well and is being used by a large company.
    - A story about a man who thought he was on the fastest track to success at another large company.
- So it was a process of raising the level of abstraction.

More specifics.
- Timeline 1: A person who left one of the largest companies, X, claims that he was on the fastest track to success.
- Timeline 2: My friend who recently received an unprecedented promotion responds, "No, no, you're running on existing rails and you say you're the fastest, but to someone who doesn't run on rails, it's like we're all on different sides of the same coin.
- Timeline 3: After some time has passed, I read an anonymous testimonial about a 360-degree evaluation being done at a large company, Y, that was not very good.
- Timeline 4: I think that superiority in that evaluation method is just a matter of who is ahead on the rails in big company Y, and most people in the world aren't on those rails.
- Time Series 5: Recalling the events of Time Series 2

- I think "tactics ←→strategy" is too abstract.
        - [[just a bit of opposing concepts]].
    - The important keyword "[[constraints]]" has disappeared and is missing.
        - [policy constraint

    - When you need to dig deeper into a concrete concept, you can simply use the closest concrete example to explain it.
