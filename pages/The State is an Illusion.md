>  I wonder if this is the most hated line of the many quotes by [[Jan Wenli]] that netizens hate the most.
>  It seems to be a line that people with weak minds and hearts, who cannot have a proper ego and even their ego depends on the state, just cannot tolerate.

The idea that there is something higher than the individual is all an illusion. The state and God are all illusions. Illusions are useful when they function as [[devices to make people happy]], but as soon as they are perceived as [[something beyond the individual]], they begin to function as [[devices to oppress the individual]]. What is worse, those who are under the illusion are simply immersed in the pleasure of oppressing those who oppose them, using the illusion of the state as a shield.
> [IkedaKiyohiko](https://x.com/IkedaKiyohiko/status/1825548077069136028) The state and God are concepts. Concepts do not exist. Only phenomena are real. Human beings are concepts, but individual people are real.

[[Illusions are useful when they function as devices to make people happy.]]
    - [[pragmatism]] -like justification.
