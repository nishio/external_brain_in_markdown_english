title: "Knowledge Extraction and Reuse from AI Chat Logs"
---

> @Devin I would like you to do a knowledge extraction from the chat logs with the AI, put it in a reusable form, and then find out what research has been done in the past on actually reusing it and put it in Markdown.
>  Advice:.
>  Don't forget to write information in the file for references to what you have searched and read so that a log of the research process can be kept in the file.
>  I think it would be a good idea to decide on search terms and look for them on Google Scholar or arXiv.

A research study on knowledge extraction and reuse from AI chat logs has been completed. Key findings include:
1. latest research trends:
    - [[Memolet]] (2024): An innovative approach to directly manipulate and reuse the interaction history between user and AI.
    - [[ISPY]]: Automatically extracts problem-solving patterns with 93% accuracy
    - Integration of dialogue state management with the [[knowledge grounding]] method
2. specific examples of implementation methods:
    - Structured Knowledge Management with Graph DB
    - Highly accurate extraction using a combination of Hidden Markov Models and BERT
    - Relation Extraction Technology Considering Dialogue Context
3. practical results:
    - Realization of automatic knowledge base updating
    - Improved accuracy of judging topic continuation (13.7 points)
    - Integrated domain tracking and state management for improved performance
