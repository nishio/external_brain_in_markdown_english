title: "When you create opportunities for retraining, people who are not willing to learn will not learn."

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>People without [[Willingness to learn]] will not learn, even if you create [[opportunities for re-education]].

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>That's right. It is not enough to provide retraining opportunities; it is important to motivate people to learn.

The following initiatives may be used to motivate students to learn
- Improve educational content: Design an engaging curriculum that allows students to acquire practical skills.
- Clarify career paths: Specifically indicate what careers will open up for them as a result of their education.
- Financial Support: Provide scholarships and allowances to support students during their education.
- Share success stories: Share widely and motivate examples of people who have been successfully retrained.
- Psychological support: Ease anxiety and resistance to learning through counseling and other means.

However, even with these efforts, not everyone will be motivated to learn. Depending on their personal values and environment, some may be less interested in learning.

It is also important to provide such people with opportunities for activities other than learning. For example, encouraging them to participate in [[volunteer]] and [[community activities]] may help them stay connected to society and find fulfillment in life.

In order to respond to the social transformation brought about by AI, we believe that it is necessary to approach the issue from a variety of angles, not only from an educational perspective. Flexible support measures will be required to match the characteristics of individuals.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>In an age when AI has the intelligence of a college graduate, the following skills and careers will be important
1. creativity and innovation: Jobs that can demonstrate creativity unique to humans that AI cannot will be valuable. Talent who can generate novel ideas in fields such as art, design, and R&D will be in demand.
2. emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills: There will remain jobs that require interpersonal skills such as empathy, persuasion, and leadership, which are difficult for AI. They will be in areas such as counseling, education, and sales.
3. advanced expertise: The value of personnel with in-depth expertise that cannot be replaced by AI will increase. Experts who can work with AI to make high-level decisions in fields such as medicine, law, and engineering will be needed.
4. data science and AI utilization: In order to effectively utilize AI, people who can do data science and design and operate AI systems will be in high demand. Positions such as machine learning specialists and AI engineers are promising.
5. ethics and governance: as AI is implemented in society, ethical decisions and rule making will become important; roles will be created for ethics experts to address AI ethical issues and for policy makers to create a framework for AI governance.
6. pioneering new fields: Pioneers are needed to open up new fields where AI has not yet been introduced. Talent who are willing to take on challenges in uncharted areas such as space exploration, ocean exploration, and biotechnology could be active in this field.

What these skills and careers have in common is that they demonstrate unique human abilities that are difficult for AI to replace. Areas that can leverage human strengths such as creativity, empathy, expertise, and ethics will continue to play an important role in the age of AI.

At the same time, a lifelong learning attitude is essential, and adaptability will be required to keep learning new skills as AI evolves. Rather than relying on a fixed set of skills, a flexible attitude of adaptation will be the key to surviving in the age of AI.
