- Generative Agents are computational agents that simulate human behavior and can be applied to a variety of interactive applications such as immersive environments, interpersonal communication exercises, and prototyping tools.
- The system consists of 25 agents in a The Sims-like environment, where users can observe and intervene in the agents' daily planning, sharing news, forming relationships, and coordinating group activities.
- The architecture that enables Generative Agents extends the language model to fully record the agent's experience in natural language, compile memories into high-dimensional reflections over time, and dynamically retrieve memories for use in action planning.
- Evaluation results showed that Generative Agents can generate believable behavior both at the individual agent level and at the society-wide level.
- The architecture validation revealed that observation, planning, and reflection contribute significantly to the credibility of an agent's actions.
- We proposed an architecture and interaction method that enables believable simulation of human behavior by integrating a language model and a computational interactive agent.
