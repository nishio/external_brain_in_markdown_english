title: "Users who want a large text summary, fast horses."
---

I have a feeling that users who request "[[a]] summary of a large text" will not be satisfied with the results of [[summarizing with LLM]].
"[[I need a fast horse.]]" and what I really want hasn't been verbalized yet.

[/villagepump/ "I want a massive sentence summary" is not "I want a fast horse"](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/ "I want a massive sentence summary" is not "I want a fast horse").
