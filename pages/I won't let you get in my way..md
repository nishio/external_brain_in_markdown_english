Song: [[Masami Okui]].
Lyrics by Masami Okui, Composed by Masami Okui and Toshiro Yabuki, Arranged by Toshiro Yabuki
Coupling song for [[Megumi Hayashibara]]'s single "[[Give a reason]]".

>   [[A life manipulated by something that has no hope or dreams. Are you satisfied with your life now?]]

>  [[It's time to start the engine, take off all that rusty common sense.]]
- [[rusty common sense, all off]]
    - [[rusting common sense]]
    - [[undressing]]

> Give a reason" ([[Give a reason]])
- 「 [[I won't let you get in my way.]] 」は「世界中ウワサになりたい」という目標を注目に置いてるところに共感してなかったけど、そもそも曲名にもなってる「[[誰ひとり邪魔はさせない]]」のところは実はかなり近いのだなー<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

> Give a reason" (Give a reason) is the 11th single by [[Megumi Hayashibara]].
> The opening theme song for the TV anime "[[Slayers]] NEXT" broadcast on the TV Tokyo network. The coupling song is the ending theme of the same TV anime, "[I won't let you get in my way.
