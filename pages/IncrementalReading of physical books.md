title: "IncrementalReading of physical books"

Can we apply [[Incremental Reading]] techniques to physical books?
- Manage pointers to books on your computer
- 1 book draw
- Just read one page ([[Habits that are too small]])
- If you have something to say about what you have read, just say it (compressed).
    - If you can't think of anything to leave out, don't write it down (that's how much it was worth).
- The next interval depends on whether there were any leftover notes.
    - If not, the interval will increase.

The burial is reminded at progressively longer intervals.
You may also look at the listings or search for the information. In this case, the interval should be shortened.

Many people unknowingly use the [[buying books and not reading them]] algorithm for physical books.
- Place books in a list as much as possible.
- Read what you see
- Pile it up where you can see it.
Since the system is designed to be able to list and dig out using "what you see" (unconscious search), it breaks down when it comes to hard-to-see e-books and the like.
