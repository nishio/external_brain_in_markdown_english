What the Crusher does
- 1: Talking behind the backs of leaders and key members
    - Repeatedly, "where there is no fire, there is no smoke."
    - Lowering the confidence of key members
- 2: Lying
    - Repeatedly lie with impunity.
    - Reduce trust in people who tell the truth.
- 3: Flattering Important People
    - Create a positive bias.
    - This mischaracterizes the movement to exclude the crusher as an "equal fight" when it occurs.
- 4: Swarming
    - Make a weakling a henchman.
    - Be able to claim "I'm not the only one" when expressing an opinion.
- 5: Creating an untouchable atmosphere
    - Showing emotional or other behavior
    - Even if people around you have concerns, you don't point them out because you don't want to get involved.

counter-measure
- Gathering the facts
- Denouncing in the presence of a large number of people, including important people
