title: "Gradual and PCO"

- I was wondering about the announcement of [[Gradual]] at [[name-your-enemy party]] and the comment, "[[Partial Common Ownership]] would be fine." I thought it was strange about the comment "Why don't you just use [[Partial Common Ownership]]?

(Notes for the next day)

- The motive is "I want to own an expensive NFT, but I can't afford it, so I want to own it cheap."
    - You don't quite understand what benefits you're going to get from this "ownership".
        - I thought they must have some desire for it.
    - The problem was the other stakeholders in the market, who were not quite sure of the incentives for the creators of the object of ownership to use it.
    - Shinkansen ads that say something like, "You too can be a building owner with our office building unit-ownership system! or something like that.
        - I don't know what part of that makes you a building owner, but I'm sure you make enough money to run ads.
        - I think it's possible to make a trade that sells at a lower price with a high misperception of what "ownership" means by [[small lot]].
        - Personally, I don't find it interesting at all, but I think it's just "[[I'm not the client.]]" so I figured I could do whatever I wanted.

- [[Landlord and SALSA]]
- > Most of the expected users can't afford 6 million for immediate cash and don't have the risk tolerance to withstand the risk of not being able to sell in a year, do they? Then I had a feeling that a service like [[Gradual]] for NFT would occur for residential SALSA as well, and eventually the end user would be able to rent for 50,000 per month.

I like the idea that after information is shared at the event, thoughts are distributed and asynchronously deepened in each person's Scrapbox, and then gently reassembled through links in the Scrapbox.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- I thought, "Aren't Gradual and PCO's different in purpose to begin with?" I thought so.
- I'm now verbalizing that it's all about "making it smaller and more liquid."
