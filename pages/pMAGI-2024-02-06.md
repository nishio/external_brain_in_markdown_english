> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1754866272955756694) SVG to PNG is done, but text laid out with foreignObject is not displayed?

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1754874830959046948/quick_promote_web/intro) I'm in trouble, I exported SVG from Adobe XD and pasted it into React as JSX I pasted the SVG exported from Adobe XD as JSX to React so that data can be poured in, but word wrap is not done automatically, so I used divs with foreignObjects. But when I render it with Sharp on the server side, the text is not displayed. to be continued
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1754875417884852413) So I asked GPT4 if there is any good library to dump foreignObject and carve it into tspan, and they said "no, use this function" or something like that. I tried to use it anyway, but document.createElement doesn't work on the server side. The solution is jsdom. seriously? Are you sure you're not running in the wrong direction?
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1754878357831819414) I've been going along without worrying because AI is accelerating so fast, but isn't this the path humans should be on? Are you sure about that? I think there was a fork in the road between SVG and Canvas, and a fork between Sharp and Pupettier, but I've been trusting them to come up with a solution with full confidence, so I've been going forward, but is this really the path to take?

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1755024049888170223) No! That's a trap, isn't it?
>  ![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GFsZAMIboAAQzxp?format=jpg&name=medium#.png)
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1755041467960377527) Wait, in the first place, in this view, I think the appearance of the text in a monospace font and line breaks without considering word breaks or hyphenation is sufficient. I guess... then there is no need to get the width.
>  In the end, which technology choice is better depends on the unspoken requirement specification of "how you expect it to look like.
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1755041832105550102) Until 5 minutes ago, I was thinking "I can't get the width, so it's impossible to make my own line breaks, Sharp was the wrong choice and I'll choose Puppeteer"

- Maybe the AI assistants are misleading you in a big way.
    - Rendering SVG on the server side is a thorny issue.
    - I can't copy and paste if it's made into an image.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Since the image seems to be a fixed size, I would put a div with position:absolute or something to overlay the image.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - No, what I'm making now is an OGP Image for SNS, so it's a prerequisite to make it an image.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I can embed a div in the SVG itself with a foreignObject, but when I try to render it on the server side, it doesn't show up, and I'm wondering if that's not good enough.
        - Ah, OGP.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - I made my own tool to insert text into images for OGP generation...
            - I wonder what everyone else is doing.
                - Simple things can be done with [[ImageMagick]], but if you start thinking about folding Japanese characters, you will have to make your own.
                - It would be nice to be able to generate PNGs or something from SVG without having to think about it.
                - I believed the AI when it said it could do that, and I was hooked.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - [[ricapitolare]]はsvg生成のみ<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/yuta0801/icon' alt='/villagepump/yuta0801.icon' height="19.5"/>wrote code to convert svg to png in rust.
            - [https://github.com/yuta0801/svg2png](https://github.com/yuta0801/svg2png)
    - It's interesting that talking to GPT4 clarifies a wide variety of misconceptions on this subject.
        - I'd like to sort this out after a break as an interesting story of human cognition.
