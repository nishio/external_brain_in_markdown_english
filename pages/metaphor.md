title: "metaphor"
---

> In 1980, George Raykov and Mark Johnson published Rhetoric and Life, which pointed out that "[[Metaphors are]] fundamental conceptual operations that support the understanding of abstract concepts. Metaphors are fundamental conceptual operations that support the understanding of abstract concepts" and "Metaphors permeate all aspects of everyday life, not only language but also thought and action.
- [Metaphor - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%A1%E3%82%BF%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%83%BC)

Personally, I would extend "metaphor," but [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]] uses [[metaphor]] without the long sound as is the policy of the Technical Review.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Metaphor is a technique of expression that links two seemingly unrelated events or concepts and compares one to the other. Among past thinkers, [[Aristotle.]] states in "[[Poetics]]" that "metaphor is a kind of learning, [[the]] ability to find parallels," a means of relating different things and deepening understanding. This idea shows that metaphor is an important element of figurative thinking and linguistic expression.

> But the greatest thing by far is to have a command of metaphor. This alone cannot be imparted by another; it is the mark of genius, for to make good metaphors implies an eye for resemblances.
- The most important thing is to be able to manipulate metaphors at will. This is not something that is handed down from others, but is the mark of genius. This is a sign of genius, because creating good metaphors means having an eye for similarity.

[[two seemingly unrelated things]].
- [[bind (e.g. an address)]]
    - [[Ability to tie]]
    - [[cohesive power]]
- [[linking different concepts together]].
- [[Connecting experience with words]].

### digest of notes
.
Regarding the notation of "metaphor," I personally add a long sound, but "metaphor" with the long sound omitted is used in "The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production" by Gijutsu Hyoron-sha.

### Relation to Fragment
.
Fragments "The Intellectual Production Techniques of Engineers: A Summary of Repercussions" and "I read The Intellectual Production Techniques of Engineers" refer to "The Intellectual Production Techniques of Engineers" as do the notes. In particular, "Engineer's Intellectual Production Techniques: A Summary of Repercussions" refers to the use of metaphors, which can be seen to be related to the notebook.

### deep thinking
It reflects differences in individual understandings and interpretations of the notation "metaphor." This indicates that the use and understanding of the term varies with individual experiences and perspectives.

### summary of thoughts and title
.
The interpretation of words depends on the individual's point of view."

metaphor
The publisher's policy is to write "[[metaphor]]" where you want to write "[[metaphor]]".
- In Nishio's own mind, "[[metaphor]]" is commonly used.
