- SVO and the Dancing Girl are different.
    - There are no unreserved seats in SVO departing from Shinjuku.
        - It's difficult to buy a reserved seat ticket after entering the premises.
        - At the Midori-no-madoguchi counter, say it's to Ito, buy it, and then go in.
        - The Super View Odoriko (SVO) does not run very often.
            - 925 is last today.
    - The regular Odoriko train also has unreserved seats.
        - But this time he couldn't sit down.
        - The Kodama from Tokyo Station was smooth.
            - But when you get to Atami and want to change trains, the Ito line doesn't come for 25 minutes.
