> [@igz0](https://twitter.com/igz0/status/1653055719300800513?s=20): What can I say about the [[danger]] I feel for people who have a large proportion of IQ as their identity?
> This is a metaphor, but when choosing a new smartphone, you don't just choose CPU and memory performance, do you?
> I feel like the software in the brain is far more important, but we are only looking at specs for that.

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1653061529695305729?s=20): people who make high IQ their [[individual]] identity do not have people of equivalent IQ around them. In other words, they are not able to build [[friendships]] with people of equivalent IQ.
> Next, people who are using their IQ to produce [[results]] talk about results, so people who only talk about IQ without it are people who are not producing any results.
> I think these two are the main ingredients of danger.
The danger of [people who take high IQ as their identity

> [@tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1653146999225724928?s=20): @nishio Ah, I'm starting to think it's equally bad for middle-aged people with the names of high schools like Kaisei or Nada in their profiles ......

> [@ringo](https://twitter.com/ringo/status/1653146403575840771?s=20): @nishio Lack of identity and
> The lack of a way to express identity and
> Why bother choosing that mode of expression?
I felt like I had to >separate them.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1653223555864092672) I would like to hear more about this as it sounds like an interesting angle!
- > [ringo](https://twitter.com/ringo/status/1653227869802475520) I agree that IQ, or rather a person who expresses a particular ability or attribute as an identity, looks dangerous. It's like saying that supporting a large building with a single pillar looks dangerous.
- >  But I think it might be a play that hides or jeopardizes other attributes, for social networking purposes.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1653231485430927362) Ah, you dare to put forth one character attribute to make the character setting easy to understand (and play it out), that makes sense!


> [@HeLiCoPtAr2](https://twitter.com/HeLiCoPtAr2/status/1653138466371432448?s=20): @nishio "I won't let you take the IQ mount but I will let you take the achievement mount" is simply sterile. I feel like it's just a petty skirmish.
- > [@read_me](https://twitter.com/read_me/status/1653163016521908225?s=20): @HeLiCoPtAr2 @nishio After the achievement mount comes "how much money did I make?", "how much support did I get?" How much happiness you make people..." and the list goes on and on. All of these are acts of putting others on a specific scale, which reproduces unhappiness because it makes them superior or inferior in comparison to others.

> [@seiichiro1240](https://twitter.com/seiichiro1240/status/1653200012304867328?s=20): you know, there used to be someone who would get involved with "my IQ is xxx," as a pillow talk. I wonder how he is doing.

> [@YasashiNingen](https://twitter.com/YasashiNingen/status/1653150075563184129?s=20): ah, the same weirdos who are always bragging about how many points they got on the center exam or whatever! I'm not sure if I'm being too harsh or too harsh.

> [read_me](https://twitter.com/read_me/status/1653162133662892033) I don't think it's a good idea to intervene in how they use their specs.
>  "Since I was born a woman, I should make the most of my femininity," and that's up to the individual.
- > [read_me](https://twitter.com/read_me/status/1653168494886932481) I can't just write things like height and affiliation in my profile and then be told, "People who really produce results don't write things like that. I can't stand it when people say, "It's important to know how much you've achieved with it. I'd love a society where people can recognize themselves even if they don't have achievements.
