title: "I don't feel the medal is worth it."
---

I don't feel much value in [[order]], so I don't feel much value if someone else is wearing a medal.
- The fact that you "have that medal" is a clue to inferring competence.
- The fact that they "choose to wear that medal" is a clue to inferring values.
- So I think the medal itself has utility.
    - There is also harm: [[A small medal of youth becomes a great curse.]]
