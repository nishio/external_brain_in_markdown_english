title: "AI Memory"
---

2025-01-30
It occurred to me to ask ChatGPT, "Tell me what you remember about me that relates to digital democracy," and I got more details than I expected.

I even remember stories I don't need to remember.
- When I told him to forget it, he said, "I understand," but he didn't forget.
- I make a note that "users want us to forget about information about ~" or something like that. w

Memory extraction from the chat would be helpful in making the assistant smarter.
- I think a UX at the end of a Devin session that reviews what was learned in that session is a good design.

On the other hand, it is troublesome to manage the extracted memory in ChatGPT or Devin because it is not possible because of the list format UI.
- A list-style view is not a good prospect when there are a lot of elements in the list, right?
- ChatGPT currently has 113 cases, mixed Japanese and English, and only about 10 are visible on one screen.
    - Cannot be edited, can only be deleted item by item.

I'd like to be able to prompt and organize against memory, wouldn't you?
