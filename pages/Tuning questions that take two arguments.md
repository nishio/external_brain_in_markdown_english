Tuning questions that take two arguments
- Not a good idea to ask every interactive question.
    - Do they suppress it completely?
        - Symmetrical questions are "the same question", so it looks good to suppress them.
            - done
    - The "what happens to Y when X?" question was asked both ways and I realized "well, it wasn't a one-way street," so it's good to have both.
    - If the answer is that the relationship between two symbols is identical, it's not a good idea to ask questions about the relationship between symbols.
            - [[Identical symbol relationship]]

- [[Use Case: Importance of Grouping]]
