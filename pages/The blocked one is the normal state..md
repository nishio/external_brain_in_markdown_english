> [piro_or](https://twitter.com/piro_or/status/1480085718332735495): Every so often, I'll see a quote flowing down my timeline and the tweet being quoted is invisible, and I accidentally figure out that I'm being [[blocked (lump of something)]] by that person. (lump of something)] from that person, and every time I do, I feel uncomfortable because if I had remained unaware, my mind would not have been boggled.

> [yomoyomo](https://twitter.com/yomoyomo/status/1480119858985848835): This is really true, every time someone who is often quoted RT in my observation range tells me I'm blocked and we've had some sort of exchange. I don't blame them if they have, but it makes me wonder why this person hates me so much, and it really boggles my mind.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1480123160775499776): I have such cases sometimes, but there are more people in the world than I can recognize anyway, so I don't think it's reasonable to devote [[cognitive resources]] to people who block me. I think it is not reasonable to devote [[cognitive resources]] to people who block me because there are more people in the world than I can recognize, so I just ignore them and [[they cease to exist in my world]] (I can't remember how many there are because I forget easily).

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1480187642704969737): Most people block most of the human race because they don't speak the language they are used to, so it doesn't affect many people if someone uses some Japanese but doesn't speak it. It doesn't affect many people when people who use some Japanese but don't understand their language block them.
