title: "Morphological analysis of Japanese is a barrier to multilingualization"

> [@taku910](https://twitter.com/taku910/status/1660845546553180163?s=20): NLP nowadays is language independent using [[subword]] unsupervised learning from raw data. The difference in the number of tokens comes from the difference in the amount of training data, not from English specialization. If you increase the amount of Japanese data, the difference in the number of tokens will naturally decrease. Specializing" in Japanese language knowledge is a detriment to multilingual processing.
> [@taku910](https://twitter.com/taku910/status/1660847558338523137?s=20): Conversely, this language-independent subword technology is what makes it possible to collect a corpus and have it work in a language-independent manner. This is the reason why we are able to collect corpora and make them work in a language-independent manner. Japanese [[morphological analysis]] is only a barrier to [[multilingualization]].
> [@taku910](https://twitter.com/taku910/status/1660857987815055362?s=20): It is not realistic to increase the Japanese corpus at the expense of the rich English corpus, so we should only water down the Japanese corpus when learning sub-words. The number of tokens problem can be eliminated if we increase the number of Japanese at the expense of the rich English corpus. I don't know if the number of tokens is really effective for accuracy or not.
