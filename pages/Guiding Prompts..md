> [Not_junk_](https://x.com/Not_junk_/status/1901129151370981758) University of Tokyo's mysterious rule that you can use chatgpt in your report, but if you do, you have to write the prompts and everything in the references.

> [tokoroten](https://x.com/tokoroten/status/1901544735166320698) ah, soooo right!
>  Even if you give guidance on the text output to ChatGPT, nothing will resonate because it was not written by the person in question.
>  When you ask them to write a prompt, you can see at once what cognitive model they are being asked to write a report on, so you can instruct them on their own perceptions.
> [drinami](https://x.com/drinami/status/1901630772660060277) The intent of the question is exactly right. Thank you!
> [drinami](https://x.com/drinami/status/1901809218090635676) On second thought, devising a report assignment can be described as [[prompt engineering to Organic Intelligence]].
> [drinami](https://x.com/drinami/status/1901851802993316316) Example of former "prompt engineering"
>  >drinami: I cast a spell on the report that it would be submitted on a first-to-file basis, just like patents. I made a spell that "the first to file system is the same as for patents, meaning that if the contents are unintentionally similar, points will be deducted for those submitted later" and there was no copying and pasting.

> [tokoroten](https://x.com/tokoroten/status/1901831075682455814) In the meantime, I made slides of this episode for use in a lecture.

> [tokoroten](https://x.com/tokoroten/status/1901911880240943334) subject "the boss is".
>  This is not the fault of the guy who uses the generative AI, but the boss who can't teach it.

> [torufurukawa](https://x.com/torufurukawa/status/1902009177209532804) You wrote somewhere that modeling/transforming the real world, solving it there, and modeling/reverse transforming it back to the original world is engineering, right? I think it was written somewhere.
>  I think the prompt is a visualization of the conversion step.

> [AlwaysLightning](https://x.com/AlwaysLightning/status/1901996173986349327) I guess it's like giving me an executable program but not knowing if it's correct, so I ask to see the source code too.
