- Related: [[Entering Another Community as a Reincarnation into Another World]].

If you can't carry over resources, you have to acquire them [[at the destination]].
- Hunter-gatherer-like "gathering from nature" does not mean gathering from others
    - Passive content consumption is not foraging.
- Hunting and gathering food for the community [[joint deposit]].
    - "Acquisition on the move" means producing something of value to the community.
        - In the end, it's going to come down to [[intellectual production]].
