I think the problem is that there are many people who can't calculate [[risk]]. It is correct and reasonable for people who cannot calculate risk to be cautious.

I feel that it is difficult to give them real experience in schooling (difficult in schools that require a certain amount of protectionism. The damage of failure has to be real for me, both in quality and quantity).

[[Parents remove risk]].
