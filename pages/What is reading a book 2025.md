title: "What is reading a book 2025"
---

What is "[[read a book]]" in an age when advances in LLM have made it more efficient to find the information you want when you want it?

Effect as a mess in a situation where what you want to get is not clear, not verbalized, and you want something interesting.
- But this is a lot of social media encroaching on this.

The "virtual sharing of experience" effect of multiple people reading the same story
    - [[All but one read HUNTER x HUNTER.]]
