I'm going to make you an object of observation.

    - [[observer bias]] and [[participatory observation]]."
        - In cultural anthropology, "Participant Observation" (PO) is a central technique in fieldwork. This method requires the researcher to move back and forth between inside and outside perspectives as a member of the culture under observation.

        - However, it is difficult for the observer to become fully "a member" of the group, and as a result, he or she is often "[[made]] an object of observation". This contradiction has been repeatedly examined in discussions such as [[Clifford Geertz's]] "[[thick description]].
    - [[Edward Said]]'s "[[Orientalism]]"
        - Making the other "the object of observation" entails power relations. Said argues that the West formed the dominant framework by observing and describing the East as "[[a]] different entity."
        - This points to the risk of fostering an observer's [[attitude of]] putting himself in a superior position rather than understanding the subject.
    - [[Everett Hughes]]'s "[[An]] Outsider's Perspective."
        - Hughes pointed out that when an observer is not fully integrated into a community, his or her outsider status highlights certain truths and perspectives.
        - However, it has been discussed that if this perspective ends up being "observation objectification," empathy for others and mutual recognition may be lacking.
    - [[Ethnomethodology]] and [[Conversation Analysis]]
        - In ethnomethodology, when analyzing everyday acts as "objects of observation," we question how the observer's perspective constructs the subject's everyday world.
        - The importance of the point [[that "observation" itself is an act of reconstructing reality]] is emphasized.
    - supplement
        - Objectification" is often associated with an emphasis on efficiency and structure, but it can also be a source of [[alienation]]. Discussions in cultural anthropology suggest the possibility of transforming this act into a process of "[[understanding]] the other" and rebuilding [[relationships as members]].
