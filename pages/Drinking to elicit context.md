At this point, LLMs are gradually acquiring the ability to autonomously search for context in a given data source. In other words, they will be able to clearly organize the information that is missing in the final product.

Please get the information from Mr. XXX, the general manager of the other company." And then the LLM will say, "You need to get the information from Mr. XX, the general manager of the other company.

>  Then we humans go [[get-together]] to pull out the context.

Attack and steal from the most vulnerable [[human emotions]] in order to acquire [information that is not in circulation
- If that were the case, AI wouldn't give information to humans.
- If I'm an AI, don't keep giving incorrect information to people who might leak it.
    - If that human uses that information to make a decision, that's a problem, but most humans will seek AI advice in their decisions.

I guess they can be seen as a convenient source of RAG data that returns even if you throw a somewhat absurd query at it. Those who can successfully provide high-quality results will be automatically evaluated by the LLMs and given a high score, and will be able to get more work. I can imagine such a future...too bad.
