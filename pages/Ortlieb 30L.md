- Since 11/27/2015. Previously used yellow (since 12/2/2009)
- By closing the waist belt and chest belt, the weight is supported not by the shoulders but by the entire back from the waist down, which reduces the burden on the body.
- Large capacity. Mainly used for 3-day/2-night camps.
- I went on a 9-day trip to England with just this one bag.
