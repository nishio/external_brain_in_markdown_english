title: "Even one person needs to co-edit."
---

    - What I think about using Scrapbox alone, which allows [[joint editing]].
- Sometimes edit the same page at the same time from iPhone, iPad or PC
    - PC is good at keyboard input.
    - iPhone is good at taking pictures with the camera
    - iPad+Apple Pencil is good at diagramming
- So co-editing is necessary.
