Token Economy is an accompaniment management system based on the systematic reinforcement of target behaviors. The three basic requirements of the token economy are
- [Tokens: Symbols or objects that can be exchanged for other [[enhancements]].
- [Backup Enhancers: rewards offered in exchange for tokens (material rewards, services, privileges, etc.)
- [Targeted Behavior: Behavior subject to clearly defined reinforcement.

In the token economy, target behaviors earn tokens, which can be exchanged for backup reinforcers. Tokens have no intrinsic value, but function as learned [[secondary reinforcers]] based on psychological principles ([[operant conditioning]] or [[behavioral economics]]).

The name token economy was first used in 1961 when Teodoro Ayllon and Nathan Azrin implemented a program at Anna State Hospital in Illinois. This is considered the first full-scale token economy.

The token economy then reached its peak in the 1960s and 1970s, when it was widely adopted, particularly in psychiatric hospitals. It has been shown to be effective in a variety of subjects and settings, including adult schizophrenic patients, [[developmental disorder]] children, and schools. Positive results have been reported, including [[improved behavior]], [[decreased undesirable behavior]], and [[increased motivation]].

On the other hand, ethical issues, restrictions on patients' rights, and the sustainability and generalization of acquired behaviors have also been identified. It has also been criticized for its token economy and has been on the decline since the 1980s. However, it is still recognized as an effective approach in certain circumstances, and similar systems are used in areas such as substance dependence rehabilitation under the name "[[contingency management]].

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> I saw a comment on [[Quadratic Voting and Plural Management Study Group]] that "this is a very good example of the token economy," and I thought it was, but there was no explanation of the "token economy," so I made one up.
    - A well-known concept in the field of [behavioural analysis
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/sge/icon' alt='sge.icon' height="19.5"/>The token economy refers to economic activities such as the visualization, accumulation, and exchange of new value using tokens (alternative currencies) issued on the blockchain, which is not possible with the traditional legal tender-based economic sphere structure.

    - Using "tokens issued on the blockchain" as tokens in the token economy is a naive application of the token economy, not a requirement of the token economy
