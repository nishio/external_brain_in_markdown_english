title: "Try new task management techniques"
---

- I often feel like I'm trying out a new task management approach.
        - [[Trade-offs between use and exploration]]
    - Even if you have a system that is working okay now, it is good to try something new
    - But on the other hand, during the "give it a try," the cycle that has been habituated and spinning until now is interrupted.
    - When you're using System A, you try System B and conclude that System B is not good enough, you don't go back to A.
    - It could be argued that going back is the right thing to do.
            - [When what you change is a mistake, don't undo it, change it further.
