Copy. I'll explain "affixation disorder [[c]]" in plain language with minimal formulas.

What we're talking about (in a nutshell)
- When the local fit is correct, but the overall fit is not, the "mismatch" is called a lamination disorder [[c]].

concrete image
1. make a card summarizing the book chapter by chapter (local meaning).
2. chapter A and chapter B could be connected without contradiction in the overlapping content (OK).
3. chapter B and chapter C could also be connected without contradiction (OK).
- But when I try to connect A and C, there is a slight discrepancy and they do not connect (use of different terms, different assumptions, etc.).
→ The "parts" of each chapter are correct, but when pasted together in the "whole book" the seams do not match.
The objective "remainder" of this "unfitness" is shown in [[c]].

Just a little more formality.
- There is a semantic fragment $s_A, s_B, s_C, ...$ for each open compartment (chapter/section/context).
- I want the overlapping parts to essentially match the "same meaning".
- The cocycle (misalignment table) records the misalignment (difference between A ∩ B) at the overlap of the two parcels.
- If all overlaps can successfully cancel out the misalignment, then the whole is "cleanly" pasted together (no obstruction, [[c]]=0).
- If the displacement cannot be erased in any way, the disorder remains ([[c]] ≠ 0).

What makes you happy?
- Can locate "something blurred": can tell which chapters/concepts don't fit together seamlessly.
- Seeds of novelty: Where there are gaps, new connections can easily be made by rephrasing, bundling, and redrawing boundaries.
- Become a "quality indicator": if the local area is correct but the overall design is incomplete, [[c]] will remain → Clear areas to be fixed.

How to find it (practical procedures)
1. determine the section: chapters, divisions, topics, etc.
2. align overlapping claims: definitions/premises/conclusions on the same topic.
3. record differences: differences in term definitions, discrepancies in assumptions, contradictory conclusions.
4. try to see if it can be erased: paraphrase, alias bundle (quotient), try to reconcile with boundary re-demarcation.
- If it remains, [[c]] ≠ 0: This is the point where the affixation failure = "hole in the structure" = discovery point.

A small example
- "Gr" is generally "group," but internally it is "Garoon.
    - In A (General Glossary), Gr = group.
    - In B (internal document), Gr = Garoon.
    - A∩B (shared region) cannot be unified because the same "Gr" is assigned different meanings.
    - Solution: Use the alias bundle (quotient) to associate "Gr (general)" and "Gr (in-house)" as a bundle while distinguishing between them / Use boundary operations to switch the display by context.
    - If this cancels out the discrepancy, [[c]]→0; if it remains, [[c]]≠0.

summary
An affixing fault [[c]] is an indicator of the location and amount of "partially correct but not whole".
The places where you find them are the promising areas where discoveries occur through rephrasing, bundling, and boundary redrawing.
