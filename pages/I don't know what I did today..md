I don't know what I did today.

I'm using an AI in parallel with the amount of AI that is just barely within the limits of what I can control.
At the end of the day, I'm trying to write down what I did today, and it's a blur. w
I guess I shouldn't have immediately rounded up the finished notepad and thrown it away (...)
Ah, so the [[AI Task Management System]] now has everything, including long-term tasks, but there should be a list of just "[[what to do today]]"?
