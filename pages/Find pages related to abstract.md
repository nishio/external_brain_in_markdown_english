    - [[Extract questions at various levels of abstraction]] continues to develop
    - I created a system that, when you enter a consultation, pulls up "pages that are related in the abstract, but on a completely different topic in the concrete," and explains how they can help you.
    - At first glance, it looks like a typical RAG, but there is a sense of doing something much more interesting.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/blu3mo/icon' alt='/villagepump/blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - [demo_2.pdf](https://scrapbox.io/files/66f02157baf0b5001d2f5070.pdf)  ([/nishio](https://scrapbox.io/nishio))
        - User input was originally from [The hell of slacking off in the face of frustration.
        - For example, a story about procrastination and a story about low self-esteem and the inability to actively ask questions are quite different in the concrete layer.
        - However, the abstract structure of "behavior is hindered by emotional influences" is the same, so it can be pulled together. (Then the LLM relates the two stories to each other.)<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/blu3mo/icon' alt='/villagepump/blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/rtree/icon' alt='/villagepump/rtree.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - [demo_3.pdf](https://scrapbox.io/files/66f03e583e02ea001d9184f6.pdf)  ([/nishio](https://scrapbox.io/nishio))
        - Consultation on habit formation
    - [demo_anno2.pdf](https://scrapbox.io/files/66f0374f34d87d001ca3f3ac.pdf) (Mr. Anno's policy manifesto)
            - [[AI]] Maybe a demonstration of context would be easier to understand?
        - The answer to the problem of "labor shortage in the construction industry," which is not mentioned in the manifesto, is provided by diverting Anno's policies toward other similar problems.
            - [[汎化された安野たかひろ]]だ<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Okay, interesting.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Scrapbox is helping me move back and forth between the abstract and the concrete.
        - I don't know where we were talking about.
            - [[Scrapbox reminds me of what I've forgotten.]]
        - →[/shokai/2 hop link](https://scrapbox.io/shokai/2 hop link)
            - > Can move back and forth between concrete and abstract in a mutually complementary manner
        - I feel like I'm finding "analogies in different areas" by abstracting once and then searching.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/アナロジー/icon' alt='アナロジー.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - This experiment is able to jump to a different space by analogy by abstracting, analogous search, and then pulling back to the concrete.
            - ![image](https://gyazo.com/aba79d6067557a2c137a8e7ab19d3929/thumb/1000)
        - The LLM then gives a connected commentary looking at both the original space and the later space.
        - I was curious to see what would happen if I only showed the space afterwards, so I tried it.
            - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Propose a Next Action to resolve the bad situation of "low self-esteem and inability to actively ask questions" using this text. Techniques to dig deeper into the conversation...
            - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/gpt/icon' alt='/villagepump/gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Build on small successes: Start with easy questions and gradually get used to asking them. Build confidence through experience by realizing that it is okay to ask the wrong question.
            - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Project that Next Action by analogy to the "state of slacking off while being driven by frustration".
            - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/gpt/icon' alt='/villagepump/gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Complete small tasks: If you feel agitated, the whole thing feels too big to take action. First, [[complete small tasks to gain a sense of security that "slacking off won't be a problem," while gradually expanding the scope of your actions]]. For example, concentrate on a task even for a short time to pull back your motivation.
                - I think there's a clue in the wording of this one.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
                    - Indeed. In a "state of frustration and slacking off."「サボっても問題はない」という安心感という発想は個人的には思いつかなかったが、「サボってはいけない」と「変な質問をしてはいけない」に共通の特徴はありそうだ。<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - [full log](https://chatgpt.com/share/66f0cb6e-1ea8-8011-bf80-91466be6afe0)
        - Using different [[concept spaces]] in parallel is [asym-chat (chat with misalignment)
            - Derailment:[/nishio/思考の結節点2019-01-21#5c452bf1aff09e0000bb1a70](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/思考の結節点2019-01-21#5c452bf1aff09e0000bb1a70)に [[Networks between concepts]] 、 [[metaphorical space]] というリンクが有る。関係する？<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - RELATED.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I don't think it's the same as if real people "only see the space after" because you can't erase memories.
            - but on the other hand, there are other cases where elimination from the active context might be beneficial
                - [/nishio/Teach AI the KJ method#66eb9ccaaff09e00003b6e0d](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/Teach AI the KJ method#66eb9ccaaff09e00003b6e0d)
            - Even for humans, the ability to "put it aside for a moment -" may be beneficial for thinking with a wide range of exploration
    - It feels even more enhanced.
    - I wanted to believe that coming and going was a human prerogative, but I feel again that it's time to lose.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/sta/icon' alt='/villagepump/sta.icon' height="19.5"/>
