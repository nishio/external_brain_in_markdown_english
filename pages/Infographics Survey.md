2012-03-06
Research report based on a request from headquarters to look into [infographics

After researching, I came to the conclusion that "[[infographics]] = [[schematic]]".

    - [[There are three types of diagrams]]
    - [[Illustration is a cooperation of pictures and words]]
    - [[If a conflict becomes apparent, dig into the reasons why.]]

Leading to [[Kyoto University Summer Design School 2013]] in 2013 and [[Digital Handwritten Illustrative Communication]] in 2019.
