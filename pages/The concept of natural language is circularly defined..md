title: "The concept of natural language is circularly defined."
---

- Human natural language does not neatly define all the meanings of words.
    - Most of us humans can't even answer the question, "What is goodness?"
        - We think we have "defined" the state of [[circular referencing]] with each other as [[opposing concepts]], and then we pile concepts on top of each other.
        - In the [[developmental process]], [[pleasure and comfort]] are probably primordial first.
