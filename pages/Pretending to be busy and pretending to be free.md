title: "Pretending to be busy and pretending to be free"

[Pretending to be busy and pretending to be bored.
- Pretending to be busy is seemingly beneficial by not having anything extra come in.
- but in reality, [[lost opportunity]] occurs with "I'm not going to call on you because you seem busy.
    - This opportunity loss is not observable to the individual.
- Strengthening the barrier of busy pretending to be busy will only allow the following to pass
    - A: That there is perceived legitimacy in passing on the story (specifically, that there is [[precedent]], etc.).
    - B: Funny people who charge at you without regard for barriers.
    - In the end, it doesn't prevent B, and the increased percentage of A's reduces the opportunity to gain new perspectives, which is a loss.
