non-numerical= [[innumerable]]

「 [[innumerable feature (e.g. in a programming language)]] 」は、「 [[experience]] 」が明確な境界や単位を持たず、どこを「1単位の経験」と切り出すか確定していない(=「 [[innumerable]] 」である)という「経験の特徴」である。経験は根本的に明確な境界を持たない。経験は個々の事象ではなく、連続的な流れの一部である。経験をどのように切り出し、解釈するかは、個々の認識や理解に大きく依存する。<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/omni/icon' alt='omni.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

- [Study Session 3 on "Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning" invented the expression "Make the gradient in three steps.
- In [[Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning" Study Session 4]], it was expressed as follows ([[Schematic diagram of innumerable features]])
- It has not been determined what part of the bewildering experience will be cut out as "one unit of experience".

    - For these things, the question is, "Is this one? Two?" It is futile to ask, "Is this one or two? It depends on where the boundary is.

## Digest 1
In Study Session 2 of "Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning," I explained "myriad features." Depending on one's perspective, it may appear to be one, two, or many.

## Digest 2
.
Myriad Features" is explained in detail in Study Group 2 and Study Group 3 of "The Experience Process and the Creation of Meaning. Myriad Characteristics is the concept that experience has no clear boundaries or units, and that there is no fixed point at which a single unit of experience can be separated from the rest. This is also shown in the "Schematic Diagram of Myriad Features" and "Multiplicity(v1)". Also, in "atomic v.s. non-numerical," it is emphasized that experience has no fundamentally clear boundaries.

## deep thinking
Experience is myriad, and its characteristics and units vary according to perspective and interpretation. This indicates that experience is not an individual event, but part of a continuous flow. In addition, how one isolates and interprets experience is highly dependent on individual perceptions and understandings.

## one-line summary
.
Experience is myriad, and its interpretation depends on perspective and perception.

## Title
.
The myriad nature of experience and the diversity of its interpretations."
