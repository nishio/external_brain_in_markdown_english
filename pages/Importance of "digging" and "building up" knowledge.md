title: 'Importance of "digging" and "building up" knowledge'

## [[digging]]

People who understand [[piling up]] from the basic concepts can answer in depth when asked about [[Abstract Concepts]], "What does that mean?" they are able to answer in depth when asked "What does that mean? In contrast, [People who memorize the whole thing can't dig in.

## [[Rootless Knowledge]]

Knowledge must be connected to the "[root (of a tooth, hair, etc.)" of experience to be applicable. This is why knowledge that is "rootless" will eventually die out.

## [[Aerial]]

[[Highly abstract concepts]], when not connected to [[Specific Examples]], are prone to [[argumentation games]]. The [[interpretation]] for the abstract concept often differs, and the discussion often becomes sterile.

## [[dig in and circular reference]]

If you ask someone about an abstract concept X, "What exactly is that X?" some people will get a concrete example and others will get another abstract concept Y. But be aware that this can be a circular reference. Is this hypothesis really correct?

## [[How to learn to be a programmer who can]]

Understanding concepts is important, but too much abstraction makes them difficult to understand. Learning from small [[examples]] can prevent this problem.

## [How can the ability to abstract be taught?

- If you avoid [[adherence to specific cases]] and collect only abstract information, your knowledge will wither without roots. [[Spreading one's roots (of a tree, etc.)]] is the key to true understanding.
