title: "Quantity and Malice"

On the other hand, the man has no helping hands at all. There seems to be such a difference. The man envies the woman for having many helping hands, even if some are malicious. The woman does not see that the man has few helping hands when in trouble. To the woman, it seems enviable that the man does not have malicious helping hands.

> >faked_equality: "I am a first-year university student. I am having trouble solving a PC-related issue. Currently, ○○ is in a ×× state." When this question was posted in two versions with different genders, the version set as a female university student received nearly 400 responses, while the male university student version received less than 10. This is a real episode that visualizes the difference in appeal between genders.
