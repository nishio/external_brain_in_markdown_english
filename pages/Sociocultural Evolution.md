> The dual inheritance theory [[that humans are the product of both sociocultural evolution and biological evolution]].
>  Each factor has a separate [[selection mechanism]] and mode of transmission (biologically [[gene]], the unit of [[cultural evolution]] is often called a [[meme]])

- Changes in [[corporate culture]] could be described in the same way, through meme transmission and selection mechanisms.
- Cases where a company's [[vision]] is posted on its website, but it does not become a [[culture]].
    - Is the vision replicated in the individual employee in the first place?
    - For example, in the case of Cybozu, one of the memes is [[fairness]], and when there is a discussion about whether to choose Plan A or Plan B, the conclusion may be "Plan A is more expensive, but it is fair and just, so we will choose Plan A. In this case, the "fairness" meme is replicated by the participants in the discussion.
        - Two memes are selected by the "selection pressure" and "selection mechanism" of debate: "We should choose proposal A, which is costly but fair," and "We should choose proposal B, which is less fair but less costly."
        - The "meme that disrespects fairness" is getting weeded out.
        - This is the process of establishing a corporate culture
        - [[Owned media create a common language.]]
        - This too can be explained by memes.
        - Memes are replicated by posting them on owned media.
        - Also, by releasing a meme outside the company and having it praised, it becomes [[social proof]] that "this meme is not just a [[Galapagos concept]] that survives only within the company, but something that can be accepted by the outside community as well.
