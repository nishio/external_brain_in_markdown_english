How Japan has taken different cultures, beliefs, and technologies and developed them in its own unique way
- Part 1: Reconciliation with Buddhism
- 2nd: Integration with Western Civilization
- The advent of AI is Japan's third "encounter with another civilization," which will be followed by a "fusion.

- Introduction of Buddhism: Around 538, Buddhism is introduced to Japan via the Korean peninsula.
    - Emperor Suiko's reign: Conflict arose between the Mononobe and Soga clans in favor of and against acceptance of Buddhism (Mononobe against, Soga in favor).
        - Vandalism of Buddhist statues: In the early days of the introduction of Buddhism, the Monobe clan and some powerful clans opposed Buddhism and destroyed Buddhist statues.
        - Mononobe-Soga Conflict: The Mononobe were a Shinto-based power, while the Soga embraced Buddhism. The conflict between the two was over acceptance of Buddhism.
        - Exclusion of Buddhism: Some regions and powerful families felt that Buddhism was too closely tied to political power, and there was a movement to exclude it.
- Prince Shotoku's Policy: Prince Shotoku took the lead in promoting Buddhism as a political support. In the process, Buddhism was reconciled with the indigenous beliefs of Japan.
    - Politics of Prince Shotoku: In the early 7th century, Prince Shotoku popularized Buddhism as the support of the nation.
    - Taika Reform: In 645, the political system was reformed and centralization of power was promoted.
        - Taika Reform:
        - Background: In the 7th century, Japan was facing conflicts among powerful clans, problems with the land system, and the need to centralize power.
        - Conflict: The power struggle between the Soga and Mononobe clans intensified. The conflict became especially clear on the issue of whether or not to accept Buddhism.
        - Result: In 645, the Taika Reform took place to promote centralization. In the process, the Monobe clan was eliminated by assassinating Soga Iruka, and the Soga clan came to power.
    - Nara Period: From 710 to 794, many state temples were built and Buddhism flourished.
- Heian Period: From 794 to 1185, Shintoism and Buddhism were reconciled and [[Shinto/Buddhism syncretism]] developed.
    - Establishment of [[manifestation theory (holding that Shinto gods are manifestations of buddhas)]]: This idea became widespread after the middle of the Heian period (794-1185), and the idea that gods are incarnations of buddhas took hold.

2nd: Integration with Western Civilization
- National isolation policy: In 1639, Japan implemented a policy of seclusion that restricted foreign exchange.
- Perry's Black Ships: In 1853, U.S. Commodore Perry arrived in Japan on a black ship to force the opening of Japan to the outside world.
- Conflict: With the end of the isolationist policy, Japan was forced to open its doors to the Western powers as contact with them increased. There was a conflict between traditional Japanese values and institutions and modern Western values and institutions.
    - Ansei's Five-Power Pact: In 1858, Japan signed an unequal treaty with the Western powers.
        - Ansei no Gokoku Treaty: Japan enters into an unequal treaty with the Western powers. This threatened the country's sovereignty and caused domestic disagreements.
        - [[Ansei no Daigoku]]: The Great Rebellion of 1858-1859, in which the Shogunate suppressed the forces that advocated the Emperor's reign over the barbarians.

        - Sonno Joi Movement: A growing movement by some samurai and court nobles to eliminate foreigners and restore the emperor-centered government.
        - Tengu Rebellion: A rebellion in 1864 by the Chōshū clan's "Sanō Joi" (Emperor Exclusionist) faction, which was dissatisfied with the power of the feudal lord and antagonistic to foreign powers. The rebellion arose from dissatisfaction with the power of the feudal lord and antipathy toward foreign powers.
        - The Forbidden Gate Incident: In 1864, the Choshu Clan, which stood for the Emperor's exclusion of foreigners, clashed with the Shogunate and other clans. The Choshu Clan, which was opposed to the Emperor's exclusion of barbarians, burned down the gates of Kyoto (the Forbidden Gate).

- Meiji Restoration: The shogunate ended and the Meiji government was established. The government sought to integrate with Western civilization by rapidly advancing policies of modernization and Westernization. While adopting Western institutions and technology, the government tried to maintain Japan's unique values and culture.
    - Background: In the late 19th century, Japan needed to overcome unequal relations with Western powers, the decline of the shogunate, and domestic turmoil.
    - Conflict: There was a fierce confrontation between the forces that wanted to maintain the shogunate and those that wanted to exclude the emperor and the barbarians.
    - Meiji Restoration: In 1868, the Shogunate collapses and the Meiji government is established. Rapid westernization and modernization is promoted.
    - Boshin War: 1868-1869, war between the new Meiji government and the old shogunate forces based in Hokkaido. After this war, the new government took control of major parts of Japan.
    - Result: In 1868, the Meiji Restoration was achieved, led by the forces of the "Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarians" movement, and the Shogunate was abolished. The new Meiji government adopted a policy of adopting Western institutions and technology to modernize Japan.
    - 1868 [[Shinto and Buddhism Separation Order (1948)]] ("[[Shinto and Buddhism Separation Order]]")

- Response of the administration during the period of integration with Western civilization
    - Vigilance and closure: During the first contact, especially with the spread of Christianity following missionary work by Portugal and Spain, the regime was wary of foreign cultures and religions and adopted a policy of restricting contact with foreigners through the Decree of Seclusion in 1639.
    - Pressure to open Japan: When an American fleet led by Commodore Perry arrived in Uraga in 1853, Japan realized that it was technologically and militarily behind Western nations. Although initially baffled, the Shogunate, under external pressure, signed the Treaty of Amity between Japan and the U.S. in 1854, and gradually moved toward opening the country.
    - Internal schism: Opinions were divided between those who were open to adopting Western civilization and technology, and those who were opposed to interaction with foreign powers and who were for the Emperor's exclusion of the barbarians. The Shogunate itself was not sure how to respond.
    - Toward the End: The Shogunate's unstable handling of the situation led to growing discontent within the country and eventually to the Meiji Restoration of 1868. The new government adopted a policy of aggressively adopting Western civilization.
    - In general, during the second period, the regime was unable to respond consistently to the new Western civilization and was forced to make major changes due to internal and external pressures.

- Establishment of the school system: In 1872, the school system was promulgated, introducing a Western-style education system.
- Japan's Industrial Revolution: Late 19th to early 20th century, industrialization progressed and Western technology and knowledge were introduced.
- Cultural Westernization: Western art, fashion, architecture, etc. were introduced to Japan and developed in a uniquely Japanese way.
    - Backlash against civilization and enlightenment: After the Meiji Restoration, "civilization and enlightenment" was promoted to incorporate Western dress and culture, but many people opposed this.

- [[Protestant influence and development after the Meiji Restoration]]
- [[The ethics of Protestantism and the spirit of capitalism were not yet in place at the time of the Meiji Restoration.]]
- [[Establishment of Dejima in Nagasaki]]

- [[American Colonists and Puritans]]
Back to the story, I guess you could say that Christianity since the Meiji Restoration has been mainly Protestant, and that a reconciliation has occurred in the form of a strong non-interference in the faith, and a successful integration into society in the form of investment in modern infrastructure in the process of Japan's modernization.

Yes, that interpretation is generally accurate.

After the Meiji Restoration, Christianity once again found its way to spread in Japan, with Protestants taking the lead in missionary work. Many missionaries came to Japan from the U.S. and England, not only to evangelize Christianity but also to provide social services such as education and medical care.

In fact, many Christian-related schools, universities, and hospitals were established in Japan during the Meiji era. These institutions played an important role in the process of Japan's modernization and westernization. Aoyama Gakuin, Doshisha University, and Yokohama Medical College (now Yokohama City University), for example, are representative examples.

Through these activities, Christianity became actively involved in society as Japan modernized and was accepted by some Japanese as a source of new values and education. Therefore, Christianity after the Meiji Restoration can be positioned as an important element in the process of Japan's modernization, beyond mere religious teachings.
