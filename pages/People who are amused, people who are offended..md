title: "People who are amused, people who are offended."

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1875579198657659234) [[People who act with amusement]] and [[people who act with anger]] (in a sense of justice or in a gap between ideal and reality), both have in common that they are not driven by something like "[[the world's point of view]]". and [[those who act angrily]], both have in common that they are not driven by "the world's viewpoint.

I am overwhelmingly a "[[person]] who moves for the fun of it," but the "[[person]] who moves with anger" in [[anger-driven development]] is, well, understandable, and we have some things in common.
There is an incompatibility with "[[air-driven people]]" (people who internalize the idea of intersubjective existence and are driven by it, like a "group").
