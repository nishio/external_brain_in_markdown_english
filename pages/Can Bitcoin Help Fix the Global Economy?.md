A wide range of opinions exist regarding the impact of Bitcoin on the global economy, but it is difficult to determine its effects as "helpful" or "disturbing" in a blanket statement. While the characteristics of bitcoin and other virtual currencies open up new possibilities in the economic system, they also pose some challenges.

Useful Aspects
- Financial [[inclusiveness]] : Bitcoin can improve access to financial services because it is available to those who cannot afford a bank account.
- Remittance efficiency and cost savings: international remittances can be done faster and at a lower cost with bitcoin than through the traditional banking system, which has high fees.
- Transparency and Security: Blockchain technology makes transactions transparent, difficult to tamper with, and highly secure.

Obstructed sides
- Price volatility: The price of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies is extremely volatile, making it difficult for them to function as a reliable means of storing value in the economy.
- Lagging regulations and legislation: In many cases, regulations and legislation have not kept pace with the rapid spread of virtual currencies, pointing to the risk of them becoming a breeding ground for fraud and [[money laundering]].
- Environmental Impact: Bitcoin mining requires an enormous amount of electricity, and its environmental impact has been raised as an issue.

Ultimately, the impact of bitcoin on the global economy could vary greatly depending on its use, regulation, and even technological advancements. Currently, it will be important to properly understand bitcoin's potential and risks, and to promote appropriate regulatory and technological improvements. Whether or not bitcoin becomes a "hindrance" will depend on how the economic system and society surrounding it evolves and adapts.
