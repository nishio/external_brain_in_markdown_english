- 2  [[Summarize the state of the art]]
        - [[DP speeds up all searches]]
        - Speeding up the process by equating states
        - Conditions that can be summarized
            - Same destination state
            - The coefficients on the transitions are the same.
            - All of the summarized states either meet or do not meet the conditions of the problem statement.
        - [[ARC059F]]
        - [[codefestival_2016_final_F]]
        - [[AOJ2439]]
- 3  [[Change search order]]
    - 3.1  [[Sort in descending order of size]]
        - [[AOJ2333]]
    - 3.2  [[The permutation is insertion DP]]
        - When determining permutations in DP, it is necessary to keep track of "what has already been used".
            - If it is small, you can use [[bit DP]].
        - Instead of doing it in order, do it in ascending/descending order of what you put in.
    - 3.3  [[Section sorted by endpoint]]
- 4  [[Paraphrasing conditions]]
        - [[Many operations but few products.]]
- 5 Return from greedy
    - Find the number of columns that may be created by an operation" is difficult when the same column is created by multiple operation columns
    - It would be easier to count if there was a way to uniquely determine the operation sequence from the product.
- 6 Techniques for Case Segregation
    - Case by parameter
        - Be careful to DISJOINT
    - [[AGC013D]]
- 7  [[Decomposition into linear sums]]
    - It is similar to what I call [[change order of operations]].
        - [[Decompose bitwise operations into digits]]
- 8 [[subgroup]] techniques
        - [[Operation is reversible and the whole area → subgroup]]
        - [[Lagrange's theorem]]
    - Predicting the number of invariants
        - If it's even, it's likely to have even-odd invariants.
- 9 Use of recursive definitions
    - Works well with DP [[Recursive definition → DP]].
    - [[ARC037D]]
- 10 About [Digit DP
    - [[AOJ0570]]
- 11 Acceleration Techniques
    - 11.1 Using [cumulative sum
    - 11.2 Use of Data Structures
            - [[Fennic tree]]
    - 11.3 Array usage
    - 11.4  [[Fast Fourier Transform]]
        - [[NTT]]
    - 11.5  [[fast zeta transformation]]
        - Can be used for operations that satisfy the coupling and exchange laws
    - 11.6  [[Convolution of And and Add]]
            - Algorithm similar to [Fast Fourier Transform
    - 11.7 Simple branch trimming
- 12 Techniques with Matrices 26
    - 12.1  [[power of two]]
        - [[AGC013E]]
        - Power of the companion matrix
        - Power of polynomial
    - 12.2 Matrix Expression Techniques
            - [[matrix tree theorem]]
                - [[Number of trees in the whole area]]
            - [[LGV Official]]
                - [[Number of non-intersecting paths]]
        - [https://www.ioi-jp.org/camp/2017/2017-sp_camp-kumabe2.pdf](https://www.ioi-jp.org/camp/2017/2017-sp_camp-kumabe2.pdf)
- 13  [[Ignore small probabilities.]]  29
- 14 Binomial coefficient technique 30
    - 14.1 Collection of frequently used formulas
            - [[binomial coefficient formula]]
    - 14.2 Return to [Number of routes
        - Attributing binomial coefficients to the number of paths makes it easy to transform the equation
    - 14.3  [[45 degree rotation]]
            - [[divide into X and Y]]
    - 14.4  [[Catalan number]]
- 15  [[principle of inclusion]]  33
