title: "Open Source Drawing AI and Cameras"

2022-08-29
When the camera was born, it was a hard-looking black-and-white picture built over time. Most painters did not consider the camera their paintbrush.
Over time, the camera did not displace painting. It did, however, create a new branch of art and a new kind of artist: the photographer, not the painter. The camera is the tool with which that artist creates his work, the equivalent of a painter's paintbrush.
And I think the emergence of open source drawing AI is the same composition.

For most camera users, the camera is just something you point at the subject and press a button, and they are not interested in what's inside. For those types of people, a closed-source drawing service would make no difference.
I think that the open-source nature of image creation services is equivalent to the ability to change the lens on a camera, adjust the focus and aperture by yourself, or tweak the development parameters of a RAW file by yourself.
