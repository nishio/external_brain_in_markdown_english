- Polis" is a tool designed for better democracy. However, Nishio is more interested in "improving consensus building in small communities that I can influence," "its utility as a tool that provides opportunities for better thinking," and "improving my intellectual productivity" than in national politics. Therefore, we felt the need to further experience Polis and verbalize our ideas for achieving these goals.
- Not all of the opinions below are Nishio's opinions; half of them were generated by GPT-4. In fact, some of the opinions include those that Nishio voted against.
- You may vote anonymously. Once you have voted on all opinions, you may submit a new opinion. New opinions will be reviewed by Nishio and may be modified in wording or split into multiple opinions. At the appropriate time, we will end this experiment and move on to the next one.

- > [@lempiji](https://twitter.com/lempiji/status/1647449365706076160?s=20): On the other hand, the reality is that even if you can add questions later, if the participants are not involved or serious, they won't follow through, so it's a matter of how much you pack in at the beginning and So it's a matter of how much you pack in at the beginning and how carefully you select the questions. It seems to come down to "The difficulty of asking good questions" as they say.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1647452047850221627) GPT4 "Overall, from this discussion, participants agree that tools that respect different opinions and support good debate are useful. We also found that consistency of opinion is a demanding requirement for many."

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1647461043638276096/photo/1) I didn't do too well at instructing him to make a new opinion list based on past voting results, but handing him the list and saying, "Make a continuation." is pretty good.
- A human (Nishio) chews through the previous Polis' disagreement posts and makes a list, then throws it to GPT4 and says "make a continuation" style

When posting opinions, it would be nice to be able to add links to external sites to show context
I like the way the system encourages people to talk about why they voted the way they did, because it promotes language.
If people want to talk about why they voted, there should be a mechanism on Polis where they can talk about it easily.
An interface that displays many comments on a single opinion is not conducive to deepening discussion.
Polis should not have the ability to comment on opinions.
If you want to comment on opinions, you can use Scrapbox or other external tools that are good at forming context.
Being limited in the number of words prevents good intellectual production.
I like the system whereby votes accumulate credits and the credits are consumed when submitting an opinion.
I like the system of spending credits in proportion to the square of the length of the opinion when submitting an opinion.
I prefer to see the divided opinions first.
Participants should pay for the server to maintain a good discussion forum
The cost of maintaining a good discussion forum can be raised as a CPR or branding budget for the company as it is in the public interest to maintain and operate it
It's not a good idea for a for-profit company to try to get money to maintain a discussion forum by advertising its products.
For opinions you don't understand well, you should press the "I don't know" button.
The creation of the first seed opinion to be prepared should be assisted by an AI.
User submitted opinions should not be published as is, but should be broken down into simple components and posted by the administrator
Moderation of user-submitted opinions should not be done because of the possibility of moderator selection of opinions

Better to create more and more small Polis than to continue one Polis on a large scale for a long period of time
Polis topics should start out vague and gradually become clearer as you see what everyone has to say.
We need a mechanism to be aware of the birth of new Polis

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1647473624784465921): This is the second experiment. This time the topic will be clearer than last time and Nishio will play the role of moderator based on the topic. GPT-4 is also helping to run the event.

I'll make sure to comment on the report at the specific time this time.

- Surprisingly, the majority is fine with a word limit.
    - Many people asked for various additions to the previous experiment, but I wonder if many people felt the "value of being short" after one experience.

- The bottom four opinions that A is in violent opposition to C (and B)
- The "don't display random opinions, don't ask for credit for what you say, have commercial advertising" school of thought.

- B is not very distinctive.
