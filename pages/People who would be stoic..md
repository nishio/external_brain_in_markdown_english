title: "People who would be stoic."

From [/villagepump/stoicism/people-who-stoicize](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/stoicism/people-who-stoicize).
The first person to create a method created it by thinking, "How can I make it more [[raku]]?
- And yet [[I want to brag about how hard I'm working.]] People start doing [[stoic]] things.
- Those who see the activity and imitate it become "not easy, it's hard".
- I think the composition of the project is "I'm not sure. that

case
    - [[Intellectual production is not stoicism.]]
    - [[Pomodoro Technique breaks are not 5 minutes.]]
    - [[Buddha didn't tell us to suffer.]]

There are a lot of people who believe what the "braggarts" say without checking the original source.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- And then they imitate you, and then they can't do the same thing, and [[self-assurance]] goes down.
    - I don't think anyone would have a hard time doing the same and succeeding.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/Mijinko_SD/icon' alt='/villagepump/Mijinko_SD.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Some people can't admit "[[I am the one who can't do it.]]", so they force themselves to put up [[bluff]] and brag about being a "[[self-made man]]".
    - [[Boasting begets boasting.]] Structure arises.

I'm sure there's a reason other than bragging rights.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - [[Just a good effort to create an alibi.]]
- You're trying to get [[indulgence]] ([[alibi]] , a shield for [[excuse]]), "I made an [[effort]] and it didn't work, because I tried [it's not my fault.

- Object-oriented systems also started with the idea that "GUI implementation without objects would be difficult, but if we use this system, it will be easier", but before you know it, object-oriented [[ritualization]] has occurred and things have become strange.
