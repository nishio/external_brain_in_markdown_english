Bandwidth of human communication
- 1: Before the birth of language
- 2: Language was born a little thicker.
- 3: Writing was born
    - The biggest change is that humans can now communicate through written records without having to communicate directly with each other.
    - The bandwidth is written a bit thicker, but of course it means "for those who can read fluently"
        - A disparity was created between those who could read and those who couldn't.
        - Created a difference in reading and writing speed.
            - When people communicated by voice, they were disciplined by slow output.
            - Asynchronous communication has been created, allowing for more efficient input from the reader.
- 4: The amount of written text accumulated and increased as it did not disappear.
    - The invention of letterpress printing also encouraged
    - Libraries began to collect books and classify them systematically so that it was easy to find what you wanted.
    - Human "librarians" now help people find texts to read
- 5: Search engine appeared.
    - Now a non-human program can find the text to read.
    - Now available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week because it's not human.
    - The development of the Internet has made it possible to obtain reference materials from the comfort of your own home.
- 6: Emergence of LLM (current)
    - Instead of returning "already written" search results, they are now "generated" to meet the user's needs.
    - This has caused programmers using GPT-4 to "stop searching on Google" and "it is more efficient to ask GPT-4 first".
    - So human input efficiency has increased.
    - In the near future in fields other than programming, "humans will only use search engines directly for special applications.
- 7: Future
    - The search behind the AI now in 6 is a search engine born in 5
    - However, as the need for human use of search engines decreases, naturally "search engines optimized for AI searches" will be created.
    - Expressed it in the form of wider bandwidth between record and AI.

remarks
- This figure depicts the speed of human "input."
    - [[download bandwidth]]" so to speak.
    - Speed of output, upload bandwidth consumed digital bandwidth in the form of "talking video instead of text" format change
    - The speed itself hasn't changed much since the days of the primitive 2
