- The way we do things is changing, and it's confusing to look at past articles.
    - "Split keyboard"? We don't have that option.
    - When searching on Google, use the search tool to narrow your search to within a month!
- As of December 2019
    - Pinching in on the keyboard changes it to floating.
    - At this time, flick input is used when the keyboard type is "Japanese-Kana".
    - So, put "Japanese-Kana" in the keyboard settings.
        - I use "Japanese - Kana, English (American) - QWERTY, Simplified Chinese - Handwriting".
