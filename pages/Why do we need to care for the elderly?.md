> [Gabriero2](https://x.com/Gabriero2/status/1847975266456678887) In the course of my work, I have had the opportunity to listen to many high school students, and I was surprised by the number of [[anti-saro]] statements.

> [rougetgachihold](https://x.com/rougetgachihold/status/1847976169246994811) [[Generation Z]], there are many statements that honestly send a chill down my spine.
>  We, the older generation, argue that "[[the working-age burden]] is too heavy and should be lowered," but not a few of them seem to think, "Why do we need to care for the elderly in the first place?
>  By the time I am an old man, the [[social security]] problem will likely be finally solved.

> [NC_miyakoji](https://x.com/NC_miyakoji/status/1848725350437818862) That's right, the statement "The elderly should [[collectively commit suicide]]" will be praised... (whether it is good or bad).

> [owariday0zenbu](https://x.com/owariday0zenbu/status/1848312506827378948) Not a few people in Generation Z wonder why they need to take care of the elderly, and at the same time, I think there is a possibility that they think, "If I am going to be taken care of in the future, I want to die quickly, and I want a [[euthanasia]] system. I think there is a possibility that not a few people in Generation Z think "Why do I have to take care of the elderly?

> [rougetgachihold](https://x.com/rougetgachihold/status/1848847818729152875) I have received so many comments that it is difficult to respond anymore.
>  I have found that the younger generation is far more skeptical of the elderly and elderly social security than I expected.
>  I have a word I would like to give to the younger generation than myself.
>
>  "[[There are no rebels without reasons]]".

> [fudosanfudosan](https://x.com/fudosanfudosan/status/1848915470118003104) No wonder there are revolts even among the five publics...
>  It's no wonder, since the numbers have visualized that in the modern era, the exploiters are not the lords, but the elderly.

> [hikaki1998](https://x.com/hikaki1998/status/1849027256510976009) I think Machiavelli also said, "Only property should not be taken, and the other party will not forget their grudge."
>  Social Security is what breeds division and turns supposedly good people ruthless.
>  In other words, leave even life and death to the market.
