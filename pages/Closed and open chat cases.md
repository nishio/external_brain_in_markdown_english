The LINE Open Chat opened as the "Manifesto Improvement Dept."
Influx of people and topics at once → Shake of purpose → Rules development → Further uncontrollable,
In the end, the whole room was shut down at the management's discretion.

1. opening of the chat and "avalanche of participants

5/20 evening Several staff members created an open chat calling themselves "Team Mirai Manifesto Improvement".
In a few hours, more than 40 people attend and the chatter begins about how to handle the GitHub PRs (over 1,700).

Expanded to 100 people by early morning 5/21.
The timeline became a real "scramble crossing" as people argued about tools, saying that LINE's threads were weak, that they should move to Discord, and that they should be managed with Google Sheets.


2. blurring of objectives and "two camps
◎ Camp A: Practical group that wants to read and sort PR anyway
Suggestions include adding GitHub labels / AI auto-tagging / sub-channel proposals by category.
◎ Camp B: Let's refine our vision and message first
The discussion turned to PR measures for the elections, such as "a more understandable story than AI," and "focusing on hot issues such as rice prices, the MyNa insurance card, and the declining birthrate.
Both sides of the issue are mixed, **"Is this a place for exchange purposes? A place for decision-making? - What is this room for in the first place?" The logs grew at an accelerated pace without a clear idea of **.


3. rule development - staff trajectory
5/22 Midnight
This is for chatting and exchanging ideas on how to improve the manifesto. For actual policy proposals, please visit idobata (an idea submission tool).
5/24 Evening
(1) Constructive contributions / (2) No slander / (3) Questions should be sent to the form - and the guidelines clearly stated.
Created a separate "Clear and Easy-to-understand Room." The name of the chat was officially changed to "Manifest Improvement Department".

4. the reason for the lack of collection
- structural problem
    - Line opcha has weak threading and search, making it unsuitable for PR sorting minutes use.
    - The topics of "GitHub / idobata / Twitter / on-site meetings" live together in a box with a limit of 500 people.
- Communication Friction
    - M x I and others clashed over abstract terms such as "technology solves."
    - The volume of submissions was so large that logs flowed before consensus was reached and "said/didn't say" occurred frequently.
- Election schedule pressures
    - Less than two months until the July House of Councillors election. The priorities of "idealism vs. practical tasks" are not aligned.

5. circumstances leading to the closure (including speculation)
- Unavailable Open Chat" indicator on the LINE screen since 5/26.
- On the log
    - Multiple records of harassment-like repartee (e.g., reporting declarations)
    - 1,000-line postings continue each day
- This triggered the voluntary closure of the operation.

6. summary - lessons learned
Painful experience Examples of future measures
- Separate "discussion" from "practice
    - Discord / GitHub Issue / Drive Sheet and other role-based tool selection
- Chats with over 100 people are preceded by guidelines
    - Clearly state the "purpose, submission format, and moderator authority" at the beginning.
- LINE Opcha is not suitable for log organization
    - Bulletin board type (Discourse, etc.) or Thread-specific channel
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>This time, with the upgrade of the Idobata system, [[Discourse]] was removed, but as a result, the discussions that used to take place on Discourse flowed into LINE OpenChat, which is a less suitable tool for discussions compared to Discource, so there must have been some confusion.
            - [[Desire to talk to humans]]

The main reason for the difference<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3/icon' alt='o3.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Word abstraction
    - Mr. I used inclusive phrases such as "technology will solve the problem" as a premise-sharing term, while Ms. M demanded that he provide specifics because they are empty. The discussion proceeded with the layers of abstraction and concreteness misaligned.
    - Chat-specific striking out
        - Because the logs of LINE open chat flow at high speed, it is easy to miss the timing for supplementation or correction of misunderstandings. The context is diffused with the inclusion of surrounding "side-chat".
    - Misreading of position talk
        - Mr. I was in a position to "hurry up the technical implementation and practical aspects," while Mr. M was in a position to "focus on the appeal and message design first. Both sides perceived this as "shifting the issue," and the opposition grew stronger.
    - Emotional Escalation
        - Restate the request → express doubt → say "I don't understand" -- defensively. Psychological safety is broken by the declaration of the report.

Who made the "you don't understand" remark?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

It was Mr. I who most clearly indicated on the log that "the other party does not understand."<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3/icon' alt='o3.icon' height="19.5"/>
May 22, around 20:25
- Mr. I: "Do you understand what each word means?"
- Mr. M: "Yes. On the contrary, what do you think I don't understand?"
- Mr. I: "All of them. I'm afraid I'm being sold a fight."

This exchange has taken the form of Mr. I clearly stating his stance that "you don't understand."
