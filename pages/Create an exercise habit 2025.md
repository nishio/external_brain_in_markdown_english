title: "Create an exercise habit 2025"
---

physical examination
- 'Do you walk at least 30 minutes a day, at least 3 days a week?' No.
- 'Do you do strength training two or three days a week?' No.
- You don't get enough exercise." "Yes, I do."
- I think I'm doing more than I thought when you add it all up, but I can't confidently say "I'm doing it! I can't say with confidence that I'm doing it, but that's not good enough.

[[InBody]]
- Stable in an obese state because of lack of exercise.
- We need to get into the habit of exercising and aim for a gradual reduction.
- I want to be able to confidently answer "yes" instead of "no" to the question of whether I exercise on next year's health checkup questionnaire.

Not very good at taking diligent action and not very good at keeping track of it
- iPhone or other devices that record on their own.
    - number of steps
- Maybe I shouldn't have been wearing my Apple Watch lately.
    - Proposal to buy a new Apple Watch or [Aura Ring

Pokémon Go Route
- 950 m course around the house, about 10 minutes walking, 15 minutes with a buffer of work.
- Find out how many steps this is.
    - About 1,500 to 2,000 steps?
    - I'm thinking 6 laps for an hour, 6km, about 10,000 steps. I'll try to do it when I feel like it.
    - Roughly the same order to the station, and when I was going to work, that meant I did about four sets every day, including walking to work for lunch.
- This is rewarded for 7 consecutive days of achievement.

Nishio, the trick is to fix it small and visualize it. Turn it around with the least amount of structure.

Three Principles
- Very small: from a size that can be done with zero motivation (5-10 minutes of walking, 5 chair squats).
- Fixation: start each day with the same trigger (e.g., after lunch = shoes on -> 10 minutes around the house).
- Visualization & Reward: Circle and cross on the calendar and a small reward for achieving 7 times.

Shortest route of 4 weeks
1-2 per week (ignition)
- Walking: 10 minutes after lunch (if it's raining, step up and down indoors or on the spot footsteps).
- Strength training (2 per week):
8 chair squats / 8 wall push-ups / 8 hip lifts x 2 laps (5 minutes total).
Approximate intensity: a slight increase in breath (RPE 5/10).
- Visualization: ○ for implemented days, - for not implemented; target 5 out of 7 days.
3-4 per week (established)
- Walking: 15-20 minutes or 7,000 steps/day (split OK).
- Strength training (2-3 per week): 10-12 x 2-3 sets of the three types above; 20-30 seconds of plank can be added.
- Rest: Do not take two consecutive days off (do not break the chain).
After 5 weeks (standard)
- Approximate: 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity + 2 strength-training sessions per week; on days when the mood strikes, increase the load slightly by walking uphill or at a faster pace.

Structured (not relying on motivation)
- Environment: Sneakers left out in the entryway/exercise t-shirts on top.
- Alternative plan: on busy days **"1 minute "** (10 chair squats + 10 wall pushups).
- If-Then plan (copy and paste to use)
    - If you finish your lunch, put on your shoes at the entrance and walk for 10 minutes.
    - If it's raining, then 1 round trip up the stairs x 5 minutes (or footsteps on the spot).
    - If I don't make it at night, then I'll just do 10 chair squats and go to bed.

Injury Prevention and Safety
- Warm up by walking slowly for the first minute or two. If pain occurs, stop.
- Consult a physician before starting if you have chest pain, severe shortness of breath, dizziness, or pre-existing medical conditions.
- The first priority for weight is to make exercise a habit (food can be fine-tuned later).

Today's 3 moves
1. now put the sneakers out in the doorway.
2. schedule a 10-minute walk after lunch tomorrow on your calendar.
3. do 5 wall push-ups before bed and "mark the start".
If needed, I can set reminders for a "10 minute walk" at 12:30 daily and a "5 minute strength training" on Tuesdays and Fridays. Do you want to make it?

Understand. Let's design on the premise that "I'm not good at making a habit. The goal is not "exercise itself," but rather to not zero in on it every day.

Minimum rule (fixed for 2 weeks, no increase)
1. action: 1 chair squat (10 seconds) after brushing teeth.
2. trigger: start the moment the toothbrush is placed.
3. record: circle on the calendar when finished, - when not done. 4 out of 7 days passed.
Do not add to the motivation (remain at "one time" for 2 weeks). This is a period of time for the success experience to etch itself into your brain.

7-day reboot
- Daily: only one time above.
- Option only on days when you can (optional): walk on the spot footsteps for 30 seconds or 5 minutes.
- The goal is not consecutive, but total (4/7) - no problem if consecutive runs run out.

Emergency procedures" on a day with zero motivation: 30 seconds
- Stand up → 1 chair squat → circle and finish.
- This tells the brain that the chain is not broken.

Common mistakes → Countermeasures
- Trigger is ambiguous -> fixed after brushing teeth (connected to an action that is always present every day).
- Preparation is a hassle→You can leave your normal clothes on, no tools required.
- Perfectionism → Record only "○ or -". Do not record time and frequency.
- Guilt of skipping work → resume normally the next day (no punitive games).

Environment and Visualization
- Small sticky note "Suk 1" on the toothbrush cup. Turn it over when you are done.
- Put a 7 x 2 week square on the refrigerator (X/- only).
- Reward for achieving 2 weeks (small ones are OK).

How to stretch after 2 weeks (just one)
- Chair squats 1 time to 3 times (others remain unchanged). Only +2 times every 2 weeks thereafter.
If necessary, you can create a nightly reminder at 9:30 p.m., "Did you finish Sukuk 1 today?" reminder at 21:30 every night if needed. Do you want to make it?
