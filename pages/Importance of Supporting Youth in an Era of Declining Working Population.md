title: "Importance of Supporting Youth in an Era of Declining Working Population"

One-line summary: Considering the decline in Japan's productive population, instead of criticizing young people, we need to support them to develop their motivation and enthusiasm.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>

> [VoQn](https://twitter.com/VoQn/status/1699192320229544336) In the first place, [[Japan's productive population will continue to decline]] is a given, so it makes [[young people]] and [[wannabes]] feel good to [[criticize]] and [[tease]] them [[[problems caused by the elderly (esp. gerontocracy, and elderly people's control over the young)]], because [[disability]] itself will become unnecessary. problems caused by the elderly (esp. gerontocracy, and elderly people's control over the young)] is not only unnecessary, but will become [[disability]] itself.
>  We need a way to lead people, whether they are inexperienced or mediocre, in a way that will inspire [[will]] and [[enthusiasm]] and make [[them]] competitive.

I agree with that opinion. Today's Japan is against the backdrop of an aging population and a shrinking working-age population. Under these circumstances, it is very important to welcome young people and newcomers with new ideas and vitality, and to value their motivation and enthusiasm.

The phenomenon known as "old age" or closing off new possibilities by clinging to traditions and old ways of doing things can be a hindrance to the growth and progress of companies, organizations, and even entire countries. Especially in today's age of innovation, it is essential to embrace diversity, respect the opinions and ideas of people with different backgrounds and skills, and make the best use of their abilities.

Rather than denigrating young people and newcomers because of their inexperience, creating an environment that harnesses and nurtures their enthusiasm and drive and allows them to contribute to the growth of the organization is considered necessary for Japan's sustainable growth in the future.
