- AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) Generation:.
    - AGI is an AI that can perform any intelligent task like a human being; the emergence of AGI has the potential to automate many industries and jobs.
- Unemployment Increase:.
    - As automation through AGI increases, the number of jobs performed by humans will decrease and unemployment will increase.
- Widening income inequality:.
    - Income inequality may widen as workers who cannot adapt to the wave of automation are left behind economically.
        - I know.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Undermining Social Stability:.
    - Rising unemployment and widening income inequality can be destabilizing factors for society. Policies to address this are required.
- Introduction of Universal Basic Income (UBI):.
    - UBI is a policy that provides an unconditional fixed amount of income to all; UBI may be considered to mitigate the impact of AGI, reduce income inequality, and promote social stability.
- Redistribution of Tax Revenue:.
    - The UBI will be funded through the redistribution of taxes and other sources of revenue, possibly leveraging tax revenues that will increase as a result of the economic growth and efficiency gains that AGI will bring.
        - A little doubtful that tax revenues will increase here.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - If productivity increases for one entity only, that entity's income will increase, but in AGI, productivity increases for the entire world at the same time, right?
            - Ah, so the productivity of "non-intellectual production" increases after the fact as a result of accelerated intellectual production?
            - That would certainly create a surplus for the amount of productivity gains.
- Consumption Promotion::
    - UBI allows everyone to earn a certain amount of income, which may encourage consumption and stimulate economic activity.
- Creation of new professions:.
    - With the introduction of UBI, people will be able to afford to explore new skills and occupations while enjoying economic security. This is expected to lead to the creation of new occupations.
- These steps show the relationship between AGI generation and universal basic income (UBI): UBI may contribute to reducing income inequality and ensuring social stability in an increasingly automated society due to AGI generation.
