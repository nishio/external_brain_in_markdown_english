- Sequential paths are a means of [[unidimensionalization]] in a [[two dimensional arrangement]].
- Placement is two-dimensional.
- Humans can only recognize [one dimensional
- So we'll set up a sequential route.
    - That's also the purpose of [One-dimensional text

- When slides are made into stickies, generate the sequential order according to the order in the original PDF
    - That way you can have a sliding display.
    - Order in original PDF = [[local context]].
        - [[Preserving Local Context]]
