It's going to be another level of abstraction from the title.

- (A) [[try to create a system that is]] [one against many
        - [[core]] X points [[arrow (mark or symbol)]] R to [object
- (B) However, from the point of view of others, X is an object, so [[a system that Rs to an object should first R]].
- (C) If there is no constraint that guarantees that subject X is one, then when X looks like it will succeed, a similar Y is born and they become [[mutually R-relationship]].

- The [[evaluation system]] is also [[evaluated]].
The system to be [[R is also R]].
