Thoughts on [o1 Pro
> [fukkyy](https://x.com/fukkyy/status/1865578912459485210) o1 pro, when I consult with it on management strategy, it is not only generally correct, but it even picks up on issues that I had overlooked. I think we need to change the workflow to have AI review the strategy and analysis first.
