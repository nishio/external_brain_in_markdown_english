This week, we proceeded with operational improvements to AI task management, digital democracy-related adjustments, and technical experiments. With the increase in information channels, the need for organization was strongly felt during the week.

1. work/project related
- AI and Intellectual Productivity
    - Devin.ai's look back article writing
        - Wrote the article: "[[How to Melt 40,000 in Devin]].
            - He reaffirmed that the introduction of AI tools involves significant risk due to the level of knowledge of the users.
    - Revisiting AI Task Management
        - Parallel processing problem: The problem of "the intention to reduce the task burden increases inversely" occurs.
        - Temporary solution: Tried a method whereby short-term tasks are managed in a notepad and entered into AI at night.
    - Alexa Custom Skill Creation
        - First [[Alexa Skills]] development (Hello World level).
- Plurality / Digital Democracy
    - Cybozu SmartNews Coalition Conference
        - Plurality book was published by Cybozu Shiki Books in May.
        - Audrey Tang and Glen Weyl are scheduled to visit Japan.
        - Adjust the direction of event planning (policy to involve a wide range of stakeholders rather than holding the event independently).
- Preparation of lab debriefing materials
        - [[Advances in AI and Plurality]] <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

2. technical experiments and considerations
- Survey on DeepSeek
    - Research the background of the founder.
    - Tested a summary script utilizing DeepSeek (60 pages of progress).
- Polis and [[Community Notes]] code reading
    - Analysis utilizing Devin and O1 Pro.
- Increased number of information channels and organization challenges
    - Connect with the author of [[Polis]] at [[Signal]].
    - The burden of information management has increased, and the need for an organizational structure has been reaffirmed.

3. organization of life and thought
- Walking experiments
    - Walking around without connecting with the AI confirms that the thought process is more organized.
    - Reaffirming the importance of "do nothing" time.
- Uncovering Distraction Problems
    - Tend to get distracted by notifications and interrupt tasks.
    - Conscious time must be set aside to organize information.
- Smart Speaker Issues
    - [[Google Home]] is not working well, so we are considering replacing it.
    - [[Alexa Echo Pop]]を買った<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

4. next action
- Further improvement of AI task management
    - Verify current notepad + AI input operations at night.
- Optimization of information management
    - Consideration of measures to deal with increased information channels.
- Use of walking and thought organization
    - Improve work efficiency by being aware of "time to be empty.

This week was spent exploring the increasing burden of information management and how to deal with it. Next week, through experimental operations, we will explore and improve which methods are best suited.

- Since it is based on regular reports, I know enough to explain things that don't need to be explained, don't I?

## comparison and discussion
.

### 1. common
.
- AI Task Management and Devin's Use of AI Task Management.
    - Both weeks were trial and error in the operation of AI task management.
    - It includes reflections on the use of Devin and its problems.
    - A week ago, the theme was the closing of the "Meeting to See Devin", but this week the focus shifted to "Devin's Going Private & Transitioning to a System".

- Digital democracy related activities.
    - Last week: From watching a film about the Sunflower Student Movement in Taiwan, I was reminded of the difficulty of social change.
    - This week: Plurality book publication and event planning underway.
    - The ongoing interest in digital democracy is developing into a concrete project.

- Recognition of information management issues.
    - Last week: "There are too many information channels and it is difficult to organize them.
    - This week: connected with the author of Polis via Signal and identified additional information channels as a challenge.
    - The need for AI-based information management is becoming more apparent.

### 2. Distinctive changes this week
.
- Organize specific task management and priorities.
    - This week we made progress in clarifying and prioritizing our short, medium and long term strategies.
    - Last week's review showed that "tasks were in a state of confusion," but this week "priority handling of deadline-based tasks" and "starting the MVID data set analysis" were organized.
        - No, it's not organized, we haven't started w<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

- Decreased trial of new technologies.
    - Last week was marked by trials of new tools and workflows, such as the DeepSeek-R1 test, non-destructive book scanning, and J-Moshi's voice recognition memos.
    - I have the impression that there have been few trials of new technologies this week, other than Alexa skill development, and the focus has been on task management and project organization.
    - Or, to be more accurate, the deadline for next Wednesday is approaching and that's taking precedence.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - It's a phenomenon that when a deadline approaches, the urgency of the task makes the priority of the task clearer, so there's less hesitation.

- Continued use of walking and organizing thoughts.
    - Last week: "Looking back while talking to AI" experiment.
    - This week: an attempt to "reaffirm the importance of time to do nothing" and organize thoughts by walking without connecting with AI evolved.

### 3. Areas for Improvement and Future Prospects
.
- Systematization of information organization and management.
    - To reduce the burden caused by the increase in information channels, a mechanism for automatic organization using AI should be considered.
    - Automation to "extract, organize, and summarize important information" from Devin and O1 Pro logs may be useful.

- Automate and reduce the burden of task management.
    - The operation to separate short-term tasks from long-term tasks has begun, but it is necessary to verify to what extent the flow of inputting all tasks together at night into the AI will work.
    - After Devin's environment is organized, a phase of more advanced task management automation will begin.

- Balance between use of new technology and existing tasks.
    - Last week was spent trying out new technologies, and this week is focused on organizing tasks.
    - In the future, it would be good to consider a balance between utilizing new technologies and organizing existing tasks in parallel.

- Conclusion
This week was a major step forward in task management and information organization. Improvements have been made based on last week's review, and especially important progress has been made in organizing short-, mid-, and long-term strategies.
From next week onward, based on this organization, the key will be to focus on "optimizing information management" and "automating task management," while also moderately incorporating the use of new technologies.


<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>  You are the AI manager. Next, I will give you the manual, the backlog, and this week's review. Read them all, discuss them, and suggest updates to the backlog in jsonpatch format. You may offer a different opinion since the recap is written by an AI that is not smarter than you.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>
The following is a proposed update based on a close examination of the entire backlog.
Point Summary
- T0103 ("Writing a story about melting money in Devin") is "written" in the look back, so it is set to Done and the completion date is added.
- T0100 ("Procedures at 7-Eleven for Mynah Insurance Card") was moved to Closed because it is a duplicate of T0112 ("On your next visit to 7-Eleven -"). Add a note to the description stating that it is a duplicate.
- Two new tasks added from this week's review: new operations ("Notepad + AI input at night") and "Measures to deal with increased information channels".

(PATCH is omitted <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>)
- [[jsonpatch didn't work.]]
