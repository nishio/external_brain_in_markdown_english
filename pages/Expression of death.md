    - Went to Hiroshima to buy cigarettes = "died."
    - I didn't know this.

    - I heard that the original phrase was "I'm going to Hiroshima," and later the phrase "I'm going to Hiroshima to buy cigarettes" was created because it was confused with the actual Hiroshima.
- Go westward = "die."

    - Data shows that "silent homecoming" came into use in the postwar press.
