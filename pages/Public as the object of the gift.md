- [[Public]] as an object of [[donation]]

In "[[A Flexible Design for Funding Public Goods]]," a design is proposed to provide a decentralized, self-organizing ecosystem of public goods. The concept is for individual people to make donations to public goods projects that are of value to them. This design is said to optimize the provision of public goods.

In "[[Quadratic Payments: A Primer]]," a contrast is made between public and private goods. It is stated that public goods cannot be decomposed into individual decisions because they have the characteristic of a large number of recipients.

In "[[Donations to public institutions]]," it is pointed out that there is a big difference in the amount of donations to public institutions between Japan and the United States.

### Digest of Research Notes
.

My last research note was on "publics as objects of giving" and I saw a connection to some of Nishio's research notes.

A Flexible Design for Funding Public Goods" proposes a design for providing a decentralized, self-organizing ecosystem of public goods. The concept is for individual people to donate public goods to projects that are of value to them. This design is said to optimize the provision of public goods.

In Quadratic Payments: A Primer, a contrast is made between public and private goods. It is stated that public goods cannot be broken down into individual decisions because they have the characteristic of a large number of recipients.

Donations to Public Organizations" discusses donations to public organizations. It is noted that there is a big difference in the amount of donations between Japan and the United States.

These research notes allowed us to think deeply about the importance of donations and funding for public goods and how this affects individual decision making.
