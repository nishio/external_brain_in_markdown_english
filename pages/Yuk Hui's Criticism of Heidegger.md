Yuk Hui's Criticism of Heidegger
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>
1. response to Heidegger's critique of technology
Heidegger criticized the attitude of treating modern technology as "[[a]] forgetting of existence" or "[[a]] provocative standing out" ([[Ge-stell]]) and nature and existence as [[resources]] ([[Bestand]]). Yuk Hui, in contrast, points out the limitations of viewing technology as merely negative.

(1) Positive revaluation of technology
While criticizing modern technology, Heidegger suggested that we should return to the "technē" of ancient Greece.
Yuk Hui argues that instead of simply criticizing the evolution of modern technology, we need to construct a new technological ontology and rethink technology as a positive possibility.
E.g.: Consider the potential of digital technology and AI not as mere tools or means of control, but as a search for a new relationship with the universe and existence.

(2) New harmony between technology and existence
While Heidegger emphasized the danger of technology "resourceizing" nature, Yuk Hui believes that modern technology also has the potential to harmonize with nature and the universe in new ways.
He explores ways for humans to re-establish a new relationship with the universe through technology.

2. point to the "diversity of technology" of Yuk Hui
(1) Criticism of the universality of Heidegger's view of technology
He points out that Heidegger's critique of technology is based on the Western technological tradition and does not adequately take into account the technological practices and ideas of other cultures.
Example: Lack of multicultural understanding of technology, including Chinese and East Asian views of technology ("Dao" in Taoism and "Rei" in Confucianism).
Yuk Hui emphasizes "technological diversity" based on the history and cultural background of technology, and proposes a pluralistic philosophy of technology rather than a universal critique of technology.

(2) Cosmo Technics Proposal
Yuk Hui proposes the concept of "cosmotechnics," which liberates technology from an anthropocentric perspective and views it in relation to the entire universe (cosmos).
This goes beyond Heidegger's critique of technology to explore new possibilities for technology to be in harmony with the cosmic and natural order.

3. criticism of Heidegger's "return to antiquity
(1) Heidegger's "Greek-centrism".
Heidegger proposed a return to the ancient Greek "technē" or primordial disclosure of existence as the key to solving the problem of technology.
Yuk Hui believes this is overly Greek-centric and inadequate for the conditions of modern society and technology.

(2) Neglect of modern technical conditions
While Heidegger took a negative view of modern technology and oriented himself toward a return to the past, Yuk Hui argues that we should consider the evolution of modern technology (especially digitalization and artificial intelligence) and not only criticize it, but also construct a new philosophy that is appropriate to the modern context.

4. perspectives on temporality and recursion
(1) Limitations of Heidegger's view of time
Heidegger's ontology emphasized "historicity" and viewed time as linear and a continuity from past to present.
Yuk Hui focuses on the new "nonlinearity of time" or "recursion" brought about by digital technology, which, he argues, offers new possibilities for understanding existence.

(2) Importance of recency
Yuk Hui sees "[[recursivity]]" (the process of self-reflection and self-adjustment) as a core characteristic of technology and presents it as an important alternative perspective to Heidegger's "[[disclosure of being]]."

5. conversion to a practical philosophy
(1) Overcoming Heidegger's abstraction
He points out that Heidegger's theory of technology is abstract and does not offer practical solutions to the concrete challenges of modern technology and society.
Yuk Hui seeks to provide a concrete framework that makes the philosophy of technology responsive to contemporary challenges (climate change, artificial intelligence, digital society).

(2) Integration of technology and ethics
Yuk Hui states that Heidegger's critique of technology lacks an ethical perspective and seeks a new framework that links technology and ethics.

6. proposal of Yuk Hui: beyond Heidegger
Rather than rejecting Heidegger, Yuk Hui proposes "cosmotechnics" in a way that extends his framework and adapts it to contemporary technological conditions.

Pluralistic philosophy of technology
Emphasis is placed on the history and cultural background of technology to create a universal view of technology that is not limited to any particular civilization or region.
Technology and the Reconciliation of the Universe:.
He proposes a new philosophy to bring technology back into harmony with nature and the cosmic order.

7. conclusion
While taking Heidegger's philosophy of technology as an important starting point, Yuk Hui points out its limitations, particularly criticizing its lack of cultural diversity and lack of adaptation to modern technology. He then proposes a new philosophy of "cosmotechnics," which reconstructs technology from a "cosmic perspective," and seeks to harmonize modern technology with man and nature. In doing so, he seeks to go beyond Heidegger's philosophy and redefine the significance of technology in modern society.
