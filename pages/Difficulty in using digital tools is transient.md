> [masui](https://x.com/masui/status/1817137349647827150) If you just say "Nami" on a terminal at a gyudon restaurant, the restaurant will confirm that it is the same size as a beef bowl, and you should be able to order the same size as a beef bowl. and you should be able to order with the same hassle as before, so the [[difficulty]] of the current terminals is [[transitional]].
