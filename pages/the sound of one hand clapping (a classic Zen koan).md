>  [[(with) both hands]] when struck together makes a sound, but what sound does [[one hand]] have?

> The sound of one hand clapping (a classic Zen koan) is one of the representative [[koans]] of [[Zen (Buddhism)]], created by [[Hakuon Haku]] (1686-1769). One of the most representative [[koan]] of [[Zen (Buddhism)]]. [Voice of the vessels - Wikipedia](https://ja.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/隻手の声)
- > The koan that [[Veitch's silver fir (Abies veitchii)]] worked on for [["Does a dog have Buddha nature?" (classic Zen koan)]] was used as an alternative koan, as it was easier to get a suspect than a dog.
- > "There is a voice in both palms, and what kind of voice is in one hand? What kind of voice do you hear in your hands?
- >  ("When you strike both hands together, you hear a sound, but what sound does one hand make? Report it.") means "Report it. "[[sophistication (e.g., of writing style)]]" means to submit an answer to a koan.)
    - [[Veitch's silver fir (Abies veitchii)]]

### [[Nu Zi Buddha nature]]
[Nguko Buddha nature - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/狗子仏性)
> GuZhiBuddhism is one of the typical [[koan]] of [[Zen (Buddhism)]].
> On one occasion, one of his disciples, a monk, asked Zhao Zhou, "Do dogs have Buddha nature or not?" Zhao Zhou replied, "None."

### [[Nansen zan cat]]
[https://www.weblio.jp/content/南泉斬猫](https://www.weblio.jp/content/南泉斬猫)
> Famous koan of Zen Buddhism. When the disciples of Nanquan Pugan (748-834) were arguing in China about the Buddha nature (Buddha's seed) of cats, Nanquan taught them to slay the cat to sever the root of the conflict. When Nanquan asked him about it, Zhaozhou put his sandals on his head and left. Nanquan said, "If you had been there, the cat would not have been killed.

- The conclusion is: "Do cats have Buddha nature? No? It is.[[False dichotomy]] だ！」ってことだと思ってる<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Don't kill the cat for the sake of saying that much! (aside)
    - The subsequent "he left with sandals on his head" was followed by "Does the cat have Buddha nature? Or not? It's like sandals right and left".
        - That "conflict is not inherently present, but is found by humans, and disappears when viewed differently."
        - Nansen killed the cat because he wanted to eliminate the conflict by eliminating the "existence of the cat.
    - I think [[the sound of one hand clapping (a classic Zen koan)]] would be more direct and clear regarding this sensation.
        - Do cats have Buddha nature? Does the cat have Buddha nature or not? That's like asking which hand made the sound when you clapped your hands together."
