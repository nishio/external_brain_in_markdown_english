title: "Strategic Profile"
---



[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_(game_theory)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_(game_theory))
> A strategy profile (sometimes called a strategy combination) is a set of strategies for all players which fully specifies all actions in a game. A strategy profile must include one and only one strategy for every player, as to respond in the best and most rational way to the decisions made by other players.

- [[Strategy is not a start.]]
> The strategy concept is sometimes (wrongly) confused with that of a move. A move is an action taken by a player at some point during the play of a game (e.g., in chess, moving white's Bishop a2 to b3). A strategy on the other hand is a complete algorithm for playing the game, telling a player what to do for every possible situation throughout the game. It is helpful to think about a "strategy" as a list of directions, and a "move" as a single turn on the list of directions itself.
