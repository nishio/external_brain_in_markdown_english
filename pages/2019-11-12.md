Transcription of a recording made with [[Tomoya Tachikawa]] on [[2019-11-12]] while taking a walk in Ueno Onshi Park, made into [[Have Claude 3 Opus summarize]] on 2024-03-15.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Claude/icon' alt='Claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The following is a summary of the conversation between Nishio and Tachikawa.

- We discussed [[the importance of subjectivity]] and came to the conclusion that [[subjectivity is more valuable than objectivity]].
    - Subjectivity is factually correct and essential to creating [[empathy]].

    - Discussion of the differences in worldviews of those with high [[self-assurance]] and those with low [[self-assurance]].
    - People with low self-esteem live under the assumption that there are people to be denied and people to be affirmed.
    - On the other hand, people with high self-esteem do not make such a distinction.

- In intellectual production activities, it is more productive to think in dialogue with someone than to think alone.
    - Mr. Nishio facilitates and converges well with Mr. Tachikawa's divergent thoughts.

- [[The act of thinking]] is to [[organize the observed events so that there are no contradictions]]. This requires an abundance of pet theories.

- Intellectual production activities, which were once thought to be the exclusive domain of humans, may in the future be left to AI.
    - Wikipedia and Google are sufficient substitutes for [[knowledge accumulation]].
    - The act of thinking will also be implemented sequentially from areas where AI excels.

- Discussed the possibility of [[slide generation by AI]].
    - This may be achieved by using data from past slides to connect highly similar content while appropriately selecting axes to be crushed.

As mentioned above, there was a thought-provoking discussion on the importance of subjectivity, the role of pet theory, and the potential of AI for intellectual production. We felt that many insights were generated from the lively dialogue between the two of them.
