- There are people who disagree with some person x or some opinion x
- Unconsciously equate the opinions of "the people."
    - Misinterpret "people" as if they were one person.
            - [[The bug that sees multiple people as one person]]
    - I know it in my head. Do you think you are one person?" I say no if you ask me.

    - [[overgeneralize]] some of the "people."
- The assertion that "those who disagree are xx" is "[[the subject is]] large."
