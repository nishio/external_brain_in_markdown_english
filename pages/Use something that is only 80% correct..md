title: "Use something that is only 80% correct."
---

Seek to be 100% right and choose the 95% correct option.
Assume you're 100% right and 5% wrong.
I can't correct it because I think it's right.

Use what is 80% correct with the understanding that it is only 80% correct.
Use twice when you need precision, if you're 80% right twice and the results are the same, you're 94% right.
If the results are different, you know it's [[uncertainty]] high
