title: "Social Triggers and Approval Dependence"
---

It is an observed fact that the situation where "a lot of people like what you say" or "a lot of people are talking about you when you ego search" easily drives people crazy ([[approval-dependent]], coined term), but I feel that finding references to the output of one's thoughts ([[Social Triggers]]) is beneficial for developing thinking, and I wondered if I could take it one step further aufheben.

suggestion
    - [[Pleasing the masses is evil.]]
    - [[place for storing bicycles]]

When you work hard to tweet a blog post about something technically interesting and get no response at all, and then you see a silly story you wrote about a pop-up that's no big deal often get a lot of traction, you develop a kind of [[Resignation toward Humanity]].

suggestion
    - [[Buddhist service for the anniversary of the death of Shotoku Taishi (orig. the 22nd day of the 2nd month of the lunar calendar)]]

In other words, it is a state of [[it is natural that there is no reaction]] to what you write. It is natural that there is no reaction to what one writes because even Buddha did so, [[it is]] hubris to think that there should be a reaction, or an infantile sense that "it is natural that the people around me pay attention to me.
- Rare is the reaction, it is valuable because it is rare. (Really? Need to be reviewed)
If, on the other hand, the masses reacted, then it was a failure of something, evil in the sense of [[Pleasing the masses is evil.]] or that the theme was as trivial as the color of the roof of [[place for storing bicycles]].
- It must be avoided (really?). Need to be examined)

Is it OK if there are a very small number of people who produce something interesting to me and I "follow" them in the Twitter sense?
- That doesn't justify [[ego search]].
