title: "Effect of retaining 10 members"
---

I wasn't sure myself, so I asked ChatGPT (I was not a good question, but ChatGPT o3 pumped me and kindly told me w)

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Explain how having 10 members in Japan will affect [[party subsidy]].

## Rough Conclusion
- "Putting up 10 candidates" alone does not pay a penny for a political party.
- The 10-member list is a condition for being treated as a "[[deemed party]]" under the Public Election Law, and for obtaining "advantages in election operations," such as being able to produce a [[proportional list]].
- To receive a grant, you must meet the following [[requirements of the Political Party Subsidy Law]].
    1. have at least 5 members of the National Assembly, or
    2. elect at least one Diet member and obtain at least 2 % of the valid votes cast in the most recent general election for the House of Representatives or the most recent or previous regular election for the House of Councillors.
- => The 10-person race is only a means to an end, to build a base for one winner and 2% of the vote.

## Specific effects of retaining 10 people
.
_
| Item Whether or not 10 people are retained Impact |
| -- |
| Submission of proportional representation list: 10 or more acceptable Failure to submit list makes it difficult to reach 2 % of the national proportional list |
| Number of political broadcasts and leaflets Full slots as a "political party" Less exposure than as an independent |
| Grant requirement Not directly fulfilled If the election +2 % is achieved, the grant will be paid from April of the following year. |

## How much if a grant is given?
- The total amount of subsidy is fixed at 250 yen per capita x population = approx. 31.5 billion yen/year.
- The distribution is 50 % by number of seats + 50 % by number of votes cast.

### Example of a typical small political party
.
_
| Party (2025) Seats Vote share* Grant amount |
| -- |
| Upper house 1 lower house + 0 upper house Approx. 1.7 % Approx. 520 million yen |
| Association for Realization of Free Education (first year) 1衆 approx. 1.0 % approx. 120 million yen |
*Vote ratio is a weighted average used in the grant (lower house primary + proportional, upper house twice)

>  simulation.
>  *If you have 10 candidates and get 2 % of the proportional vote, and one of them is elected proportionally*.
>
>  * Share of seats: approx. 0.14 % → approx.
>  * Vote share: 2 % → approx. 310 million yen
>  → roughly 300 million yen per year in total (one level below the Upper House in terms of scale)

## Practical points to keep in mind
.
- 1.The key is how to get proportional votes.
    - 2 % is almost impossible to achieve only in the electoral districts. In anticipation of submitting a proportional list, 10 people will be retained.
- 2.Design that always produces one winner.
    - The grant requirement cannot be met by "zero legislators + 2 % of the vote".
- 3.The record date is January 1 of each year.
    - If the requirements are met as of January 1, the funds are transferred in installments in April, July, October, and December.
- 4.Even if the number of councilors is reduced to less than 5 after the requirements are met, the grant will continue for a certain period of time.
    - If the "2 % of the vote" side is cleared, it will continue until the next House of Representatives or House of Councillors election.

- Summary
- The process is not 10 voters = fixed grant, but 10 voters = OK for proportional list => 2 % + 1 winner => grant from the following year.
- Since the subsidy is determined by both seats and votes, it is essential to design a set of measures to increase the number of proportional votes and to win at least one seat.
