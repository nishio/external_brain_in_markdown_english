Include [/nishio-en](https://scrapbox.io/nishio-en) in [https://github.com/nishio/external_brain_in_markdown](https://github.com/nishio/external_brain_in_markdown)

background
- Problem of poor quality of English translations because of line-by-line DeepL
- They keep saying they are trying to improve it, but they keep neglecting it.
- Let Devin do the work of improving the Japanese version by comparing it with the English version.

Repositories should be separated.

This page is auto-translated from [/nishio/TODO:現状の英訳外部脳もGitHubにいれる](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/TODO:現状の英訳外部脳もGitHubにいれる) using DeepL. If you looks something interesting but the auto-translated English is not good enough to understand it, feel free to let me know at [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en). I'm very happy to spread my thought to non-Japanese readers.
