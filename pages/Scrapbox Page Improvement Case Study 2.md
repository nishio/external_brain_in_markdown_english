- [[Scrapbox Page Improvement Case Study]]

- In the page titled `Corpus Refinement`, I wrote `It is impossible to prepare a clean [corpus] in advance` `A mechanism is needed to put in a corpus at random and refine it to [posterior] `Need a mechanism to refine [[Incomplete corpus]] instead of learning from a given corpus. We need a mechanism to refine the [[incomplete corpus]] instead of being given a corpus and learning it.
- I searched for "miscellaneous" thinking, "Where's the story about improving that messy corpus?"
- I also searched for "miscellaneous corpus."
- I finally found it by searching for "corpus".
- The word "miscellaneous" was not on this page.
- So I added a `[Miscellaneous corpus]` and a `[[miscellany (classification of Japanese poetry)]] corpus.

- It was a long way around, but beneficial because in the process I saw that `the more important the project, the more messy it starts,' and it reinforced my feeling that the concept of `miscellaneous' is useful.
- The `miscellaneous` is not actually a link on this page either.
- I made it a link so the two pages are now connected.

- I'll [[linking]] ([[bracketing]]) various other things as I remember them.
    - The more repeatedly a page is read, the more linked it becomes and the better it becomes a hub of information.
