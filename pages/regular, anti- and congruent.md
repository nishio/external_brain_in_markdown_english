Specifically, you are required to discuss the topic presented in the following structure ([PDF](https://nagoya.repo.nii.ac.jp/record/2003940/files/nueduca6901_02.pdf))
- [[standing]] (positive)
    - First, clarify your own assertion or position ([[statement]]).
- [antistat.
    - Consider objections, criticisms, and different points of view ([[antithesis]]) to the claim.
- [General
    - The integration of these positive and negative aspects leads to a new, higher-order view ([[synthesis (in semiconductor technology)]]).
