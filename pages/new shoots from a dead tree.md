new shoots from a dead tree
## [[new discovery]]
- New thoughts can sprout from fuzzy metaphors, such as the difference between "denying the air as good" and "not reading the air," or a sprout from a dead tree.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamed-project/neko/icon' alt='/unnamed-project/neko.icon' height="19.5"/>

- Can we cut this out?" I was looking at it and thinking, "What is it? "Isn't this what it looks like?" and a new thought sprouted.
    - Example: `"denying air as good" is not the same as `not reading the air`.
        - [[dead tree]] I thought it was [[sprouting]]

- Newborn metaphors are fuzzy and grow after the fact.
    - The process of waiting for branches to grow and fruit to enlarge
