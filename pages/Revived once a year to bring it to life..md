title: "Revived once a year to bring it to life."

Of the "dead texts" written in non-Scrapbox places, only those written on Facebook are often unearthed and reprinted in this project; Twitter and Hatena Diaries are not; and the "dead texts" written on Facebook are often reprinted in this project, but not in Scrapbox. What's the difference?

Facebook has a [[This day in the past]] feature that allows you to view texts you wrote on Facebook n years ago.

Wouldn't this ability to "come back to life once a year" be useful in bringing dead text to life?
    - [[Not a warehouse to put dead text in.]]
    - [[How do you bring a document to life?]]

Therefore, we imported Hatena Diary and Twitter into Scrapbox with one page per day, and added a function to realize "this day in the past" on its own.
- Realization of "this day in the past" simply combines the pages of the same month and day in different years into one
- Example: [/nishio-twitter/0909](https://scrapbox.io/nishio-twitter/0909).
