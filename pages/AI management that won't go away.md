title: "AI management that won't go away"
---

What's good about [[GTD]] is that "[[if]] you write it down, it doesn't disappear.
- Reassure yourself by thinking that you have "everything you need to care about" in one place.

I don't feel comfortable letting the current AI manage tasks (simply by putting them in context) because they will disappear.
- I think the bottleneck is the number of [[Multi-Head Attention]].
The problem was that even in the "[[Teaching AI the KJ Method]]" experiment, the way it was handled in context made it disappear.
- If you leave it solely to the LLMs, you're missing out on input.
- LLMs (and humans) unintentionally ignore
- I thought it would be KJ legal to check this in the program and poke it over and over until it's taken in.

- [[Conceived tasks are often too abstract to perform]]

The AI is equipped with "[[an]] indelible memory" to concretize abstract tasks and optimize the combination of related tasks for GTD-like peace of mind and execution efficiency. Concretely,
- Persistent record: tasks and ideas can be retained and tracked outside of the LLM context by linking to external databases and note-taking tools.
    - [[LLMコンテキスト外]]という場の存在<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Concretization support: AI generates and presents a set of actionable steps and clear outcome goals from vague ideas entered by the user, lowering the hurdles to implementation.
- Task Relevance Analysis: Using natural language processing and clustering methods, commonalities and dependencies among multiple tasks are discovered, and areas where efficiency can be improved if they are processed together are identified.
- Iterative improvement: tasks can be reorganized and re-abstracted again based on execution status and feedback to maintain an optimal action plan at all times.
Combined, these functions go beyond mere "task enumeration" to create a practical and dynamic "indelible AI management system.


- Personal Information Management (PIM):
    - Keeping Found Things Found]" (2007) by William Jones provides an overview of how personal information management tools and techniques can help users store and reuse information, and is helpful in considering GTD-like "indelible" records and reusability.
- AI Planning and Scheduling:
    - Ghallab, Nau, & Traverso "[[Automated Planning: Theory & Practice]]" (2004) organizes AI techniques that reduce abstract goals into concrete action plans. These frameworks and algorithms are helpful in creating mechanisms to transform abstract tasks into actionable steps.
- Idea organization and knowledge clustering:
    - Papers in the HCI and information science domains dealing with computer-assisted research on KJ methods (e.g., [[information clustering]], [[automatic knowledge graph generation]]) provide useful suggestions for structuring disparate memos and tasks and uncovering relationships.
