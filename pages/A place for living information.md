> [@sm_hn](https://twitter.com/sm_hn/status/1564919292613001218): Ten years ago, I used to watch as my conscious digital uncles would say, "Evernote is my second brain! I used to look at them and think, "Well, if I can master Google, I can skip some of that hard work.

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1565157274876002304): Nowadays, "search from your own clips" and "search from information open to the world" are [[choosing the wrong two options]], and using Scrapbox as a second brain, you can skewer your own personal clips and discussions in closed communities, which most people don't understand because [[closed community]] is unobservable

What is missing for those who think that they have clipped and hoarded information but have failed to produce useful buds are others to make the place not a "warehouse of dead information" but a "fish tank where living information swims around".

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1565161678941339648): The increase of garbage on the internet is the same phenomenon that has been repeated in several places. At first, all the [[givers]] create a beneficial place, but when the place becomes beneficial, takers come in to profit and the value of the place goes down.
