> [Event Summary
>  The Tokyo gubernatorial election was held on July 7. Among the many topics of conversation that followed the election, AI engineer Takahiro Yasuno stood out from the crowd. His innovative campaign, which utilized AI, GitHub, and groupware, attracted a great deal of attention after the election, and he has become a media sensation.
>  We are pleased to announce that [[Genron Cafe]] will hold an event to think about "new politics" and "new elections" with Mr. Yasuno, Sirus CTO and engineer Daisuke Katsura, and Azuma joining us.
>  Actually, Yasuno-san is a reader of Azuma's. He says that his election strategy was influenced by "General Will 2.0" and "Philosophy of Correctability," and he also made his debut as a novelist in the Hayakawa Science Fiction Contest, for which Azuma serves as a selection committee member. On the day of the voting, he came to the special program held at Genron.
>  One particularly lively topic was how to think about the relationship between cool "[[technology]]" and hot and human "ideology. Azuma appreciated Yasuno's election strategy, but asked, "If you are serious about becoming a politician, you should think more about ideology as well as technology.
>  This question was carried over because time ran out. How will Yasuno-san answer this question now, two months after the election campaign? This is an active joint discussion where "politics," "ideology," and "technology" intersect in a way that only Genron Cafe can provide. Please look forward to it!

> [dkatsura](https://x.com/dkatsura/status/1834625060394660217) Now that I read it again, the screen of general will projected on the parliament in "General Will 2.0" is [[broad listening]] itself...

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1836576343955570831) I slept less than 4 hours and woke up and now understand the hashtag #Genron240918
>  Yesterday's talk was very well organized with the [[General Will 2.0 and "Listening, Polishing, and Communicating"]] diagram by Yasuno and Katsura's "There are at least 6 ways that the term "digital democracy" can mean in Japan. I wonder if the documents will be published somewhere.

> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1836733513405718654) At the Genron Cafe event, I started at 7:00 p.m. and talked for the entire event until 4:00 a.m. when the after-party ended. I talked for 9 hours in front of people, but it felt like only a moment. It was fun!
>  Please watch the distribution too!
> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1836735425416929603) I liked Daisuke Katsura's @dkatsura's slide "Anno lacks xxx" and Hiroki Azuma's @hazuma's question "Why did the argument change between "[[ General Will 2.0]]" and "Philosophy of Correctability"? General Will 2.0]" and "[[Philosophy of Correctability]]".
