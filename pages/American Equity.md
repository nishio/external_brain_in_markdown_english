- The following is a summary, lines with <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> and their children are my comments

~~~
- I believe that every adult American citizen should receive a share of the U.S. [[GDP]].
        - [[Distribution of GDP]] <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- I believe that by owning something like the American share, all of us can help make this country as successful as possible, and the better our country becomes, the better everyone becomes and the more people have a fair chance to achieve the life they want. And we will all work together to create a system that will create much prosperity.
    - What we're talking about here is making "America" look like a corporation, where everyone owns shares of stock and gets a share of the profits.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- I believe that if we agree to the new [[social compact]] that I am proposing here, i.e., a set floor and not a set ceiling, the prosperity of the United States will be greatly enhanced and we will remain on top of the world.
    - Decide on the floor, not the ceiling," which means[[basic income]] 的に最低収入を導入し、上限は決めないということ<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- There are historical examples of countries giving land to their citizens as a way to distribute the resources necessary for success (e.g., the [[Homestead Act]] in the United States). Today, the basic ingredients for creating wealth are money and ideas, not farmland.
    - Argument that there is no strange precedent for the state to provide its citizens with a source of wealth creation.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- American Equity also eases [[the transition from today's work to tomorrow's work]].
    - Automation has the potential to create more abundance than we could ever dream of, but it will also change the way we think about work.
    - If everyone can benefit more directly from [[economic growth]], it will be easier to move faster toward this better world.
    - The [[automation]] default is to concentrate wealth (and thus power) in the hands of a very few. The U.S. has found ways to challenge such concentration many times, and it needs to do so again and again.
    - Automation by AI means that if nothing is done, there will be a severe concentration of wealth.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - The [[Corporation]] is one of the most important inventions in the history of mankind.
    - Inc. has brought together many people toward a common goal and enabled them to accomplish things that would be impossible individually.
    - Of course, the U.S. is not a company, but I think a similar model would work in the U.S. just as well as in a corporation.
- Obviously a lot of new money `[1]` is needed to make such a proposal on a large scale. However, I think we can start on a very small scale, a few hundred dollars per capita per year, and work our way up to a long-term goal of 10-20% of GDP per year when per capita GDP doubles.
    - In 2021, the "[[Moore's Law for Everything]]」では少し違う目標に変わってる<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- On the difficulty of such a program
    - There will be difficult ramifications for immigration policy and other issues, and much discussion will be needed.
    - Rules regarding the transfer and borrowing of this equity must also be considered.
    - And it needs to be set up in a way that does not exacerbate short-term thinking or encourage unsustainable growth.

- But as the economy grows, one can imagine a world in which all Americans are guaranteed basic needs.
    - Absolute poverty will disappear and the fear of not being able to eat will no longer motivate people.
    - Eliminating poverty will also increase productivity.

- I believe that American Equity will make our society far better than it is today.
    - American Equity enables Americans to work on things they really care about, increases social cohesion, and motivates everyone to think about ways to make the pie bigger.

- `[1]` It is time to update the tax system to match the wealth structure of modern society, for example, taxing capital and labor at the same rate. And we should consider eventually replacing some of our current aid programs, which distort incentives and are unnecessarily complex and inefficient, with something like this.
        - [[property tax]] ,  [[asset taxation]] の話<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

- Of course, this will not solve all problems; serious reforms are needed in areas such as housing, education, and health care.
    - Without policies to solve the cost-of-living crisis, no redistribution will be able to have its effect.
