The Relationship Between These Two
- [[First, Build Trust Through Gritty Problem Solving]]
- [[Things to Be Mindful of When Suddenly Appointed as CTO from Outside]]
It's about [[newcomers needing to earn the trust of those who were there first]].

Why is that?
[[U-Curve Model]]
- To move beyond prototyping to performing, embedding within the [[existing system]] is necessary.
    - [[Alignment]]
- "[[Respect the Existing System]]" from [[Things to Be Mindful of When Suddenly Appointed as CTO from Outside]]
    - This expression makes "respect" unclear, possibly perceived as a mere platitude.
    - It's obvious that ideas that demonstrate value by connecting with the "existing system" require an understanding of that system.

- Visualize [[Differences in Evaluation Functions]]
    - The [[individual's metric]] of "taking risks and gaining attention = value" often clashes with the [[organization's metric]] of "minimizing [[coordination costs]] and [[legal risks]] while achieving results = value."
    - By first verbalizing and presenting both evaluation axes in a comparable form, mismatches can be detected early.
    - Though o3 separated them, the following is almost the same <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Recognize [[Asymmetry in Career Tracks]]
        - Individuals with an [[entrepreneurial mindset]] prioritize "speed" and "uniqueness,"
        - While organizations with a [[stability orientation]] prioritize "reproducibility" and "consensus building,"
        - Even for the same outcomes, evaluation points differ.
        - Ignoring the gap can lead to '[[Friction Costs > Outcomes]]', making dissolution of collaboration seem optimal.
- The “[[Youth Bonus]]” is Consumable
    - The "frequency of failures" and "sharp remarks" permissible for the young rapidly reverse in evaluation with age.
    - It's crucial to be aware of the bonus's remaining amount and design a conversion from "attention" to "[[trust assets]]" before the [[failure tolerance]] decreases.
- [[Risk-Taking]] Comes with “[[Solidarity Costs]]”
    - Legal and ethical risks ripple out to affect not just the individual but all involved parties.
    - Even if "I'm fine," those around who dislike “[[collateral loss]]” may avoid you.
- Create a Flow for Conversion to “Assets”
    - Ensure ideas and attention don't end fleetingly,
    - Through small-scale verification → templating successful patterns → redistributing as know-how or tools,
    - To convert them into assets.
        - The appropriateness of this flow is debatable <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - This helps shed the reputation of being "just a person of interest" and provides persuasive material for the organization.
- Measure [[Coordination Costs]] as a KPI
    - Quantify how much additional effort and [[firefighting]] the surroundings were forced into, and set self-improvement goals to accelerate [[trust recovery]].
    - The key is to focus not on “your output alone” but on “[[total value against total cost]]”.

[[Communication Issues Are Mutual]]
- If A and B have communication issues, it's often a mutual problem.
    - If A has issues with B, C, and D, A appears to be at fault.
- Organizations form a trust network by having members maintain "no communication issues" over the long term.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/3454525d404118d66ed50c87bceebe13/thumb/1000)
    - Assuming individuals A and B have no communication issues,
    - If B introduces A to their organization and A has issues with member C,
    - D and E, who have maintained "no communication issues" with C, will naturally judge "A is at fault."
    - B finds themselves caught between A and C, D, E.
        - This is troublesome.
        - C, D, E's trust in B decreases for bringing A in.
            - An unspoken [[introducer responsibility system]]
            - It's as if A spent B's money.
            - Similar to a guarantor, B pays the cost of troubles caused by A.
    - If observed multiple times, the perception that "A tends to cause such troubles" spreads, leading to fewer introductions.
        - In a similar but different context, players who make others uncomfortable are not invited to enjoyable gaming sessions.
            - [[Harmful Individuals Are Not Invited to Communities]]
            - This is it: [[Self-Induced Exclusion]]
- [[The World of Those Who Kill Does Not Expand]]
    - It's the opposite of [[expanding and reproducing social capital]].
    - [[How to Use Social Capital]]
        - > After a transaction between D and S, it's necessary for both parties' happiness to increase.
        - > If the transaction doesn't lead to good results, trust in the intermediary M decreases.
    - It's wasteful to burn resources acquired through "recklessness typical of youth" without increasing them.
- "Understanding the Existing System"
    - It's not that difficult.
    - It's a mechanism that average-intelligence Homo sapiens can execute on average.
    - If you have a high system understanding ability, you should be able to understand it better.
    - This might be [[Downloading]] in the [[U-Curve Model]] of [[Theory U]].
        - If trapped in your own preconceptions, you can't understand.
        - Reacting with "it should be this way," "it's not," "the existing system is crap" blocks information, hindering understanding.
        - In such a state, even if you verbalize ideas or create prototypes, without connecting to the [[social field]] in [[Presencing]], you'll face difficulties in the [[Performing]] stage.
