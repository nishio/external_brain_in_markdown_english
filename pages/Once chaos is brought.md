from  [[🌀Once chaos is brought]]

Once chaos is brought
The development of AI causes temporary chaos and
- New perspectives and adaptations are created.

Comparison of AI and human capabilities is sterile.
- It is important to have an assistant with different strengths and weaknesses at your side.

AI evolution is irreversible, and it is more important to be swept along well than to go against it.
AI puts human thoughts into words
- Human discovery and communication of new knowledge is a means of value creation
