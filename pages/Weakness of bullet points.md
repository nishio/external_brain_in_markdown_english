title: "Weakness of bullet points"

Example
- A
    - B
    - C
    - D

This is because the BCD
lisp

```
(time-series
	B
	C
	D)
```

seven days
lisp

```
(parallel
	B
	C
	D)
```

I don't know if it is.

And the relationship with A.
lisp

```
(define A (list
	B
	C
	D))
```

seven days
lisp

```
(has-children A (list
	B
	C
	D))
```

I don't know if it is.

Conversely, this is similar to the KJ method, which expresses a relationship somehow by "putting them close together".
- The same indentation makes you think, "I don't know if this is a chronological list or an unordered list, but it must be some kind of a grouping.
- Parental hierarchy becomes "I wonder if it's some kind of higher concept".
    - Sometimes it's a tree-board style "child refers to parent" relationship.
        - Here's a case study

Can be expressed in a more flexible way compared to writing sentences out of the blue.
- That's why there are so many people who use an outliner to write bullet points and then a writing style.
    - At least until just a few years ago, the KJ method didn't have enough screen resolution to do it digitally.

Even with bullet points, there is a need to "describe the relationship between distant objects" as described in [Why are lines essential?
    - [[Isn't it strange that Scrapbox's in-page linking is not easy?]]

- Weakness of [itemization
- relevance
        - [[Weakness of one-dimensional language]]
