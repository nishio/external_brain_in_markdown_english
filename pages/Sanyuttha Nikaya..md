title: "Sanyuttha Nikaya."
---

No. 3 of 5 parts of the Pali sutras
In Japan, it is often written as [[appropriate department]], but here at Scrapbox, we decided to write it in Pali because it is the name of a Pali scripture.
> The Saṃyutta Nikāya, SN, [[saṃyutta]] [[nikāya]]) is the third "division" (nikāya) of the "five divisions" (Pañca Nikāya, [[pancha nikaya]]) that make up the Buddhist scripture collection of the Pali sutras. The third "section" (nikāya) of the "Pañca Nikāya," [[pancha nikaya]]. It is a collection of thematic short sutras. The term saṃyutta (saṃyutta) refers to "thematic groupings."
