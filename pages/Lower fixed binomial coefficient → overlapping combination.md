title: "Lower fixed binomial coefficient → overlapping combination"
---

$\binom{A+i}{A} = \binom{A+i}{i} = H^{A+1}_i$

$\binom{A+i}{A} = H_A^{i+1}$
The latter is also possible, but the former is a more natural form of [[Collapsing Duplicate Combinations]] since it is a form of placing a variable ball on a fixed frame.

- [[binomial coefficient of under-fixation]] → [[nested combination]]
