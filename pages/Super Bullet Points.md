- Figure 45: NG words in presentations
- Improve ~."
    - It's not working, so it's only natural to improve.
    - It is not the improvement itself, but how it is to be improved that is meaningless unless you tell them how to improve.
- Reviewing the ~."
    - It's not working, so it's only natural to revisit it.
    - It doesn't make sense if you don't tell them how you're going to review it.
- "to promote..."
    - It's natural to promote what you know you're going to do.
    - It doesn't make sense if you don't tell them what exactly you're going to do.
- Optimize ~."
    - If you can optimize, you do. No one wants to optimize.
    - It doesn't make sense if you don't tell them what exactly they need to do to optimize.
- Balance the ~."
    - This is the same as "optimize ~." Balancing is a given.
    - It makes no sense if you don't tell them what happens and what they need to do to achieve a balanced state.
- I'll make sure ~ is done thoroughly."
    - If you can be thorough, you should be.
    - It is meaningless if you don't tell them specifically how to be thorough.
- "to enhance."
    - ⇒This is the same as "be thorough with ~". If you can reinforce it, you do it.
    - ⇒It is meaningless if you don't tell them specifically how you will strengthen it.
- "I'm going to do it."
    - ⇒It is natural to do what you are doing or what you are supposed to do.
    - ⇒It is meaningless unless you tell them what you are going to do specifically, not just what you are going to do.

> [nullzwai](https://x.com/nullzwai/status/1964985361345757381) When I tried to write a bulleted outline without actually using the words here, I had trouble coming up with anything at all. I try to convey the purpose, not the means, in the body of the text, but when the words here are prohibited in a short title, I'm in great trouble!
