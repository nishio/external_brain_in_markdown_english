title: "Effective integration of ChatGPT and Scrapbox and reuse of content"
---

- [[Preparation for Omoikane Study Group]]
- I had [[ChatGPT]] create questions for me to generate material for my presentation.
    - I put the answer to that question in [[Scrapbox]].
    - This was repeated to create the material.
    - When I had enough, I thought of a composition in [[Kozaneba]].
    - I made it using only the parts I used while looking at Kozaneba.
    - At this time, of course, "questions and answers that were written but not used" can be created.
    - It is beneficial that this pair be reused
- This scrapbox is automatically chunked by [[Omoikane Embed]] and indexed by [[vector search]].
- If Scrapbox is automatically inscribed into a chunk and subject to a vector search, then the next time you try to write about a related topic, GPT can pick up that chunk in a vector search and reuse it.
    - Questions and answers that were not used in this presentation ([[wisdom not to know]]) will also be reused.
    - [[Text ComposTer]]-like.

- This story was an hour version, but I hope we can compress it and make a 5 or 10 minute version.
    - But it's going to be "where to cut it out?"
    - Appropriate cutout locations vary depending on the target audience...
            - [[The appropriate way to cut out the need is determined after the need is identified.]]
    - I'd rather use this as a base, and if I request "with this kind of assumed audience," GPT4 can make it.



Once this is done, the source of value moves from the lecture material to the pool of questions and answers in the foreground.
- It didn't seem like anything special.
    - Already in the days of [[Tadao Umesao]], the source of the value of intellectual production was not the output book but the card-type database in the back.
- It was just difficult to observe and distribute it.
- Right now, in an ongoing process, Nishio's "[[card-type database]]" is observable in the form of Scrapbox.
    - Interaction with the reader is happening at the card stage.
- A little further into the future, "[[Interaction with readers]]" will become "[[Interaction with AI]]".
