title: "Philosophy books and code reading"
---

Reading and comprehending a difficult [[philosophy book]] and reading and understanding complex software source code ([[code-reading]]) have quite a bit in common.

The understanding of software can be verified by tinkering with it and seeing if it produces the expected results. Since verification of understanding of philosophy is not easy, the percentage of people who think they understand but actually do not understand is probably higher among philosophers than among software engineers.
