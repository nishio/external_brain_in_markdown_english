> very dangerous trap that many super talented builders never escape from, until they eventually look back on it all and say “damn i’m so unfulfilled”.
> [@sama](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1655255321726832640?s=20): investing is an amazing very-part-time job, and (at least for me) a soul-sucking full-time job.

> those mountains in aspen aren’t gonna ski themselves, that party in saint-tropez isn’t gonna enjoy itself, that kiteboard on necker island needs someone to fly it, etc etc etc.
> [@paulg](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1655934068142505988?s=20): @sama This is why being a YC partner was designed to be a part-time job. I only wanted a part-time job, because I had other things I wanted to work on as well, and I only wanted to hire people who felt the same.
> [@paulg](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1655934556707631119?s=20): @sama It's also why I retired. While being a YC partner can be a part-time job, running YC itself can't be. So if I was ever going to work on anything else, I had to leave.

- It is very easy to become a VC, you have a great position, lots of money, and a very enjoyable lifestyle. But it is a very dangerous trap, and many very talented builders never get out of it, eventually looking back on it all and saying, "I am so unfulfilled.
- Investing is a great super part-time job, and (at least for me) a soul-sucking full-time job. But I can't ski the mountains of Aspen by myself, I can't enjoy the parties in St. Tropez by myself, I need someone to fly me kiteboarding on Necker Island, etc.
- So the YC partnership was designed as a part time job. We wanted to hire only like-minded people because we had other things we wanted to work on, so we decided to make it part time.
- That's also why I resigned: the YC partners can do it part-time, but the YC operation itself can't. So if I was going to work on something else, I had to quit.
