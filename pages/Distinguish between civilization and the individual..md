title: "Distinguish between civilization and the individual."
---

I realized that the concept of "[[human being]]" is ambiguous and should be divided into two parts.
- 'AI harvests emotions from each individual in order to give advice beneficial to human civilization.'
    - Calling both this "[[civilization]]" and "[[individual]]" "human" is confusing.

[[Human civilization]]
[[Homo sapiens civilization]]
[[Earth Civilization]].
