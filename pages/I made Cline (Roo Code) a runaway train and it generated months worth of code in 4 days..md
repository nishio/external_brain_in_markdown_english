title: "I made Cline (Roo Code) a runaway train and it generated months worth of code in 4 days."

> [erukiti](https://x.com/erukiti/status/1906492325049913668) I wrote a bare bones article about how I used Roo Code to generate just under 30,000 lines of code in 4 days, and then eliminated the approximate technical debt in the next 5 days.

> [erukiti](https://x.com/erukiti/status/1906492593896395144) What we can learn from this article:
>  * Technical debt should not be neglected when programming with coding agents
>  * Or rather, if you feel uncomfortable, don't leave it (which it is).
>  * In just a few days, you can experience what it's like to "realize the tremendous technical debt
>  * You can eliminate that ridiculous technical debt in just a few days
>  * In just a few days, we had a very good quality experimental asset that could be used for a variety of experiments.


> Basically, there is one thing that we need to keep simple or we will soon go bankrupt.
> LLMs are prone to various failures due to inconsistencies. This is due to the smartness of the model itself (a rule of thumb, but to some extent it is proportional to the number of parameters), which makes a big difference in its resistance to failures. This is why you need to keep it simple.
> I had confirmed that the code was shaky, but in the human sense, a little bit of shitty code in the code would not cause the project to fail, so I decided to go ahead with the project! So, I went ahead with the project, but it turned out to be the cause of the project's failure! Well, if you think about it properly, that's true, but AI is more dangerous than humans in the sense of the broken window theory.
