title: "Niche Contingent Expansion Strategy"
---

I'm recording this because various people's stories connected in my brain.

- First, go for [niche top
        - [[niche]] Top = state of being in first place there, although the range is narrower.
        - This can be acquired by anyone with some ability through hard work.
        - Specifically, you can narrow the scope by multiplying attributes #Multiply Niche Top Strategy
            - Example
                - "I can design and prototype my own IoT devices" x Master of Business Administration
                - "I can create my own program" x Physician
                    - [[parable of the bridge]]
            - The most knowledgeable person in the company is also a type of this.
                - "I am an employee of this company." x "I am familiar with ____."
- [[harvest]] from a niche top position.
    - Profit from being at the top, business-wise.
    - Being at the top makes it easier to gather information.
            - [[Information is gathered to the sender of information.]]
    - Aim for sustainable harvesting conditions.

- Reinvesting the harvest to increase niche tops.
    - Can be expanded to adjacent areas
    - Or you can try your hand at something completely different.
    - Stable revenue base allows us to take on challenges with more time to spare.
            - [[nothing ventured, nothing gained]]
        - Added 2023-11-28 Related: [[Barbell Strategy]].
- [[Unpredictable market changes]] will cause the market to expand rapidly.
    - For example.
        - Or finding new uses for the tools you've been making.
        - I've heard that the materials used have dropped in price significantly, which has led to a decrease in overall prices and an increase in users.
        - Complementary goods are launched, and the combination increases customer value.
    - This is luck, and it's hard to aim for or predict.
    - If you are lucky enough to have this happen in an area where you occupy the top niche, you will earn a large profit.
    - This is the equivalent of the first [[Unexpected Success]] mentioned by Drucker in Seven Opportunities for Innovation.
    - Added 2023-11-28 Related: [[planned contingency]].

[[2017]]-07-05 First published.
- I think it all started with [[Jun Kuikei's]] presentation at the unexplored [[Boost Conference]] on 6/30.
