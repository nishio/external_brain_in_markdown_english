Heavyweight board game
It started at 7:00 p.m. but was not finished by 11:00 p.m. and was terminated in the middle of the day.

Four players become like the four noble factions in the Atlantis civilization and increase the power of their faction.
When Roman soldiers and such attack from the periphery of the city and reach the city buildings, Poseidon in the center floods the city and defeats them, but then the buildings and divine beasts (like giant robots, different from the ones you board) are also swept away.
- So you have to defeat the enemy, but of course, in worker placement, manpower is a limited resource, so fighting delays internal politics.
- Therefore, in cases where there is no damage to you in the event of a flood, you may ignore the enemy's invasion.

I had an enemy heading for a building I had constructed early in my career, and it was destroyed at my mercy, like I had no way to physically defend it with my meager initial strength.

In this game, buildings can be destroyed and others can use them.
- So it's not a resource that belongs to an individual.
    - The exception is the dedicated building that each faction has only one
- Only one faction has bonuses to buildings, and they can be built a lot, and at the end of the day, every time someone else uses it, it generates victory points.
- I was of the faction where population ultimately added to victory points, so I decided to ignore the buildings and increase the population.

In this game, workers have morale and can perform additional actions by spending morale.
- Initially, there are 3 workers, each with 1 morale, and in this state, basically 3 actions can be performed safely.
    - Additional actions will reduce the worker's morale to 0.
    - This would basically be a Grace-1 penalty.
- Also, since +1 recovery occurs for everyone after the penalty calculation, you can safely perform 6 actions in the second round if you have not consumed morale
- However, "Morale +1 except for the top" is activated first, so you can safely do 7 actions from about the 3rd round.
- There is also "Worship", a means to gain +2 Grace by consuming 1 action.

There are three types of resources: trees, fish, and ore.
- This one has a rather tight upper limit.

There are many benefits to be gained by studying the technology tree.

Appearances from the perimeter of the city may be special actions, not enemies
- In the case of this play, I got "Spend Grace to Study Era 3.
- At that time, no other player but me had met the conditions for Grace to be activated, so I was the definite one to activate it.
- I used this to get "any resource +2 per morale at the end of every round / +2 victory points".
    - At that time, he was the last to win, and when asked why he was not building, he said, "Why don't you build a building, Nishio-san?" He said, "Well, when I can afford the resources," but instead of building a building that could be destroyed by flooding, he first increased the population.

Finally, as the time for the last train approached, the organizer declared "We're done in 10 minutes" or "This turn is the end", so we took the collection in reverse order.
- Usually in these games, the endgame is a trade-off between "invest or expropriate", so the endgame involves a reading of "when will it end?", but that was not the case this time, so I decided to "make the most efficient exploitation without thinking about the future".
- First use the temple of others to activate the action "Poseidon's Arrogance" for -15 Grace +25 victory points, then use the exchange of wood and Grace for +3 Grace
- 3 actions with the next 2 people from 2 to 1 morale, the action is "Worship" with +2 Grace, so +12 Grace here.
- And the fourth person "builds a temple" and "activates Poseidon's Arrogance with an additional action" for a +25 win advantage.
- Time was up here without waiting for the end of the round.
- consideration
    - I gained a +50 win advantage in one round, but it will be difficult to do it twice every turn since I'm doing my own temple construction, of which there is only one.
        - You have the resources to use it once each turn, but you can't activate it if another player takes the temple at worker placement.
            - I'm sure the temple will be fought over since all players could run the Divine Beast Deployment +15 win advantage.


Next time, we will play with the same members, the same faction and the same combination of divine beasts, so we can continue our discussion later.
