> [kensuu](https://x.com/kensuu/status/1913036663581970687) I was talking with Chef Toba and Go Miura-san the other day about the importance of [[the power of starting point]] in the age of AI (original source: DeNA Nanba-san).
>
>  I was wondering if there was a book suitable for such a purpose, and I found "[[Hajime no Chikara]]" by [[Takahiro Yasuno]] very good.
>
>  Exactly this! I thought. Recommendation.
