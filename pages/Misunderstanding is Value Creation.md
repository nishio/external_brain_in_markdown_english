title: "Misunderstanding is Value Creation"
---

- Readers often [[misunderstand]] what the author is trying to say
- But this is not a "mistake" or "point deduction" as in a school test.
- The phenomenon that the concept that the reader [[reconstructs]] from a list of letters on paper is not equal to that of the author.
    - This kind of "reconstructing a new form" is not something authors can do.
- In other words, misunderstanding and communicating that [[misunderstanding]] to the author is a [[productive]] activity.
- Conversely, someone who understands 100% of what the author is trying to say without misunderstanding has not yet done any [[Value Creation]] at that point

- There is a negative bias in the expression "misunderstanding.
    - When there is a discrepancy between the author's understanding and the reader's understanding, that alone does not make either right
        - What is [[correctness]]?
            - [[useful]] was correct.
    - The author has invested more time on the subject than the reader and is more likely to have arrived at useful knowledge
    - On the other hand, this is not true if the reader has knowledge that the author does not have
            - [[experience]] is different for each person.
        - The author has only experienced as much as one human being.
            - [[Learn from the experiences of others]]
    - Thought experiment:.
        - Author who read programming books for 3 years, did not write a single line of programming, and put it all together
        - Readers with one year of programming experience

- Need [[measures]] on the author's side
    - When you observe someone who has interpreted something differently from what you intended to express, instead of cutting them off and saying, "That's a misunderstanding.
    - I wonder if there is something useful in that interpretation, or something else.
