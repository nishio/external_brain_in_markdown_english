- > Modern Western philosophy begins with Descartes, who started with the thinking ego, and continues with Kant, Schelling, Hegel, and Schopenhauer. This book is an attempt to show how philosophy itself is restricted by the Christian tradition and dogmatism, and to pave the way for a new philosophical activity, while building on that heritage.

Chapter 146, "[[Fighting Monsters]]."
- > He who fights against the monster, do not become a monster in the process. If you look into the abyss for a long time, the abyss will also look into you.
Declaration 190, "[[Plato and Socrates]]."
- > Plato, who was the most daring interpreter, picked up all of Socrates' philosophy and transformed it into something infinite and impossible, as if he were transforming the common themes and folk songs heard on the street. He covered it up with his own mask and diversity... Plato's Socrates is "Plato in front, Plato behind, Chimera inside."
Intermission 195, "[[Insurrection of the Slave in Morality]]."
- > ... The adjectives "rich," "godless," "bad," "violent," and "sensual" were blended into a single meaning, and for the first time the word "this world" was smeared with stigmatism.
