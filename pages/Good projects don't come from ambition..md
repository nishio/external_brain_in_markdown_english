Good projects don't come from ambition.
A good project is not born out of an ambition to leave a legacy of one's existence to future generations," said Achille Castiglioni. A good project does not come from the ambition to leave your existence to posterity, but from the desire to make an exchange with a stranger who will use what you have designed.
