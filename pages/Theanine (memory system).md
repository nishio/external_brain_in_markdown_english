Theanine (Ong et al., NAACL 2025): is a framework for [[timeline-based memory management]] in long-term interaction. While existing research has focused on destroying old memories that are no longer needed, Theanine dares not to delete memories but to keep them.
Instead, each memory is linked based on time of occurrence and causal relationships, and related events are structured as a causal timeline.
During dialogue response, the entire sequence of events related to the current context (e.g., transition of user behavior) is referenced, and utterances are generated based on past history.
This allows even seemingly old events to be used as contextual clues of "changes in user behavior," leading to more consistent responses and the development of long-term relationships.

Theanine is a new perspective to improve the contextual comprehension of long-term dialogues. Theanine is a new perspective to improve the contextual comprehension of long-term dialogues.
