- When conversing in a ChatGPT-like one-to-one chat, the scope of AI's write (A) is one human
- Devin-like AI agent enters closed multi-person scope (B)
    - Not global scope (C) for the entire world
    - Some people in C are not kind to AI agents.
- However, if you give write access to a public repository on GitHub, you may write in C what you know in B.
