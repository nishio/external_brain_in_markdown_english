Community Notes] analysis attached to mass-tweet

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1822203175547318414) Interesting article. I heard that [[Fact-Checking Center]] has stated its policy not to fact-check existing news organizations in principle. If this is the case, then there needs to be an entity that [[fact-checks]] existing media organizations, and the analysis in this article indicates that [[Community Notebook]] can play that role.

The day after I wrote this, [[Asahi Shinkai 6500 Incident]] happened.
