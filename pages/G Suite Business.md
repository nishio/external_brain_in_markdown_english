Used to be a drive with unlimited capacity for 1500 yen/month, but will lose unlimited due to plan change in June 2021.
Will it be 2TB? Details undecided?

At any rate, 2TB will fit what I've got in there now.
Can escape to Dropbox, etc.

and tell yourself six months from now that you have made a decision
