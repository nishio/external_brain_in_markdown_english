title: "contemporary art"
---

I read somewhere that the difference between normal art and contemporary art is that the artist is still alive, so there is a possibility of interfering with future works.

I wrote the following forgetting that I wrote the above

Difference between contemporary art and other art
Art whose creator lives in the present time can influence the process of its creation
Whether or not there is a possibility that "I can change things."

- [[contemporary art]]
