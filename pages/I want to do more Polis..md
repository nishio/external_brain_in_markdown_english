title: "I want to do more Polis."

If the number of "overviews" is small enough to allow a quick look at the whole picture, [[Attention mobile voting]] can be done, but not if it is overflowing.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1646183223968546816) I want to do more [[Polis]]. It's open source, so I could host it on my own and use this account to call out, "Let's do this, everybody! I feel like that would be a miscellaneous agenda, and it would be an uninteresting experience because it's mostly an uninteresting agenda. do I need to read more carefully the case studies of vTaiwan's operations?
- [["It's not interesting because it's a largely uninteresting agenda."]]
    - People are not equally interested in all agendas.
    - I want to assign [[attention]] where I'm interested.
    - This is a similar situation to how [[Quadratic Voting]] allows individuals to control the strength of their voting power

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1646316706154029061) My desire to do more Polis, if I observe carefully, seems to be "as an alternative to Twitter". In other words, I'm interested in Polis as a social networking site that generates useful discussions without emotional buzz, spambots, or [[echo chamber]].
