title: "Extending the red link: anything that can't be taken out when needed is as good as nothing"

[[Extending the Red Link with AI]] in [[enchi]] revealed that the content I thought existed did not exist.
I redid it in /nishio and found

My last research note was only one sentence, "Anything that cannot be retrieved when needed is the same as nothing". This illustrates the importance of having information and knowledge readily available for retrieval when needed.

Nishio's research notes "Chapter 1: Overlooking the Learning Process (v3)" and the "You Don't Need That" YAGNI Principle are related to this concept. The delayed evaluative learning method emphasizes retrieving needed information when it is needed. The YAGNI Principle is also a software development principle of not adding features until they are needed, which is also consistent with the idea of retrieving what is needed when it is needed.
- This one has a strong "don't do it until you need it" color to it.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

The following questions emerge from these notes.

- How can delayed evaluative learning methods and YAGNI principles be combined for more efficient learning and work?
- How exactly can we put into practice the idea that "anything that cannot be retrieved when needed is as good as nothing?"

These questions will be explored in depth in future studies.

### Digest of Research Notes
.

My previous research note discussed the subject of "anything that cannot be retrieved when needed is as good as nothing". This illustrates the idea that it is important not only to store information and material things, but also to have the ability to use them appropriately when needed.

In this connection, some of Nishio's research notes, fragments from "What you can't find is as good as nothing", "Hatena2011-01-25" and "Hatena2009-10-07" are considered relevant. These represent considerations about the management and use of things, in terms of the decision to throw things away or keep them, and the ability to retrieve stored items when they are needed.

Fragments such as "If you don't write it down, it will disappear and will not stand the test of time," "Don't fight someone anonymous who has nothing to lose," "Unfeasible ideas," and "Most things are not gained because you simply don't try" show the importance of recording things, challenging yourself, and taking risks. The following is a list of some of the most important things to keep track of.

Taken together, these considerations suggest that managing things, keeping track of them, challenging them, and taking risks are key elements in effectively using knowledge and material things to improve productivity.
