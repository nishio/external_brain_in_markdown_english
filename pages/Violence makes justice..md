We explored the connection between [[violence and justice]] from the perspective that "violence makes justice." Violence is often a force that creates new justice and at the same time [Justice justifies violence. This illustrates the duality of "[[Creating Justice through Violence]]" and "[[Justification of violence by justice]]."

People may also have the confidence to commit violence against others when they believe they are justified. This illustrates the phenomenon "[Justice does violence. On the other hand, those who engage in violence tend to see themselves as victims and their targets as moral wrongdoers. This is also related to "[[a sense of self-defense run amok]].

Furthermore, some believe that justice requires a logical basis, and that without that basis, justice does not exist. However, this perspective raises the question, "[Isn't there no logical basis for justice?
- [[The Logical Basis of Justice]]
    - [[Mackie's Theory of Error]]
    - > The moral code is a product of people's way of life and their endorsement of it, and it is an error to think that the moral nature is on the side of the world.

We also discussed the link between [[violence and inequality]]. Japan used to be a society with a lot of [[disparity]], but it fought an all-out war that mobilized the entire population and the entire economy, and lost, which led to a decrease in inequality. This is related to "[[A Human History of Violence and Inequality]].

We explored the link between violence and justice from the perspective that "violence creates justice." Violence is often a force that creates new justice, while at the same time justice serves to justify violence. This illustrates the duality of "creating justice through violence" and "justifying violence through justice.

People may also have the confidence to commit violence against others when they believe they are just. This illustrates the phenomenon of "justice committing violence. On the other hand, those who engage in violence tend to view themselves as victims and their targets as moral wrongdoers. This is also associated with a "sense of self-defense run amok".

Furthermore, some believe that justice requires a logical basis, and that without that basis, justice cannot exist. However, this perspective begs the question, "Doesn't justice have a logical basis?" The question arises, "Is there no logical basis for justice?

We also discussed the link between violence and inequality. Japan used to be a society with high inequality, but the total war that mobilized the entire population and the entire economy, and yet lost, reduced inequality. This is related to the "human history of violence and inequality.

The above discussion has provided us with a deeper understanding of the relationship between violence and justice, the rationale for justice, and the relationship between violence and inequality. From these perspectives, we believe it is important to further explore the relationship between violence and justice.
