- On a curved road, the in-course (A) can move ahead faster than the out-course (B).
- So we tend to think of this as "[[the]] fastest course."
- But this only means that A is better than B under the [[constraints]] of "course."
- If we remove the constraints, straight forward C is the [[fastest]] and by far the fastest
- Compared to C, the difference between A and B is nothing.

---
- Are these "constraints" really unmovable, or are they illusions created by the human mind?
- A runs on the inside of the course, a little ahead of B, and feels superior.
    - But hard to see, the off-course C is far ahead.
- A thought he was the best, but suddenly C appears so far ahead that he can't catch up.
    - A thinks that C is [[cheating]].
- From C's point of view, A and B are not much different.
    - They took a [[detour]] along [[the rail of illusion]]. So it is [[self-responsibility]] that is slow, we think.
