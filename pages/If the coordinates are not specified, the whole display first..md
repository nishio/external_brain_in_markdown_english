A feature that has been wanted for a long time, not the implementation of the process itself, but the timing of triggering it was difficult and neglected.

Drawing and organizing diagrams

To know the size of the content, it needs to be rendered, so we'll do it at the double circle, but the information that the coordinates are not specified is at a distance
