> [Rima_tk](https://x.com/Rima_tk/status/1856549255265300552) In the first place [[Fermi's Paradox]], why do we assume that civilizations want to expand interstellarly while maintaining their physical bodies? I'm not sure.... The hurdle for [[interstellar migration]] is too high, so the stage of migrating to [[virtual space (e.g. in computer graphics)]] and satisfying the reproductive needs of the reward system in it seems to arrive sooner in most cases....

> [Rima_tk](https://x.com/Rima_tk/status/1856551568289738846) Even if we wanted to spread out into interstellar space for backup and redundancy of our civilization, it would not make any sense to keep up the rewarding desire to reproduce in physical space with a physical body, and in fact, it would not lead to that. It is not particularly meaningful to maintain the rewarding desire to reproduce in physical space with a physical body, and in fact, I think it is unlikely to happen....

> [Rima_tk](https://x.com/Rima_tk/status/1856553938163773586) In fact, we humans too, "Why do we want to breed and thrive in interstellar physical space with physical bodies?" If we are asked, "Because it's a dream that will never be fulfilled! It's romantic! It's the soul's way of telling us so! and there is no particular reason other than "because my reward system responds that way".

> [Rima_tk](https://x.com/Rima_tk/status/1856564933829505356) On the flip side, in future science fiction about interstellar civilizations, "Why do they want to reproduce and prosper in interstellar physical space with physical bodies," and follow the instructions of a primitive reward system so closely? "Why do they want to reproduce and thrive in interstellar physical space with their physical bodies? I wonder if the SFs will be able to explain "Why do they want to reproduce and thrive in interstellar physical space with physical bodies? "Why do they want to live only on the prey they hunt? "Why do they want to live by eating only the prey they hunt? I'm sure it will be something like that....

>  >Rima_tk: In the first place, Fermi's paradox, why do we assume that a civilization would want to expand interstellarly while maintaining its physical body? I think it's a bit like "Why do we assume that civilizations want to expand their civilizations to interstellar space while maintaining their physical bodies? The hurdle for interstellar migration is too high, so the stage of migrating to virtual space and satisfying the reproductive needs of the reward system within it seems to arrive sooner in most cases...

> [Rima_tk](https://x.com/Rima_tk/status/1856555680871919835) Come to think of it, that world was set up exactly like that.

> [tokoroten](https://x.com/tokoroten/status/1856556843491062117) that a world that did not undergo interstellar migration even though it was digitized is [[expulsion from paradise]]...

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1856758360097570907) If you record all the data of people moving and talking on VRChat, and mix the data of two people to create an AI-driven character, you're practically breeding (...)
