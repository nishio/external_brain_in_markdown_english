When using the KJ method to form teamwork, an approach that brings together relevant elements in one place and then describes the content of the group can be effective. The idea of "bringing together people of relevance in one place" may also be related to the observation that the majority values change as the group grows. This may be an important factor in the formation of teamwork.

From Nishio's research notes, we see a consideration that AI support for teamwork differs as the size of the organization increases. This may be related to my consideration that as the size of the organization increases, the balance between the majority and minority groups in the team changes, which in turn affects teamwork.

A new thought: "The observation that AI support for teamwork differs as the size of the organization increases may be related to the phenomenon of a shift in the balance between majority and minority groups within the team."

New question: "How does AI assistance affect teamwork, and specifically what changes can we expect to see?"

New Opinion: "With the help of AI, it may be possible to form efficient teamwork in large organizations."
