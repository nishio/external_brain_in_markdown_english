<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>[[Polis]] is an online deliberative democracy platform promoted by Audrey Tang and others. It aims to make diverse opinions visible and find consensus to overcome conflicts.
In the dialogue, Tang explains how bridge making statements work in Polis as follows

> the [[bridge-making statements]] will only work if it convinces both sides [link](https://moda.gov.tw/en/press/background-information/8655#145)
In other words, when votes are cast for a "bridge making statement" that connects opposing clusters, the statement has support from both sides. In this way, Polis is characterized by its ability to find consensus while encompassing diverse opinions.

In addition, Tang mentioned the idea of "[[Polis 2.0]]," which utilizes language models to summarize opinions by cluster and promote constructive dialogue.
> And what we call Polis 2.0, which is language modeling and evaluation works on top of this simple base and does two things: Synthesize a summary, including a synthetic avatar; and second, to steer conversation toward [[bridge-making statements]] the way your API does.

Thus, it can be said that Polis' ambition is to realize democratic decision-making by aggregating the wisdom of crowds and facilitating dialogue through the use of AI. Rather than incite division, Polis aims to pick up diverse voices and build consensus, and we understand that Tang sees great potential in Polis as a tool for this purpose.
