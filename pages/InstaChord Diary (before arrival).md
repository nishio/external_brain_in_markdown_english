    - It's a sound game that when you get a GREAT sound, you get a brain fart from the ear area.
- I noticed that you like ICN:3~.
- I noticed ICN:6251 from Thesis of the Cruel Angel popping up all over the place.

- I'm actually looking at InstaChord because of my bitter experience of buying an early [[udder]] and not being able to use it.
    - Udder is difficult to find.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - [[InstaChord is fun on day one.]] It's probably a lot of people, and then how they enjoy it, you know?
        - I think it's too hard for me to go into technicalities like [[arpeggio]], so I just play songs from this season's anime like karaoke.
- I ordered InstaChord because dithering around wasn't getting me anywhere.
    - Worst case scenario, if I get bored after a month, I conclude that I can ask for applicants in the unexplored junior chat room and give them away in a drawing.
- I added my observations of people instacoding to [New doors opened.

PS: It is [[overgeneralization]] + [[Pessimistic Misconceptions]] not to challenge something Y that appears afterwards because you tried something difficult X in the past and failed.
- Excessive generalizations that equate X and Y when they are not the same thing.
- Pessimistic misconceptions that lead people to stop trying because they assume from experience that it won't work in the future because it didn't work.

- Welcome [[Instacode]] #Instacode First Day Thoughts
        - [[It should be able to fly.]] を弾けた。むちゃくちゃ感動している<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/issac/icon' alt='/villagepump/issac.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I tried it, but it's so hard to play the hardest songs.
            - 7とかは無視して弾いてもOKですよ！<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - The 7 is a symbol for adding a fourth note, and it sounds similar without it
                        - [[seventh code]]
                    - The good thing about chordal instruments is that you can learn these areas while trying them out immediately.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
- It's fun to see someone out there who can talk about InstaChord.
    - I guess any experience can be useful!

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/mtane0412/icon' alt='/villagepump/mtane0412.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Instachord 3rd day or so.
        - [At any rate, an experience that can be played and talked about.
        - I've easily overcome the barrier of wanting to play it, which I hadn't been able to overcome for decades.

- Every day I play for about 2 hours in the morning on Instachord.
        - The resolution of [[Running into the night]] was raised a little bit, for example, "Running into the night" has two modulations.
        - I'm looking forward to hearing that transposition support is part of the update plan.

- I saw the well and wanted one, so I ordered myself [[InstaChord]] today.
    - International shipping from Amazon.co.jp so it will be a little while before it arrives
    - [InstaChord, an instrument-type device recommended for DTMers, which can be played even by those with zero experience with musical instruments [[guitar]] [typing]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QwIoW6ExLI)
        - Introductory video for [DTMer
        - >  That feeling of being able to create a song as you are playing along is something you can't do if you are using a computer program. (With InstaChord, you can do that... [** There are many people who understand how a song is created as they touch it. [Many people say that as they play with InstaChord, they gradually understand how a song is made. You can notice that after this chord, it often becomes this.
            - I really felt it.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/issac/icon' alt='/villagepump/issac.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/mtane0412/icon' alt='/villagepump/mtane0412.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - I can't wait to feel it!<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - [iOS app InstaChord-i](https://instachord.com/overview/app/)
        - I'm playing with the simulation app until it arrives. Already having fun.
        - I didn't know there was such a thing!<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - Interesting, I'm comfortable just playing [[canon progression]] for now.
            - be known<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/shoya140/icon' alt='/villagepump/shoya140.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I still can't play the chords in my head just by looking at the [[degree name]] sequence, and I'm hoping that exposure to InstaChord will help me build that mental model.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- I tried to pull "[[Merry Christmas Someday]]" on the InstaChord app and got frustrated because there were so many 4M7s.
    - Let's find a song that looks easy first.
    - Great, [It should be able to fly.
    - [[add9]] overlaps the major with a higher note 9 degrees above it.
        - [[astronomical observation]] , ignore add9 and 7 and play
    - Merry Christmas someday, what does 4M7 mean when the key is G. 4 is originally C
        - Oh, I see, the fourth note of 7 goes up a semitone.
        - Then I'll just ignore this one too.
        - There's some stuff in the A melody that doesn't make sense, like 7m7-5, but the chorus is only 7 and m7, so you can play it.
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/4192e8db0bf14fcf1393814e5e062717/thumb/1000)
        - The one that everyone makes.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - [[InstaChord basic playing method #63b4193f6eb4060000617de8]].
        - After all, you don't know what you're looking at when you look at someone else's, you write down what you know, and then you look at someone else's and you see the same thing, a certain composition.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - Let's check the answers against each other.
    - Updated.
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/f027e294b53fe418cfce7217ed95bc42/thumb/1000)
        - Separated by major and minor.
        - The top five are common.
        - sus4 messed up.
                - There is a lot of sus4 -> none.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
                    - You'll know it when you hear it, but it sounds like unstable to stable.
    - [[Rinbu-revolution]], you can't play it on the app because of the dim at the end of the chorus.
    - I can't substitute any other code around aug sus dim.
        - I'd only play the root note, or just the string where it fits, to fool them....<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - It seems like it would be better to charge and practice honestly than to play strange techniques. w<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I'm not sure if I'm going to pay for it or not. w
    - I bought it for $320, so I didn't hesitate.
        - Simultaneous pressing of flat and dim!
        - Semitone up!
        - interesting
    - [[Cruel Angel Thesis]], surprisingly, all the chords in the chorus are unmodified.
    - That feels so good.

- >  I bought InstaChord and couldn't wait for it to arrive so I bought the iOS app as well ($320 to release all codes).
- >  very interesting
- >  Smooth flow of playing with free iOS apps, then wanting to play dim and paying for it.

- Everyone's InstaChord situation is interesting.
    - This data seems to be something that is not readily available over the internet.
        - I generally swallow once and write it down, so any minor notices or misunderstandings are erased.

- InstaChord:
    - I was playing the chorus part on a loop and it entered my head, so I played the original song to try it out and was pleasantly surprised that it matched perfectly!
    - It's a beat'em-up game. When you get a "GREAT" sound, it's like a brain drug going off in your ears.
- So much more of [** see code with video
    - [https://www.ufret.jp/plus/](https://www.ufret.jp/plus/)
        - [[Habit]], [[I'd rather die.]] and [[Outdated Rock'n'Roll Band]] seen in [[Kohaku Utagassen 2022]].
    - I guess that means a higher percentage of songs covered that have been talked about since this system was established.

            - No way [[Cruel Angel Thesis]] progress w (6251)
            - I saw a YouTube video like "[[This song and this song actually have the same chord progression]]" and thought "Wow, I wonder how I can understand that," but now I do.
        - [Cherries (easy chords for beginners ver.) (video plus) / Ai Otsuka Guitar chords/ukulele chords/piano chords - U-fret video plus](https://www.ufret.jp/song.php?data=60139)
            - Key:G. The chords are simple, but I couldn't make it to the 4536251 folded in "Neighbor to Neighbor, You and Me, Cherry Blossoms".
                - I think I can do it if I practice this chord progression enough not to say, "What's next?
                - Oh, and the second half of this [[ICN:6251]].
    - After the first couple of days, my wife and I spontaneously broke into a chorus and said, "Oh, this is a fashionable thing that families who can play instruments do! I thought, "This is a fashionable thing that families who can play instruments do!
        - Both of us don't play instruments at all, so this was our first experience
        - The fact that it sounds decent enough to sing is amazing.
        - However, if you practice the one without video accompaniment, you will be told that the chords are fine but the uncle sings in an unstable pitch and unstable rhythm, which is unpleasant 🤣.
            - It's much better to be able to keep up with the song and skip over chords you can't keep up with or occasionally make a mistake.

I am going out to Osaka today and should receive the actual machine when I get back!
