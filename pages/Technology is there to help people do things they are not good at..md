> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1802872600408051770) "[[technology]] is essentially there to help people do [[weak (in)]] things. For people with poor eyesight, we have [[glasses]]; for people who are not good at math, we have [[calculators]]. In the same way, if AI and other technologies are properly disseminated so that everyone can use them easily, we can address each person's "weak" points."
