title: "Data or Rules."
---

- In [[ppoi]], I assumed a use case where the rules cannot be verbalized, but sample data can be provided.
- In some cases, they don't.
    - There is too much equivalent data that goes into unknown.txt.
    - Create some positives/negatives with miscellaneous rules, and then eyeball them and play the incorrect ones to create teacher data.
