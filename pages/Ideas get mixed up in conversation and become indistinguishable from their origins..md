Ideas get mixed up in conversation and become indistinguishable from their origins.

AI said it very well! I think.
- If you go back and look, you'll find yourself saying similar things.
- Is it useful at this time to identify whether it is AI-derived or self-derived?
- You're talking with a like-minded friend and you say to something they said, "Oh yeah! That's right!" and you feel like, "Oh, yeah!
    - In fact, the concept may be something I told the friend a long time ago.
    - What's wrong with that?
- Directly written strings are attributed to the individual who wrote them, there are sentences written by me and sentences written by OMNI.
    - However, the "idea" that the sentence refers to does not belong to the individual, does it?
    - [[Diagram of the correspondence between symbols and meanings]].
    - Since "meanings, ideas, and experiences" are essentially [[non-numerical]] and [human experience fundamentally has no clear boundaries, Therefore, by [[collaboration]] of [[conversation]], [[they]] inevitably [[become]] blended and indistinguishable], don't they?
