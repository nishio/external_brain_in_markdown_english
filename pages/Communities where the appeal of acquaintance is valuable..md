A community where [[appeal to acquaintances]] has value.
- I observed a case in which a person was sitting at another table in a café and asked the waitress, "What are these beans?" and received an answer that he did not understand. and when the answer came back that she didn't understand, she appealed that she knew someone from that place.
    - On behalf of your sister, I said in my mind, "What would you say then?" I said to her in my mind, "Then what are you saying?
- Coffee and other knowledge changes, so you have to pay "[[the cost of]] continuing to learn" to maintain value.
- On the other hand, "I know someone" does not disappear once a relationship is established, and the apparent value of the relationship improves through promotion, etc. due to the efforts of the other party, even without one's own efforts.
- In a community that values the appeal of "I know who you are", it would be reasonable to invest in that area.

- Appeal to acquaintance is inherently valuable because there are more than a few people who appreciate it.
    - It's not the "people who are making an acquaintance appeal" who are making a mistake, but the "people who appreciate acquaintance appeals."
    - If you make an appeal to someone you know, but you don't go at them, it's a sign that you realize you don't really have that much of a relationship with them.
        - It's not a mistake, it's intentional.
    - What people think is valuable has value #Social Proof Principle
