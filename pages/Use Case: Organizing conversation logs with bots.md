title: "Use Case: Organizing conversation logs with bots"
---

- I poured over the chat logs from [[Use Case: Importance of Grouping]].

The old one is below.

----
I found that I only used the chopped one, so I poured it into [Use Case Memo: Creating Presentation Materials from Scratch

-----
I did some more grouping, etc., but I was working offline and reloaded by mistake.
    - [[Reload when editing offline to avoid losing updates]]

----
I ended up placing it with just the chopped one.

chopped (e.g. meat)
- If you pour through the chat logs, it's more interesting to see the long-winded replies than the brief ones.
- But if you put it on a sticky note as it is, the letters will be small and hard to read.
    - Short, uninteresting responses that reply in short sentences stand out.
- Long sentences need to be chopped.
    - Need support for carving
    - Now I simply edit it myself as text and then import it: [[engrave on a sticky note]].
    - It would be nice to chop on the system to keep reference to the original text and be able to see it in the detailed view of the sticky note
