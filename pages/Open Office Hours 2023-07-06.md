Areas with high [[profitability]] will have free competition and autonomous [[social decision-making]].
What areas are not profitable?
    - [[tax]] and [[CSR]] came in.
- There is a bias in the stakeholders involved in decision making.
- Can we make some kind of improvement?
    - Financial indicators?

Providing People
- Provide people from large companies
    - People who don't have what they want to do, who are not motivated, who don't have the mindset? People who don't have the
    - Have them work a little in areas that don't make money but are beneficial to society.
    - Because you can't design that kind of thing.
            - [[loan deal]] を連想した<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Nomura Research Institute and Miyoshi City, Tokushima Prefecture case study?
- What specific resources are distributed by this activity?
    - Where appreciation is gained for the individual.
    - They don't get the thanks they deserve in big business.
        - Because they are far away from the beneficiaries of the benefits they generate, it is difficult for them to feel that their activities are creating happy people in society.
        - Working in close proximity to [[beneficiaries]] makes it easier for them to understand the benefits of working and gives them motivation.
        - The company that seconds the employees to the company wants employees who are enthusiastic by it.

DAO's Challenge
- social common capital
- We're getting a lot of helpful approaches.
- Especially when people who have cryptocurrency assets put up money to ~.
- Incentive Design
    - I'll have a billion dollars put in and try it out.

Self-introduction by each member

    - Why were you called here?
    - > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1676437886999363584): Both DeCartography and Polis can be viewed as systems that create value by collecting the subjective opinions of many people in a certain format. Polis has no means of distributing the "value" to the participants, while DeCartography tries to create a means of distribution.
        - Sunazuka-san saw this and shared it on Discord, and Motoshima-san said, "We're connected on Twitter," and approached me via DM.
        - I see!
    - Impact is "good for society"
        - The scale to measure this is the problem.
        - CO2 reductions and so on.
            - Is this really the appropriate scale?
        - A bias that, by attempting to create an objective measure, leads to the selection of indicators that are easier to objectively measure at this point in time.
            - Incorrect KPI setting derails decision making.
        - On the contrary, I am interested in [[DeCartography]], [[Polis]], and [[Plurality]] by trying to unite the subjectivity of many.

Grants from [Gitcoin
- good plan
- But focus on the PUBLIC GOOD on the digital
- Can we create a scheme that replaces the real world PUBLIC GOOD?
- For companies that make a profit from Web3, there is a profit in the development of the Web3 ecosystem, so they invest in public goods to enrich the Web3 world.
    - The question is how to bring it to our world.
    - Create incentives by tweaking the tax system?
    - It is a scheme that works for existing NPOs and public corporations, so leveraging it?

I want people to be rewarded for doing good.
- Return local tokens to those who solve local problems, even on a small scale.
    - Coins that can only be used in the region.

    - In short, good and smart people should cull them [[philosopher's politics]].
- impact investment

        - What is the validity of that selection?
        - The public cannot judge.
        - Experts and specialists
- In local government?
    - We'll start with DAOs and community participants.
    - Then there are the surrounding residents.
    - Affected parties
        - There is an incentive to participate.
        - I want to have a vote.

        - The right to reflect is a resource to be traded.
    - People in the next neighborhood will be affected, right? Can I come in?

    - Subjectively, it's natural to give greater credit to those that are closer to you because they have a greater impact on you.
    - The person's subjective view actually matters.
    - You can't find it because you're chasing a nonexistent entity.

Size Matters in Society
- The needs of the individual no longer match the needs of society.
    - Society has grown too big for its own good.
    - So the person making the investment is not getting a return on their investment.
- Wouldn't a smaller community make it easier to match?
    - Small communities
    - Face size
    - It's easy to notice [[mutually beneficial relationships]].
- It is important for one person to participate in several communities.
    - You can leave a community you don't like.
    - Being able to move to a good community is a vote of confidence in the community #MobileVote
    - But [[there is a difficulty in leaving a community that is tied to the land]].

a matter of subjectivity
