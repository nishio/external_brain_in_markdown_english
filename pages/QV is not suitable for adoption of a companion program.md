title: "QV is not suitable for adoption of a companion program"
---

Programs such as [[Unexplored Projects]], where applicants propose projects and the PM selects the selected projects and accompanies them for about 6 months, are not compatible with [[Quadratic Voting]].
- This is due to the fact that the nature of "[[accompanying]]" is different from that of money
- Quadratic Voting is a [[consensus-building mechanism]] that may or may not be suitable for some situations, such as the nature of the goods to be distributed. It should be noted that it is not a magic wand that makes everything better.

Specific examples
- There are four PMs.
- Suppose Project A receives votes 1,1,1,1 and Project B receives votes 15,0,0,0
- At this time, Quadratic Voting selects project A
- From PM1's point of view, it appears that "Project B, which I pushed for, was rejected because the other PMs did not understand it.
- Even if we were to accompany Project A (+1), it would be difficult to have the same [[enthusiasm]] as for Project B (+15)

This is due to the fact that the resource of "enthusiasm" [[tightly coupled with the individual]] cannot be separated and is difficult to control externally
- Programs that offer "enthusiasm" as a value must think carefully about how to produce more of this valuable resource.

What I wrote here is that QV is not suited to provide "companionship."
- Conversely, the "funding" part, which removes the accompaniment, does not.
- For example, I think [[Quadratic Funding]] is a possible solution to the problem that both software and hardware projects of the unexplored juniors are not good with a budget of 500,000.

    - What prompted me to write this article
    - > In some cases, the current item-by-item scoring may be suitable for review under different conditions, while in others, secondary voting (Quadratic Voting) or Quadratic Funding may be more appropriate.
    - I totally agree with the point that some conditions are not suitable for others, and I thought it would be better to verbalize "in what cases are/are they suitable" and "in what cases are they not suitable".
- Unexplored Junior believes that "scores should not be evaluated by sums or averages.
        - [[Generalists are selected when evaluated by sum]]
    - This method does not require consensus building among multiple mentors in the first place.
- In some cases, the "harmonic mean of rankings" is used when ranking for footnotes.
        - [[Harmonized average of ranks to get the sharpest talent]]
- [[social cut corners]] are curtailed by making it "one PM's discernment" instead of "adopted by consensus of multiple people."
    - If the adopted project ends up with an iffy result, it is because of the PM's poor discernment skills.
    - PMs have an incentive to believe in their own discernment abilities and support the projects they adopt, even if other PMs do not evaluate them.
    - [[Direct matching is important for human network formation]]
        - Even as a [[Human Network Formation System]], it is preferable to have a clear [[individual]] adopt it rather than a vague [[organization]].
