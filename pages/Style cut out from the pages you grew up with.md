Style cut out from the pages you grew up with
from [/villagepump/ One of the reasons that the well is working so well is that there seems to be more than one person to cut out](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/ One of the reasons that the well is working so well is that there seems to be more than one person to cut out).
- Scrapbox is a[[cut-out cost]] が低いUIになっている<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
- from the start[[The idea of cutting out]] がScrapboxに触れるまであったっけと思った<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/yosider/icon' alt='/villagepump/yosider.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - [[collaboration]] という意味ならあったと思うけど相互参照できるリンクの仕組みは見たことなかったので、発想はなかったかも<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>
- It's pretty easy to cut out UI-wise, but it's harder than you might think to figure out where to cut out.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/Mijinko_SD/icon' alt='/villagepump/Mijinko_SD.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - [[Difficulty points for cutting out pages]]
    - [[Readers, writers, and cutouts.]] There is a roll of [[Readers, writers, and cutouts.]] The balance of this is going to change the way the Scrapbox project is going to be.
    - [If you don't initiate the project, no one else will.
        - [[Loneliness Project]]
- Can this act of cutting out also be [[Interpretation in divergence and convergence lincography]]?
    - Feels like a kind of convergent thinking.
    - Not simply cut out, but additional[[convergent thinking]] が行われてることがある<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - For example, you can re-combine related topics that are branches of multiple people's diaries into a single page.
        - Now that we have a clearer definition of convergent thinking, we can describe this one with a higher resolution.
            - Mr. A saw Mr. B's branch and simply wrote something related to it on his own branch, which is simply [[Continuing the topic]].
            - If Mr. A is writing about a certain topic and I write, "This seems to involve Mr. B's ~," this is a [[convergent move]] by Mr. A.
            - If Mr. A wrote something related to Mr. B without realizing it himself, and Mr. C cut those two things out and put them together, then Mr. C is doing a convergent thought move.
