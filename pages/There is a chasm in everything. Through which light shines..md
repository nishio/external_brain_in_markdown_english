From this comment,
- First accept that reality is inherently imperfect.
- It is through that "rift" that salvation, forgiveness, and a new beginning (LIGHT) are brought about.
The two-stage message of the work is clear: "The world is a place of hope," and "The world is a place of hope is a place of hope. While using religious imagery (bells, doves, and light), the work is characterized by its function as a universal "theology of hope" that crosses the boundaries of Judaism, Buddhism, and Christianity.
