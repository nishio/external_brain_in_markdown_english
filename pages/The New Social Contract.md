title: "The New Social Contract"

> [@0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1639569516450443264?s=20): I think it's more futuristic to tie a new [[social compact]] for the turbulent times afterwards than to create AI services. I think you're more of a futuristic entrepreneur. Most people don't get it. And those who say it's [[impossible]] are just saying you'll never be able to do it.

It's easy to imagine people reacting with, "I can't sign a new social contract."
- but that's just the [[conceptual resolution]] of the "social contract"!
- Not all of today's "social contract bundles" were born at once.
- Not that the "social contract bundle" hasn't been changing all along.

The "social contract bundle" is like a [[gene pool]] in organisms, where genes adapted to the environment reproduce and multiply to become mainstream.
- You recently wrote a related story.
- Oh, this one.
    - [[Social innovation legitimizes governance.]]
    - After a good [[gene]] has spread, it is described as "the species has acquired new capabilities through [[evolution]]"
    - Similarly, after a good [[mounting]] is spread, it is described as "[[social innovation]] happened.
- [[Democracy needs to evolve into a real-time system]].
    - To use a biological analogy, this means that as a new environment, a real-time system, becomes available, a species is created that has evolved to adapt to that environment.
