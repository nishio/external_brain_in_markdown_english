- [[Switching Weekly Journal]]
- Why switch [[weekly journal]] irregularly?
- The diary automatically generates pages every day.
- It is not difficult to automatically generate a page each week for a weekly journal as well.
- Why not do it?
- If nothing special happens, switch to Saturday and Sunday.
    - The fact that it hasn't switched means something is wrong.
- It could be one page in two weeks.
- I'd notice the next weekday and do the switchover.
- The fact that you are doing the switch is a barometer of your mental capacity.
- Two weeks go by without a changeover, which is an undesirable state of mind because you're losing [[your mental capacity]].
- Sometimes, as in this case, the switch is made for a shorter period of time in advance.
    - This is very good, anticipating that you will not be able to afford it, and preparing for it while you can afford it in advance.
- It's a record of this kind of [[lack of mental capacity]].
