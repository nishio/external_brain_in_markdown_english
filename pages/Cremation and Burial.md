Cremation (cremation, kasō)
- Predominant Practice: In modern Japan, cremation is the most common method. This practice has been widely adopted for various reasons, including limited land space for burials and religious beliefs.
- Buddhist Influence: [[Buddhism]], which has a significant influence on Japanese culture, typically prefers cremation. It is seen as a way to free the soul from the body.
- Ceremony: The cremation process in Japan is often accompanied by a ceremony. Family members may participate in the final farewell by placing flowers in the casket or, in some cases, picking bones out of the ashes with chopsticks, transferring them to an urn.
- Final Resting Place: The ashes are usually kept in a family grave or columbarium.

Burial (burial, dosō)
- Less Common: Traditional in-ground burial is less common in Japan compared to cremation. This is partly due to the scarcity of land and the high cost of maintaining graves.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> In these days, it is difficult to find graveyard which allows burial.
- Cultural Shifts: While historically more common, the shift towards cremation began in the late 19th to early 20th centuries and has become the norm.
- Religious Contexts: Some religious practices in Japan, particularly in [[Shinto]], the indigenous spirituality of Japan, originally preferred burial, but over time, cremation became more integrated into these religious practices.

In summary, while both cremation and burial are part of Japanese funerary customs, cremation is much more prevalent today due to practical, religious, and cultural reasons. The ceremonies and rituals surrounding death in Japan are deeply respectful and are important parts of saying farewell to loved ones.
