title: "Electric cars are home appliances"

A line that came up in the context of the recent [[CES]] being all about [[electric cars]]: "Electric cars are [[appliances]]."

> When the author first attended CES, it was often referred to as the "Consumer Electronics Show," but the scope of the event has gradually expanded.

The interesting part of your case study
- The idea that "CES is a consumer electronics trade show" is "an existing [[frame of mind]]."
- Focusing on [[existing framework]] prevents understanding of [[real phenomenon]] "CES is full of electric cars".
- The "consumer electronics" and "CES" [[the meaning of the words]] are not dots, but expansive.
