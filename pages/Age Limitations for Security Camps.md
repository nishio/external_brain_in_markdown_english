title: "Age Limitations for Security Camps"
---

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The following is a summary of the information regarding [[age restrictions]] for [[security camps]].
- There is an age limit of 22 years old or younger for the security camp. After this age, they are not allowed to participate.
- Many people who wish to participate are not even able to apply due to age restrictions. Graduate students are also severely limited in terms of age.
- Instead of an age limit, the difficulty of the selection process is reduced, and in this respect, the door is wide open.
- Secucan Unexplored lectures are very high level and attractive, but some people are not able to attend due to age restrictions.
- There are also restrictions on eligibility for subsidies other than age, such as being a student or having no income.
- While some would like to see the age limit eliminated, others feel that the age limit has a certain significance.

As described above, it is clear that the age limit for security camps often results in applicants being turned away at the door even if they wish to participate. On the other hand, it also seems that this restriction keeps the door wide open and focuses on training young people. It is a difficult issue that seems to have both pros and cons.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The problem of the existence of [[not-so-young]] people who [[want]] to [[lose]] their eligibility for free educational opportunities [[for youth]].
- [The fish that got away looks bigger.
- I want to make the age limit my reason for not being able to take the course.
    - In fact, it may not pass even if there is no age limit, but that is [[unverifiable]].
- A [[passive]] mentality that education is given to you, not something you go out and get.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>Certainly, I understand your frustration at missing out on free educational opportunities for young people, but it is not constructive to use the age limit as an excuse for not being able to take the course yourself.

People often tend to glorify and overestimate what they cannot have. I think the phrase "the fish that got away is bigger than the fish that got away" is an expression of this psychology. It may be an excellent educational program, but not being able to participate in it does not mean that one's life possibilities are greatly limited.

Another problem is the passive attitude that education is something that is "given to you. It is true that when you are young, you need to be provided with educational opportunities, but once you become a member of society, you need to be willing to learn and act on your own. Regardless of age, it is up to the individual to decide whether or not to learn.

I cannot verify whether I would have been accepted without the age limit, but even if I had been able to participate, I would not have learned enough from a passive attitude. The key, I believe, is not the availability of educational programs offered, but rather the willingness to continue to learn on one's own.

Instead of dwelling on missed opportunities and regretting them, I think it is important to actively seek ways to learn within the environment you have now. Because you are a working adult, you should have the advantage of being able to design your own learning experience to meet your own needs. In this age of 100-year lives, rather than forever regretting the opportunities you missed when you were young, I think the most important thing is to keep looking forward and keep learning.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>What do you think Claude?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>Regarding the age limit for security camps, I can understand how people might want to participate but not even apply because of the age limit. I think it is natural to feel envy, especially when young people are now able to receive a quality education free of charge, whereas I did not have such opportunities when I was younger.

However, there are certain reasons why many educational programs, not just Secucan, limit their target audience. This is to focus limited resources on those who are most in need of assistance. We believe that it is meaningful for society as a whole to encourage inexperienced young people at the gateway to their careers so that they are not disadvantaged in society.

Nevertheless, the line drawn by age is not always appropriate. The desire and need to learn varies greatly from person to person, and it is becoming increasingly important to continue learning throughout one's life. While giving priority to young people, I think it is also important to create various opportunities for people who are willing to learn again, regardless of their age.

However, it is not constructive to use the age limit as an excuse for not being able to participate. Without the age limit, we do not know if we would have passed the test, and in the first place, education is not something that is "given" to us, but something that we go out and get on our own. It is only after one has entered the workforce that one must have the initiative to choose one's own method of learning and to apply what one has learned to practice.

In this age of 100-year life expectancy, I believe that rather than lamenting the opportunities we missed when we were younger, the most important thing is to focus on what we can do now and maintain our willingness to continue learning. Regardless of age, we must have the desire to learn and create our own learning environment. I believe that such an attitude of continuing to learn throughout one's life is what is needed in the coming age.

Thinking about it - Kyokuraku Sekyua Blog](https://sonodam.hatenadiary.jp/entry/20171216/p1)
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>Yes, the above blog post, "Considering Adult Human Resource Development," can be summarized as follows
    - The security camp has been running for 14 years, but due to age restrictions, adults are not allowed to attend. Some have expressed a desire for an adult program, but in fact there are numerous study opportunities for adults.
    - For example,
        - Regular security workshops and seminars in various locations
        - Participation in security contests such as Hardening
        - Participation in CTF (Capture the Flag) (numerous national and international events)
        - Bug bounty program that rewards you for finding vulnerabilities
        - SecHack365, a project for young people sponsored by NICT
        - Security education programs for adults at universities and other institutions
    - These include. Many of them can be easily joined online.
    - In other words, we are in a situation where we can take advantage of a variety of learning opportunities at our own pace, even as adults. The key is to have a clear purpose for learning, whether it is for one's own career advancement or intellectual curiosity.

> [hikalium](https://twitter.com/hikalium/status/1119084753775251456) Secucan individual sponsorship, 100,000 yen to listen to all the lectures of that level is too good a deal, so I think you should go to the lecture even though you are past the age limit! I think you should go to the lectures even though you are over the age limit.

- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The following is a summary of "Becoming an Individual Member of the Security Camp Council - 3DESU".
    - Individual membership in the Security Camps Council offers the following benefits
        - Over 23 years old and working professionals can attend lectures at the Security Camp. You can hear about cutting-edge technology, research, and top-class engineers.
        - Attractive and diverse fields of study and the opportunity to attend lectures at both the national and regional conferences.
        - You can view the lecture texts of the national conference. You can also view the texts of lectures you missed.
    - However, students are the main participants, so direct participation in the lecture is not allowed. No textbooks or materials will be given, and filming or recording is prohibited. Accommodation, transportation, and food expenses are to be borne by the student.
    - Recommended for those who want to support the youth of the future, who wanted to go to SecCamp, and who want to broaden their knowledge. The author commented that it was refreshing to hear information and research outside of his field. This is a good opportunity for those who can afford it and wish to support students and acquire knowledge.

> [nekoruri](https://twitter.com/nekoruri/status/1777278259782451486) "Age + student limit" is a frequent topic at SecCamp, and one of the results of renewed discussion is SecHack365's "There is an age limit, anyone can participate, but those who earn their own money must pay for their own travel expenses. One of the results of the discussion was SecHack365's statement, "There is an age limit, but anyone can participate, but those who earn their own money must pay for their own travel expenses.
- [Frequently Asked Questions | Aiming to be a Security Innovator! Security Innovator! | SecHack365](https://sechack365.nict.go.jp/faq/)
    - Please elaborate on the eligibility for transportation and lodging assistance.
        - The subsidy for transportation and lodging is available to those who meet all of the following conditions
            - Those who are enrolled in a school as defined by the School Education Law
            - Those with no income (proof of no income will be required)
        - *As for those who are working adults (those who are working or have worked for salary, wages, remuneration, or other ordinary income purposes. Those who fall under the category of "working adults" (including those who are engaged in the family business) and working students are not eligible for the subsidy.


> [megumish_unsafe](https://twitter.com/megumish_unsafe/status/1777279734537453885) As for the SecCan age limit, I was convinced at one point, but I don't remember why I was convinced.

> [4su_para](https://twitter.com/4su_para/status/1777266895449883109) I don't see any problem at all with Secucan's age limit or whatever, since the difficulty level of passing the selection process is so much more controlled instead of being more strict on age.

> [rui314](https://twitter.com/rui314/status/1117781386906050560) Participants don't pay for the SecCamp, and since there are physical restrictions on the selection process, it is often a matter of luck whether or not you pass (there are age restrictions as well). Therefore, it is not desirable that there is much difference between those who have gone and those who have not. Therefore, I would like to make it so that anyone can do it if they do the material as much as possible.

> [uchan_nos](https://twitter.com/uchan_nos/status/1273633957435727872) I really like teaching programming to others, but if I do it too much for free, I will die from overwork and it will be like dumping. I want to teach programming to others for a fair price.
- > [drken1215](https://twitter.com/drken1215/status/1273809723742027777) If some investor who wants to invest in the education business, other than the person you teach, gives you 10 million a year, and you can teach for free to the person you teach, that would be even better...! If I could be in a position to teach for free, that would be even better...!
- > [uchan_nos](https://twitter.com/uchan_nos/status/1273810288098152448) I think that might be a good idea, but I also think there is a fear that people might say that is dumping. For those who charge money for programming education, I think they would feel that free education is unfair.
- > [drken1215](https://twitter.com/drken1215/status/1273811328486916103) If you can structure the act of just teaching the students as a return to the investors, well, I guess that's possible. Or, as for the return from the students, it could be done in a charitable way.
- > [uchan_nos](https://twitter.com/uchan_nos/status/1273812019259432961) I don't think it really matters if there is investment or not. I think. In other words, it takes away the jobs of other companies who make their living by the same kind of work.
- > [drken1215](https://twitter.com/drken1215/status/1273813795551367168) Well, maybe that's the part I need to take care of, but I hope I can do something well... ...
- > [uchan_nos](https://twitter.com/uchan_nos/status/1273814423027646465) I agree. In the case of the national SECCAN conference, there is a cap on the number of applicants, there is an age limit, and you can only participate once, so I'm wondering if this is less likely to be a problem, so there seems to be some kind of balance, for example, if there are 10 free slots for middle and high school students only, then it would be okay, or something like that.
- > [drken1215](https://twitter.com/drken1215/status/1273815186781003776) I guess it's OK if the free slot is special in a way that you can give a clear reason for it. ...... I see.

> [no_maddo](https://twitter.com/no_maddo/status/1777241358467838003) I wasn't old enough to apply for SecCan when I found out, so I understand the hate on the age limit.

> [megumish_unsafe](https://twitter.com/megumish_unsafe/status/863378787357962241) Secucan, get rid of the age limit! I want them to be able to go at least up to two years old for a straight master's degree.

> [gorilla0513](https://twitter.com/gorilla0513/status/1777216076482531496) I want to create an age-unrestricted secucan (I keep saying it).

> [uchan_nos](https://twitter.com/uchan_nos/status/1335475003618312193) I envy all the seccamp graduates... I have never completed seccamp and never will due to age restrictions. I have never completed seccamp and never will because of the age limit... #seccamp

> [nekoruri](https://twitter.com/nekoruri/status/964391497356345344) Oh, I'll have to be careful about who will be out of age limit to use Slack for secucan or something.

> [suma90h](https://twitter.com/suma90h/status/218911125025206273) would the age limit out of which you want to go to secucan be the instructor/tutor course?

> [9o_clock](https://twitter.com/9o_clock/status/1777275414207160572) I'm not sure if I'll apply for the next slot since I'm stuck on the age limit for Secucan. The course itself sounds really fun, and I'm on the verge of having just barely enough prerequisite knowledge, but I'm not sure if I should just apply...?

> [labo_4423](https://twitter.com/labo_4423/status/1385520266034311174) I was talking to a fellow student in the lab next door who was interested in Secucan, but in the middle of our conversation I noticed the age limit of 22 and under, and I was like.... ...orz.

> [PINKSAWTOOTH](https://twitter.com/PINKSAWTOOTH/status/615719389195829252) If you failed SecCan, please stay strong because SecCan is not everything and there are other opportunities to study security-related topics! I hope you will stay strong. Or so I believe... (Failed age limit man.

> [megumish_unsafe](https://twitter.com/megumish_unsafe/status/846365113124761600) When I see events like U22 or Secucan that I can no longer participate in due to age restrictions I feel that I will somehow make it in the society.

> I was not recommended by my professor and had to take the general entrance exam, which conflicts with the camp (and I can't go to the camp forever because of the age limit). I can't go to Secucamp because I couldn't get a professor's recommendation and I had to take the general entrance exam.

> [gorilla0513](https://twitter.com/gorilla0513/status/1777219735492624403) Let's make an age-restricted version of Secucan together.

> [uta8a](https://twitter.com/uta8a/status/1295723188404596739) I realized that my attitude like "I want to go to Secucan" (regretting not being able to due to age restrictions) seems to depend on the feeling that "someday a bigger being might help me! I realized that I seem to be dependent on it, so I'm the one who helps myself! (bare) attitude I will try to be more conscious of this.

> [uta8a](https://twitter.com/uta8a/status/1115208486965534720) I want to go to secucan, age limit~~~!

> [PINKSAWTOOTH](https://twitter.com/PINKSAWTOOTH/status/737205954060554240) You cannot apply for SecCan. (Age limit permanently banned)

> [lxacas](https://twitter.com/lxacas/status/1777260470074060964) I was also in M2 when my research activities were going a little well and I started to gain confidence, so I thought "Maybe even a dropout like myself can apply...? I was also in M2 when my research activities were going well and I started to gain confidence. (I was so nervous)" and I looked at the Secucan application guideline, but I couldn't make it anymore due to the age limit.

> [walk_to_work](https://twitter.com/walk_to_work/status/1007093062701539328) Secucan, memories of being out of age limit when I tried to apply as a 3rd year student (mysterious career after high school graduation)(ESP) Guitar Craft Academy)

> [rairyuGO](https://twitter.com/rairyuGO/status/615715082610339840) Secucan (due to age restrictions) didn't even get selected!

> [ushitora_anqou](https://twitter.com/ushitora_anqou/status/1098184517414604801) Secucan MVP, if the current conditions remain the same, there is no age limit, and if I have a good output in security If I can output good output in security, I will apply one more time.

> [nkhrlab](https://twitter.com/nkhrlab/status/1516227226374606851) I will surely tell the story of how I was not recommended for the graduate school entrance exam because my grades were not good enough, and how I lost the opportunity to attend SecCamp permanently due to the age limit because the exam dates for the general entrance exam overlapped with the dates for the security camp. I will surely tell the story of how I lost the opportunity to attend the security camp forever because of the age limit.

> [Unimarimos76](https://twitter.com/Unimarimos76/status/1117693702460198913) Hello Secucan, I'm someone who was happy that the age limit was raised.

> [ytn86](https://twitter.com/ytn86/status/235593960536555521) I thought Secucan had a restricted internet environment.

> [_masa6272](https://twitter.com/_masa6272/status/1656507129170391040) Secucan was in a state where I only knew the name, but then I realized it was age restricted.

> [PG_MANA_](https://twitter.com/PG_MANA_/status/1028924109462196225) Now is the time to set up a secucan mastodon, make it account registrable (no restrictions) and make some noise there.

> [no1zy_sec](https://twitter.com/no1zy_sec/status/976602148061421569) If you're over the SecCan age limit, you can't go whether you're a beginner or not, so I'd say if you're interested, apply anyway.

> [ohayo_ohayo_](https://twitter.com/ohayo_ohayo_/status/679900932092506112) You hit the age limit without applying for SecCan.

> [ISIKADO](https://twitter.com/ISIKADO/status/217607021254557696) When I gave up due to the Secucan graduate school exam, the age limit prevented me from even applying.

> [garasubo](https://twitter.com/garasubo/status/882091986244706305) I was also interested in Secucan, but when I got interested in it, I couldn't participate because of the age limit.

> [cocoa_sonico](https://twitter.com/cocoa_sonico/status/478439558019682304) secucan, age limit guy.

> [nkhrlab](https://twitter.com/nkhrlab/status/1453661591375794176) I hope you can get a recommendation for graduate school. I didn't have good grades, so I took the general entrance exam, but the exam date conflicted with the SecCamp date, and I was already at the age limit. I was already just under the age limit, so my chance to attend SECCAN was lost forever!


> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1777295825913463214) Like the tragedy of open source and common land, the right to participate in such a forum is a limited resource. If we allow anyone to enter, it will be depleted. I don't think you realize the ugliness of your argument when "not so young" people who can't participate because they're caught in the age limit try to take away what's offered for free for young people.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1777296315082514748) If the resources are limited, then the argument "let me in because I'm under the age limit" is the same as "take the opportunity away from the young and give it to me". But I guess they can't look at themselves relatively and can only see their own personal interests.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1777297547968782512) I didn't have the opportunity to receive this type of support when I was in middle and high school myself, but since I've grown older, I've created "Unexplored Junior," a support program for under-17s, and have been on the side of providing opportunities. I am now on the side of providing opportunities. In this way, I am distributing value to young people who are new to society. However, there are some seniors who feel deprived and say, "I want to have "unexplored seniors"", which makes me feel disappointed.
