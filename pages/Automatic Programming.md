<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>[[FORTRAN]], a programming language developed by IBM in 1957, is particularly suited for numerical and scientific calculations. Early FORTRAN advocated "automatic programming" and was designed to allow scientists and engineers to enter mathematical expressions directly into programs. This greatly reduced the effort of traditional [[machine language]] programming and made programming available to a much wider audience.
