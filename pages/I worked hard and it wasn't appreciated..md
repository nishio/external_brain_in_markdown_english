This is due to an overestimation of self-assessment or different standards of assessment by others.

5.  [[imposter syndrome]]
- [Low self-esteem: People with low self-esteem tend to seek excessive evaluation from others and often feel that their efforts are not appreciated. This tendency is particularly strong when evaluation by parents was harsh.

6.[[excessive modesty and insecurity]].
- [[Masked self]]: When the masked self that you have worked hard to create is evaluated, you feel that it is not the real you and your anxiety is not relieved. This can cause them to feel that they are not appreciated even though they work hard.
    - from  [[The relationship between being an idiot and asking questions and Imposter Syndrome.]]

7.[[discrepancy between others' evaluations and competence]].
