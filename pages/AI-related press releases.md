    - [[College Test Parable]]
- When there was a good test with a score of 70.
- A score of 65 is still acceptable.
    - This is what we call "hitting the AI-related press release".
        - [[Attendance point]]-like nuance
    - Press releases make customers say "hmmm, not so good" when they try to use it.
- You don't know if you're going to get a 65 or a 75 until you try.
    - We have to produce the best of the many prototypes we've generated without discussing "what we should do" in advance.
- Even if you give them a 75, customers will demand a 90.
    - The task of raising a score from 75 to 90 is harder than making a 75, plus it's not newsworthy.
- And even if you reach 90 points, customers will still ask for 120 points.
    - Even if it's physically impossible because it's a 100-point score, the customer doesn't know that.
