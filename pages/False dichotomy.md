Mr. A thinks X and Y are in conflict and "distant"
But Mr. B thinks that X and Y are close, that there is a Z that opposes them.

concrete example
    - [[Mandatory regular leave also low discretionary status]]
    - A" counterposes "thorough implementation of no-overtime day X" with "forced overtime work condition Y" of a black company.
    - B counterposes discretionary work Z with no fixed hours, which both X and Y see as "a state of being deprived of discretion over when to work".
- I don't want to live, but I don't want to die either."
    - Mr. A believes it is a dichotomy between "wanting to live" and "wanting to die."
    - Mr. B says, "I don't want to die," "I don't want to live," and "I just want to go away."
        - Dichotomy of "wanting to be active" and "not wanting to be active"
        - I recognize that both "living" and "dying" are active actions.
            - (Off-topic if this perception is correct)

- [["Does a dog have Buddha nature?" (classic Zen koan)]]" is a false dichotomy.
    - Whether dogs have Buddha nature or not is a false dichotomy
    - see  [[the sound of one hand clapping (a classic Zen koan)]]

- One of the specific patterns of [dialectics
    - [[dialectic development]]

Q: What is the relationship with [[false dichotomy]]?
- The point about the "false dichotomy" implicitly assumes the existence of a boundary, which begs the question, "Is there really a boundary?" I get the sense that you're asking the question, "Are there really boundaries?
- The "false dichotomy" doesn't negate the original conflict itself.
    - There is an additional axis of conflict.
            - [[There is more than one axis.]]
    - It's like you're telling someone who implicitly sees the original conflict as a "big one" that it's a small conflict and there's a bigger one.
        - Maybe it's subjective whether it's big or not.

False dichotomy
There is no clear [[boundary]], [[gradation]], and yet we assume there is.
