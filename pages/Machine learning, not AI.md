> [@kazunori_279](https://twitter.com/kazunori_279/status/1666991583546466304?s=20): I respect this branding. "Apple likes to be precise and seems to think it's more accurate to label features like personalized volume and smart stacks as "[[machine learning]]" (mentioned 7 times) rather than the vague "[[AI]]" [.yahoo.co.jp/articles/e0347820270e0fdc61eb9adf3abefd778136ae3f Why Apple Didn't Use the Word "AI" at WWDC (Overseas) (Business Insider Japan) - Yahoo! News](https://news)

It's not that we're cautious about adopting buzzwords, it's that we pride ourselves on really creating something new in the world, so we don't have to get on board with the "new-ish buzzwords" that other people create.
- They make up new words and try to make them popular, don't they? They try to make new words like "[[spatial computer]]" or, a little while ago, "[[differential privacy]]".
    - [[Imitating others is what losers do.]]
