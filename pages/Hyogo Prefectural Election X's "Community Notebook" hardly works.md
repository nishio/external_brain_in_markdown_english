> Code for Japan, a general incorporated association of IT engineers and others, and a research group led by Professor Hiroyuki Fujishiro of Hosei University extracted and analyzed election-related "community notes" created in X during the Hyogo Prefecture gubernatorial election, for which voting was held last November.
>  The result is that of the 165 notes created, only 5 were published temporarily and almost none were available to the public.
>  A note was created to add that Mr. Inamura himself denies the allegations made about the candidate, Kazumi Inamura, that "if elected, a foreign carrot regime will be established," but the original post was viewed over 500,000 times without being made public.
>  The research group believes that the notes were rarely published and did not work in the election because of conflicting claims and the tendency for people to evaluate even incorrect information differently.
