work as life
    - I had misunderstood the concept of "work as life" in [[Yoichi Ochiai]] until now.
    - The idea of [[work-life balance]] separates [[work]] and [[life]] and opposes them separately, but I think a way to separate [[stressful]] and [[stressless]] would be more useful than this way of thinking. Proposal
- In the course of my working life, I somehow became infected with the meme of opposing "work and life," clearly separating [[work]] and [[recess]], and feeling like [I need to rest on my day off.
- But "not being able to do the work you care about" causes [stress
- It is better to abandon the composition that puts work and life in [[antagonism]] and say, "It's okay to work on your days off!" It's more satisfying to be able to work on your days off.
- This type of discussion is difficult to communicate because each person's labor environment is different. #Each person's environment is different
    - For those who have already piled up stressful work beyond their capacity, holidays are a limited chance to restore balance, so the statement "I can work on my days off, yay!" may seem like [[madness]].

- This is an example of [[false dichotomy]].

- It has come to be pointed out that [[work-hour limiting work style reform]] based on the idea that "people should be happier if they spend less time working" by separating work and life was [a harmful meme
    - Example: [[Decline in Japan's Research Capability]].
        - > After April 1, 2024, [[work-style reform]] requires permission for overtime work over 960 hours per year -> even more difficult to find time for research
