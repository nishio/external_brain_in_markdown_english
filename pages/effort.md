- [Monument of Effort" by Sadaharu Oh
- > On September 3, 1977, at 7:10:05 p.m., Sadaharu Oh hit his 756th home run at Korakuen Stadium, setting an unprecedented world record. In honor of this achievement, the Japanese government awarded him Japan's first "National Medal of Honor," and he also became the first recipient of the Shoriki Matsutaro Award, the highest award in the baseball world. This was the crystallization of his efforts to endure the storms of trials and tribulations and to study his mind and skills since he joined the Yomiuri Giants in 1958. To commemorate this achievement, Oh dedicated a white ume tree to the revered Yushima Shrine. Here, volunteers have gathered to erect a monument to his life's motto, "Effort," and to make it a symbol of his dedication to the youth of Japan.
