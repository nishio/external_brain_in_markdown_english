>  Planned Happenstance Theory is an approach to [[careerism]] proposed by Professor John D. [[cranbolts]] of Stanford University and others.
>  80% of an individual's [[career]] is determined by unexpected [[accidental]] events. The idea is to design that [[(by) chance]] systematically and make your career a good one. --- [Theory of planned contingency - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/計画的偶発性理論)
    - [[planned contingency]]

Advocate's Statement.
- While traditional career counseling attempts to eliminate uncertainty from career planning, in this day and age, unplanned events should be considered inevitable and desirable.
- So career counselors need to guide their clients to engage in exploratory activities to increase the probability of finding unexpected career opportunities

Career counselors help clients develop the following five skills
1. [[Curiosity]] [[Curiosity]] Explore new learning opportunities
- 2.[[durability]] [[Persistence]] Striving despite setbacks
3. [[flexibility]] [[Flexibility]] Changing attitudes or circumstances
- 4.[[optimality]] [[Optimism]] Thinking that new opportunities are possible
- 5.[[sense of adventure]] [[Risk Taking]] Taking action in the face of uncertain outcomes

Career consulting based on the theory of planned contingency
- Step 1: While asking about the client's past history, ask about coincidences and encourage the client to think that taking advantage of coincidences is normal.
    1. how has the unplanned event affected your career?
    2. how did each of these events affect you?
    3. how do you feel about unplanned events in the future?
- Step 2: Help clients turn curiosity into opportunities for learning and exploration
    1. how is your curiosity aroused?
    2. how do coincidences increase your curiosity?
    3. how did you act to increase your curiosity?
    4. how can you apply your curiosity to your work?
- Step 3: Guide the client to create the desired coincidence
    1. please tell us about a coincidence that you would like to see happen to you.
    2. what actions can you take now to increase that likelihood? What is your preferred event?
    3. how would your life change if you took action?
    4. how would your life change if you did nothing?
- Step 4: Instruct the client to overcome whatever is blocking the action.
    1. how have you been prevented from doing what you want to do?
    2. how can I find out how permanent the block is?
    3. how have others overcome such blocks?
    4. how do you begin to overcome that block?

    - This is "[[self-efficacy]]" [[Albert Bandura.]]
        - [[There are two ways to learn]]
        - Learning by direct experience
            - [[observed learning]] (learning by modeling)
            - The point that there is this study was new.
            - Learning through social observation → [[social learning]].

> Chance plays an important role in everyone’s career, but career counseling is still perceived as a process designed to eliminate chance from career decision making. Traditional career counseling interventions are no longer sufficient to prepare clients to respond to career uncertainties. Work world shifts challenge career counselors to adopt a counseling intervention that views unplanned events as both inevitable and desirable. Counselors need to teach clients to engage in exploratory activities to increase the probability that the clients will discover unexpected career opportunities. Unplanned events can become opportunities for learning.
