- [[Narrow search area]] What was [[the only option]] at the time is no longer the only option after the search area is expanded.

A, which was seen as the only [[rare source of information]] when you were a student with a small [[range of friends]], is now just one of many options as you become a working adult and your range of friends expands.
- From A's point of view, the value of [[information provision]] to the other party has decreased, so communication based on the provision of [[scarcity value]] is less likely to take place.

- [[Not the only option.]]
