title: "There is self-sacrificing altruism and self-serving altruism."
---

[Selfish altruism = [[Win-Win]] relationship
    - The idea that [[self-interest]] and [[altruism]] are opposites is a [[false dichotomy]] and can be reconciled.
- Rather, it is preferable to have both.
- Self-sacrificing altruism" is created by "the assumption of antagonism" and "selfishness is evil" [[Sklavenmoral (slave morality, as a philosophical concept of Nietzsche)]].
    - This is a [[meme]] that causes [[self-sacrifice]], so when infected, [[self]] becomes [sacrifice

- It's been a while since I read [[The Spirit of Selfishness]], and the words have matured and emerged.

orthographical variants
- [[Self-sacrificing altruism.]]
