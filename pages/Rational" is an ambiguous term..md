title: 'Rational" is an ambiguous term.'

> I don't have any particular rationale for doing so, but I would go to the Shinjuku bus terminal and take the limousine bus.
- from  [[Take the Limousine Bus]]

Rational" is an ambiguous term.
- The "rationale for whom?" has been cut down.
    - Because [[values]] varies from person to person.
- When I said "without any particularly rational basis," I meant "not particularly rational by [[Mr. Sekai's]] value standards (the price is about $500 more, not faster)."
- For those who act with the value criterion of "clearing the [[Fog of the World]]," it is reasonable to pay 500 yen because there is intrinsic value in taking a different route.

    - I'm curious as to why the root is disconnected, I'll go look next time I'm on foot.
