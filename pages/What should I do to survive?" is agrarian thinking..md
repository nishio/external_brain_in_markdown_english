> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1636071412774612992) I was wondering what the heck [what should I do for a living? I realized it when I saw this tweet. The [[implicit assumption]] is that "[What are you doing?" is uniquely determined, just as [[agricultural people]] who [[settle]] think "[[Where to live]]". That implicit assumption does not hold true for [[nomads]].
- > [@ochyai](https://twitter.com/ochyai/status/1636021023652081664) ... If we consider [[digital nature]] as a new commons, we can find a way to live as nomads settled in a rich natural environment. This commons includes non-mass nature, and is a new natural environment that can be shared and does not diminish even if it is divided. This world can be seen as a kind of settled nomadic age, like the Jomon period....
