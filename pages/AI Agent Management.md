In managing multiple AI agents as "team members," the following points from existing management practices are helpful

1.### [[clarification of purpose]], [[clarification of roles]] ([[OKR]], [[RACI]], etc.)
- Clarify the expected output and task scope for each AI agent.
    - Assign roles to each agent with reference to OKR (Objectives and Key Results) and RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed), and clarify the scope of responsibility.

2.### Regular progress checks (e.g. [[sprint review]] in [Scrum
)
- As with human teams, the task progress is reviewed in short cycles and instructions and input data are revised as necessary.
- A system to frequently check results and identify areas for improvement, such as "Daily Scrum" and "Sprint Review" in Scrum, is useful.

3.### Establish feedback/learning loop ([[PDCA cycle]] etc.)
- A PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) approach is desirable, where the results of instructions to agents are evaluated and additional training data and parameters are fed back to improve performance.
- Continuous feedback and tuning are especially important for generative AI to be effective.

4.### [[design of communication flow]] ([[development of information sharing process]])
- As with human teams, design when and in what format the necessary information will be passed to the AI agent.
- When multiple AIs are to be linked, a mechanism will be developed to unify output formats, APIs, etc., to reduce wasteful interactions.

5.### Set metrics and evaluation indicators ([[KPIs]] and [[quality indicators]])
.
- Establish metrics (KPIs) and quality indicators to quantitatively determine each agent's performance and measure progress. This will facilitate identification of bottlenecks and prioritization of improvements.

By combining these methods and continuously repeating the cycle of "[[presenting clear goals]]," "[[assigning tasks and responsibilities]]," "[[managing progress periodically]]," and "[[learning and optimization through feedback]]," efficient AI agent group management can be achieved.
