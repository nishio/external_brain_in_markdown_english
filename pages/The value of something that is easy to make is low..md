title: "The value of something that is easy to make is low."
---

- If something is [[easy]] to make, it will be made as much as there is demand for it, so [[scarcity value]] will not be created.

Exception
- Limited number of people who can observe or recognize the existence of demand

I feel like I should describe "easy to make" with more resolution.
