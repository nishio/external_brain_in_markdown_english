title: "Public Offering with an emphasis on spontaneity"
---

    - It is counterproductive to give a lot of advice to someone who is applying for a [[spontaneity]] oriented position.
    - [[Dare to write the obvious]] Series
- For those who are planning to apply for a type of public call that emphasizes spontaneity.
    - You may seek advice from those around you.
    - But you have to [[select]] your opinion yourself, not just do as you are told.
    - You must be able to explain in your own words for the choices you make.
    - The worst is "I did it because I was told to."
