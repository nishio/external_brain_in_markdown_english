title: "Communication as Knowledge Transfer"
---

- When you look at communication from the perspective of [[Knowledge Transfer]],
- Person X, who has the knowledge, doesn't know how person Y, who doesn't have the knowledge, would feel about the text.
- Y doesn't know what knowledge is lacking or what questions to ask compared to X
This is the situation.

It is a huge burden for X to speculate and document that "Y may not understand this part.
- Often, it produces a document with a poor outlook that is filled with things that don't need to be written.
- The larger the document, the higher the cost of maintaining it and finding the desired one.
- The larger the document, the greater the burden for the reader. It is difficult for Y to skip over and read only what is necessary.

It is an impossible task for Y to verbalize what he does not know compared to X.
So we need a low-cost way for X to first create a document without worrying about Y, and then express at low cost when Y reads it and thinks, "[I don't know.
- This "low cost" is not just about UI design.
    - Don't be ashamed of what you don't know [[psychological safety]].
    - No [[DISCRETION]], such as, "Will asking questions interfere with my work?"
    - Includes such things as

A device that makes it easier for person Y without knowledge to express "I don't know" at a low cost is, for example
- Permanent links in smaller units
    - What do you mean by "what are we talking about here?" It is easier to point to the
        - Scrapbox Row Permalink
- Comments can be hung anywhere in the text.
    - Easy to have discussions about things you don't understand
        - Comment function in Google Docs
        - Scrapbox solves the problem with a "bulleted co-editing" operation.
- Highlight [[Words you don't understand]] in the text to easily express "I don't understand".
    - A type of collaborative editing tool operation such as Google Docs
    - In the case of Scrapbox, it expresses the feeling of not understanding by making it a link, but also provides a place to write an explanation.
        - [[Share what you don't know]]
- Asynchronous means of communication
    - I can immediately output what's on my mind without thinking, "If I ask a question now, will it interfere with my work?" You can immediately output what you are interested in without thinking about
        - [[Shared Space Communication]]
and others.

relevance
- Just as there is "making something the customer doesn't want" in software, there is "writing something the reader doesn't want" in documentation.
