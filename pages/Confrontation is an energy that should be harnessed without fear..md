<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>The following is a quote from Audrey Tan's speech at the [[Meetup with Audrey & Glen]], in which she talks about "viewing conflict as a source of energy," and a brief explanation of it in Japanese.

Quote (from Audrey Tan's statement).
> “But there’s also a different kind of thinking. This is fire on the ground, and you might think, ‘Oh, there’s oil underneath; I should drill to get the energy source.’ So, not being afraid of conflict, but harnessing the conflict…”

(Translation.)
> "When people see a fire burning, they usually say it's a fire and try to put it out, but when they see a fire burning, they usually say it's a fire and try to put it out,
> In fact, there may be oil under it. We may be able to pump energy from it,
> There's also the idea that conflict is an energy that should be harnessed without fear.

Commentary (Japanese)
- This is an example of how it is important to view conflict not as a fire to be extinguished, but as fuel to create new value.
- Traditionally, we tend to think of conflicts and clashes as something that should be avoided or calmed, but in the Taiwan case, the idea is that by "linking conflicts to demonstrations (implementation of solutions)," they have in fact been transformed into a new source of energy for society.
- Specifically, by going beyond "just protesting (protest)" to the stage of "demonstrating (demonstrate) what the problem is and how to solve it," a constructive bridge (co-creation) is created with the government and other participants. This is the context in which the "use without fear of confrontation" approach is yielding positive results.

In short, the idea is that "pointing out the problem is not the end of the process, but the starting point of the conflict is to show how it can actually be solved. This is the idea that, "by not just pointing out the problem, but by taking the conflict as a starting point and showing how it can actually be resolved, new energy and value will be generated in society.
