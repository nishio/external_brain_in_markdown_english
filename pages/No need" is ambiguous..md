title: 'No need" is ambiguous.'

The words "[[Not necessary.]]" are [[ambiguous]].
![image](https://gyazo.com/41cfc136bf168096bc895dba9f59947d/thumb/1000)
When "condition X is not necessary to achieve objective Y
- There is at least one case where Y is achieved even if condition X is not satisfied.
    - logical
    - X is not a [[requirement]]."
- For the difference D between Y when condition X is not satisfied and Y' when it is satisfied
    - D is zero.
        - This is a stronger argument than "X is not a necessary condition" above
        - Concept similar to "whether there is a [[significant difference]]" in science
    - D is not zero, but small compared to the cost of acquiring condition X
            - [Profitability Criteria
    - D is not zero, but the difference is not valued by the speaker.
        - Speaker's subjective value criteria

There are two extremes, "X is necessary" and "X should not be there," and everything in between those two extremes is vaguely called "X is not necessary."
