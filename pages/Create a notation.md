Create a notation

It defines a new notation so that the expression is easier to read or more beautiful to look at. Einstein's convention.

Conversely, forget the definition of notation and try to deviate by association from its appearance. Like trying to look at the derivative dx/dt as if it were a fraction and multiplying both sides by dt in the denominator. Logically incorrect, but useful if there is something to be gained. In fact, it was so useful that it became popularized under the name of Heaviside's operator method, and the mathematical support came later.

### digest
.
Defining a new notation and trying an action that deviates by association from what it appears to be may yield useful, though not logically correct, results. A concrete example is the act of treating the derivative dx/dt as a fraction and multiplying both sides by dt in the denominator. This was popularized as the Heaviside operator method and later found mathematical support.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The fragment "Nada School Saturday Lecture 2014 Questions" is related to the note "Blind Spot Cards without Pictures Yet". Both cite Heaviside's operator method as an example of an action that is mathematically incorrect but is later recognized and theorized to be beneficial.

### deep thinking
Cases of actions that are considered mathematically incorrect but are later recognized and theorized to be beneficial demonstrate the importance of experimenting with new perspectives and approaches. Not only logical correctness, but also the usefulness of the results should be part of the evaluation.

### summary of thoughts and title
.
We should evaluate both the logical correctness and the usefulness of the results."
