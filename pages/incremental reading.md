Methodology of [[reading]] by the author of [[SuperMemo]], an interval repetition memory tool
- Put the text you want to read into the tool.
- Extract] the parts you find important as you read (shortcut keys are easy to use).
    - [[You may interrupt at any time.]]
    - The algorithm [[step-by-step procedure]] presents sentences at progressively longer intervals.
    - Those that are not read because they are too difficult, or I tried to include them but they are boring, etc., will naturally disappear.
- Fragments that are small enough are rewritten into a quiz format

This page is auto-translated from [/nishio/Incremental Reading](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/Incremental Reading) using DeepL. If you looks something interesting but the auto-translated English is not good enough to understand it, feel free to let me know at [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en). I'm very happy to spread my thought to non-Japanese readers.
