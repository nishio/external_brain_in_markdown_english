title: "rework"

> [terurou](https://x.com/terurou/status/1253706322127642626) I've been talking with employees lately, and I'm wondering about the word "rework". I guess there is a sense of "we got to 100% progress, but we got NG and got back to progress", but it is not like that, it is either "the goal setting was wrong and we did something useless" or "we found a new problem when we tried to make it".
