title: "Organize partially completed tasks"

After being taught the Scrapbox "[[Status indicator with pictograms in page title]]" technique, I've been able to make progress in organizing my tasks.
Wish I had known about this earlier.

Cut out the tasks that are left unattended on this on a separate page.

Linked to the bulleted parent task from a cut out on a separate page, so that you can change the bulleted form.

Completed tasks are now lumped together and can be moved to the Completed list.
