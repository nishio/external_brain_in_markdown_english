All products added together are multiplied by the sum

- $\sum_{i,j} a_i \times b_j = (\sum_i a_i) \times (\sum_j b_j)$
It looks like a special law, but it just uses a lot of [[distributive law]].
- Distribution law: $a \times b + a \times c = a \times (b + c)$

More use [[formal power series]] (corresponding to an infinite sequence of numbers) for infinite sums
- $\sum_i^\infty x^{ai} \times \sum_j^\infty x^{bj} = \sum_i^\infty\sum_j^\infty x^{ai+bj}$
