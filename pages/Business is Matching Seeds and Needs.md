title: "Business is Matching Seeds and Needs"
---

- [[Business]] is [[matching seeds with needs]].

If you're being asked to identify "[[Burning Knee's]]" before you make something, it's because you're considered "not capable of producing [[seeds]]"

Because such a person needs to obtain [[resources]] from others in order to create [[seeds]], he or she is forced to verbalize "[[needs]]" in advance in order to persuade the entity with those resources.
- Conversely, persuasion is for obtaining the resources you want, so if you can achieve it with the resources you have, you don't need to persuade.
        - [[Don't persuade people you don't need to persuade.]]

Difficult to prove the need for something that is not yet tangible
- Therefore, we will create a "[[Minimum Viable Product]]" that is capable of performing hypothesis testing for the existence of needs at a minimum cost.
    - [[concierge-type MVP]] and Dropbox's [[video prototype]] are well-known
    - > Dropbox's MVP was a 3-minute screen recording video. This was posted to social news sites and immediately received a large number of quality feedback. When we posted the beta video the following month, the number of people who wanted to use the beta service increased from 5,000 to 75,000 overnight.
