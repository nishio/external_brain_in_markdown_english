title: "stop-word"

Q: I would like to stop the habit of stopping to think.
> [@kensuu](https://twitter.com/kensuu/status/1666978988429045760?s=20): using thought-stopping words in your brain stops it, so you should try to rephrase them into words that keep you thinking. It stops when you think in your brain something like "[[difficult (e.g. customer, guest, child)]]" or "[[I don't know...]]" or "[[Whatever]]?"
>  I think it would be better to use a question format, because the brain will answer if it keeps being asked.

relevance
- [[Difficulty means an extra 30 minutes]].
- [[If you say, "It's too hard," nothing will work.]]
