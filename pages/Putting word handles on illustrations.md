title: "Putting word handles on illustrations"
---

- The reason why it is beneficial to [[grouping]] parts of a [[schematic]] in the KJ-legal sense is that tableplate making is the act of attaching "a [[handle]] of words for manipulating it" to a concept.

In the same way that in the KJ method, first the spatial arrangement of sticky notes expresses relationships, and then words are created to express them after the fact, in the same way, in a diagram, you first draw various things, and then handles are created for them in [[posterior]].

This is the same as writing a program and then lumping parts of it into a function

Therefore, it is important to start with a diagram, and then later on, to make a process of "one lump of something" by lumping out parts of it after the fact.

In the past, when the KJ method was invented, the device was paper, so it was a hassle to hollow out the device after the fact.
