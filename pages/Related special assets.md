It is an asset that would lose most or all of its value in a transaction with another counterparty.

Examples include the following
- Dedicated facilities for producing products or parts [[customize]] for a specific customer
- Factories and stores located on the premise of doing business with specific clients
- Know-how and knowledge that can only be acquired through transactions with specific suppliers
- [[relationship of mutual trust]] or [[human network]] with a specific business partner

Such relationship-specific assets have value as long as the business relationship continues, but if the business relationship is terminated for some reason, the company will suffer a significant loss. In other words, investing in relationship-specific assets creates a strong [[dependence]] on the counterparty.

This leaves the party that invested in the related special asset vulnerable to [[Opportunistic Behavior]] ([[hold-up problem]]) from the counterparty. To deal with this problem, companies may use measures such as [[vertical integration]] or [[long-term contracts]].

The concept of relational special assets plays a central role in [[Transaction Cost Theory]]. It is recognized as the source of [[transaction costs]] and is an important concept in analyzing [[corporate boundary determination]] and [[governance structure]] choices.

Let the other party accumulate relationship-specific assets.
