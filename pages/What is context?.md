<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/> [[context]] ([[context]]) refers to the background or situation in which an event, text, or statement exists. Understanding context is critical to correctly capturing the meaning of information and data. Ignoring context can lead to misinterpretation, especially when the meaning of a word changes depending on the context in which it is used.

Context Type:.
- [[linguistic context]]:.
    - Linguistic context refers to the environment within a language in which an utterance or text is situated. This includes the preceding and following utterances or sentences in a conversation or document that form the meaning of a particular word or phrase.
- [[Socio-cultural context]]:.
    - Sociocultural context involves [[customs]], [[values]], [[belief systems]], etc. in a particular culture or social group. This creates language and behaviors that are understood only in a given culture or community.
- [[historical context]]:.
    - Historical context refers to a situation in which [[historical background]] or events at a point in time influence [[Past events]] may influence the interpretation of current events or statements.
- [[Physical Context]]:.
    - Physical context refers to the physical location or environment in which an event occurs. The characteristics of a place can influence the occurrence of an event and its interpretation.

[[the sentences before and after are contextual]], right?
- I'm not sure about [[linguistic context]], so let's call it [[chronological context]] or [[temporal context]].
    - [[time-oriented]]
    - [[temporal scheme]]

There is [[Prerequisite Knowledge]], [[implicit assumption]], and [[common sense]] that are not included here but are implicitly assumed to be known. Some of them overlap with the socio-cultural context.
