[[MITOU2024 Demo Day]]

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1890682229937865035) Last admission today is 18:30, so it's not impossible to make the ladder...
>  [ENCOUNTERS | Agency for Cultural Affairs Media Arts Creator Development Project](https://creators.j-mediaarts.bunka.go.jp/encounters-2025)
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1890685667211989060) The plan is to break up at 50 minutes so we have 20 minutes to get to the venue and 50 minutes to look, it's a split, let's go!
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1890686938073513995) I got on the Ginza line at Suehirocho, the train came at the right time, God says look!

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1890696050568052924) It's bigger and more varied than I thought, there are videos, games, and installations that only one person can experience at a time, so it's not an exhibit you can rush through in 50 minutes. It was like 25 minutes because I skipped those restraint systems and went through them roughly.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1890701168055095602) Of course it would be a waste of time to skip it, so you should come with plenty of time if possible!
>  I went to see the picture book installation three times because I wanted to experience it, but there were people there all the time...

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1890707500715966785) I like that the description is digital signage, because you can play a talking video of the person who made it.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1890708294911541683) It was a building with various exhibits unrelated to this one!

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1890703466147848192) I didn't grasp it at all, but it's next to the [[Artison Museum]]!

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1890704218463359387) I have a feeling it's a more laid back place to spend time, not a place where people rush in 20 minutes before the deadline after an event.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1890706917816746381) Saturday night in an office district, it's basically dark with no neon signs or anything, so it's interesting in reverse!
