Consistency of evaluation:.
- The rubric allows moderators to evaluate comments based on consistent criteria.
- The quality of moderation can be maintained by having multiple moderators use the same criteria for evaluation.

Clarification of expectations for participants:.
- By making the rubric available to participants, it is possible to clearly indicate what comments are desirable and what comments are excluded.
- Because participants do not receive direct feedback on whether their comments were approved or rejected by moderation, it is important to clarify expectations through the rubric.

Moderation efficiency:.
- A clear rubric would allow moderators to evaluate comments quickly and accurately.
- Judgment based on a rubric allows for efficient moderation without being influenced by the subjectivity of the moderator.

When creating a rubric in Polis, you may want to consider the following
- Establish criteria for excluding spam and irrelevant comments.
- Clarify how to handle duplicate comments.
- Decide how to handle comments containing multiple ideas.
- Establish criteria for comments that are consistent with the purpose of the conversation.

Implementing a rubric can help make Polis conversations more constructive and productive. It is important that there are clear guidelines for both participants and moderators.
