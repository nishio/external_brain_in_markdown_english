I thought to myself, "Oh, I read this story in [[How to Learn to be an Engineer]], let's cite it," but I can't because Mr. Shibukawa's material has not been published yet, and I've been told three or four times that I wanted to cite it but couldn't because it hasn't been published yet, so much so that the material, which is highly useful, has been put to sleep. It's an enormous loss of opportunity.
In addition, "what Nishio was going to write about overlapped with what came out in the interview, so if I wrote about it without the interview article being published, it would be a form of plagiarism, as if I had told what I heard in the interview as if it were my own idea," which would have hindered my own creative activities. This situation also hinders my own creative activities.
Since we have chosen "how to learn" as a theme that will not become obsolete over the years, the need for public disclosure will not disappear even if we neglect it, and the anger about not being publicized will rekindle again and again and accumulate in a "this is the fourth time I've done this" way.
I keep asking what the obstacle is that prevents you from publishing, and the answer has the air of "I just haven't gotten around to it," but is there some other reason why you can't publish?
