title: "Whoever notices does it."

> The burden of "whoever notices will do it" type chores tends to be concentrated on a specific individual, so I asked a different junior staff member to do it with me each time, or I told a junior staff member whom I had taught how to do it before to "teach another junior staff member". (Note that "It's faster to do it myself" is easy to accumulate stress.
>  It is important to tell them in the right words that you want them to help you, because "guess it by the air" like "everyone else do it too" does not work, and others often think "I wish I could avoid this but it would be better to do it", so I have never had a bad look when I asked them nicely to help me. It is important to [[Motivating Others]], as it is for me too!
