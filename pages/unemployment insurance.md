Under Japan's unemployment insurance system, the period of benefits received varies depending on the age of the eligible recipient and the length of time insured (number of years enrolled in unemployment insurance). middle-aged and older workers between the ages of 45 and 60 are especially privileged, with a maximum of 330 days of benefits available if they have been insured for 20 years or more. The number of days of benefits varies greatly depending on the reason for resignation. If the resignation is for personal reasons and does not fall under unavoidable reasons, there is a 2-month limitation period during which benefits will actually begin.

On the other hand, France has a very good unemployment benefit system, with benefits available for up to two years. There is extensive follow-up support for the unemployed, including job training and job interview mediation. However, the impact of this generous support on the economy is controversial.

According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), the unemployment insurance system should be at a level that allows workers to maintain a minimum standard of living (at least 50% of the minimum wage), and the minimum duration of benefits should be 6-10 months. The Japanese system follows this standard and can provide benefits for longer periods under certain conditions, but benefit levels, duration, and details of the system vary widely from country to country.
