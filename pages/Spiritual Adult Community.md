> [windymelt](https://x.com/windymelt/status/1953587469796225441) I thought that to create a seriously fun [[mentally mature]] [[community]] without the stupid [[flames]] and [[harassment]], it might be a micro [[subscription]] that charges monthly at the 100 yen or 50 yen level. I thought it might be a micro [[subscription]] to charge 100 yen or 50 yen per month. No one would harass someone by spending their own money, and if they pay, they can be easily identified if they are sued.
    - [[use one's own money]]

I'm rather doubtful that the inside of a paid [[sarong]] or something like that is in a happy state, though.
    - [[The salon you can get in for money is a low hurdle.]]
- [Money has different weights for different people, so the same 5,000 yen membership fee can feel like 500 yen to some people and 50,000 yen to others.
    - It would be fun if it were a community of people who are not uptight, who say, "I'll pay you about 500 yen, please use it to maintain the place.
    - And then you don't want to have [[people with bloodshot eyes]] who are like, "I paid 50,000 yen, so I have to get my money back!" I don't like it when [[people with bloodshot eyes]] come in and say, "I paid 50,000 yen, so I have to get my money's worth!
        - You can't prevent that kind of thing.
    - So this is what it comes down to, "(a) community of people who can afford it (financially) [[is]] interesting."
        - [People who can afford it give to the community, whereas people who can't afford it try to take.
