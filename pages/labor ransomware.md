> [@tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1591310789465735169?s=46&t=d6MaU7Y_yyH9lH-8I5ZDxA): we're in an age where IT systems do business and strikes I guess it doesn't work.
> The unions need to have a hand card other than strike, but they don't have that card, so ......
> I knew it was ransomware, or the unions would have to put ransomware on their IT systems.
