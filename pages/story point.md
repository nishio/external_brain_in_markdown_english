title: "story point"
---

A provisional unit of measure for estimating by relative size rather than by time.

In "[[Agile estimating and planning]]," originally published in 2006, it states. (p.8) The core concept of Story Point is to estimate in relative magnitude rather than absolute "time required.
> There are two critical differences between story points and lines of code or function points. They are simple to calculate and they can be used from an early stage. Why simple? Because they are expressed in terms of relative size, not absolute size. Why can it be used from the early stage? Again, because it is expressed in terms of relative magnitude, not absolute magnitude.

In "[[kanban work methods]]", originally published in 2014, the author acknowledges the merit of estimating by relative size, but criticizes it as follows and introduces "T-shirt size" (method of estimating by S, M, L). (p.200)
> The fact that the story points are numbers is not nice in that the numbers may seem to indicate accuracy, even though they are only intended to indicate the relative size of the work estimated.
