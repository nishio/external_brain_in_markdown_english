- Potential of [[graphic]] to support [[Project Management]] and examples of its use
[https://www.slideshare.net/tamkai88/pm-114572241](https://www.slideshare.net/tamkai88/pm-114572241)

I enjoyed the idea of moving from "[[forced into a position where one is forced to do something because one has been told to]]" to "[[want to do]]" and the idea of "[[emotional capital]]. It was like putting the idea of [[anthropocentric]] into the project design.

The human means of communication used to be voice, with an inescapable set of emotional information,
Overwhelming efficiency has led to the replacement of written communication with electronic methods, and in doing so, emotional information has been dropped.
- [[pictograph]] and a movement to reclaim it in the form of stamps is taking place, but maybe ultimately we will communicate through graphics.
