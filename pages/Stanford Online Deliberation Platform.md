Stanford Online Deliberation Platform is a platform for Deliberation ([[careful deliberation]])
    - [I attended the Nobel Prize Summit 2023 because of the hands-on opportunities offered.
- Official Website: [Online Deliberation Platform](https://stanforddeliberate.org/)

Experience it for yourself.
- This is a [[deliberation support system]], not [broad listening
    - A system for verbal discussion among about 8 people
- It is more advanced than [[Polis]] in terms of "deliberation," but it is orthogonal to the appeal I feel for Polis.
- The official website describes it as "Better online conversations with automated moderation". Calling this "[[automated moderation]]" "AI moderation" is an over-interpretation as of 2023/05.


Automated moderation is a mechanism for moderating a videoconference.
- Continue to cut off people who talk too long.
    - Speaking time is visualized.
- When one person is talking, the next person who wants to talk is queued up and everyone can visualize "who wants to talk next".

- Pre-setting and consumption is visualized for each agenda item.
    - After the scheduled time has passed, the speaker moves to the next agenda item without mercy at the end of his/her remarks.
    - On the other hand, if everyone is silent, "Shall we move on to the next item on the agenda?" a vote called "Do we proceed to the next agenda item?
        - I failed to take a screenshot of this one, below is a similar diallo
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/f6959bb4530c5688b09edd76233b8b90/thumb/1000)
    - When the time is up, it turns red outside of the scheduled time frame as shown below.
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/35dbcc6c2e17f2c04bcc8c92afa9ec4f/thumb/1000)
- When you press the interrupt button, the two faces of the main person talking and the person who interrupted are shown (screenshot failed).
    - The composition becomes clear: "Mr. B is interrupting Mr. A's turn of conversation."
    - Is there a limit to the amount of time we can talk in an interruption? I failed to check, but I would put a limit.
- If you're silent for a while, you'll be prompted to speak up.

    - It does not make it easier to speak up just because you are prompted to do so (personal opinion).


Voting part
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/bcb90ea3954d6f92f4c1f0938bf9fc18/thumb/1000)
- Each individual writes 0 to 1 statement each.
- Vote on it in the order of discussion.
    - I think the algorithm for this part of the voting is [[Boulder Rule]].
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/d32a01593165d9c5c5907ce88c1a8627/thumb/1000)
- Discuss during each discussion time and the submitter can update the text in light of it.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/21ce697d3f1486a848631309f2de89a7/thumb/1000)
- Then we'll vote in order of preference.
    - Do it twice and hire the top of each.

        - Adopted W
        - The event was designed so that the questions selected here would be used as potential topics for the panel discussion that followed.
            - I think this is a case by case basis.

consideration
- Not similar to Polis.
    - The only voting-like part is the last "prioritize your questions" section.
    - Basically, it's like talking in English and listening in English via videoconference.
- Voice Communication Issues
    - Automatic subtitles appear, but disappear quickly.
    - Cannot be selected on the browser
    - So, as a non-native English speaker, I am prevented from using machine translation.
    - Just leave it all like a chat.
    - Ideally, machine translation should be integrated into the system itself.
    - I thought there would be some more mechanism to take care of the "participants from all over the world" since it's a Nobel Prize Summit, but there was nothing like that.
- What I thought after the two sessions.
    - Is voice [[turn-based communication]] not the root of all evil?
            - [[voice communication]] can only output to one person at a time
        - There are mechanisms in place to interrupt and prevent one person from talking too much, but that is necessary because we are using voice
        - Why don't they just stop using audio and everyone write in parallel in text?
- I went to bed and woke up and realized
    - This is a different perspective on the same thing.
    - A system of showing the issues on video and discussing them verbally (this one)
        - This is a mechanism "to allow people with low literacy skills to participate in the deliberative process
        - However, those who have difficulty with spoken communication in English are marginalized.
    - Mechanism for non-turn based discussion in text
        - This assumes the participants' writing literacy is high enough.
        - A system that enables people who have difficulty hearing or speaking out loud to participate in discussions
        - However, poor text communication alienates
    - In the end, this is about leaning on the various cognitive characteristics of each individual, so we need both mechanisms.
        - But my cognitive characteristics are in the "text asynchronous communication is far better" camp, so I don't think I'm the right person to do a project to support the voice side of things.
