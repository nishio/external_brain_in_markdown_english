title: "Individuals live longer than companies"
---

I see people who introduce other companies' good initiatives and say, "You're a competitor.
> For an individual, "company" is just a temporary attribute in life, but "what you think is good" is for life, so it is natural that the latter takes precedence over the former.
I thought.

After I wrote it, I remembered Drucker.

>  The [[knowledge worker]] of the future will outlive the organization to which he or she belongs. [[Drucker.]] says that we must first design our lives on this premise.

Life planning that depends on one organization is dangerous.

>  [[Priority should be given to one's values.]]
> Drucker says that the problem is when what you [[forte]] is different from what you value. We must give priority to what we value.
- When [[My Values]] and [[Organizational Values]] cannot coexist, even if you repress your own values and serve the organization, the organization will change in a shorter time than your life.

(In Japan, many people may not agree with the assertion here, especially since large companies have a strong image of being stable and not changing for a long period of time.)

- [[values]]
