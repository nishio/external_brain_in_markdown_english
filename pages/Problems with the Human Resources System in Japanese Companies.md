title: "Problems with the Human Resources System in Japanese Companies"

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>In this series of tweets, issues related to the HR system and organizational culture in Japanese companies are pointed out. The main points are as follows

- During the company's [[period of rapid growth]], those who are capable and who are studying can get higher posts, but when growth stops, there is no reason to study because one's career will advance just by being in the company.
- Even if you acquire [[IT skills]], you are treated as a [[handyman]] and not evaluated properly. [The work that can be done by someone who has been transferred from one position to another is recognized as "[[business]]," and IT is not part of that framework.
- Business is moving away from understandable [[complexity]] in HR and the old HR system is dysfunctional.
- Reasons for not studying include that it is not useful for current work, it does not lead to promotion, there is no transfer without a post, and there is little mobility, such as changing jobs.
- There used to be a time when you could be happy if you worked physically without studying, based on [[potential hiring]] and personnel transfers.
- After learning at a company that educated but paid less, it sometimes served as a springboard to jump to another company.
- In the IT industry, there is a tendency to focus on internal improvement activities and business evaluations while leaving technology to dispatchers without understanding it. In some cases, employees who study go to foreign companies or become independent consultants.

These indications suggest that the human resource system and organizational culture of Japanese companies are no longer in step with the times. Various remedial measures are required, such as reviewing human resource development and evaluation systems, promoting the use and understanding of information technology, and diversifying career paths.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1547023742085533696) This means that if you make the "fair career path" work, the whole society is spinning backwards... ...

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1547357203077922816) As long as the company is growing fast, this is the way to go.
>  As the organization expands, upper posts become vacant rapidly, so those who are capable and who are studying fit into those posts.
>
>  Once a company stops growing and becomes stable, and career paths begin to be developed, there is no reason to study because your career will progress just by being in the company.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1547394297011773440) "work that can be done by someone who comes from a personnel transfer" = "operations"
>  So, IT is not in the frame there, so yeah. ......
>  We don't recognize it as our business, just that it's less work to outsource.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1547758173536526336) Neglect of the Human Resources Department
>  Or rather, the business has gone so far from the complexity that HR can understand, that the old HR department has become dysfunctional.

> [matome55](https://twitter.com/matome55/status/1547463268117098496) There are many arrows directed and directed from "not studying". There are few reasons to study: it doesn't help you in your current job, you don't get promoted even if it does help you, there are no transfers without a post (on the contrary, job rotations for no good reason after about 3 years), and there is little mobility such as changing jobs. Some people learn to mount up, though.

When I was happy as long as I depended on the company for my life, I could just work 24 hours a day with a lot of physical activity, even if I didn't have to study.

>  Companies that educate but pay a little less than other companies
>  but taking education and immediate real-world training at a slightly lower salary.
>  I think I saw it was then used as a springboard to jump to other companies.

> [Fate_chu_chu](https://twitter.com/Fate_chu_chu/status/1547216060822470656) IT industry is "I don't know anything about technology, so let's just have dispatchers do everything, okay, I'll work hard on internal improvement activities and work evaluation today! Today, I'm going to work hard on internal improvement activities and work evaluations! The IT industry is revolving around "I don't know anything about technology.
>  By the way, employees who study quit because they don't want to do it, go to a foreign company, or become independent consultants.
