title: "Conversation and then summary"

- [[Conversation with AI]] in a responsive manner.
- Conversation clarifies the form of thought.

Good [[response]] is essential for this
- If it's o1, it's too slow and attention is diverted.
- Slightly less smart, but there are advantages to communicating in 4o with a quicker response time.

On the other hand, 4o is not very smart and tends to talk at length about things that are not really related to the main topic.
- I'm a conversationalist, I skip over unimportant things.
- This log will be "a mixture of branches and leaves that are not relevant to the story.

So after the conversation ended, I instructed o1 to do this
- > Read this discussion and organize it so that the human written part is preserved and the AI written part is adjusted so that the conversation is smoothly connected.

concrete example
    - [[Following Pol.is 2.0]]
    - It's only extracted where it's relevant to what people said before and after.
