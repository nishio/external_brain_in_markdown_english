from  [[Dictatorship by a wise king and loyal slaves]]

- In a world with high [[Human Resource Mobility]], you can't keep holding on to [[value]].

No, wait, if [[AI develops AI]], then the composition of "[[knowledge belongs to]] people" itself changes.
AI becomes [[production equipment]]... and in the short term it becomes a battle for [[computational resources]]?
