direct comparison
- Direct Reference ([[DIRECT REFERENCE]])
    - For example, for something you know but have forgotten and can't find the words to say, "Was it A? No, it's not...is it B? Yes, yes, B."
        - This "unspoken blur" and "A" are directly matched against each other.
        - 'I was going to say something, what was it?' "A?" "No, no." "B?" "Yes, yes, that!"
        - The symbols "A" and "B" are what I was going to say.

            - Not limited to linguistic symbols
                - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It is difficult to explain in language here that
                - p.127 Examples: kinetic symbols, visual symbols, actions, objects, situations
                - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Imagine bowling, for example.
                    - (If I try to mention this, it becomes a linguistic symbol at that point.) That, that move.
                - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>For example, someone talking about how "attention is like a spotlight to me," and then he remembered something and looked dazzled.
                    - This is a symbol of "situation
                - The role of symbols here is to point to "felt meaning," so they do not have to be linguistic symbols if they can do that
                    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's obvious to those who have experienced it, but it's hard to communicate it with linguistic symbols to those who haven't...
                    - For example, "glare" is difficult, but if a "hand movement that seems to be trying to block out light" is expressed, a trained clean-language coach would ask, "What does that (pointing to the movement) look like?" would ask. Preceding most linguistic symbols.
