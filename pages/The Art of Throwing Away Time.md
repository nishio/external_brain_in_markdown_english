title: "The Art of Throwing Away Time"
---

I hate the art of throwing away time.
- It's hard to mention because I feel sorry for the people who did it if I mention specifics.
    - But if I search for something now, years after I saw it, and I don't get any hits, I guess I can assume that it's already been buried by [[Test of Time]].
    - You know, the "I drew 10,000 circles with a red pen" kind of thing.
- [Few people do it because it's [[irrational]].
- The variety of ways to dump time makes it easy to find "[[something]] that no one has done yet."
    - [[novelty (patentability)]] Communities that place a high value on "what no one has done yet".
    - People who have gone crazy with the looming [[deadline pressure]] because they can't come up with new ideas.
    - Young people's [[valuable time]] is consumed by [simple labor
    - I feel like it's [[socially harmful]].
