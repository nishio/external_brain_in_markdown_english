title: "The concept that the word refers to expands and contracts and becomes something else."

- In the story of [[Masakari 2]], I thought that the transition of the meaning of the word [[masaqali]] had the same composition as that of [[fake X]], but it was difficult to convey the similarity by reading the text, so I drew a picture.

- Time 1: Mr. 1 ties the word A to some concept X.
- Time 2: Concept X is expanded, and Mr. 2 refers to the expanded concept Y as A.
- Time 3
    - A person named A appears, referring to part Z of the expanded concept (Mr. 3).
    - Mr. 4, who sees that Mr. 3's statement and doesn't know about X and Y, starts to think "A=Z".
- Time 4: Mr. 4 and Mr. 1 have different concepts of what word A refers to, and they are not talking about the same thing.
