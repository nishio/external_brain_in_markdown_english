title: "human perspective"
---

People who think they are thinking from humanity's point of view are just misinterpreting [[one's own point of view]] as humanity's common point of view.

Because they do not understand that people have different perspectives, they identify "those similar to themselves" as "mankind" and misidentify their own perspective as "the common perspective of mankind" because they are similar and therefore their perspectives are also similar.
