Main Concepts:
- Beyond Orientalism": This book expands on Edward Said's theory of "Orientalism" and advocates an ideological movement that overcomes Western-centeredness.
- Nomadic Thinking: In contrast to sedentary thinking, nomadic thinking is a way of thinking that continually traverses boundaries and opens up new horizons.
- Postcolonial": a concept that describes an ideological activity that takes into account the experience of colonial rule, but transcends its framework.

Main publications:
- Beyond Orientalism (1996): A critical examination of Western-centeredness, this work attempts to open up new ideological horizons from an Asian perspective.
- Nomadic Thinking" (2008): A collection of critiques that points out the limitations of sedentary thinking and the importance of nomadic sensibilities.
- Postcolonial Thinking" (2001): critically reviews the history of colonialism and discusses the ideological work to overcome it.

There are many aspects of Jiang Shangzhong's thought that resonate with Deleuze's philosophy. In particular, the concept of "nomadic thinking" directly echoes [Deleuze.

Just as Deleuze focused on nomads, Jiang Shangzhong also points out the limits of sedentary thinking and stresses the importance of a more fluid and transversal mode of thought. His emphasis on the relativization of the nation-state framework and his shedding of light on the presence of exiles, immigrants, and other boundary-crossers also overlaps with Deleuze's idea of de-territorialization.

Furthermore, Jiang Shangzhong has been cutting into the issues of contemporary society from a different angle than Deleuze, criticizing Western-centeredness from a postcolonial context. By introducing an Asian perspective, it can be said that he suggests the possibility of rethinking Deleuze's thought in a global context.

Jiang Shangzhong's thought can be positioned as one of the attempts to develop Deleuze's philosophy in an East Asian context. The encounter between the two will provide important suggestions for opening up new horizons in contemporary thought.
