title: "Readers and editorial right holders are equal."
---

- Scrapbox was created in the first place to share information in the lab, and readers and editorial rights are equal.
    - in that case
        - Use bullet points rather than long, tight sentences so that formatting will not be lost if you add more.
        - You should be able to easily add a face icon <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>.
        - Feel free to add comments anywhere to make the culture known.
    - I wonder if it is possible to communicate effectively in this way (I would like to experience it, but I haven't).
- We think it is abusive to use it for a blog-like application with "one editorial authority and an unspecified number of readers" in the first place.
    - One person "sharing information in the lab" is beneficial enough.
        - It's interesting to discover links to related articles I've written in the past.
        - Past selves are strangers
