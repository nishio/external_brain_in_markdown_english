Quadratic Funding is neither mere [[voting]] nor mere [[fund distribution]] (funding), but rather an "in-between" mechanism. For example, in ordinary voting, a person simply expresses his/her "preference," such as "one vote for Option A and one vote for Option B," and no funds are transferred. On the other hand, in the case of simple funding, the structure tends to be one in which "the person who gives the most money has the greatest influence.

Quadratic funding, however, is designed to combine both [[individual voting]] and [[donation]], and to provide a large match (additional funds) for even a small amount of support. In other words,
- While focusing on "[[number of]] endorsements" as in voting,
- By actually paying money, you show your "[[seriousness]]" in supporting the project,
- Calculate those totals by "square root" and distribute them in a democratic and financially supportive manner.
In this respect, it is described as an "intermediate mechanism between voting and funding.
