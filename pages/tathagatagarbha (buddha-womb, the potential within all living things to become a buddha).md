title: "tathagatagarbha (buddha-womb, the potential within all living things to become a buddha)"
---

The idea that there is wisdom of the Buddha in ordinary people from the beginning.

Well, having a seed inside is not equal to having it germinate and grow...

- [[Yusuke, Kegon, Kukai, Nishida]]  p.97
> But the foolish sentient beings are covered with the thought of lapses and do not know, do not see, and do not have faith. --- (Taisho vol. 9, p. 624, top)
- The wisdom of the Buddha is in the bodies of sentient beings, but because they are all idiots, they are caught up in strange thoughts and do not know, do not see, and do not want to believe in it.
