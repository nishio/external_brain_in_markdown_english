title: "Transformation to open-minded thinking"
---

> The ChatGPT boom has started a transformation from an era when it was cool to take a position of [[critical thinking]] to defend a particular system of thought and create [[dividing into parts]] to [[open-minded thinking]] that [[accepts diverse ideas]]. I can't help but feel that a transformation has begun. And, of course, the brightest young people have noticed this change. Humanity today knows the answer to the question of how our world can become more win-win. But the [[path dependency]] of history stands in the way. But [[AGI]] may bring us a revolution that will destroy such path dependency.
