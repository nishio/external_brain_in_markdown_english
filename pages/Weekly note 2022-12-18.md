title: "Weekly note 2022-12-18"

In a situation where there is a lot of pressure to output and summarize, the diaries in my personal project were not written at all, while the diaries in the well project were written, this phenomenon is interesting.
- In other words, the diary of a personal project and the diary of a well have different potencies.
- When you're doing one X, another Y is inhibited because it shares the same resources.
- The personal diary was a utility for "outputting thoughts.
- On the other hand, I suppose "communicating" was the utility of the well diary.
