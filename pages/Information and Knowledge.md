title: "Information and Knowledge"
---

Organize how you use them differently.

    - [[information]] is separate from people and can circulate independently of them
    - data
    - fact
    - Text from the book
    - [[knowledge]] is tightly coupled to a specific individual and difficult to distribute in isolation
    - The work of detachment is, for example, the writing of a book.
        - Significant costs involved.
        - It will take a while again for the recipients of that information to make use of it.
    - Individuals distributing themselves and
    - Hard to scale

I sometimes use it wrong myself, so I'll fix it as soon as I realize it.

Knowledge" and "information" in this distinction correspond to "[[tacit knowledge (knowledge management terminology)]]" and "[[explicit knowledge (knowledge management terminology]]" in Ikujiro Nonaka's [[SECI Model]].
