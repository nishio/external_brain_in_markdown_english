concrete example
    - [[ruling strategy equilibrium]]
    - A player is rational if he/she never chooses a dominant strategy. Also, if every player has a dominant strategy, then the [[Strategic Profile]] of the pair is called the dominant strategy equilibrium. In a game with a dominant strategy equilibrium, the dominant strategy equilibrium is realized if all players are rational.
    - [[Nash equilibrium]]
    - A Nash equilibrium is a combination of strategies in which no player can gain a higher gain by changing his strategy, given the other players' strategies.
