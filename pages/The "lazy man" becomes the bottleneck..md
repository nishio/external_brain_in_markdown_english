> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1783698842569048424) I was thinking of eliminating "[[lazy humans]]" because they would be [[bottleneck]] and building a society with only "[[diligent AIs]]", and then the AIs who can afford it can keep the "lazy humans" as their pets...and then I realized that's what humans and [[cats]] are doing now. AI that can afford it will keep "lazy humans" as pets... and then I realized that's what humans and [[cat]] are doing right now.
