> [satetu4401](https://twitter.com/satetu4401/status/1668130711327629312) Many people have a strange way of thinking about [[the gerrymandering of work]], but basically, a [[permanent employee]] can do [[becoming a national of a person or organization]]. In the first place, permanent employees are "hired to reduce [[administrative costs]] by making them a part of the organization".

>  It's stupid to give them a [[manual job]] that anyone can do with benefits and high compensation.

> [satetu4401](https://twitter.com/satetu4401/status/1668132695623499777) You [[manualize]] a job [[when]] you reduce costs by having [[part-timers]] or machines do it, and when you do [infiltration tactics and when you do [infiltration tactics

>  There is absolutely no point in making a manual for such a job, which is not easy enough to be done by part-timers and does not involve so much human input that it can be called a manpower operation. It's easier to get the job done if you make it belong to a genus and have them do it the way they're best suited to do it.

> [satetu4401](https://twitter.com/satetu4401/status/1668134514013650944) And when you seriously manualize a job, the people who are currently in charge of it can still do their job, while

>  First, put a different manager from the person in charge, eliminate useful functions that were only possible because that person was in charge, simplify the work on the assumption that people will be replaced, and restructure the work itself before putting 4-5 people in charge to make it a department. The original person in charge is promoted somewhere else.

> [satetu4401](https://twitter.com/satetu4401/status/1668135598367064064) A common mistake people tend to make is to keep the original person in charge and add more people, but this never works.

>  "A person who can handle a large amount of work alone by [[adapting work to himself]]" and "a person who can handle a team by [[adapting himself to work]]" are different races, so mixing them doesn't work. That's a waste of human resources.

>  When full-time employees were [[lifetime employment]], it's true that it's good to be a genus.
>  In this day and age, people no longer stay with one company for their entire lives, and they are changing occupations in search of better benefits.

> [satetu4401](https://twitter.com/satetu4401/status/1668505136656961536) I'll do that next time.

> [takusigov](https://twitter.com/takusigov/status/1668332780747620352) Doesn't that go directly against the so called [[job type]]?

> [Corp_Warrior_3y](https://twitter.com/Corp_Warrior_3y/status/1668370005560532993) I see what you mean about the benefits of attribution.
>  However, I think that efforts to standardize work are necessary because the number of recruits or the quality of recruits is expected to decrease with the [[aging population combined with the diminishing number of children]]. Personally, I think it is important to distinguish between gentrification and [[standardization]].

> [BearBeqr](https://twitter.com/BearBeqr/status/1668515880081428485) If you become an employee of a company, isn't it hard to get maternity leave, paternity leave, and paid leave?

> [@tokyo23gou](https://twitter.com/tokyo23gou/status/1668417168843874304?s=46&t=gkSZtjGEtUZPO0JCzBxCBw): While I agree with what you wrote, I think that the assumption that a full-time employee = someone who stays with the company forever is crumbling. I think that the assumption that regular employees = people who will stay with the company forever is collapsing, and this is why people are thinking that gentrification = risk. When quitting, if there is something only you can do, it is hard to quit smoothly.
> Is there a genus for those who don't want to quit, to increase their value?

> [@ShiodaSalt](https://twitter.com/shiodasalt/status/1668378119668121600?s=46&t=gkSZtjGEtUZPO0JCzBxCBw): attribution may be a source of growth for an organization when it creates [[tacit knowledge ( knowledge management terminology)]] from formal knowledge, and may be a source of organizational growth.
>  [[SECI Model]] and others also seem to model the process from the occurrence of gentrification to its elimination.
