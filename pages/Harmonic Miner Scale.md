- If you look at it as a minor scale (like C↔Am), `3` becomes [[dominant]], and if you set it to `3~`, the semitone raised becomes the [[leading tone]] to the root note of `6`, and if you set it to `3~7`, it becomes [[tritone]] ([[triad]]), so it progresses to `6` more and more. It seems to be easier to progress to `6`.
        - Maybe that's why the chorus `6` from `3~[7]` in [[Cruel Angel Thesis]] sounds so pleasant.
- I have no idea, so I watched the video and tinkered with InstaChord a bit and figured it out.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - First of all, with InstaChord, it's usually displayed as C/Am.
        - Since 1 is C, this is a major scale
        - At this time, 3 is Em and 6 is Am.
        - In the minor scale, Em is dominant and Am is tonic
            - In other words, going from 3 to 6 in a major scale is the equivalent of going from dominant to tonic in a minor scale.

            - Compared to the major scale, the minor scale has a weaker dominant to tonic connection.
                - Because it's not moving in semitones relative to the base note of the tonic.
            - 3~ing in the C/Am state is to E the Em.
                - Em becomes E, which means So becomes sharp.
                    - [[Raise the "so" a semitone.]]
            - 3~→6 would be a semitone shift from So# to La
                - Also, in the Seventh Chord, the Re is sounding, so the So# and Re make a tritone.
