Oh, you forgot to switch the weekly journal.



> [GOROman](https://twitter.com/GOROman/status/1726490372539584928) Deja vu of the OpenAI family feud. This reminds me of the feeling I once had at Unity when the founder, David Standup Collerman, was forced out after a boardroom dispute and John Riccatero came from EA and turned it into a shitty IPO.

> [GOROman](https://twitter.com/GOROman/status/1726490590349779163) Both of them are going to suck and disappear in the future

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1726643327276347658) I remember Ichisawa Hanpu, where all the engineers followed the ousted president and recruited inexperienced people at Hello Work...



> [BoufrawFrodo2](https://twitter.com/BoufrawFrodo2/status/1726642233460642069) This is another typical conflict between shelter and freedom. If children were smart enough to recognize "inconvenience as the price of shelter", it would be a different story, but I think it is quite difficult in reality.
>  >daijapan: [[A free society is a society of inequality]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1726644264288104814) So the child gives up his freedom to gain shelter [[interchange format B]], or the child gains economic power and goes outside the ruling structure, Otherwise, it leads to [[violent revolution]] (exaggeration)

> [BoufrawFrodo2](https://twitter.com/BoufrawFrodo2/status/1726645104499380551) This is rather unfortunate, because if the child is smart enough, he/she would rather have some sort of sympathy for the sheltering parent.


> [piro_or](https://twitter.com/piro_or/status/1726645968245084613) When I saw this, I wondered "what is the exchange style B" and searched for it, and now I know that there is a range from A to D. [Interview with Yukito Emaya, "Power and Exchange Style. Hope Beyond Despair｜Jimbundo](https://book.asahi.com/jinbun/article/14748689), but when I read the article, the phrase "spiritual" jumped out at me and I'm a bit reluctant to read it.
>  >nishio: well, it's exchange style B where the child gives up his freedom to gain shelter, and the child gains economic power and gets outside the ruling structure, or else it leads to violent revolution (exaggeration) twitter.com/boufrawfrodo2/...

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1726771717144801429) It's "spirit" in the nuance that humans have believed in various forms of unfounded things until now. Like the "thing-gods" who believe that goods and currency have exchange value, or that if you don't return a gift when you receive it, you will be "cursed by the spirit of hau".

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1726772304221454571) "I feel that it's somehow not good if I keep getting it" is a feeling that has been given a name and conceptualized as a spirit or a god.

> [piro_or](https://twitter.com/piro_or/status/1726775990825976175) It's what's known in psychology as the principle of return.
>  I thought that if the principle could be clarified at the level of "there is a neural circuit that responds to such and such input, and it is formed from such and such a part of the gene," then there might be no need for occult vocabulary to be used.





> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1726773961256796657/quick_promote_web/intro) that chronologically, things and money have exchange value because people believe they have exchange value. Marx described it as "the god of things."
>
>  > Marx called the mysterious phenomenon that is inevitable in a commodity economy the "godhood of things" (or "god worship") of the commodity world, likening it to the primitive worship of things such as stones and pieces of wood.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1726774118484492440) [What is Busshinsei? Meaning and usage - Kotobank](https://kotobank.jp/word/%E7%89%A9%E7%A5%9E%E6%80%A7-125191)
>  Nippon Encyclopedia (Nipponica) - Glossary of Monotheism - Capitalist society is a society based on the social division of labor and private ownership of the means of production, where labor is operated independently of each other by private producers. The products of private labor, operated independently of each other, inevitably take the form of commodities. The complex of these private labors is the total social labor...

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1726775575958986808) Then Morse, who later studied the culture of giving, asked, "Why do we feel compelled to return a gift when we receive it?" He then introduced the Maori's answer to the question "Why do we feel obliged to return a gift when we receive it? This belief in the spirit "Howe" gives rise to a culture of reciprocity.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1726777165323415692) So, after getting to this point, I looked back and wondered if Hobbes' Leviathan was also that kind of "naive faith". Hobbes compared state power to "[[leviathan]]," a "huge monster," and the fact that the "deal" is in place means that people believe in the monster's power.
- [Leviathan (Hobbes) - Wikipedia [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%AA%E3%83%B4%E3%82%A1%E3%82%A4%E3%82%A2%E3%82%B5%E3%83%B3_(%E3%83%9B%E](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%AA%E3%83%B4%E3%82%A1%E3%82%A4%E3%82%A2%E3%82%B5%E3%83%B3_(%E3%83%9B%E) 3%83%83%E3%83%96%E3%82%BA)]

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1726799391825289449) In "[[Maybe the monster that is the company is making us unhappy."]] this Leviathan Similar to the discussion, the point was made that by believing in the power of the monster that is the company, we may be voluntarily unhappy.
