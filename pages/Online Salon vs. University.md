- Online salons are open to those who can pay 10,000 yen per month.
- Universities are only open to those who pass the entrance exam, prove they are smart, and pay tuition (about 500,000 a year?). and who can pay the tuition (about 500,000 a year?).
    - Some people think that someone around 18 years old is supposed to enter, although "young" is not important because there is an entrance for working people.
