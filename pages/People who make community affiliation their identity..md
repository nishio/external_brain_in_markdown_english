title: "People who make community affiliation their identity."

The bad case I was originally trying to point to with this title.
    - [[I'm awesome to belong to this community.]]

It is very common for "community affiliation" to be used as an identity in a neutral sense in general terms.
- I'm starting to think that the majority's pattern of thinking is that way.

[[When he introduces himself, he always talks about the project he's working on and doesn't talk about his affiliation or anything like that]].

[[Community affiliation]]
