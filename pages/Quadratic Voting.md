title: "Quadratic Voting"

When [[voting]] on multiple agendas, allow voters to change the "weight of their votes per agenda item based on their interests" rather than the general "one person, one agenda item, one vote" [[mechanism design]].
- > While participants do not play exactly as game-theoretic equilibrium would predict, voting is generally linearly proportional to some noisy value, leading to much closer to optimal results than [[1p1v]] ([[1 person 1 vote]], [[one vote per person]]).
