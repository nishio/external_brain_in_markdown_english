- I want a [[place to chat]].
- The lack of a place for chit chat makes it a place for me to talk alone.
- I alone lose money by giving out information.

I wrote about this phenomenon in [Do people who learn well perform poorly?
The information intermediary ([[gatekeeper]]) is a loss, but the organization as a whole is less costly.
