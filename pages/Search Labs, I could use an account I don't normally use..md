When I tried [[Google Search Generative Experience]], [[Search Labs]] was in this state, but yesterday I heard that "I couldn't use the account I normally use either, but when I set it to an unused account, I was able to use it," so I switched to an old account I created. I switched to the account for the bot.

You can use it!

What, they don't generate it, and when you enter a conversation and ask them to explain it, all they say is "Here are the search results"?
