title: "Changing the way people work who don't enjoy their jobs"
---

- For those who enjoy their work, being forced to reduce their work hours is unpleasant
    - Measures to force Fridays off
        - I wonder if it was thought up by someone who doesn't enjoy his job.
        - Or reduce the salary to 80% as the working hours are reduced to 80%.
            - Positive-looking labor cost reductions
- I want to act on an idea as soon as it occurs to me, even if it's 1 a.m.
    - Labor regulations that prevent them from doing so are a hindrance.
- People who haven't been able to find work they enjoy.
    - If being present in the workplace is in itself a detriment, then it might be reasonable to make [basic income

People who don't enjoy their work [[work-style reform]].
