summary
- The above two precedents present contrasting conclusions regarding the conflict between modification of a work in a [[private use]] situation and the [[right of identity preservation]].
    - [In the Tokimeki Memorial case, it was confirmed that even private modification of a game with a strong narrative can infringe on personal interests if it deviates from the author's intention, and legal liability was recognized for acts that encourage modification.
    - On the other hand, in [[the Mikuni III case]], private modification was evaluated as within the scope of the author's expectation in a game whose essence is diversity of results by users, and infringement of the right of preservation of identity was denied.
- This difference suggests that the scope of the right of identity preservation varies depending on the type of work and the form of expression (whether or not the narrative is fixed).
- Even in cases where private use is permitted, legal restrictions may be imposed on actions by third parties that encourage such use, while modifications that are purely personal tend to be virtually unquestionable.
- These precedents are important guidelines for considering the balance between users' use of creative works and protection of moral rights in the digital age.
