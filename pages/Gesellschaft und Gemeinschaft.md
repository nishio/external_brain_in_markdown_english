title: "Gesellschaft und Gemeinschaft"
---

- [[Ferdinand Tennys.]] (1855-1936) said that there are two kinds [[of organizations]], right?

    - [[gemeinschaft]] (German: [[Gemeinschaft]])
        - [[community]] organization, [[community society]].
    - Social groups connected by [[human relations]] such as [[geographical]], [[blood]], [friendship
    - Member relationships and [[member comfort]] are a priority.
    - [[society]] (German: [[Gesellschaft]])
        - [[functional unit]] organization, [[profit society]].
    - A social group united for [[common purpose]], [[achievement]] of [common good
    - Profit and [[achieving objectives]] come first.

- [[Tennys.]] himself considered the whole social change in the process of [[modernize]], but the idea of this dichotomy was so useful that it was frequently cited by subsequent [[organization theory]].
Nowadays, organizations are not clearly categorized into one of these two types. The [[corporate organization]] is usually thought of as a Gesellschaft, but there are investments in [[Employee Satisfaction]], [[creating a good work environment]], [[Employee Club Activities]], and so on. [[False dichotomy]].
    - [[Large corporate families]]

    - [[teal organization]] classification, the Gesellschaft is an orange-type organization.
    - Is the Gemeinschaft a green type?
