title: "Gesellschaft und Gemeinschaft"
---

- [[Ferdinand Tennys.]] (1855-1936) said that there are two kinds [[of organizations]], right?

    - [[gemeinschaft]] (German: [[Gemeinschaft]])
        - [[community]] Organization, community society
    - Social groups linked by human relationships such as geographical, blood, and friendship
    - Members' relationships and comfort come first.
    - [[society]] (German: [[Gesellschaft]])
        - [[functional unit]] organization, interest society
    - A social group united to achieve a common purpose or benefit
    - Priority is given to achieving profits and objectives.

- [[Tennys.]] himself considered the whole social change in the process of [[modernize]], but the idea of this dichotomy was so useful that it was frequently cited by subsequent [[organization theory]].
Nowadays, organizations are not clearly classified into one of these two types. Corporate organizations are usually considered Gesellschafts, but there are investments made in [[Employee Satisfaction]] and in creating a good working environment. [[False dichotomy.]]
    - [[Large corporate families]]

    - [[teal organization]] classification, the Gesellschaft is an orange-type organization.
    - Is the Gemeinschaft a green type?
