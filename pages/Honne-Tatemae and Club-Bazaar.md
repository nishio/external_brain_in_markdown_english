title: "Honne-Tatemae and Club-Bazaar"

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/> In Japanese culture, "[[honne]]"([[本音]]) means your true feelings and desires that you usually keep to yourself or share only with close friends or family. It's like being in a private "[[club]]" where everyone understands and trusts each other. On the other hand, "[[tatemae]]"([[建前]]) is about the face you show to the wider world, the opinions and behaviors you display in public to get along with others. This is more like a "[[bazaar]]," a busy market where all sorts of ideas and personalities mix openly.

[[Richard Rorty]] uses the "club" to describe private spaces where people share ideas and values within a small, understanding group. This is similar to how "honne" works. The "bazaar" for Rorty is a lively, public place where people from different backgrounds share and debate their ideas, much like "tatemae."

So, both "honne" and "tatemae," and the "club" and "bazaar," show us how people balance being true to themselves while fitting into society. They explore how we manage our private selves and public roles, showing this balance is a common challenge everywhere.

This understanding helps us see how important it is to know the context or setting when people behave or express themselves. Whether in Japan or in Rorty's philosophical view, everyone navigates between their private truths and what they show to the world, finding a way to be true to themselves while also being part of a larger community. This comparison shows that, across cultures and ideas, we all try to find harmony between our private and public lives.

On 2024-02-12, IJUIN Hikaru pointed out on an NHK educational broadcast this. It is a natural interpretation/analogy for many Japanese people. Dr. Ju Heechul, a lecturer, commented on this matter, saying, "This time, I too used a rhetorical approach to facilitate understanding. However, it seems to me that unless we incorporate rhetoric about 'correctness'—at the very least distinguishing between 'the correct facade' and 'the possibly incorrect true feelings'—we might miss the nuances that Rorty wanted to emphasize" in [his blog written in Japanese](https://note.com/heechulju/n/nebab28b3f97c)

「[[面従腹背]]」([[menju fukuhai]]) translates to outward obedience but inward opposition. This phrase captures the idea of someone who appears to agree or comply on the surface but internally disagrees or even works against what they outwardly support. It underscores the complexity of social interactions where individuals might navigate their roles within societal or cultural expectations while harboring different personal beliefs or intentions.

「[[嘘も方便]]」([[uso mo houben]]) means that lies can be a strategic or expedient measure, suggesting that not all truths need to be spoken if bending the truth serves a greater good or a practical purpose. This phrase ties into the nuanced understanding of "honne" and "tatemae," where the latter can involve presenting a facade that may not entirely align with one's true feelings (honne) but serves to maintain harmony or achieve a specific outcome. It touches upon the ethical or moral considerations in how we present ourselves in public versus private spheres, reflecting on the 'correctness' of such actions.

Both phrases highlight the delicate balance between sincerity and social harmony in Japanese culture and the nuanced ethical considerations that come with navigating personal authenticity versus public conformity. They reflect the broader philosophical discussions about the nature of truth, the role of individual agency in social interactions, and the ethical dimensions of conforming to social norms or expectations.
