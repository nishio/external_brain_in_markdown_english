Last month [[November 2020 Muscle Training]].

12/2
- My wife bought an exercise band.
    - [https://bukiya.net/blog/abstubemenu/](https://bukiya.net/blog/abstubemenu/)
    - I have a wobbly torso to begin with, and abdominal training often makes my back hurt, so I'm not ready to take on the load.
    - The problem is that they don't distinguish between "contracting the abdominal muscles" and "deflecting the waist," "thrusting the neck forward," etc.
    - The habit of thrusting the neck forward is often described in abdominal training as "looking at the navel" because
        - If you try to look at the navel while not using your abdominal muscles properly, you will end up bending your neck too hard.
        - Focus on "touching knees" and "exhaling" with hips and knees bent at 90 degrees
            - If there's room in that goal position, just look at the navel.
    - Don't move it fast and use recoil.
    - Hands should not be below the waist in the starting position

- Supported squat 120
    - I guess I lost a lot of strength while I was slacking off, or maybe it was just too hard to do 120 times.
