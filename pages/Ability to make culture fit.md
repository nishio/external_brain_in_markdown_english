title: "Ability to make culture fit"
---

Culture fit The expression "do" or "do not" implicitly assumes that the condition will not change
- In fact, "[[culture fit]]" can
    - Transform something that is not a culture fit into a culture fit.

Why is there so little discussion of this perspective?
- Is it because "culture fit" is a hot topic in the recruitment process for business organizations?
- No organization's side goes out of its way to culture fit individual applicants.
    - I'm not going to spend that kind of money on someone who's not going to join the company.
- The cultural fit of the individual applicant to the organization is
    - Individuals can change before applying.
    - When we interview someone and internally say, "This person is not a culture fit," we don't give feedback to change that individual.
        - It increases the risk and does not justify taking a risk on someone who is not going to join the company.

There are individuals who are highly skilled at fitting themselves into the culture of the target organization.
- Seems to have a lot of advantages over people who are lower.
