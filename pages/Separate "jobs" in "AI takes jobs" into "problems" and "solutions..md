title: 'Separate "jobs" in "AI takes jobs" into "problems" and "solutions.'

AI will take jobs." is [[ellipsis]].
- Separate "[[work]]" into "[question (e.g. on a test)" and "[[solution]]".
- AI increases the [[productivity]] of the [[solution]] of the [[AI user]].
- If the quantity of "problems" is limited, then the price of "solutions" gets cheaper.
        - Balance [supply and demand
    - Easily mentioned as a job that affects tax accountants.
        - Even if the solution is easier, it won't increase the demand for the problem.
        - No one says, "Let's file taxes twice because it's twice as easy."
- This story has two conditions
    - AI should increase the productivity of "solutions".
    - The supply of "solutions" is inexpensive and the demand for "problems" is not increasing.

Another expression
- If productivity does not increase and demand does not increase, prices will fall.
- Many software engineers in the vicinity are concerned about what will happen to software engineers in the future
    - Software engineers would be the first job category to see an increase in productivity.
    - The situation may vary depending on the type of business, but for sites where "there are many things to improve, but we don't have enough engineering resources, so we have to prioritize and select them", the situation will improve for the time being because "the problems to be solved exceed the productivity of the solutions".
    - The "we refuse to customize for specific customers because it's not cost-effective" talk can be avoided if productivity is increased.
    - In the long run, it's going to be harder for new companies to enter the market when those "already contracted software vendors" start offering customizations for their customers at a lower price.
