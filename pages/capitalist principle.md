title: "capitalist principle"
---

Just before I fell asleep, I thought, "There are three principles,"but when I fell asleep and woke up, I could only remember two.
    - [[principle of the extended reproduction apparatus]]
    - In a capitalist society
        - [[reproduction on an enlarged or expanded scale]] with [equipment
        - A system that comes out more in [[being a lap behind (e.g. motor sports)]] when you put capital into it.
    - Getting this is the high road in playing the game of capitalist society.
    - [[Principle of limited resources]]
    - If the good is limited, that [[limited resources]] will be unobtainable
    - If you join late, you get the bad stuff.
    - Good expansion equipment is no longer available, leaving only the bad.
    - Those who didn't get it underestimate its value.
            - [[sour grapes]]
            - Sometimes it's jealousy, but not always.
        - Simply "not having had the opportunity to observe the good stuff", they confidently underestimate its value based on their own experience.
    - [[principle of parallel growth]]
    - Some things take time.
        - The "time-delayed" part of the expanded reproduction device
            - Image of [vegetative growth
    - Bring it to a state where it will grow without your help and then leave it alone.
    - It is especially good to do several [[random events]] in parallel
