title: "Scale-out improves organizational productivity"

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1892401871840825537) This is a development of the recent discussion about Cursor being scale-up and Devin being scale-out. Scale-up tools are tools that [[increase individual productivity]], while scale-out tools are tools that [[increase overall organizational productivity]].

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1892402715621237111) Devin-like AI agents virtually increase the number of members in an organization. Organizations were created in the first place by scaling out founders to "do bigger things than they could do individually". In doing so, costs for "recruitment," "education," and "alignment of vision" were incurred, but these costs will be drastically reduced.
