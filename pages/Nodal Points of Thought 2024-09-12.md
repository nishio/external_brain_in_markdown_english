[[Dilemma of Acquiring Knowledge from Outside]]
[[There Are Two Information Inflow Paths into an Organization]]

During the [[Broad Listening Diagram Study Group]], I drew a picture of [[Multiple Organizations and Broad Listening]] for the first time, and I feel like something might emerge from it.

Internal Resources of a Company
- I'm not sure if it relates to today's topic, but I remembered a topic I intended to write about before but never did.
- "A company has internal resources."
- Those who have never been part of a company have never observed this.
- Even if you belong to one, it might take time to understand?
- By possessing some internal resources, a company can produce more efficiently than through division of labor by unspecified people in the market, thus maintaining a competitive advantage and surviving.
    - [[Resources Within the Membrane]]

There are things that make me happy and unhappy about being an information hub.
- Information gathers.
- The cost of communication increases.
    - [[Two Types of Notifications: "You May View" and "I Want You to View"]]
    - When capacity overflows, "You may view" is usually discarded first.
    - Next, reactions to "I want you to view" notifications become more cost-efficient.
        - Using Slack stamps for reactions is one example.

In both cases, I am the information hub.
It might be better to distinguish between IN and OUT.

This only depicts IN.

When the cost of output is 10, it's easier to output 10 in a public space and transfer it to each place with a cost of 1 (2) rather than doing it in two places for a total of 20 (1).

- Although I wrote as if public disclosure is rational, the logic is flawed.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/3099dd95e2e8912e16f57155f2ac69c0/thumb/1000)
- A separate reason is needed for why this doesn't happen.
    - For example:
        - If the output of 10 is in a form like audio, which is difficult to transfer, it cannot be transferred to B later.
        - If what is output within A is treated as an internal document, it cannot be transferred to B, or there are costs in obtaining permission to do so.
        - Even if the costs written in (2) and (3) are the same, there are unexpected returns from placing information in a public space.
    - For example:
        - During the [[KJ Method Study Group @ Loftwork]], I confirmed in advance whether I could make the materials public.
        - During the [[ChatGPT Article @ Information Processing]], I confirmed in advance whether I could place the manuscript on Scrapbox.
        - Regarding the internal use of TTTC, I plan to write the know-how in a public space.

This is merely a combination of [[Dilemma of Acquiring Knowledge from Outside]] and [[There Are Two Information Inflow Paths into an Organization]].
- We should make use of the insight from [[Multiple Organizations and Broad Listening]] that "IN and OUT should be distinguished."
- "[[Abstract and Circulate]]" is a method of outputting what has been IN without obtaining permission.
- I explicitly ask, "Can I make this public?" or "How about this way of writing?" quite often.
    - For example, in [[Meetup with Thomas Hardjono]], I cut out part of what I wrote and made it public.
