### digest
.
Happiness takes different forms for each individual. It is important to choose good luck and avoid bad luck, and this depends on individual perception. The best also differs from person to person, and recognizing this is the path to happiness. The definition of happiness is different for each individual, and self-determination contributes to happiness. Happiness is not measured by "how you are evaluated by others," but by self-evaluation.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The fragments "each person is unique," "the best is different for each person," "the definition of happiness," "self-determination contributes to happiness," and "the measure of happiness becomes 'how you are valued by others'" are relevant to the content of the note. These reinforce the notion that happiness takes different forms for each individual.

### deep thinking
The idea that happiness takes different forms for each individual demonstrates the importance of respecting each person's individuality and values. This approach encourages each individual to find his or her own happiness, rather than imposing a uniform form of happiness.

### summary of thoughts
