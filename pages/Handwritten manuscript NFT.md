I wrote the manuscript by hand because I don't know much about writing manuscripts with digital tools or anything like that." The manuscript is for sale at [[NFT]]."

If you could own [[handwritten manuscript]] by Hirosue at [[NFT]], I'm sure there would be people who would want to write it.
- A handwritten manuscript with your favorite phrase, framed and displayed, [[emo (i.e. effeminate)]].
- I thought it was a good use of NFT.
