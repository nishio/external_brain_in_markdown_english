title: "Etymology of Happiness"

> In Aya Shimazu's "Ito," she says, "To be able to meet the thread that one should meet / People call it 'luck'" is etymologically correct. Originally, [[chance]] was called "[[happiness]]," and the word for a good chance encounter was "shitsukiawase ga iwasai," which was contracted to "shitsukiawase desu ka," and then the kanji was applied to the word to make it "[[happiness]]. A well-thought-out lyric.

> The etymology of the word [[happy]] is the same as [[happen]], and the original meaning is "happiness of [[(by) chance]]". I hope you can somehow recognize it by yourself, but it may be difficult because the meanings are so far apart. Actually, the Japanese word for "happiness" is the same as the Japanese word for "chance".
