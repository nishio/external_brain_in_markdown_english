One step ahead of you, it's crowded.
A dream story that has never been told is a big story
We must move on quickly.
Don't look back.
I have to run.
flood of tsunamis
Wider observation range
You have to see it with your own eyes.
It doesn't make sense to see the same things as other people and
We have to keep our eyes on what is hard to see.
What looks like the right answer is wrong.
A wide gate is a road to destruction
Alone like the horn of a rhinoceros.
You have to go through the thorns.
We need to pack less.
Can't move on fast enough.

Easy to see movement inside when the water is still.
The oracle of sleep is meant to be awake and not inputting information for a long period of time.
The Zazen of Sleep
If you see a fish, scoop it.
in a web of metaphors
If we let go of public language and make it a personal metaphor.
Bring us closer.
The preoccupation with words that must be communicated
Let go of attachment once and for all.
Because you either get the message or you don't.
Thinking before writing is deskilling and
Just write it down and then give it to the LLM to observe.
Hypothesis testing process
Premature and worrisome groundless fears

Third way to speak
Talk to someone who has been identified.
Speak to an unspecified group of people
Talk to something that is not an identified person.
Teddy bears, rubber ducks
Talking without responding is beneficial.
Is it even more beneficial to reply?
Whether it disturbs the surface of the water
What if my core is not blurred?
Blurring, playing, and not moving is not always a good thing.
Flexibility to change
Interaction with Monsters
Whether or not a specter does harm depends on how humans behave.
