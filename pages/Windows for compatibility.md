title: "Windows for compatibility"

- Windows, which emphasizes [[compatibility]], or an Apple-style OS that bangs [[truncates]] old systems?

Personally, I prefer Apple systems, but I think it's rather harsh to be told to update the whole OS to update Xcode because it doesn't work.

For those who are able to [[move]] more and more into new things, a system that cuts and advances more and more is closer to the current optimal solution, so it has more utility.
- Various ties may prevent us from moving.
    - Like being banned from updating in-house systems because they don't work with the new OS.
