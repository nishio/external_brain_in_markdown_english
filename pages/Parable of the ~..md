title: "Parable of the ~."

The term "[[metaphor]]" is convenient, but it may seem formal or unfamiliar.

I like the phrase "[[even if]]." I often use it in the expression "even if."

Consider the choice of translation in translating this into English.

The expression "parable of the mustard seed" comes from the Christian Bible, which says, "[[Parable of the mustard seed]]". This is a parable that many people around the world have heard.

I looked up the English expression for this and found that Wikipedia has it under the heading [[Parable of the Mustard Seed]].
[Parable of the Mustard Seed - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Mustard_Seed)
So it would not be wrong to use [[PARABLE]].
