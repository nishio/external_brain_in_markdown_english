Using Tokyo and Taiwan as examples, the report states that "broad listening" (a method of absorbing the voices of citizens in multiple directions by utilizing AI, rather than a one-way broadcast type) is attracting attention in order to revitalize democratic politics in the age of AI. Specifically, the following points are discussed.
- In the Tokyo gubernatorial election, independent AI engineer Takahiro Anno practiced interactive policy formation using GitHub and AI avatars to reflect the voices of many citizens.
- The Audrey Tang-led initiative in Taiwan also influenced the passage of legislation by facilitating large groups of people to exchange opinions inexpensively and quickly through AI facilitation.
- These examples have led to the creation of new mechanisms for SNS, such as "Community Notebook," and have attracted worldwide attention.
- In short, the proposal is to break away from "one-way political propaganda" and to strengthen democratic politics through broad citizen participation (broad listening) using AI.
