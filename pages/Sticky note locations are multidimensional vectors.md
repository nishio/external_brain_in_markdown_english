title: "Sticky note locations are multidimensional vectors"
---

The position of a sticky note is basically a multidimensional vector
- We tend to think of it as "two-dimensional," but it is a mapping of multidimensional vectors to two dimensions.
- This way you can solve the problem of automatic layout: "Manual placement is an intellectual product and I don't want it to be overwritten by automatic generation.
    - We can do automatic layout in the immediate subspace.
- Difference from having multiple views
    - Can interpolate arbitrarily between views
