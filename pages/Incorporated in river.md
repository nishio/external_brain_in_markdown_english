<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>New Zealand enacted a law in 2017 granting legal personality to the "[[Wanganui River]]". This law recognizes the Whanganui River as a single "living entity" and gives the river the same rights as a human being. Below is a brief summary of the background and significance of this event.

background
- [[Maori]] culture and beliefs:
    - The Whanganui River is very important to the Maori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, and is deeply connected to their culture and spirituality.
    - For generations, protecting and respecting the river was part of Maori life and beliefs.
- A prolonged legal struggle:
    - Maori have been engaged in a legal struggle to protect their river rights since the 19th century.
    - As a result, negotiations with the New Zealand government proceeded, and it was finally decided to grant the river legal personality.
significance
- A new model of environmental protection:
    - By granting juridical status to a piece of nature, a new approach to environmental protection has been created.
    - This protects the river as a legal entity and protects it from development and pollution.
- Respect for Maori rights and culture:
    - Traditional Maori values and the legal system were harmonized, and their rights and culture were officially recognized.
    - This is a landmark development in Maori government relations.
- International Impact:
    - This move attracted international attention and provided other countries with a new perspective on nature conservation.
    - Other regions have begun to introduce similar laws.

New Zealand's decision to grant juridical personality to the Wanganui River was important for both environmental protection and respect for the rights of indigenous peoples.
