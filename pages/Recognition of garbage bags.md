title: "Recognition of garbage bags"

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1821355438731878493) I thought that there is a difference in [[difference in perception]] or [[evaluation function]] of things in the difference between a room becoming tidy and a room not becoming tidy. When there was a garbage bag with 1.3 plastic bottles in it, I perceived it as "a garbage bag full of garbage" and "a place to throw away plastic bottles" when it was untidy, so I only had one bag to throw away.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1821356832117469500) As a result of education in a dozen years of marriage, the 0.3 bag was first recognized as something that could be thrown away. Then there was a separate decision to throw it away or not. The physical consumption of one garbage bag was easy to understand, but the cost of having a bag of garbage stay was harder to comprehend, so they chose not to throw it away

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1821358590294118662) I finally had one realization today, if I save the 0.3 bag instead of throwing it away, the 0.3 amount of plastic bottle trash doesn't fit in the regulation trash can and overflows into the second bag! I noticed that the period is extended. Which means a decision will now be made on whether or not to eliminate next week's "period of dumping plastic bottles in the second bag on the floor."

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1821359236175077765) After thinking about it that much, I finally said, "Well, you should just throw it away!" and I was able to throw away the bag with only 0.3 plastic bottles in it, wholeheartedly convinced. I guess I will be able to get rid of things little by little by repeating this kind of shift in cognition and evaluation functions. The road is long (14 years)
