- Discord DM, Facebook Messenger, X(Twitter), Signal could be consolidated into [Beeper
    - I've also connected Telegram and Instagram, but I haven't exchanged much with them, so I can't confirm that they're working properly.
- Slack and Discord workspace stuff is subtle.
    - Slack is also a pain to have to log in separately for each workspace.
        - For now, I've only connected the most likely Yasuno team.

- LINE is not an option.

I wondered how they would get the data and then I got an export request.

Well, there's always been talk that it would be nice if all chats could be unified, and in the end, the companies that do that are the ones who make the money and maintain the service.
