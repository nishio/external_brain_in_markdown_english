from [[180308 Memo.]] / 2023-09-30 cut out and added
human system

- [[system]] includes not only [[computerized systems]] but also human systems
- Some systems, like chemical plants, consist of chemicals, reactors, and pipes.
- Programmers are people with an aptitude for "understanding and hacking systems" compared to the average human being
- I didn't realize [[the human system]] was a system, now I realize it.
- Human systems do not have publicly available source code, [[closed source]].
    - This is not a special thing, we will unravel it through [[experimentation and verification]].
- Understanding how knowledge and concepts are related to each other, just as we understand how functions and variables are intertwined in source code.
- There are efficient data structures, etc.
- An example of the correspondence between knowledge of the structure of a program and knowledge of the human system is the [mediator pattern
    - Reduce the amount of interaction by having an intermediary
    - Examples of "organizers" of events
