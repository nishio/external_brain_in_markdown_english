title: "Connection between LLM and Plurality"

from  [[As yet unnamed concepts that emerge from experience]]
Connection between [[LLM]] and [Plurality
- > I thought that my understanding of the connection between the LLM story and the Plurality story was not well shared, so I tried to verbalize it a little more.
- > First of all, even before I met Plurality, I thought that LLM had a great impact on the way organizations were organized: [[Changes in organizational structure brought about by LLM]].
- >  This is an extension of what was said in "[[teal organization]]" about how > changes in the technological environment have changed the organizational structure.
- >  But the idea I was writing about here is being used in reality in the context of Plurality, in the form of Polis, vTaiwan, etc., with the name of Broad Listening.

I wrote a more detailed story.
> [nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1651044245158125568) I drew this for my colleges. They didn't understand the possible combination of Broad Listening(such as Polis) and Large Language Model(such as GPT) in future.

> [nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1651052732571328512/photo/1) If I understand correctly, there are at least three technologies heading toward Plurality.
>  X: Broad Listening (or visualization of opinion distribution among diversity)
>  Y: Quadratic Funding (it is an implementation of redistribution of resources among diversity)
>  Z: Large Language Model (it makes communication among diversity efficient)

> [nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1651053746665971713) Some might wonder why not mention of Decentralized Identity? DID is important component of both Broad Listening and Quadratic Funding. I just avoided to draw four-dimensional cube. That is why I used the words "at least three".

> [nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1651065863725002752) One more thing. I wrote "Quadratic Funding" but I feel it too specific. I don't know comprehensive term for the mechanisms such as Quadratic Funding, Retroactive Funding and Social Impact Bond.
