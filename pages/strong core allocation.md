title: "strong core allocation"
---

That the allocation $x$ is a strong core allocation is
- $y_i \succsim_i x_i \quad \forall i \in T$
- $y_j \succ_j x_j \quad \exists j \in T$
- $\{y_i: i \in T\} = \{ w_i: i \in T\}$
There must be no $T \subseteq I$ and $y \in X$ that satisfy
- [[Mechanism Design (Book)]]  p.138

If it is a strong core allocation, it is efficient and individual rationality.

Individual Rationality:$x_i \succsim_i w_i \quad \forall i \in I$
- $w_i$ is the initial holding
