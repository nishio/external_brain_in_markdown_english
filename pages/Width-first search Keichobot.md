title: "Width-first search Keichobot"
---

- [[Preparation for Omoikane Study Group]]
- While Kozaneba is more user-friendly with the help of GPT, [[Keichobot]] is mostly encompassed by ChatGPT
- I felt that "[[breadth first search]]", which I hadn't done before, was emerging as a "non-chatty use case".

- Keichobot concept is split in two
    - [[If you ask me questions about what I've written, I can make progress on the language]].
        - This will be more beneficial than ever.
    - Chat-like UI
        - This one feels not so much.
