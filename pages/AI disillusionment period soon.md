title: "AI disillusionment period soon"

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1643889910544465921) Soon, we will see a period of disillusionment among users as they are rushed to "just put AI functionality in existing services right now! Soon, services that are rushed to "just add AI functions to existing services right now" will be flooded with services with crude API functions, and users will become disillusioned with them. When the means to "use AI" becomes an objective, customer value will be neglected.
