I started wearing [[Vibram]] and now the sole of my left foot hurts.
- I guess it was never discovered because the shoes ([[MBT]]) had never been bent in the sole before.
- It occurs only on the left leg, so the body must be distorted.

- I have been wearing Vibram Five Fingers for a little over a week now, and what used to be a rambling "my soles don't feel good, I want to step on green bamboo and massage them" has loosened up, and as a result, I have a clearer idea of where the problem is. It seems that the muscle crossing the sole of my left foot is tight.
- Compared to the shoes I had been wearing, I found that I had not been able to move my fingers and ankles much with the shoes on. I also realized that when I stepped on the green bamboo, there was no movement in the direction of rounding my foot vertically because of its cylindrical shape.
    - > Kazuhiro Shiozawa: I heard that human beings, by nature, curl up vertically when climbing a tree. Modern people can only hold a tree between their legs, can't they? It is because of our shoes. According to Dr. Jun Kaneko.
    - Rather than stepping on green bamboos of a certain shape indoors, "taking a walk and stepping on a stump" outdoors is more effective in relaxing the feet, perhaps because the blood circulation is better after the feet have been moved. The fact that the roots of the trees in the park are in various shapes also stimulates the feet in various ways, and one is forced to try stepping here and there in search of just the right one, thus adding various kinds of massage to the feet.
- But the problem of the tightness of the sole muscle of my left foot due to my long-standing habit of walking, etc., does not go away in a week. As a result, it remains unresolved and is noticeable.
        - I don't think it's as bad as [[plantar fasciitis]], but that's exactly where it is. Since he is a person who does not exercise much, I think he has not moved it too much until now, rather than too much exercise load caused inflammation. It would be better to do it gradually while resting so that the inflammation doesn't get worse.
