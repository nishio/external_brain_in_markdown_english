- When [[the system]] consisted exclusively of people, [[running the system]] was almost the same as [[motivating a person]].
In [[systems without human intervention]], running the system no longer means running people.

I don't have to move people anymore.
    - [[Don't persuade people you don't need to persuade.]]

On the other hand, there are systems that you think don't require human intervention, but in fact require human intervention.
- This one is a mistake software engineers tend to make.
