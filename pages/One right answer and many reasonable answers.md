title: "One right answer and many reasonable answers"

> [budoucha](https://x.com/budoucha/status/1805936595863777683) If you ask someone who knows [[correct]] to tell you the correct answer, you will get [[knowledge]] about one of the correct answers, but if you do a lot of research [[trial and error]], you get one (or more) correct answers, a lot of [[incorrect answers]], and [[extensive knowledge]] and experience in a slightly related area or an area that turns out to be irrelevant, which can make a big difference when accumulated over several times.

> [isoo_](https://x.com/isoo_/status/1806258298787881143) The "right answer" changes with different values, so it is better to know many different "[[reasonable solutions]]" instead of one right answer.

>  I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.
>  You say.
