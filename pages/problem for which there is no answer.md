title: "problem for which there is no answer"
---

The term "[[question (e.g. on a test)]] without [[answer]]" has low resolution. There is a difference between "a question for which the [[answer]] is unknown but can be [[verified]] after the fact to see if the answer given is correct" and "a question that cannot even be verified.

A [[complete issue]] is a problem for which we know the answer exists, but the answer itself is not yet known" ([[Kohei Okubo]]).
- This is what happens when you flesh out "a problem without an answer is still incomplete as a problem." [src](https://www.facebook.com/nishiohirokazu/posts/10219157109215122)
