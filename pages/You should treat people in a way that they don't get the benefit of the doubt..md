title: "You should treat people in a way that they don't get the benefit of the doubt."

> "Mr. Okuda, you don't seem like a [[great person]] because you don't [[look great]]! I was told.
>  A lot of people take a [[pompous attitude]] because they treat people who are pompous with great care. Because they get more benefits that way.
>  So you really should treat people in a way that they don't get the benefit of the high and mighty.
>  By the way, am I the only one who feels some kind of stress when you use the word "great"? It's stressful to think of someone as "[[great]]" and to be thought of as "[[great]].
>  I see, "great" means "[[not flat]] I'm stressed!
