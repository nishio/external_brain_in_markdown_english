- Trade-off between [[subjectivity]] and [exploitability

I think exploitability is "exploitability" in this context.
- > we formally define "exploitability" as "the protocol provides intrinsic opportunities for profitable attacks"
    - We formally define "exploitability" as "a protocol that inherently provides an opportunity for a beneficial attack."
