While it is easier for Japanese people to understand [[roti]]'s "[[Bazaar and Clubs]]" by mapping it to "[[a place where one must speak in a formal manner]]" and "[[a place where one can speak one's true feelings]]", it is pointed out that the layer of "correctness" is missing if it ends with that.
    - [[Rorty, "Coincidence, Irony, and Solidarity" in 100 Minutes de Meikyoku]]
- Context: [[Honne - Tatemae and Club - Bazaar]].

(NHK p.39-40)
- [[Public and private should not be merged.]]

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1757662838079021117) In other words, this also has something in common with the Japanese value system that "there are true feelings and tatemae" [[which recognizes the coexistence of two opposing things]]. To put it more precisely, it is not that "Honne is true feeling and tatemae is a lie," or that "tatemae is essential for social life, so don't make unnecessary true feelings," but that both honne and tatemae have equal value.

I'm reading [[Bazaar and Clubs]] from here.

[[anthropologist as diversity expert]], [[ethnocentrism advocate]], [[Lévi-Strauss]], [[roti]], [[spiteful]], [[universalist values]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1757665716256600424) [[freedom]], [[equality]], [[basic human rights]], [[A product of chance in the local area]], [cultural empire It also overlaps with the recent issue of people who are negative about technology calling people who are positive about technology "[[accelerationists]]" as a [[pejorative]] term.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1757666968835141704) Levi-Strauss "[[ethnocentrism is rather good]]" [[immunity to other values]], [[defensiveness]]. In other words, this means that without defensiveness, a slightly stronger one will invade and override it, leading to a uniform and homogeneous "[[bad equilibrium]]", so the existence of a bias that perceives a higher value in one's own culture than it actually is can work beneficially in protecting cultural diversity.
    - [[Equilibrium is recession]]

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1757667505391481055) Oh, I forgot to mention (NHK p.39-40) that I called this [[Rorty, "Coincidence, Irony, and Solidarity" in 100 Minutes de Meikyoku]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1757667818349433178) I'm reading this one right now. ~p.14 [[Bazaar and Clubs]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1757668602944389382) Levistrose thinks the problem is that [[ethnocentrism aversion]] has reduced [[immunity to maintain diversity]]. This appears to overlap with recent arguments such as [[Vitalik Buterin's]] assertion that "[[E/A]] and [[e/acc]] are fighting, but both are going in the direction of undermining diversity, and we need [[d/acc]] to protect diversity.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1757671823859450078) anti-ethnocentrism, Rorty "[[postmodern bourgeois liberalist]]" PBL compatibility among three individuals. Rorty himself did not say it, but Giertz found "anti - anti-ethnocentrism". Loyalty to one's own culture, exaltation of ethnocentrism, source of morality (not sure about this part).

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1757673118175506466) Oh, I see, the "immunity is necessary" thing you mentioned earlier was Levistroth's idea, not Rorty's, as an extension of [[liberal democracy]]. Rorty said, "It's [[nostalgic ethnocentrism]]," to which Geertz responded, "No, it's [[anti-anti-ethnocentrism]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1757673513035698225) I've been going along, jotting down thoughts and key words from the book, and it's already been 50 minutes, so let's fold up the bathtub for the day!

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1757674754893603017) After thinking up to the point where "there is value in both the real and the tatemae," I thought, "Well, let's see what Rorty has to say about the clubs and the bazaar in more detail. Let's see." and started reading "The Bazaar and the Club," but ended today's exploration at the description of the discussion situation before the main part of the book
