title: "Two types of mobility"
---

nomadic hunter-gatherer
    - [[pure gift]] and [[reciprocal gift]]
    - [[Marcel Morse]]
        - reciprocity of a gift
    - [[Marshall Sahlins]]
        - hunter-gatherer society
        - pure gift
            - [[joint deposit]]
    - Emorya believes that the principle of reciprocity was formed after settlement
    - Thought experiment on [nomadic hunter-gatherer
    - [[Drifting Bands]]
    - 25-50 persons
        - Joint deposition of food = equal distribution
        - Joint hunting
    - Constant movement makes it impossible to stockpile the harvest
        - [[Distribute because there is no point in owning]].
[[The Settlement Revolution]]
- Reciprocity principle that avoids the state
    - [[Gordon Child]]
        - [[Neolithic Revolution]]
        - Emaya: "The idea that agriculture led to settlement is dubious."
            - Hunter-gatherers also settle
            - Cases where settlement did not result in accumulation of products and inequality of wealth and power
                - A mechanism was invented to prevent
                - That's [[reciprocity of a gift]].
                - We call this the "settlement revolution."
    - [[Clan society]] is not a prelude to state formation, but an attempt to circumvent the path to state society.
        - Advanced Society
        - The Way Beyond the State
    - How can we introduce reciprocity without relying on God's commands?
            - [[Freud]] "[[Totems and taboos]]"
- Reciprocity as "[[the]] return of the oppressed."
    - [[original father killed]]
        - The original father never existed.
        - Family bonding was fragile.
        - Nation = Original Father
            - Prevent this formation
            - totemism
            - repetition of the original father-killer
    - Freud thought the murdered original father would regress.
    - Emorya considered the mobility lost by settlement, and the freedom and equality it brings
Two Kinds of Nomads
- Farming and cattle raising emerged in the original city.
    - child
        - Agriculture and cattle raising → expansion of productive forces → urban development → class decomposition → state
    - The Economics of the City]," [[Jayne Jacobs]].
        - reverse
        - Agriculture began in "[[the original city]]"
        - The "original city" began as a place of trade between communities.
        - Trade → original city → information accumulation → agriculture
        - Emaya supports this hypothesis.
        - [[Tadao Umesao]] "[[The World of Hunting and Nomadism]]"
        - Criticizes the idea that cattle ranching occurred as a development of husbandry
        - Sheep, for example, are herding animals that live in herds on grasslands.
        - Occurred in the meadows.
        - Karaya: invented in the original city where information accumulates
            - Agriculture and cattle raising invented
            - Differentiation between farmers and nomads
            - Nomads left the original city and became nomadic.
            - Restored the nomadic nature that was present in nomadic hunter-gatherers.
            - [[Nomads and farmers have a division of labor.]]
                    - [[Farmers and Trade]]
                - As a [[merchant]], [[trade]] with the community
                        - [[People on the move connect people who settle down.]] だね<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- [[Nomads form a nation]]
    - Nomads conquer and subjugate farmers.
        - State Formation
    - Exchange of protection for obedience
        - interchange format B
    - No absolute authority arises from within the community.
        - External conquests are necessary for a kingdom to be established
        - Even if conquest does not take place, defense against the threat of conquest creates a collectivized state.
    - Nomads are between communities and infiltrate them through commerce and war
        - Nomadic nomadism is exchange modes B and C, not A
    - [[Mountain People]]([[Zomia]])
        - [[James Scott]]
- Nomadology cannot transcend state and capital.
    - [[Deleuze & Guattari]] "[[A Thousand Plateaus]]" [[Nomadology]].
    - State vs. [[war machine]].
    - Hoping to dismantle [[the Cold War structure]].
        - Ideologizing to justify [[the empire of capital]], [neoliberalism
    - A new type of nomad
        - [[Jetsetter]]
    - With this kind of playfulness, you can't go beyond capital=nation=state.
    - The clue to transcend is hunter-gatherer nomadism.
        - That is the exchange style D
        - Comes compulsively as a "regression of the repressed" as was the case with Exchange Form A.
- [[Kunio Yanagida]]
- Yanagida worked all his life on the nomadic nature of pre-settlement
