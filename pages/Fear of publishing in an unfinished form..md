title: "Fear of publishing in an unfinished form."
---

- Hypothesis that people who experience [[negative]] feedback on [[incomplete]] things will be afraid to publish them unfinished.

It's not finished, and I think I should fix it, but it's not useful to be told "You should fix it! There is no real benefit in being told "You should fix it!
Especially when the speaker is the type to give emotional, intrusive "advice" that is simply offensive without any real benefit.
There are people who find something incomplete that they are about to make and give advice even though they are not going to make it themselves.
There are types of people in the world who get emotional satisfaction from giving advice #adviceguilty

In that situation, you should be weakening the "relationship with that person", but you're weakening the "going public" side by mistake.
