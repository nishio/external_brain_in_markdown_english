- Significance and problems of [[abstraction]]ed [careerism
- The [[abstract model]] has the advantage of presenting a [[framework]] that is [widely applicable
- However, individual [[constraints]], [[skills]], and [[values]] (= subjects of [[enthusiasm]]) can easily be left out.
- Abstraction tends to be "for people with no skills or enthusiasm".

Specific examples and customization needs
- Personalized customization is needed to take advantage of the abstract model.
    - Balancing childcare and work," "financial constraints," "how to make the most of personal enthusiasm," etc.
- Without concrete examples, it is difficult to get clues about personalized customization and ultimately how to act.

Bias to work in an iffy way.
- It is also easy to drift in the direction of "[[safety]]" because of its nature of being applicable to everyone.
    - May encourage a way of working that disregards [[challenge]] and [[enthusiasm]].
- The person presenting the abstract model is required to provide appropriate concrete examples while indicating the possibility that it is "not necessarily the best".

The overall consensus was that the abstract model is only a "[[foundation]]," and that how it is applied to each situation is important.
