Definition of Happiness
- > A classic example can be found in J. S. Mill's "Utilitarianism.
- > >Happiness means the presence of pleasure and the absence of pain. Unhappiness means the presence of pain and the absence of comfort.
- Mill thinks there's [[the right to execute a fool]] in the first place, so he'd have to allow someone who "wants to use [[euphoric drugs]] and live happily ever after" to use them, even if a third party thinks it's folly to do so.
