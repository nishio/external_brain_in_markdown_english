synthetic technocracy
No, I disagree. It is true that a universal basic income (UBI) may not have an immediate effect in countries with higher wages, but it would still provide a safety net for all. It would reduce economic insecurity, reduce the stress caused by job insecurity, and would not force people to take jobs they don't want for fear of poverty. It would also give people the flexibility to take risks, like starting a new business or getting an education, which may ultimately lead to economic growth and innovation.

corporate libertarianism
Yes, a universal basic income (UBI) would provide short-term relief for some, but it is not the optimal solution in developed countries with high wages. It may discourage [[entrepreneurship]] and risk-taking, which are the driving forces of innovation and progress. Competition, challenge, and ambition motivate people to strive for success; UBI may create a safety net, but it may also lead to a comfort zone that unintentionally inhibits individuals from reaching their full potential. Moreover, who will finance the UBI, which often leads to higher taxes, placing new burdens on businesses and stifling economic growth?

digital democracy
The effects of a universal basic income (UBI) are neutral, as they depend largely on the country's circumstances; a UBI can provide stability and the freedom for citizens to think innovatively and creatively. Developed countries may already have high wages, but the gap between rich and poor still exists; UBI has the potential to narrow this gap and encourage citizen participation in social decision-making. However, its implementation and effectiveness should be evaluated using the democratic processes and public data that constitute the key tenets of Audrey Tan's philosophy. Thus, such conclusions cannot be confirmed without extensive, open-source research and comprehensive citizen participation.
