title: "Identification of people"
---

Human illogical bias. Can be positive or negative.

    - [[Identification with oneself and others]]
    - Feeling that others and oneself are one and the same
    - I think they know what I know.
            - [[common sense]]
    - Expect the other person to feel the emotions you feel toward an object
            - [[empathy]]
        - [https://ja.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/偽の合意効果](https://ja.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/偽の合意効果)
    - Reverse pattern
        - I don't think they know what I know.
            - I think [[lie]] will fool you.
        - I don't think anyone understands how I feel.
    - [[Identification with others]]
    - Different Mr. X and Mr. Y feel identical.
    - I think what I have told Mr. X has been conveyed to Mr. Y.
    - concrete example
        - One man X made a motion to a woman close to him, A, and the other women, B, C, and I know that he also made a motion to woman B, which was also shared with all of us, which significantly lowered his favorability among the women.
            - I am observing that, but I don't know only male X.
            - So man X thought, "What I said to Mr. A will never be conveyed to Mr. B."
            - On the other hand, I have observed something similar to this multiple times, so I generally believe that "what I tell Mr. A is also conveyed to Mr. B" and "there are information sharing channels for people other than me that I am unaware of" is True.
