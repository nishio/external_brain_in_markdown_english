- When a new social networking service is just starting out, its users are a set of early adopters
        - [[leeway]] situation 1-2
- This situation is favorable for users, but not for SNS operators
    - The more users, the easier it is to monetize.
        - The "number of users needs to increase" is hypothetical.
        - Often the number of users becomes a quantitative KPI and becomes an objective apart from whether it really matters
- Average value is diluted when user expansion policies are implemented.
        - [[leeway]] situation 3
    - Resource-hungry people start fighting each other.
    - Early adopters are leaving that social networking site.
    - This makes social networking disposable.
- So why don't we concentrate on the early adopters to prevent that from happening, and not have an expansion policy?
    - A model that charges from early adopters is unlikely to be viable.
        - The paid SNS market is scorched because there are too many free SNSs being offered to attract users.
        - Where's the salon?
            - It is a closed, paid community.
            - Not a group of early adopters.
            - A model where people with productive capacity produce content and people who consume content pay for it.
- How about "social networking on the run" as a solution to these compositions?
    - design
        - Create SNS A
        - When SNS A takes an expansion path, a new SNS B is created at the same time
        - Send B invitations to A's initial users.
        - Provide automatic multi-posting from B to A
        - Ensure that reactions on A can be seen on B if you want to see them.
        - Repeat after this as many times as necessary.
    - What happens.
        - As SNS A expands and value is diluted, early adopter X moves to B
        - X is communicating on B
        - Late majorities on SNS A misidentify X as if X were active on SNS A
