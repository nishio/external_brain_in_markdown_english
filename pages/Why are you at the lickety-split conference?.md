title: "Why are you at the lickety-split conference?"
---

- Dr. [[Kazuyuki Suto]] who attended [[Namera Conference 3]] asked me, "Why is Nishio-san here? He asked me "Why are you here?

As for the question, I think the nuance was "Nishio-san doesn't seem to be much of a Web3 person.
- But my perception of [[name-your-price conference]] in the first place is that I don't recognize [[name-your-price conference]] as a "Web3 conference".
- The "Smooth Society and Its Enemies," from which the name is derived, existed before Web3.
- Maybe the blockchain trilemma that Dr. Suto and this student presented was Web3.
    - Still, in my mind, it's more like "mathematical analysis of blockchain" than "Web3".
- There is no Web3 element in [[miyabi]] and his team's presentation.
    - Talk about symbol emergence and such.
    - [Taiyo Hamada's [[Funding the Commons]] is not tied to Web3, is it?
    - [[argocracy]] nor does the implementation have to be Web3, right?
    - Web3 people are looking for "new governance" with a new "world computer," and some of them are saying, "Why don't we just dismantle the current government and communication and replace it with market mechanisms on Web3?" and there might be some affinity between the two, though.

The question "why" can be interpreted as "why did you come to participate?" and "why do you intend to continue to participate?"

How did you come to participate?
- [[tkgshn]] invited me to [[Plurality Tokyo]],
- When I attended the event, young fans of "[[Smooth Society and Its Enemies]]" who were there got [[Ken Suzuki's]] autograph, and we talked about having a "lickspittle party.
        - [[How did the Named Enemy Association come about?]]
    - Wrestling and super funny: [[Reconciliation with tkgshn's criticism of Ken Suzuki]].
- I was interested in Plurality, so I attended the first time if there was an event to keep in touch with people like those who came to Plurality events.
    - Later, following Ken Suzuki "[[I feel]] a familial resemblance between Plurality and Fungi Enemy," I came to recognize the community as having a high affinity for Plurality.

Why do you continue to participate?
- Because the first time [[name-your-enemy party]] was funny.
- What makes it so interesting is this one word
    - > Ken Suzuki: "It's amazing how many people came together to make things with their hands."
    - Culture of "[[No more ideas without implementation]]"
    - For me, this event is like a debriefing of the results of my unexplored project.
- Another way to describe this place is [[early adopter group]].
    - It's a group of people who are willing to learn and create new things, so it's a great learning experience for me.
    - It's an opportunity to notice things you didn't realize existed.
            - [[become aware of a blind spot]]
    - Well, "I didn't realize how much Web3-related technology had developed," and as a result, it's a place to learn about Web3.
        - You can't learn to search the Internet if you don't have the skills to distinguish between good and bad articles.
        - I don't know if I can trust people who know a lot to teach people who don't know a lot.
        - It is better to intercept people in the know discussing with people in the know (but you will have to look it up later as there are a lot of unfamiliar words, like [[CBDC]] or [[Fiat]]).

Why do you plan to continue to participate?
- Because so far it's still interesting.
    - Ken also uses his social capital to invite people he thinks would be interesting to connect with.
        - [[Expanded reproduction in social capital]]
- As a future projection [[Ungated, profitable venues are razed.]] to likely decaying in value.
    - Then [[Move the good stuff.]] things will be done.
    - I want to be recognized as [[A person who enriches a place]] so that I can be taken to a new place.
    - I'm doing this because I think it's beneficial for me and the community to organize what I've learned and create a summary page.
- Ken said something like, "We could call Azuma-san or Narita-san, but we probably shouldn't," and that's probably because he's worried that "[[the hands-off consumers]]" will swarm in and turn this place into a kind of devoured pasture.
