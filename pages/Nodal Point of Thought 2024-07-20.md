> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1814473870599954614) Broad listening to the first half of "Beyond Difference" and "Technology for Cooperation" and the second half of, what? Digital goods became supermodular goods by being replicable, they were co-deposited when the goods rotted in the first place, it was more rational to eat them together, the accumulation of goods occurred when they stopped rotting, from free gifts to asking for compensation.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1814474786917233011) Since there was nothing to offer in return, people began to sell out their life time through labor, etc. This form of selling out made possible a standing army that did not contribute to food production. This form of government was made possible by a standing army that did not contribute to the production of food, which became stronger and invaded and annexed surrounding organizations, thus forming the shape of the country.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1814477478729265183) Money was born before and after (both standing armies and money are recorded in Mesopotamia, and since money spread slowly while gaining trust, it is difficult to say at what point the monetary value exchange system was established). The market-based system of control was more efficient than the system of state rule by force, so it grew and spread on a global scale.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1814479035172614144) We all were born after this monetary system became widespread, so we take this system for granted, but in the history of mankind, we are now in the "first 100 years of computers" and we are in the process of changing in history due to its influence. We are in the "first 100 years of the computer" and are in the process of historical change due to its influence, the main feature of which is that digital goods can be duplicated.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1814479918417564034) If something can be reproduced, it is more reasonable for as many people as possible to use it, but the market system that assumes goods that cannot be reproduced has been in use for generations, However, since the market system that assumes goods that cannot be replicated has been in use for generations, a mismatch will occur if we try to put them on the market system as it is, which is where the system needs to be updated, and this is where Funding the Commons comes in.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1814481933751275972) This is where Plurality's "trade-off diagram between depth and breadth of cooperation" leads.
>  I thought of the comparison between SNES, Game Boy and PSP as an example of how technological advances push the production possibilities frontier, but I wonder if it's easy to understand.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1814483881808277718) Capitalism is at the right end of this diagram, and voting is a little before it, both of which are technologies to control the behavior of large numbers of people through homogeneous "money" or "votes" tokens, discarding the information of "who they are". The tokens of money have been mass-produced as physical tokens that are difficult to forge by the state with the help of technology.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1814484718664274329) On the other hand, that is not the only solution. The token is then exchanged for a product, creating an incentive for continued use of the token.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1814484968627941486) (I wanted to land on broad listening, but now we're talking about governance by non-redeemable tokens?)

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1814489520135647722) Conversation used to be something that a few people would do together, but social media has made it possible for vast numbers of people to exchange ideas with each other. However, the human capacity to receive is limited, and our perception of the world is distorted by seeing only the comments of dozens of people who are similar to us.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1814491749412417638) The development of technology to help a wide range of people hear each other will enable humanity to communicate better, and the changes in that direction have only just begun, and many people It is not yet in a usable form. People who are noticing the signs of change are experimenting and making examples, like the recent Tokyo gubernatorial election.
