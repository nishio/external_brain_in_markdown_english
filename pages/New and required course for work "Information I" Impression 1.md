New and required course for work "Information I" Impression 1

I have a long train ride [New and required course "Information I" useful for work

I started doing data analysis and probability statistics in my first year of high school in 2012.
Information education has been offered in high schools since 2003, but programming education has become mandatory since 2022.
Without learning information, there is no modern business.
    - [[Overwhelming lack of awareness among high school teachers of the demand for IT in the corporate world]]

Actual problem
- I can solve this now, but I didn't get the education in high school to be able to solve this.
- Around 2030, having this knowledge will be the norm.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1722079420440346792/quick_promote_web/intro) I've been reading a book by Izakodon, which talks about how having knowledge equivalent to an IT passport will be the norm by around 2030 (p.27). In addition to that, it seems that instructions to AI assistants using that knowledge will go through easily.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1722080528835502386) There is a big difference between perceiving things as a single value or as a distribution of values, and people who can distinguish between the two will say, "Of course. Those who can't distinguish between the two don't even know what this statement is talking about. Until now, I had given up on the idea that most people don't understand it, but now this is going to be made compulsory in high school education?

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1722081140264370403) Talking about making a jig made of software for a job, until recently the "how to make it" was programming. However, with the advent of InstructGPT, it has expanded to natural language. So, it's not that we don't need programming education, but we need the skill to understand "what is possible as instructions to the computer".

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1722081678095691870) Some people who give instructions to AI assistants and share the results may say, "If I give such poor instructions and get angry that the results are not what I expected... It's your fault for giving bad instructions" or "I got a good result! but that's N=1 and it's probably just a lucky punch".

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1722084935937446380) [[agility]] is "the" source of competitiveness, not "an area that appeared to be, and players who noticed it early enough to make the right play by making the right play". Now OpenAI+MS and Google are competing in an [[equipment industry]] like steelmaking to see who can produce "new industrial iron" in high volume and high quality.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1722085476667207989) First there was "rice," and then the expression "rice of industry" came to be used for steel and semiconductors. So a new axis is emerging in that "rice of industry.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1722086610786017615) Agility through personnel transfers, or to break it down a bit more, there is a "change" created by the movement of people, and there is a transaction between the company and the employee, whereby the company benefits as an organization by entrusting the right to pull the trigger (in exchange for the employee's satisfaction) to the company. The company and the employee are making a deal whereby the company receives organizational benefits by giving up the right to pull the trigger (in exchange for the employee's satisfaction) to the company. On the other hand, there are companies that give up the right to change personnel.
    - [[You should decide for yourself whether to transfer or not.]]

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1722087424099291145) Do you think the market will make the appropriate adjustments if you let go or not? Either way, the basic premise is the distribution of information for the market to function efficiently. Internal information distribution is important, and activation of information distribution across organizational boundaries is also important in order to quickly procure resources that are not available within the company from outside.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1722087642274337095) Oh, same story on p.44

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1722089404200886661) In the DX Report 2, METI itself makes the definition of DX, it's different from the "2025 cliff", but many people only read the former.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1722090794235105780) We're up to the figure on the topic on p. 59.
>  I saw this on social media and thought I'd have to read the diagram to see what context it was in before I could make a tweak, so here I am.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1722097790283886892) This diagram is a simple depiction of the changes in the world, and it's not wrong as a "stripped down" version, but there's something about it that I think is too stripped down.  That is, the "people who were in the middle layer in the upper figure", who are the assumed readers of this book, disappear in the lower figure.
    - [[Where have all the white-collar workers gone?]]
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1722098667849712061) The purpose of the book is not to tell them to go away because they are no longer needed. The systematization is not 0/100, but a transition over time, and those people will "move on" in the process, but I feel that this is not conveyed.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1722099966867579377) So where do we move to:.
>  1: System development (which leads to the story from the beginning of this book that "programming education is now mandatory")
>  2: Work on the "interface with the world" part that is not directly systematized (lower part of the figure)
>  3: The role of extracting and propagating information by entering the "know-how" arrow
