> [shigekzishihara](https://x.com/shigekzishihara/status/1939463478533833108) I think you are right. I agree with you very much. For example, a person like me has no chance to compete with a person on the manufacturing floor who has decades of knowledge and skills in making something. I know a little bit about various parts of the industry, so I can give them some advice on how they can do things from different angles. That's all. I'm also very passionate about it.
