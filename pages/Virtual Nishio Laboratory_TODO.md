(written below)
#TODO

- Explanation of the benefits of each member's attributes
    - MOT at Tokyo Institute of Technology, Graduate School of Economics at the University of Tokyo, and other management students.
    - Unexplored adopters, students of information technology universities, and others with strong IT skills.
    - working adult
- Laboratory Directions
    - Social Change through Information Technology
        - Includes changes in organizational structure: the virtual laboratory is an example
    - However, there's no need to tie the topic in the lab to this.
        - In a real laboratory, it would be a problem if a student chooses a theme that is too far from the faculty member's specialty because he/she has to supervise the master's thesis, but there are no such restrictions in this virtual laboratory.
