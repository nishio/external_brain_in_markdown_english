I threw it away.
-- Expired groceries
-- Dirty, unworn Tupperware
-- Cutting board that did not come clean after bleaching
-- etc.

TODO
- The stuff in the fridge. I'd like to say I'll throw them out on the day of burnable garbage... but I can't do it before the end of the year. Let's throw them out next year.

*1261848711* [kaizen (Japanese business philosophy of continuous improvement)] Improvement of layout around kitchen
- Toothbrush, interdental brush, toothpaste, etc. were in the screen cabinet above the kitchen.
- There was no place to dry the dishes after washing them.
- Move toothbrush to bathroom sink.
- Converted a screen shelf into a space for drying dishes.

I decided where the toothbrushes would be placed and went and collected them, and there were six more of these. When I collected them, I found 12 pairs of socks and dozens of washcloths, and anyway, there were too many luxuries.
