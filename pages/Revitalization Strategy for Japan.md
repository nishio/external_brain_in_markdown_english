- I was thinking that the recent atmosphere of rushing ahead without regard for health and so on was like that of Yoshida Shoin, and then I saw Yoshida Shoin mentioned in the first three pages of the Strategy for the Rebuilding of Japan, and I thought, "I knew it...".

    - [[work as life]]

- It is interesting to note that peasants can have 100 different occupations, which is related to the current trend of promoting [[parallel carriers]].
- It's a product of an era when [[vertical integration]] of companies making tangible objects was more advantageous to reduce costs between layers than [[economies of scale]] by horizontally integrating the layers below, and in smartphone apps [[network effect]] has made [[horizontal integration]] of the lower layers overwhelmingly advantageous and [[platformer strategy]] has come to prevail. integration] of the lower layers became overwhelmingly advantageous, and the [[platform strategy]] began to win.
- I thought the only way to solve the "[[white-collar]] uncle" problem was to kill him (or let him perish slowly because there would be a strong backlash if you do it too quickly) because he's too much no matter how you look at it, but they've devised a way to keep him alive, which is smart.

    - [[hierarchy of samurai, farmers, artisans, merchants]] from the theory that the [[caste system]] is actually happy.
    - Intention to drop the "merchants" who do not create anything new to the lowest caste.

- I can sympathize with the following: it is risky for high school students to choose a college without knowing the society, portfolio education should be provided to make them aware of the possibility of changing jobs, the number of ronin is decreasing but should be allowed more, the center should be stopped, etc.

- Take a position.
    - [[critic]].
- Face it fair and square.
- Move your hands.
- Earn your money.
    - Don't have [[standard]] [[standard]].
    - Love what is [[complex]] and what can only be done with time, and find your own value in it.
- Live without expectation while [[thrill]] in all things and [[despair]] in all things.
- Keep changing your standards of thinking tomorrow and the day after.
