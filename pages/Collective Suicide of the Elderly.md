<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>[[Yusuke Narita]], an assistant professor at Yale University, has attracted attention for his radical remarks on the issue of Japan's [[aging society]]. He referred to "[[mass suicide]]" and "euthanasia" of the elderly, and called for the need to reform the age-based [[layered structure]].

Narita explained that his comments were taken out of context, and said that the expression "collective suicide of the elderly" was an abstract metaphor. However, there are many critical opinions, with some pointing out that it was [[discrimination against the weak]] and others expressing concern that it could promote dangerous ideas.

On the other hand, some believe that Narita's raising of the issue will trigger political discussions such as [[pension reform]]. In Japan, the rapid aging of the population is making the problems of maintaining the pension system and nursing care more serious. In response, young people are becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the current situation.

While Mr. Narita's comments have been criticized for being unethical, they have also had the effect of stimulating widespread discussion in that they have caused a stir regarding a serious issue in Japanese society today. The government has a responsibility to find constructive solutions.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Yusuke Narita, an assistant professor at Yale University, caused a great deal of controversy when he used the term "mass suicide" or "[[seppuku]]" for the elderly in a discussion of Japan's aging population, first proposing the idea on an online news program in December 2021, explaining that seppuku was an ancient Japanese samurai's [[honorary]] choice to die. He explained that seppuku was a ritual in which ancient Japanese samurai chose to die with [[honor]]. These statements provoked a huge response in Japanese society, which has a large elderly population. The elderly make up 29.1% of the population (Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines) (NextShark).

Narita then explained that his comments were metaphorical and were interpreted out of context. He specifically emphasized the need for a generational shift toward older people who have remained in business, media, and political leadership positions for too long. He stated that he used the issue raised as an abstract metaphor and subsequently stopped using these words in light of the negative implications (NextShark).

Despite this statement, Narita has garnered support from some segments of the population and has gained a notable following, especially online. His proposal has sparked debate related to Japan's aging population, including the social role of the elderly and the [[economic burden]] on the younger generation (Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines).
