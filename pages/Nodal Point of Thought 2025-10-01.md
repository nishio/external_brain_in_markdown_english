- Too many people act in ways that are not in line with their goals and visions.
- Manage with restraint
- Resistance arises from the general public creating projects on their own that may or may not be in line with their objectives.


People who believe that all messages are a work in progress for them.
- I get angry when others are exchanging messages that I don't understand in a way that I can see.

Attract the type of people who want to feel like equals by criticizing them.
- Because they say, "We listen to your opinions," the type of people who don't usually have their opinions heard by others come to them.

People who think that listening to opinions and having opinions reflected are synonymous.
