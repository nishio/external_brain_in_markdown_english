title: "Reddit ID Traceability"
---

### [Reddit
.
- Account registration required: Every submission is assigned a user name, and all submissions are tied to the same account.
- Traceability via internal logs: User activity history and IP information are logged internally and can be retrieved by administrators or law enforcement if necessary.

### [2chan
.
- Ensure anonymity: Basically, there is no need to register an account, and no fixed ID is assigned when posting.
- Temporary identifier: Some boards display an ID, such as a hash of IP addresses, for identification within the same thread, but it is difficult to track an individual across posting history.
- Optional tripcode: A tripcode for self-identification is available, but its use is optional and does not directly improve overall traceability.

### Summary
.
Reddit has high traceability of IDs because all posts are aggregated into an account once created and internal logs are maintained. On the other hand, 2channel is designed for anonymity, and there is no unique traceable ID for each post, making it difficult to identify the same person.
