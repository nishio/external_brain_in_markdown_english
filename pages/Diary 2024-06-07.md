- [[Event to Commemorate the 5th Printing of the Intellectual Production of Engineers]] and the date has changed.
- I'm tired of the quicksand, so let's take today as a day to relax and organize the information.
- I've created a page to bundle the various new things that I feel are being created.
        - [[Nodal Point of Thought 2024-06-07]]

When I came back, I found [[Takahiro Yasuno to run for Governor of Tokyo]].
- All sorts of great excitement
    - Let's see the video tomorrow.

- You should probably watch [[Hayashi's Video]] too before it disappears.
