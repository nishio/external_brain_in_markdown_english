from  [[Toward Relative Art & Technology]]
Medium Specificity
**Specificity of medium** refers to the unique properties or characteristics of a work of art or medium of expression (medium) that cannot be replaced by other media. This concept is important in aesthetics, media theory, and philosophy in considering how each medium has its own expressive power and limitations and how this affects the nature of the work and its expression.

Below is an explanation of the meaning, background, and specific examples of this concept.

1. what is the specificity of the mediam?
(1) Definition of "medium" (mediator)
A medium is the mediating means or medium through which a work of art or expression is established.
Examples: canvas and paint for painting, sound and time for music, and image and sound for film.
(2) What is specificity?
Each media should have unique physical, sensory, and technical characteristics that distinguish it from other media.
This creates a unique aesthetic and meaning that can only be expressed in that medium.
(3) Essential question
What makes a painting a painting?"
How does film differ from other means of expression and how should we exploit its characteristics?"
2. background in aesthetics and art theory
(1) "[[Medium Specificity]]" in [[Clement Greenberg]].
American art critic Clement Greenberg emphasized this concept in the context of modernist art.
Claim: Each media outlet should concentrate on its own specificity (unique materials and formats).
E.g.: Painting should explore elements inherent in the painting itself, such as flatness and the texture of the paint, and should not bring in elements such as sculpture or literature.
(2) Integration of technology and art
In today's age of multimedia and digital art, it is common for different media to merge, but it is still important to be aware of the characteristics of each medium.
E.g.: Although sound and image can be combined in film, the inherent power of each medium independently should not be ignored.
3. examples of mediam specificity
(1) Painting
Specificity: flatness, color, composition, texture.
Characteristics: A static experience that does not unfold in time, but is grasped in its entirety in an instant.
Example: Mark Rothko's abstract paintings offer a static experience unique to painting, with a subtle balance of color and composition.
(2) Music
Specificity: temporality, rhythm of sound, harmony, timbre.
Characteristics: Provides a purely auditory experience, independent of vision.
Example: Beethoven's symphonies are characterized by a musical emotional flow that unfolds in time.
(3) Films
Specificity: integration of video and audio, temporal development, editing techniques.
Characteristics: Expresses a story through images and sound, inviting the audience into a specific temporal and spatial experience.
Example: In Andrei Tarkovsky's films, the use of long takes and natural sounds bring out the film's inherent poetic expression.
(4) Digital Art
Specificity: interactivity, data plasticity, infinite replicability.
Characteristics: Creates an experience in which the audience actively participates and is transformed.
Example: James Turrell's installation creates a new sensation in the digital age by sharing the experience of light and space with the audience.
4. specificity of the medium and its limitations
(1) Specificity as a limitation
Mediam's inherent nature is to take advantage of the characteristics of its medium while at the same time recognizing the limitations of its expression.
Example: While film excels at temporal development, it is not suited to the expression of abstract thought and logic.
(2) Challenge to fusion
In contemporary art, while respecting the specificities of the mediums, it is common to attempt to pursue new expressions beyond them.
Example: VR art and AR art are exploring their own expressive potential while transcending the limits of traditional media.
5. philosophical significance
Mediam's concept of indigeneity leads to the fundamental question of what is expression or what is art.
It provides a foundation for thinking not only about what to communicate, but also about how to communicate.
6. conclusion
Mediam's specificity represents the artistic principle of respecting the unique characteristics and possibilities of each medium and pursuing expression that makes the most of them. At the same time, this concept continues to evolve with the fusion of different media and the emergence of new technologies, prompting new challenges within contemporary art and digital culture. Through this understanding, we can think deeply about why a work of art is expressed in the medium it is in.
