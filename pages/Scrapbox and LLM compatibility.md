I've heard people who have been exposed to LLM on ChatGPT and elsewhere say that they feel it works well with Scrapbox, and I think the same, but I've never been able to verbalize why that is.

- 1: Many people have an image of writing
    - Blog posts, etc.
- 2: There are several "parts" in it
    - Instead of seeing a single sentence as a chunk of text, feel that there are multiple parts that could be independent pages
- 3: Considering the relationship between these parts, the [[one-dimensional]] arrangement in 2 seems "different" in the first place.
    - In the diagram, the structure is now "A and B supporting C."
- 4: Each part connects with another to create another structure.
    - It's hard to develop this kind of development with the way one writes.

- > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1643813597792071680): Creating knowledge packages is actually easier than creating documents for human readers. Because humans have limited short-term memory, we need to give knowledge in a "good order", which is very hard for the author, but when giving it to LLM, the order is irrelevant, so just write whatever comes to your mind!
