title: "Dementia Eyes"

Dementia visual, it was really bad.
- I can't explain it in words, but I can say, "Chair? Where is it? Isn't the seat very low? Did you touch it? It's like that.
- I didn't realize it, but I was having heart palpitations.
- I can't express what I feel in words, so I tried to draw it, but 1: when I try to sit on a chair, 2: because my field of vision is narrow, 3: subjectively I can only see the surface of the chair and I don't know how it relates to the floor, so I can't grasp the distance 4: I try to touch it with my hand and then sit down, but I strike out because I can't grasp the distance
