A passage from the lyrics of [Reflection
The ones who don't have dreams are the ones who come to me, drunk on reality and with a smug look on their face.

Listening to it by ear, I thought it was "the more dreamless people are, the more they come to me with a "let's see the reality" look on their face.
- Sounds like the kind of guy who has no dreams.
    - You're not a child anymore, so stop dreaming and see the reality.
        - probable

What does it mean to be "[[drunk with reality]]?"
- What is "[[getting drunk]]" in the first place?
- The word "intoxicated" here is used in a figurative sense, with the nuance of becoming absorbed in a thing, drowning in it, or becoming self-satisfied with the situation or environment.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Drunk with reality" refers to being satisfied with one's current success and over-glorifying it, or being complacent with one's current situation and not pursuing other possibilities and dreams.
    - It can include showing others your successes and achievements and comparing yourself to others with them
- People without dreams or ambitions feel satisfied with their status quo or what they have, or want to show it off
    - They are satisfied with their current situation, so they show it off to others and brag about it
    - It sounds a warning about the importance of having dreams and the dangers of settling for the status quo.
