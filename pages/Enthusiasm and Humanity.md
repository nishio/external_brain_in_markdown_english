- Uncle Poem. I think it's a good idea to create "[[a small team of enthusiastic people]]" nowadays.
    - The advent of high-performance tools has expanded the scope of work that can be carried out by a small number of people.
    - Smaller numbers keep [[communication costs]] down.
    - No need to force members who are unenthusiastic and unmotivated to join the team.
- It is unfortunate for the company to have someone on the team who is not enthusiastic about the work, and it is unfortunate for the person in the first place.
- Conversely, "enthusiasm" is a parameter that is currently unique to humans, so I'm inclined to emphasize it if I want to bring value to the team as a human being.
- Based on this premise, when considering jobs that will not be replaced by AI, whether they are creative or not is not so important, and "whether they require enthusiasm" is more realistic. I think it is more realistic to ask whether "enthusiasm is required".
- I wonder if this future prediction will come true or not...

- Of course, enthusiasm is important, but I personally believe that humility, kindness, sincerity, and other aspects of human nature are more important. I think that a person who is enthusiastic but has low human qualities will likely have an unfortunate outcome for the organization, but if he or she has human qualities, the team will be able to achieve good results even if his or her enthusiasm is not that great.

- Kim Jinwook I hadn't thought of it that way! I took it as someone who makes the team feel at home, someone who is witty and picks up the work in between.
- I think it would be a very helpful person to have. That's why I imagine this is a position where the pressure to have AI do it will be strong, since it's a valuable resource and hard to hire.

    - One person X, who is enthusiastic and less human, is willing to barge ahead and make achievements,
    - Forming teams by involving others,
    - After that, when people with moderate levels of humanity and enthusiasm began to function as a team, the attribute that contributes to "producing results" changed from "having high enthusiasm and proceeding as a one-man operation" to "good communication with the team,
    - Mr. X was no longer able to perform as expected,
    - Mr. X casts a curse on those around him who don't work the way he wants them to.
    - It just got more and more uncomfortable.
    - Eventually, Mr. X said, "I can't stay here!" and disappeared,
    - The team is then maintained and operated by those who remain,
- What about a model called
    - The enthusiasm of the newcomers to the remaining team is lower than the enthusiasm of the team, and over time it gradually cools down.

- There are different types of enthusiasm, such as "I want to create something new" and "I want to maintain what we have now," and it is possible that the quality of enthusiasm required may differ at each stage.
- On the other hand, I am somewhat skeptical about the need for humans to take on the role of humanity. AI does not lie maliciously and does not steal money, so I think [AI is more human than standard human. And, there seem to be many types of services that don't need a human in the first place when they enter the maintenance and operation phase.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> I think if you wrap Mr. X, who lacks humanity, in AI and make him more personable, he'll be the strongest.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/tatekawa/icon' alt='tatekawa.icon' height="19.5"/> We both know what we are talking about. How high context...


- [[enthusiasm]] and [[humanity]]
