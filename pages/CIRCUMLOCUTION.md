<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT5/icon' alt='GPT5.icon' height="19.5"/>To put it bluntly, CIRCUMLOCUTION is the use of "[[roundabout]] ways of saying / [[putting in other words]]" to convey meaning. It refers to the way in which technical terms are broken down or the same content is supplemented with different expressions (examples, metaphors, diagrams, gestures).
- E.g., replace "hyperkalemia" with "high potassium in the blood (hyperkalemia)", etc.
    - [[crunching]]

Points in the Gendlin Context
- This is one of the creative functional relations, the activity of [[gradually clarifying]] the outline of the "[[Felt Meaning]]" that cannot be reached by the first expression alone, by adding related separate expressions one after the other.
    - → Not only words, but also diagrams, gestures, and supplementary sentences are included in "[[expression]]".
- Difference from [[RELEVANCE]] ([[relevance]]):
    - RELEVANCE is "[[past experience aids]] current understanding"; CIRCUMLOCUTION is "current representations rework past semantic networks and aim [[to refine meaning]].

concrete example
- "I got a new phone, you know, the one that doesn't carry ...... around."
    - - The ambiguity of "phone call" is corrected with a single word of follow-up.
- Duplicate the explanation by text to diagram (explain in text and then show the relationship diagram).

Tips on how to use (practice)
1. paraphrase in three ways: surround the same core with definitions/metaphors/examples and counterexamples.
2. add modality: words + diagrams (sketches) + gestures.
3. digging in clean language: "How does that 'xxx' feel?" and increase the number of related expressions while keeping the other person's expression.

In short, CIRCUMLOCUTION is "a technique of [[converging]] meaning by circling the same core (or closely related content) with separate expressions. In short, "[[a]] clever detour."
