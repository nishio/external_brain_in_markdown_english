title: "Believing a hoax in three days"

> People who read an article or Tweet that is pointed out as "false" by the fact checker recognize it as a "zero is a hoax" at that time, but after three days, their memory changes and they tend to think it is correct information, like "I remember that there was a story on the Internet that said zero..." This is especially the case among the elderly. Research shows that this is especially the case among the elderly.
