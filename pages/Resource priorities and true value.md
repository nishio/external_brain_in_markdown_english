Resource priorities and true value
SUMMARY: It is important to find the right balance between identifying true value and maximizing the resources you have while considering scarcity.

Oh, no, it's [[signalling]], right?
[[What is the most valuable resource?]]
It's not reasonable to go for [[a resource that can be easily taken]] with a bunch of other people without going for [[a valuable resource]].
What do you think from [[the resources you have now]]?
That leads to [[differentiation]], so I can't say it's bad.
I feel like it's a bad idea to prioritize based on [[ease of attainment]] from what you have without looking at intrinsic value.
This is hard to do.
Balance?
Rather than taking the in-between, is it more like ranking by [[scarcity]] and then what you would take with [[tools on hand]]?

## digest
.
The optimal use of resources was discussed. It is important to strike a balance between maximizing the use of the resources at hand, taking into account their true value and scarcity. However, when prioritizing the acquisition and utilization of resources, it is important to determine the intrinsic value of the resource.

## Relation to Fragment
.
It is relevant to the fragments "Scarce resources should be invested in what you subjectively believe has the highest probability of producing the best results," "Scarce resources are expensive, but whether they are productive depends on how they are used," and "Easy means." These are considerations about the scarcity of resources and how they are used, and are consistent with the notes. In particular, the fragment "Scarce resources are expensive, but whether they are productive depends on how they are used" emphasizes the importance of striking a balance between the value of resources and how they are used.

## deep thinking
Optimal utilization of resources is achieved by determining the intrinsic value and scarcity of the resource and deciding how to utilize it accordingly. However, one's intuition and beliefs also play an important role in this process. This indicates that not only objective facts about the value and utilization of a resource are important, but also decisions based on one's own experiences, observations, and intuition.

[[**Title of Thought]]
Optimal use of resources: balancing intrinsic value and scarcity."
