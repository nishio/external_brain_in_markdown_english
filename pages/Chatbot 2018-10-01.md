- Some confusion was observed regarding the concept of "pickup." After confirming understanding among the discussants, "pickup" was understood to mean that multiple people collectively utilize knowledge to make more stable choices.
- Knowledge overlap is also discussed. In particular, it is stated that communication becomes difficult when there is little knowledge overlap, and it is suggested that knowledge should be consciously shared for this reason.
- On the other hand, it suggests that when knowledge is actively exchanged and shared, it can bring new perspectives and create value by leveraging the knowledge and experience of others to facilitate problem solving.
- It is also discussed that the process of "procurement-gathering, modeling, and validation" is important in the acquisition and utilization of knowledge. And it is also stated that the effort and expense is an important factor in determining whether a problem-solving effort is worthwhile.
