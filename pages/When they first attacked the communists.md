title: "When they first attacked the communists"

> Niemöller himself states that the phrases were established in his speech without a manuscript and were not published as poetry, so there is no original in the strict sense of the word.

- > Pastor Niemöller told the thousands of people about himself (all too humbly). The Nazis attacked the communists. He became somewhat uneasy, but he was not a communist, so he did nothing. Then they attacked the socialists. He was uneasy, but did nothing because he was not a socialist. Then the schools, then the newspapers, then the Jews, and each time he was worried, but again he did nothing. And they attacked the church. He was a churchman. So he did something. But it was too late.
