title: "system"
---

- We need a clear and simple explanation of the [[systems approach]] and [[systems thinking]].

- A [[system]] is composed of several elements, and the elements influence each other.
We see things as such a system.

- Example
    - Abstraction of grocery stores, research firms, software vendors, etc. in the form of "providing value to customers and getting paid for it".
    - And if you apply Facebook to it, users are not customers because they are not paying for it.
    - So who are the customers? Advertisers
