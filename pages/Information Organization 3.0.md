    - In [[Scrapbox Information Organization]], [[Tadanori Kurashita]] divided the history of information organization into three categories
    - Information Organization 1.0: Location-based Organization
        - Things can only exist in one place at a time.
        - The same idea applies to placing files in a hierarchy of folders.
        - If something can't be clearly defined where it's located, it's out of order.
    - Information Organization 2.0: Don't Organize, Arrange
        - Arrange them in order of update or access, rather than trying to organize them.
        - Find by search
            - Search = Refine
        - Google has been successful in aligning by PageRank
        - Services without a good ranking method tend to be "sorted by update time", etc.
        - Sorting by access order is a rule of thumb that "things that have been used recently are used more often again".
        - [[Information Organization 3.0]] :
        - Networked organization, connected by links
        - Place it [[in a frequently used location]]" is often used to organize physical objects
            - Dishes and knives are usually kept near the kitchen.
        - When certain information is used, the information that [[relevance]] to it is used more often.
            - → Linkage by relevance of information to realize "[[place near]]".
        - Relevance" is not only mechanically based, but also subjective to each individual.
            - So it must be easy for humans to output that [[Subjective association]].
            - Scrapbox facilitated the related outputs by simplifying the notation of links to the extreme
