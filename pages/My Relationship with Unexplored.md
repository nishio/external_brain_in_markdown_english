title: "My Relationship with Unexplored"
---

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1579741480348168193): I've illustrated my involvement with IPA Unexplored, Unexplored Corp, Unexplored Jr. and myself, as a verbal explanation doesn't quite get the point across!

> When you think about it, you've already been involved in [[unexplored]] for more than half of your life.
>  The green dots are dots that represent my involvement in current students' projects as an alumnus at the request of the IPA, but only at events, not all the time.
>  I wrote this because Cybozu Labs is my employer and they are very understanding of my activities and the activities of the Unexplored Foundation are part of my work hours.
