title: "Scrapbox as a real-time sharing of thoughts"
---


Context from [[Plurality Study Session 1]].
- Before the advent of cell phones, I would say something like, "I'll meet you in front of Hachiko at what time," and wait in front of Hachiko for about 15 minutes, annoyed that he wouldn't show up.
- I don't do that kind of thing anymore. Now that we can communicate with people at a distance while walking around, we can say, "Call me when you get there," or "I got there, where are you now?" The interaction has changed to "call me when you get there" and "where are you now?
- Furthermore, a form of interaction is occurring where people go further from "where are you?" by making a phone call to meet up and share their location in real time via GPS.
    - I'm [[interacting]] in a [[non-verbal]] way, without [[turn-based communication]].

- We talked about how the form of interaction has changed from [[turn-based communication]] to [[real-time information sharing]].
- [Scrapbox and Blog
Blogging is basically writing and then letting people read it after you're done writing [[turn-based communication]].
Drafts are also placed in this Scrapbox.
    - [[Publish a draft]]  /  [[No separate drafts, etc.]]
At the time of [[new realization]], [[write it down and make it indelible]].

example
- [[You can't create content that will be popular overseas.]]
- [[Galapagosization and Renewable Diversity]]
Slowly the parts come together and are joined later.
- [[Metaphor of a fish tank]]
- Those that happen to be near the surface of the water combine.
