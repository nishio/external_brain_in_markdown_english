## Digest 1
Learning is inhibited when it comes to the role of "teacher."

## Digest 2
.
The observation that the role of "teacher" impedes learning is related to such fragments as "The Problem of the Teacher," "The Art of Learning for BPStudy Engineers," and "The Greatest Obstacle to Learning is Teaching the Answer." In the teaching role, there is a tendency to impose one's own viewpoints and preconceptions on others, which can inhibit new learning. In addition, "teaching" tends to become "giving answers," which may deprive learners of opportunities for self-exploration. From these fragments, the observation that the role of "teaching" may inhibit learning provides an opportunity to think deeply about the relationship and division of roles between those who teach and those who learn.

## Opinion
.
The observation that the role of "teaching" inhibits learning provides important insights not only in the field of education, but also in business and leadership contexts. The perspective that those who teach may be imposing their own perspectives and preconceptions on others, thereby depriving learners of opportunities for self-exploration, provides an opportunity to reconsider leadership styles and communication methods.

## summary of thoughts
Provides a new perspective on education and leadership by considering how the role of "teaching" can inhibit learning.

### Teaching Personnel Issues
A problem for those who teach
 [Manners instructors create manners.] 



### When people say, "Learning that stuff won't help you."
When people say to me, "Learning that stuff won't help you."
The fact that it was said is not the same as whether it is true or not.
If the person who said it has never learned it, he or she is either able to judge the usefulness to others of what he or she has not learned or simply assumes it is not useful to justify what he or she has not learned. The latter possibility is more likely.

How to Get Out of "Just Say It" 101 - Get out of the "teaching role" and play the "teaching role". -Premises and words have different meanings for you and the other person. Don't impose your own frame of reference on the other person. -Encourage and motivate the other person to speak.

### Is the learning ladder model correct?
[https://gyazo.com/22eed99243d25681aa7ec21106022496]
51It is easy to inadvertently imagine or understand a ladder model in which those with more knowledge teach and those with less are taught, but this is not correct. What is incorrect?
(Audience: When one person teaches more than one person, that person's preconceived notions are eventually just distributed to all.) That is astute. Excellent point. But I'm going to take a few more steps to get there, so I'll change the subject a bit. More knowledge, less knowledge.

[https://gyazo.com/5ad8504571d39bdd558d6b73f35ffb1b]
52The person with more knowledge teaches the person with less knowledge teaches the person with less knowledge. You are 16 years old and the teacher is 33 years old, so you are twice as old as each other. There is a division of roles between those who teach and those who are taught. It seems as if there is a clear difference in knowledge. But as I progressed through college and into the workforce, this gap narrowed. I have a junior colleague in graduate school who is about that age. He has more life experience than I do, but I teach math. The division of roles between those who teach and those who are taught will disappear. More knowledge, less knowledge.

Next [exchange knowledge and learn from each other].


### The greatest obstacle to learning is teaching the answer.
The greatest obstacle to learning is teaching the answer.
"Isn't the biggest obstacle to [learn] that [I'll give you the answer. Because it permanently robs you of the [Opportunity to find answers] yourself. I believe the only way for one to learn is to think logically and find [answer] for oneself. In order to get people to think, the imperative form of "! mark in the imperative form is much better than the question mark "? mark is much better" ([Eliyahu Goldratt]).



### What is Learning. Engineered Thinking and Principles
 	Learning will continue into adulthood. However, the service of "the teacher decides the curriculum" will disappear. Also, even if they do not learn, they will not experience short-term, easy-to-understand disadvantages such as "a follow-up exam due to a bad grade on the final exam. However, there will be a clear difference after 5 or 10 years between those who learn and those who do not. You yourself must experiment with your limited life time and acquire knowledge that will benefit your life.

(*Other items proposed)
How do you learn in a situation where you're just being driven by the work in front of you, by the work that your boss assigns you?
How to turn job hunting into "research
How do you know what you need to learn?
	It's a decision, only after the fact, and only he/she is passionate about it.
What will I learn?
	A very brief glimpse of the "Self-Management Strategy" and a few core concepts.
	Excellence, Continuous Specialist, Lid Cubes ......


-----
	Learning continues into adulthood.
	However, the "teacher decides the curriculum" service will be eliminated.
	If you don't learn, you won't experience short-term, obvious disadvantages such as "bad grades on the final exam and a follow-up exam".
		But after five or ten years, there will be a clear difference.


### The more you learn, the more you don't know.
The more you learn, the more you don't know.
see  [The more you learn, the more you realize how ignorant you are.] 



### 2018-02-04-2
	In other words, we can create a "doctrine that learning is beneficial" and give them a sense of self-affirmation (oblique conclusion).
	 [Great teachers light a fire in the hearts of their students.] 
	This is another encouragement to cause action
	The "Learning is Good Doctrine" praises learning, but it must praise it even if one cannot learn. Otherwise it is not unconditional affirmation.
		KUIKEI: No, there is also the option of becoming a cult sharpener.
			Isn't it more likely that religious people exclude those who don't enjoy learning?
			Counter, I assume that there is a doctrine that says you don't have to be able to learn, but I think pretty much everyone believes in that.
			The kind of thing where you caused something serious and it's not my fault because I didn't know about it.



### Teamwork Management Symposium
 Mr. Horie: "I didn't know about private junior high schools until I was in the third grade of elementary school, the adults around me didn't tell me about them, my homeroom teacher told me. I didn't know about my options." "I couldn't care less about taking the entrance exam six years later, so I played around on the computer, which turned out to be a good thing."
 	Teaching choices is very effective.
  You don't know in advance what will be useful.
 Horie: "[Population movements] are very simple, and students who enter the University of Tokyo should be able to understand them."
 I'm an outsider, so I look at ants and laugh at them. It's funny as satire."
  The guys who were lounging in the bar earlier, including the youngsters, we don't need all of them, their jobs are already gone."
  "You don't have to take a big stance like robots and AI, just use groupware."
  Do you guys need to be there?"
  Hori "If we do this, we'll lose money.""Those who don't want it.""Moderator "What should we do about those who don't want it?" Hori: "They should play" Mo: "They can't eat" Hori: "They should ask for help" Mo: "I'm not comfortable with that" Aono: "It's a wall of the mind"
 More and more people don't have to work, but they work by creating jobs they don't need due to the psychological barrier that it is not good to get paid for not working. The pathology of not knowing how to play.


### Polis: "People who learn on their own" and "People who learn because they are expected to"
People who "learn on their own" don't always "grow in expectation."
I'm glad to see that the barriers to learning are disappearing and the number of boosters is increasing... The internet is full of teaching materials, chat teachers are as kind and helpful as tutors, and if you have the aura of a "self-learner," there are many (human) people who will answer your questions if you ask a few.
The "self-serving learners" learn at a faster pace than the "expected learners," so the gap widens, and the gap is not good.
The change from someone who learns by expectation to someone who learns on their own is hinted at by "problem awareness.
Just make sure that only those who learn on their own stay.
I don't like the phrase people "learn" on the job.
This is about "work ethic" or "motivation"
I'm uncomfortable with the use of the terms "self-learning" and "expected to learn."
Voluntary" and "other-initiative" are better than "self-learning" and "expected to learn."
People who learn on their own are better than those who learn because they are expected to.
Majority of "people don't learn when they're expected to."
Only those who learn on their own can maintain order.
Worst case is a boss or organization that forces you to learn without compensation or other incentives.
