title: "Collaborative Intelligence"

> Not to be confused with collective intelligence ([[collective intelligence]]).
>  [[Cooperative Intelligence]] features a [[multi-agent]] type [[distributed system]] where each agent, human or machine, contributes autonomously to the problem solving network.
- DeepL-ed from [Collaborative intelligence - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_intelligence)

>  [[wisdom of crowds]] processes input from a large number of anonymous respondents to a quantitative question and generates better-than-average predictions.
>  [[crowdsourcing]] distributes microtasks to a large number of anonymous task executors.
>  [[human computation]] leverages the pattern recognition capabilities of anonymous human micro-tasking workers to enhance machine capabilities and enable machine learning.
>  Collaborative intelligence complements the above three methods, but here the task executor is not anonymous. Task executors have different skills and motivations and may perform different tasks. These non-anonymous devices and human contributors, such as tagged sensors, geo-located devices, and identified unique human contributors, drive collaborative problem solving in next-generation social networks.
Is the "non-anonymous" part important?
