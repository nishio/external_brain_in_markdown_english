Politics is moving what you can't fork.
> [@0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1661224655125090304?s=20): "[[Folks]], it is politics that moves what cannot be moved" theory, firmly traced in the same context in " [[[ Disengagement, Statement, and Loyalty]]". Disengagement, Statement, and Loyalty]". If there are enough [[options]], [[withdrawal]] is chosen, but if not, [[proposal]] has to be made.

In the past, politics may have occurred because [[liquidity]] was lower, but now feedback (meaning speaking up) is not working.
