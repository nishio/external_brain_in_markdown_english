# what is this?
- It is [[external brain]] of [[NISHIO Hirokazu]].

# What is an external brain?
- A system that performs some of the functions of the brain outside of the living brain
    - This improves the intellectual and productive capacity of the system as a whole, including the living brain
- [[Thinking does not take place only in the brain.]]
    - For example, "Fireworks to think about" by [[Jiro Kawakita]], a kind of [[Intellectual Production]] "[[KJ method]]".
        - Thinking [[outside the brain]] by [[spatially arranging]] thoughts in [[opening sentence or paragraph]] on a small [[piece of paper]].
        - This [[methodology]] can overcome the low [[short-term memory]] that the [[living brain]] can retain.
- Memory and associative stock
    - Fragments of units finer than books and articles
            - The [[information card]] introduced by [[Tadao Umesao]] in [[The Art of Intellectual Production]] is used by writers to stockpile fragments in units smaller than a book before writing.

            - Not only him, but many authors have used similar mechanisms, e.g., [[zetterkasten]].
            - Once it was written on paper and placed in a private study.
            - It was not a final work, but to assist the person in the intellectual production of the work at the stage of creating it.
            - So only he could see it.
                - A small portion was published in fragments in the form of posthumous arrangement of manuscripts, etc.: [[fragmentary writing]].
        - This could be interpreted as an information card that Yasukazu Nishio uses for his own intellectual production.
            - As of 2024, there are 2,000 cards.
            - [Information should be made public unless there is a reason not to make it public.
    - Compared to paper cards, there are advantages to being digital
        - A system that makes it easy to create and follow links between fragments
            - Scrapbox], which was the foundation for the construction of this external brain, devised a mechanism
                - [[Knowledge Network]] is represented by a mechanism for [Structuring information with links
                - Link formation is facilitated by [[link to an unexpected destination]] and [Scrapbox's link suggestions are useful
            - Link formation or [[2-hop link]] allows you to discover other pages that think about the same thing
                    - [[Comparing similarities is a new way to learn.]]
                - [[resolution of thoughts]].
    - The links between thoughts are [[suggestion]] and [[derailment]].
        - It makes sense that this is not done only in the brain, but externalized as [[stock of associations]].
        - If you externalize it instead of keeping it in the brain, external mechanisms such as computers can interact with it.
        - We believe this is important in the context of future LLM development.


# What is Scrapbox/Cosense?
- Web services we started using in 2017
    - Provided by [[Nota]] (now [[Helpfeel]])
    - Name changed to [[Cosense]] in 2024.
- Well-thought-out specifications significantly facilitated the development of Yasukazu Nishio's external brain


# Guide for New Scrapbox Readers
.
- The best way to understand Scrapbox is to use Scrapbox yourself
    - I've written a lot of verbal explanations here [[Increased skill in using tools leads to a more detailed perception of the world]], so the understanding of those who don't use them doesn't lead to those who do.
    - As a function of Scrapbox, when you search within your own Scrapbox project, a cross search is also performed against the Scrapbox projects you have viewed, giving you the opportunity to discover other people's ideas about what you are thinking.
    - Since this service is focused on "growing your network of knowledge", it is best to try to grow your own network of knowledge

- Meaning of the color of the links in the page
    - Red links are "doors that don't lead anywhere yet" and therefore not useful to click on.
        - Think of it as highlighting keywords.
    - Blue links are links to other pages in Scrapbox
        - This page can be EMPTY.
            - empty is also useful because it displays a card at the bottom of the page with a list of "pages linked to that keyword".
        - Example: [Philosophy of [/shokai/Scrapbox](https://scrapbox.io/shokai/Scrapbox)]
            - This is a link to Scrapbox's "Other Projects" page
            - This example links to a page in the shokai project that is developing Scrapbox
            - For English reader, currently auto-translation supports only in this project. Links to other Japanese project may broken because of translation of title.
    - Blue underlined links are links outside Scrapbox

- Meaning of the green and gray lines on the left edge of the page
    - They are called "telomeres." For a detailed description, see [/shokai/telomere](https://scrapbox.io/shokai/telomere).
    - Unread lines (= lines that have been updated since the last visit) are green
    - The more recently updated, the thicker.
    - Click here to get the permalink to the line so you can mention it.

- Q: Where do I start reading?
    - Option 1: Search for keywords of your interest
    - Option 2: Follow the links by clicking on the links that interest you at the bottom of each page.
        - Here's a starting point for readers: [[Links for Readers]].
            - [[For visiter of /nishio-en]] is the start point for English reader.


## About Quotations and Licenses
.
    - [[Anything published can be cited.]]
    - We think it is a very good thing to cite, mention and develop
- We believe that it is a bad idea to make it difficult to utilize information because it is not clear who inherits the rights upon the death of the copyright holder
    - The information on this Scrapbox is licensed under a CC-BY license upon the death of NISHIO Hirokazu
