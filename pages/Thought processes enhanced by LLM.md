[[thought process]] [[increased]] by [[LLM]]


> [takahiroanno](https://twitter.com/takahiroanno/status/1720990467356324144) [[unexplored junior]] creators, all of them were great, but the presentation by Ueda-san, the youngest fifth grader in elementary school I was especially impressed by the presentation by Ueda, the youngest fifth grader in elementary school. He is a fifth grader in elementary school, and he has been unable to talk to others because he cannot speak, even though he wants to.
>  So he learned programming while listening to ChatGPT and developed "Be Free," an app that combines voice recognition, synthetic speech, and LLM to enable voice conversations with people.
>  It was very impressive to see the fifth grader speak in a mature synthetic voice while making full use of a home-made app (reminds me of VIVANT's drummer).
>  You can see his presentation at [the following link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTjx_q-iI6I&t=3404s), so take a look anyway!

> [takahiroanno](https://twitter.com/takahiroanno/status/1720991795306512886) Be Free performs speech recognition of a conversation, and ChatGPT first generates "candidate words to be included in the reply. The user selects one or more words, and ChatGPT imagines sentences to reply based on the word candidates and the conversational context, and presents the candidates.
>  More than being interesting as an interaction, it makes me imagine what is happening in my brain when I think of a sentence in the first place. When I think, I just pop random words into my brain and formulate them into sentences in a nice way. In that sense, the main subject of thought may not be the brain, but the grammar of language (or perhaps the language model)...

> [takahiroanno](https://twitter.com/takahiroanno/status/1720992625048883341) Abstractly speaking, I feel that a new generation of creators is emerging who are using LLM to the fullest and creating applications that incorporate LLM into their [[speech process]] (≒ thinking process). creators are emerging, and I sense the emergence of a new generation.

> [takahiroanno](https://twitter.com/takahiroanno/status/1721000586135674888) No, I really think so. Hot..!
