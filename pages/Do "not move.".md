title: 'Do "not move."'
---

- Think of it not as "stuck" but as "doing the stuck."
- Recovery is faster when you think, "I can't move" than when you think, "I have to move or I won't move.
- [[self-condemnation]], "I wanted to do ~ but didn't when I should have" is counterproductive
    - If you can't stop on your own, meds.
- Books, movies, and games use thinking, so rest the brain with music, incense, baths, and eye-warming products.
