The gap between "self-directed learners" and "expected learners" cannot be bridged.
> [@voluntas](https://twitter.com/voluntas/status/1655038439585361920?s=20):[The gap between "people who learn on their own" and "people who learn because they are expected to" cannot be bridged｜Shiro Shibata｜note [https://note.com/4](https://note.com/4) bata/n/nf8fbcb832e91] I read it. It is very carefully put together and I can really understand what the author is trying to say.

> [@voluntas](https://twitter.com/voluntas/status/1655038866062192641?s=20): i think the "self-serving learners" in this article are "self-serving job creators".
> [@voluntas](https://twitter.com/voluntas/status/1655040180301230086?s=20): "If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together." "I kind of understand this. I think it's because people who make work on their own don't want to go together.

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1655056035466596352): unclear if the decision guideline "[[If you want to go far, go together]]" is appropriate for the current situation. Do you really want to go far? Where specifically? Originally the saying was in the form "[[If you want to go fast, go alone]], ~". What makes you think that now is a situation where "[[speed]]" is not necessary? Isn't it rather "[[flood of tsunamis]]" now?
- I think the world is changing so rapidly right now that the relevance of a long-term plan is declining.
    - In this situation, it is beneficial to have a style of collaboration where individuals move quickly to gather information and then share it with each other as they have time to do so.
            - [[Teamwork arising from stand-up play]]
    - [[If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.]]
        - [[Young people can run faster if they are alone. Older people are slower, but can go farther.]]
        - Meaning that old people can't run as fast as young people, but they have the knowledge to help them go farther.
        - Taking a young man with no knowledge and slow legs is not beneficial to "go far".
    - [[flood of tsunamis]]
    - That when speed is required, you should run alone first without worrying about others.

> [@voluntas](https://twitter.com/voluntas/status/1655057978079465473?s=20): I really get the sense that the person who wrote this really wants to do something about the organization and has a lot of ideas. Also, he seems like a very nice person.
- I agree with you that this original article must have been thought hard by someone of good character.
    - [[""The difference between those who learn on their own and those who learn because they are expected to"]] implicitly assumes that "bridging the gap" is a good thing, but is it really?
    - The implicit assumption that the current form of organization and work is correct and that we should keep it and make it work better becomes [[an obstacle to adaptation]] when the environment changes drastically.

> I think it means that those who are highly motivated to study are hired by cutting-edge IT companies, not that their motivation to study changes because of which company they are in.

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1655733473418817536?s=20): I thought I just scrapped it to Scrapbox because I didn't have enough words in my tweets, but I just realized that it was 500 Hatebukes or something. I just realized that it was scrapped in Scrapbox. Wouldn't it be more interesting to make this a Polis?

> [ttt_cellule](https://twitter.com/ttt_cellule/status/1655057688924151815) What Mr. Higaki means by "willing to die" is that unless you are willing to learn on your own, like the model on the left in this article, you will not be able to survive and I have seen many people who have failed in this area. I was talking with someone who said that what Mr. Higaki means by "willing to die" is that you can't survive unless you make independent decisions in the adjacent area like the model on the left in this article, and I have seen many people who have actually failed.

> [ttt_cellule](https://twitter.com/ttt_cellule/status/1655057825411002368) (This NOTE article is rather interesting in that the author of the article believes that in a collective project, the latter expectation circuit has to be stretched somehow. (The paradoxical nature of this article is interesting in that the author rather believes that in a collective project, we have to somehow stretch the latter expectation circuit)
>  So, he is hostile to Higaki because he is dissatisfied that people who want to do research while raising children should be allowed to do so under the right model.
> [ttt_cellule](https://twitter.com/ttt_cellule/status/1655058268581167104) But in the shura world of academic melitocracy or writing, you can't get by with such default order skills, With that style, you'll probably disappear from the force in the middle of a project.

> [ttt_cellule](https://twitter.com/ttt_cellule/status/1655058648828358657) So, in the long run, the perception that a learning model can be made more efficient, completely independent of individual preferences, is quite dangerous. I think this is the case.
>  (There may be a position that messed up authoritarian institutional adaptation is a win, it's cosponsored, but I've ruled that out here.)

> [terrierscript](https://twitter.com/terrierscript/status/1655067276801101825) I think some people are classified as "self-learners" but in fact such people are also "not necessarily growing with expectations". It's like people who learn on their own have "[[thirst for knowledge]]" or something like that as their reward system, and [[people who grow with expectations are rewarded by expectations]].
> [terrierscript](https://twitter.com/terrierscript/status/1655068335799939073) I'm probably the type of person who learns on my own, but there's no guarantee that I'll be able to improve as expected, and the way I learn is my goal, so it's hard to be limited. I'm not good at books or study groups because it's too hard when I'm restricted.

> [@rkmt](https://twitter.com/rkmt/status/1655536241465757696): I'm glad to see that the barriers for "self-serving learners" to learn are disappearing and boosters are increasing... The net is full of teaching materials, chat teachers are as kind and helpful as tutors, and if you have the aura of a "self-learner", there are many (human) people who will answer your questions....

> [@foot_25253](https://twitter.com/foot_25253/status/1487331267062689793?s=20): ... I hate the phrase "people who "learn" on the job. Why didn't they use the phrase "work ethic" or "motivated" people...
- There seems to be a fundamental disconnect in our understanding.
- Both are "learners".
