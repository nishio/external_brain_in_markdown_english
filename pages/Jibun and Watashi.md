<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The difference between "自分" ([[jibun]]) and "私" ([[watashi]]) in Japanese lies mainly in context and the level of [[self-awareness]] they convey.
- "自分" (jibun)
    - It refers to oneself in a broader sense and can sometimes mean "[[self]]" or "[[ego]]."
    - It is often used when reflecting on oneself or when talking about one's internal perspective, especially in relation to others.
    - Example: Used in self-reflection or when emphasizing one's personal awareness.
- "私" (watashi)
    - This is a standard first-person pronoun used to refer to oneself when speaking to others.
    - It is more formal and polite, typically used in daily conversations or formal settings to express one's personal views or actions.
    - Example: Common in everyday speech or business contexts when stating opinions or making personal statements.
In summary, "自分" emphasizes one's [[internal self]] or [[relative self-perception]], while "私" is used to directly refer to oneself when interacting with others.
