title: "Three Journeys of Life"
---

- When [[(human) life (i.e. conception to death)]] is compared to [[a journey]], there are at least three types of journeys
- A: The process of traveling itself is fun "[[a]] journey in process."
- B: "[[Journey to the finish line]]" where the process of travel is tough but you reach a great destination.
- C: Show others photos of the sights you've reached and enjoy bragging about your "[[journey home]]".

I think the trick is to enjoy the "journey of the process" [[of having fun with less suffering]].
On the other hand, the "goal journey" is [[reproduced]] by those who make the "journey home."
I can't say that this is not a good idea, because most of the time we [[awaken]] to the "process journey" while we are on the "goal journey"!

- [[even if]]
