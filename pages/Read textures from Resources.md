title: "Read textures from Resources"
---

- Read [[texture]] using [Resources.Load

-----
- Why does it only show up on one screen...
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/b377cec497b25f83ef0afd4e58be0b2b/thumb/1000)
- Was it not displayed but just crushed on the screen and unreadable?
    - I could see it properly when I looked at it on my Oculus Go.
