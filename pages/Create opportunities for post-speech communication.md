title: "Create opportunities for post-speech communication"
---

- Create a forum for post-event communication
    - Share presentation materials, answer questions, and announce related events and announcements after the presentation
    - Submission: Create a Slack
        - Not just this one, but share management-related presentation materials there.
        - It's hard to send a question to the author when you've read the material on Twitter or something and have a question, isn't it?
        - For now, just remember the presenter's Twitter ID (nishio) and leave. Later, send a Slack link to that Twitter ID, and take questions on Slack.
        - →Too many Slack groups is hard.
    - Create a public group on Facebook
        - You can find it by searching by title.
        - You need to approve participation requests, but it's not hard because you can approve them all at once.
