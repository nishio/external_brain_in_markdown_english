Nishio and Tachikawa used the KJ method to write down their respective interests on sticky notes and grouped them for discussion.
The main topics of discussion are as follows

- Mr. Nishio is interested in creating a program to fix [[human bugs]].
    - Interested in [[enhancing]], [[upgrading]], [[not interested in humans]].

    - [[Learning Process]] is interesting.
    - [[The process of understanding what is not understood]], [[the process of verbalizing what is not verbalized]], etc.

    - It is interesting to find [[Surprising Facts]], [[unexpected connections]].
    - [[Unexpected connections between concepts that we thought were far apart]], etc.

- Discussed [[the relationship between what is useful and what is interesting]].
    - [[Interesting things make me want to do them]], but I don't necessarily want to do them just because they're beneficial.
    - [[Ideally,]] you should be able to find interesting things that aren't interesting but are useful.

- Topics in art and information representation.
    - Nishio is interested in art based on mathematical and scientific phenomena and [[patterns that express information]].

- Differences between Japanese, English and Chinese.
    - English and Chinese have more technical information.
    - As the Japanese have a history of being surprised by [[product, person, etc. arriving from the West and disturbing the Japanese market, etc.]] and working on [[translation]], we should also follow the example of China.

In the process of advancing the KJ method, the topics repeatedly diverged and converged, and it was apparent that the participants were digging into each other's thoughts and verbalizing them. Mr. Nishio's unique perspective and Mr. Tachikawa's supportive questions were impressive.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Claude/icon' alt='Claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The following is a summary of the conversation Nishio and Tachikawa had while playing the competitive card game "Flawless".
- The tutorial will go over the basic rules of the game. Students will understand how to use cards, how to deal damage, and the concepts of aura and life.
- They both play by hand at first, but gradually learn the strategy of the game. They find it effective to accumulate flares and activate trump cards.
- After the tutorial, the players reassemble their decks and play again. The real game begins, with both sides thinking while cutting cards and adjusting their timing.
- As they play against each other, they begin to read their opponents' strategies and make moves to counter them. They begin to feel the depth of the game, such as how to use the cards that are given to them.
- Nishio-san adopts a strategy of closing the gap, while Tachikawa-san uses a strategy of accumulating aura and flare, and so on.
- The game takes longer than expected, and even a single round of reading leads to long thinking. The players play a game of games, trying to figure out each other's moves.
Throughout the entire session, both participants enjoyed the game and showed a gradual process of building up their strategies. While repeatedly confirming the rules, they seemed to gradually understand the fun of the game by reading their opponents' moves and considering their own moves accordingly. Although still in the early exploration stage, it was impressive to see them enjoying the game while stimulating each other's thinking.
