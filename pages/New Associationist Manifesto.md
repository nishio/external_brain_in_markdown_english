- > A "New Manifesto" for Global Change! The movement against "Capital=Nation=State" has become more realistic after 3/11 and in the face of the Corona disaster. The "NAM" as a movement has been summed up to become the "New Associationist Movement" as a general noun, declaring a new potential of association for the transformation of the world in the 21st century!

There was a rather new book out.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

p.108
> I heard that during the Sunflower Student Movement in Taiwan in 2004, your books were often read among the activists. Especially "[[Talking about Politics]]".
> According to Jiang Hui (a professor at Tsinghua University) in China, I had the reputation of being the mastermind of the movement in Taiwan, and his students whom I taught at Tsinghua University were happy to hear it. I was also interviewed by a Shanghai magazine about it. However, I am not involved in the Taiwanese movement at all.
> At that time I gave four talks, one of which was on the Japanese student movement. I wasn't planning to do that at first, but when I went to Taiwan, I was asked about the possibility of a "student movement" in interviews, etc., which made me think a bit. I thought to myself, come to think of it, there is no "student movement" in Japan today.
> There are student movements in Taiwan and in South Korea. And a certain amount of respect is given to student movements. Japan used to have that too, but not anymore. Why is that? The reason is not that students used to be a small elite, but that is no longer the case. Above all, the leftist movement has destroyed it.
