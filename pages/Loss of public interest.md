The main points of [[Richard Sennett's]] "The Loss of Publicness" are as follows.

Sennett points out that the political public has declined in modern society, and that the "[[private]] and [[public]] spheres" have merged and reduced, converging in an intermediate space called the "[[social]] sphere."

Originally, in the public sphere, "[[relevance of policy]]" and "[public interest (e.g., public good)" should have been emphasized, not the private life or inner life of the individual. Today, however, "private aspects" such as personalities, friendliness, and popularity have come to be valued, and politics has become a "[[popularity contest]]," he criticizes.

Sennett is concerned that such a phenomenon could increase the tendency for politicians to be elected based on their likability to the masses rather than on their qualifications or the substance of their policies, and thus risk democracy ceasing to function as it should.
