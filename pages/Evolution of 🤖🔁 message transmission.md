Human communication methods have evolved from oral to written to shared venues, the latest form being collaborative editing. Co-editing curbs the flood of information and allows for effective communication; Nishio's "Three Patterns of Communication" and "Bandwidth of Human Communication" are relevant to my research. In "Disadvantages of E-mail-based Communication," he points out the problem that the load tends to be concentrated on certain people. These studies suggest that collaborative editorial communication is most effective.

Nishio's "Mental Model Transition of Communication" details the process by which forms of communication evolve and is closely related to my research. In addition, "Generational Differences in Communication" shows that forms of communication differ from generation to generation, which is also relevant to my research. Furthermore, "Shared Space Type Communication" points out the problem of communication in shared spaces, which is consistent with my research.

My view that co-edited communication is most effective is reinforced when these fragments are taken into account. In collaborative editing, information is aggregated and summarized, allowing for effective communication while limiting the flood of information.

Human communication methods have evolved. From oral to written to shared venues, the latest form is collaborative editing. Co-editing reduces the flood of information and allows for effective communication.

In verbal communication, once a message is delivered, it is gone. In written communication, the advent of e-mail created the advantage of "searchability," but messages other than those sent to you were not subject to search. In sharing, the message is tied to the sender and not subject to editing. In collaborative editing, information is aggregated and summarized.

Nishio's "Three Patterns of Communication" and "Bandwidth of Human Communication" are relevant to my research. In particular, in "The Bandwidth of Human Communication," he states that the creation of writing has allowed humans to communicate through written records without having to communicate directly with each other. This is consistent with the evolution of written communication noted in my study.

In "Disadvantages of Email-based Communication," he also points out the problem that the load tends to be concentrated on certain people. This is related to the problem of communication in shared places described in my study. In a place of sharing, messages are tied to the sender and not subject to editing, resulting in a flood of information.

These studies suggest that collaborative editorial communication is most effective. In collaborative editing, information is aggregated and summarized, allowing for effective communication while limiting the flood of information.

- [[Evolution of message transmission]]
Human communication methods have evolved from oral to written to shared venues. Co-editing can curb the flood of information and lead to more effective communication.



In early communication, people transmitted messages orally. However, oral messages, once delivered, were not permanently recorded. In addition, one had to be "present" to receive the message.

The next form that evolved is the way people communicate messages in the form of sending something written. This first took the form of paper mail and then evolved into the form of electronic mail. The advent of e-mail, in particular, brought a new advantage: "[[Searchable]]. However, access to information was limited because only the mail sent to you was searchable.

A more advanced form is to post a message to a shared place. In this form, the message is tied to the sender, but is not subject to collaborative editing. Messages accumulate, creating a flood of information.

The latest evolution is a form of collaborative editing. This allows for the "output of ideas by scraping instead of writing. In this method, information is consolidated and summarized. This allows for more effective communication while limiting the flood of information.

1: People communicate messages verbally
- Verbal messages must be written down or they will disappear.
- In order to receive the message, it was necessary to be "there" at the time of transmission.
2: Messages in the form of people sending written
- First it took the form of paper mail, then it evolved into the form of
- Especially since email has brought the new advantage of "[Searchable
- Emails not sent to me were not included in the search except for those sent to me.
3: People post messages in a shared forum
- One person no longer has to send the same thing over and over again.
- Conversations between people other than yourself can be discovered by searching
- Messages are tied to the sender and are not subject to editing.
- Do not afford editing
- Accumulation.
- information flood
4:
- joint editing
- Content that can be edited by anyone
- Summarizing.
- Organizing.
    - [[Output of ideas by scraping instead of writing]]
- Information is aggregated and summarized. This allows for more effective communication while reducing the flood of information.

If you already have a Phase 3 "sharing place" type of communication going on and there is a flood of information with active postings, adding an AI as a team member will exacerbate the problem
Because they can only participate in the form of appending information tied to the AI.
- [[broad listening]]

- [[thread mode]]
