    - It's more natural to write this down too.
        - [Write the summary above.
- If you try to write it down below, you'll need to change the previous note's acquisition as well.
    - How should it be?
    - I was envisioning a design with the beginning as a summary and the bottom as a conversation space, but then the input wouldn't change unless a human updates the top summary.
        - Well, the fragments we see in page memory change, or other new fragments are added and we pick them up, so what's the point?
        - Instead of going off on a tangent like the original [[Recurrent Notes]], it stays around the summary at the beginning and gradually explores outward.
        - That sounds like it would be beneficial.
- Experiment with multiple pickle
