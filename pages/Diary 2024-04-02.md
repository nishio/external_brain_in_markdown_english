Worldcoin, are you able to buy, the buy button is still grayed out on the Worldcoin trends screen, but when I press buy from the top, the option appears. Is it just because I don't have a wallet or digital dollars to purchase?

If you exchange virtual currency that has increased in value for another virtual currency, the increase in value is said to be taxable.
I've heard you can break even in miscellaneous income, but with cryptocurrencies at an all-time high, though, there's no way to incur a loss.
I don't know if you have to include derivatives, but I don't have much time to study that.

I think I'll put away my STEPN, which I don't play at all anymore.

    - Isn't GST listed?


Something's changed in the currency units used for trading.

I did some quick research.
- Spark was created in response to Apple's request
- At [https://m.stepn.com](https://m.stepn.com) it's still GMT
