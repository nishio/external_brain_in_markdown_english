title: "If being right is not beneficial, which is the better choice?"
---

Suppose there is a correct but unhelpful alternative A and a beneficial but incorrect alternative B
- Q1: Which is the right choice?
    - Of course, A
- Q2: Which is the right choice?
    - Of course, B
- Q3: Which should I choose?
    - So the answer to this question depends on how you interpret the word "good."

- [[What is correctness?]]
- [[beneficial]]
