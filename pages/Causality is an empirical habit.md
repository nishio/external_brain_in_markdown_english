[[David Hume]]
- [[Hume]] viewed [[causal relationships]] as [[custom]] based on [[experience]]. According to him, we observe empirically that one event causes another event, and as a result we develop the habit of finding a certain connection between cause and effect. However, Hume denied that this causal relationship is inevitable, arguing that the human mind merely "infers" a causal relationship between [[successive events]].
