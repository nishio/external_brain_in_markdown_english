> [keccak255](https://twitter.com/keccak255/status/1697061383597404622) What I would tell myself a year or two ago is that it is overwhelmingly better to work with more than one person on things, rather than trying to do it alone, because it's much better for both parties. I think that's what I'm trying to say to myself a couple of years ago.

### Summary of notes
.
By making small connections through Twitter, blogs, etc., and then building on these connections to participate in and contribute to the inner community, the quality of information and connections can be improved and the output can be more efficient. Students and others, in particular, can achieve great results through such activities. In addition, as a community, they can share information and find solutions. Rather than collecting and thinking about information individually, we can arrive at essential solutions more quickly by collaborating with the community. Therefore, it is important to utilize information dissemination tools such as Twitter to make small connections.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The notes and the fragments "[[One large community and countless smaller communities]]," "[[Unexplored as a network formation system]]," "[[Small Communities]]," and "[[Self- Management Strategies for Engineers]]" fragments share a common perspective on the importance of small communities and how to utilize them. In particular, the fragment "Unexplored as a network formation system" emphasizes the importance of [[a network structure in which small communities are connected to each other]], which is consistent with the assertion in the note.

### deep thinking
The formation and utilization of small communities is an important means to improve the quality of information and contacts and to generate efficient output. However, this requires the use of appropriate information dissemination tools and continuous contributions to the community. In addition, the formation of a network structure in which small communities are connected to each other will enable access to a wider range of information and contacts.
