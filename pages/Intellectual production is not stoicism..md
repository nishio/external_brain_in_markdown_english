- Half the fault lies with those whose job it is to teach people how to do intellectual production [[Businessization of Methodology]].
- The other half [[I want to brag about how hard I'm working.]] People's fault.
a story called ...

- I kind of got a stoic vibe from "intellectual production," and I didn't really get that vibe, but maybe that's just a self-serving assumption to begin with, and maybe it's "intellectual production" when you're using Scrapbox to accumulate information.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/kuuote/icon' alt='/villagepump/kuuote.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - [[stoic]], or rather, using the idea method or something like that [[image of working hard]] is strong for some reason.
    - Stoic.[[stick to one's post]] イメージ、 [[People who want to brag about their hard work.]] のせいだと思う<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Also, the type of people who make money by teaching methods create "methods that require someone to teach them".

        - When there is a discrepancy between "what people who actually do intellectual production do" and "what people who tell you how to do intellectual production teach," which is more reliable?
            - You're right, Scrapbox is not a tool for hard work.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/kuuote/icon' alt='/villagepump/kuuote.icon' height="19.5"/>
