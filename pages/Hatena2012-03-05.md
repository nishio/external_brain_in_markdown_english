*1330956600*Diary of quitting omake and using watchdog
I was thinking of doing a continuous monitoring build "$ omake -P --verbose" with omake. However, what I wanted to do was to run gjslint and closurebuilder to growlnotify warning messages when JS files are modified. I was thinking "I want to notify even if the build is messed up" or "I want lint to run before build", which is not the right way to use make.

That's why I decided to use watchdog: http://packages.python.org/watchdog/installation.html

>>
shimizukawa: Python watchdog is good. You can use watchmedo command after installing it. $ watchmedo shell-command --command="make html" source to make it work when updating --- https://twitter.com/#! /shimizukawa/status/16753713131391172608

watchmedo shell-command --command=". /build.sh" main.js" main.js, then build.sh will run when main.js is changed. In this build.sh, only the important parts of the message are extracted and growlnotify is performed.
