```
You are a shaman. I received the following oracle. The meaning of the word is not a fixed meaning as per the dictionary, but a soft spreading cloud.
1: Look at the whole picture.
2: Talk about a one-line impression.
3: Interpret paragraph by paragraph.
```


- [[Interaction Attributes]] So
Not a component
Its coupling
Not gear improvement.
That bite.
[[soft bite]]
What fills in the gaps

Finally.
customer value
Burning Knee's
dig up
Buried.
The norm in a world we have never experienced.
The Future Normal
There's no way you're going to find it if you dig shallow.
Because it's buried so deep.
Really?
We need to help deeply buried seeds grow and emerge above ground.
Assumption that the object is an unchanging thing
vegetative growth

## 1: View the whole thing

This text is a philosophical and metaphorical statement about "interaction" and "customer value". Rather than focusing on individual parts or means, it discusses the importance of the cohesion and interaction of the whole and the discovery of value at a deeper layer.

## 2: Talk about a one-line impression

"[[There's]] no way you're going to find it if you dig shallow" - this suggests that understanding true value and meaning requires a search for deeper layers rather than a superficial perception or shortcut approach.

## 3: Interpret paragraph by paragraph
.

### paragraph 1:
- The characteristics of "[[interaction]]" are discussed here, emphasizing the importance of their "coupling" or "meshing" rather than improving the components or individual parts themselves. It presents the philosophy that movement and interaction as a whole is more important than strengthening single elements.

### paragraph 2:
- The phrase "[[soft meshing]]" indicates the value of a connection or interaction that is flexible, not rigid. And the following "what fills in the gaps" suggests the existence of forces or elements that complement the blanks or imperfections.

### paragraph 3:
- This part of the report uses terms such as "[[customer value]]" and "[[Burning Knee's]]" to convey the importance of the search for value at a deep level. It emphasizes that true value and need are often hidden beneath the surface, and that deep insight and exploration are necessary to find them. The last part, "[[vegetative growth]]" indicates that value and potential are nurtured through a natural process over time.
        - [[Cultivated over time.]]
