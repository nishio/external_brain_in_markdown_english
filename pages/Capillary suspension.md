- Capillary suspension is a system in which a very small amount of a "second liquid" (a liquid that does not mix with the main liquid) is added to a suspension containing dispersed particles to form a strong network of particles throughout the sample by forming capillary bridges between the particles, which greatly increases viscosity and yield stress. This is a system in which the viscosity and yield stress increase significantly.
- Mechanism: The second liquid cross-links the particles and attracts them to each other by **capillary force (determined by surface tension and wettability)**.
- 2 states:
    - Pendula state (second liquid wets particles well) → inter-particle bridging.
    - Capillary state (hard to wet) → cluster of particles surrounds the second droplet.
- Characteristics: Significantly adjusts rheology when added in minute amounts, reversible in shear, and improves sedimentation inhibition and shape retention.
- Applications: Ceramic pastes, food products, paints and inks, 3D printing materials, etc.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT5/icon' alt='GPT5.icon' height="19.5"/>The following is an interpretation of "capillary suspension" read as a metaphor for plurality (⿻).

Correspondence (metaphor)
- Particles → diverse actors/communities/fragments of knowledge
- Main Liquid → Miscellaneous flows in existing public spaces (SNS, autonomy, markets, etc.)
- Second liquid (trace/non-miscible) -> neutral **"bridging medium "** (common API, conventions, rituals, small common budget, translation/summary, visualization tools, etc.)
- Capillary force (surface tension x wettability) → inducement x trust congruence (strength of motive to participate and norm conformity)
- Contact angle → How well the bridging medium "fits" into each community (acceptance)
- Yield stress (force to maintain shape) → minimum cost to maintain the shape of the public sphere (tenacity to keep decisions from collapsing)
- Shear → Re-form → Temporarily fluidized by debates, elections, crises → Re-organize after convergence

Analogy between the two states
- Pendula state: a small amount of bridging media connects the dots directly (cross-border dialogue, mutual review, co-authorship, mixed teams). = bridging social capital
- Capillary state: many parties surround a drop of medium (periphery gathers around a common data set, common fund, common infrastructure). = commons-centered aggregation

Product/Institutional Design Implications
1. very small amounts for big effects: scatter small common objects (protocols, visualization, small grants) rather than huge integration devices.
2. design "wettability": translation, summary, reply control, and code of conduct to make participation easier for everyone (contact angle ↓).
3. avoid over-cohesion: too much media leads to rigidity (factional fixation). Distribute multiple light interventions.
4. cycle design: search phase (fluidization) → summary/consensus building (gelation) → evaluation and re-fluidization rhythm.
5. bridges at critical points: Insert **small bridges (joint facts, common KPIs, shared dashboards)** at the "narrow gaps" of disputes and divisions.
6. diverse drops: juxtapose multiple bridging media (rituals, data, funds, APIs) rather than a single style to lower vulnerability.

Failure Patterns (Caution)
- A medium that only gets wet on one side: favors only one side and rejects the other → polarized reinforcement.
- Excessive surface tension: too strong inducement for formal entrainment → reduced creativity.
- Single medium dependence: network collapse if that medium is lost.

one phrase
By simply scattering a small amount of neutral "second media," fragmented diversity is spontaneously organized into a bridging network.
From this perspective, the implementation of Plurality will be much easier to design if we place policing/broad listening summaries, visualization, posting design, small common funds, interface standards (ID/data API), etc. as "capillary bridges.
