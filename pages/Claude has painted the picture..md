Claude has painted the picture.

I was digging in and Claude came up with a picture!<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- It's not a good diagram.

Let me elaborate on the "concrete/abstract" example. This example shows that the concepts of "concrete" and "abstract" are not simple dichotomies, but have a more complex relationship.

This diagram represents the "concrete/abstract" relationship as follows
- Binomial misunderstanding:
    - First, many people tend to view "concrete" and "abstract" as simple opposites. This is sometimes imagined as a single line that simply connects the top and bottom of the diagram.
    - Actual complex relationships:
    - In reality, however, this relationship is much more complex. In the diagram, it is represented by arrows from a concrete experience (large square) to several abstract concepts (center circle).
        - No arrows drawn?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Multifaceted abstraction:
        - From a single concrete experience, several different abstract concepts can be derived. This is indicated by the multiple dashed lines in the diagram.
    - Diversity of abstraction:
        - The same concrete experience can be abstracted differently from different perspectives and contexts. This is indicated by labels such as "Abstraction 1" and "Abstraction 2" in the figure.
    - Complexity of concrete experience:
        - Concrete experience itself has many aspects, each of which can be abstracted differently. This is represented by a large square.
    - Degree of abstraction:
        - There are various degrees of abstraction, with intermediate states that are neither completely concrete nor completely abstract. This is represented by the size and position of the circle.

Here is what this example suggests
- The "concrete" and the "abstract" are not simple opposites, but continuous and multifaceted.
- Many different abstract concepts can be derived from a single concrete experience.
- The process of abstraction is context-dependent and varies depending on the observer's perspective and purpose.
- The concepts of "concrete" and "abstract" themselves can also change relatively depending on the situation and context.

This understanding will allow for a more flexible and creative approach in problem solving and concept formation. You will also gain deeper insights by moving back and forth between different levels of abstraction.
