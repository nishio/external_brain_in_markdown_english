title: "Introducing Strength of Opinion"
---

The idea of introducing a strength of opinion so that users can distinguish between "strong" and "weak" approval is the same as in the 5-step survey. [[Quadratic Voting]] (QV) goes further and tries to solve the problem of "if strong and weak opinions cost the same, we will just end up weighting and tabulating the opinions of 'those who strongly argue for everything'".

The principle is simple: "You can vote as many times as you want, but it costs 1 cost for 1 yes, 4 costs for 2 yes, and 9 costs for 3 yes. This "quadratic cost" is the origin of the name Quadratic.

The interesting thing about this mechanism is that it creates a positive meaning for "neutral". While classical voting, which always allows only one vote, leads to the assumption that neutrality or a white vote is a bad thing, in the QV world it makes rational sense to act "by voting 0 for an issue that I am not very interested in, I can allocate the cost to a topic that I am very interested in".
