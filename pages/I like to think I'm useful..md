I like to think I'm useful.
> [@GOROman](https://twitter.com/GOROman/status/1642694420222058496): I've seen a few people say they bug me because they "don't feel [[role]]" or "don't feel important" or "[[lonely]]", so [[ work]]" may be a way to keep humanity from bugging out. In order to survive in the [[AI Unemployed Era]], it may be important to deal with bugs and [[desire for approval]].

- [[I want to be seen as important.]]
- [[human bug]]
[[AI unemployed]].
