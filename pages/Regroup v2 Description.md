- It was designed for the iPad, so the iPhone screen will be a little bit messy, but it's a browser implementation, so it will work.
- Edit and save immediately to the cloud without explicit saving
    - Cached locally offline and saved when you come back online
    - However, it disappears when the tab is closed now (to be improved).
- No user management now.
    - A system that allows people who know the link for editing to edit it.
- Open the same link on your PC or iPad and you'll see the same thing.
- Pass draw instead of paint
    - Can be selected and moved after drawing.
- Still no eraser, line color, thickness, dotted lines, arrows, etc.
- Drag the background area with the move tool to get as many new sheets of paper as you want, unlimited paper sizes.
    - Two-finger gesture to zoom in/out and move paper
- On iPhone, "hide toolbar" will give you more space for editing.

- Known Issues
    - FIXED:  [[Menu icons stick out on narrow screens such as iPhone]]

        - The menu bar is hidden when the screen is rotated, for example.
        - TODO: Tap on a white area with no canvas to reposition it to the proper position!
            - Or Shake
    - > When I scroll down the screen and add a new sticky, it is added in a place where it is not visible (at the top) at that position.

        - TODO: This is a bug and will be fixed
            - If implemented correctly, sticky additions are always placed in order starting from the upper right corner of the current field of view.
    - > When I group stickies, I am prompted to enter the nameplate name, but the text of the previously entered sticky is still there.

        - TODO: This is another bug
            - I'd prefer a placeholder.
            - I'm beginning to think it's not a good idea to force people to name their nameplates.
                - Better to have a nameplate, especially when grouping paths, but I was thinking a thumbnail would be fine.
    - No way to open the middle heading.

        - TODO: hmmm, this is probably a rather difficult bug
    - When using iPhone in sticky note input mode, the text area size designed for iPad is too large
        - I lose track of the toolbar because of that.

- request memo
    - Deleting and Ungrouping
        - I know [[pRegroup2020#5d2d4ca4aff09e00005b4e11]].
