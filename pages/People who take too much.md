title: "People who take too much"

> [@philomyu](https://twitter.com/philomyu/status/1691095117816573953?s=46&t=gkSZtjGEtUZPO0JCzBxCBw): It's very important in life to identify "those who have [[uncle! (I give up)]] and **take**". (I give up) and [[take]] are not the same" is very important, and people with [[too much take]] have an incentive to spend their lives on how to make people underestimate their [[give]] so that they can be allowed to live that way. It is difficult to escape from [[sense of helplessness]], no matter how talented you are.

Sounds like [[DV]].
- Make them think "I'm not a big deal" while making them feel like they are.

[[give & take]]
