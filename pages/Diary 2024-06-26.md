Thoughts before going to bed
[[0 or 100]]
- [[who can only see things as all or nothing]].
        - [[It's not worth it because it's not 100%.]]
- Many people get into [[1-bit thoughts]] that
- The world is a lot more complicated and intertwined with a lot more things.
- Different links have different achievement lines, and those that cross them become observable as later connected links.
        - [[Trial and error is hard to see.]]
- [[Good ideas solve multiple problems at once.]]
- Complex and many things are involved = multiple links
    - [[ability that outdoes (shames) one's opponent]]
- [[setting step-by-step goals]].
- [[Good ideas inspire those around you to start growing on their own.]]
    - [[Rolling Snowball]]
- [[A world where social capital is king]]
    - [[early adopter group]]
I don't know if you can see it - sometimes I wonder if you can't see it, but, well, most people can't see it.
- The information you happen to get first becomes the glasses you need to see.
    - This is [[Rolling Snowball]], too.
        - [I can only accept knowledge that is one step ahead of what I have now.
- [[Take a position before others understand it]].

I wrote.
- Someone knows what I'm talking about even before they see what I wrote.
- Someone can tell when they see what I wrote.
- After a while, some people get it.
- Some people don't know the end of the story.
- What kind of understanding the other person has [[is not my issue]].

> [yuiseki_](https://x.com/yuiseki_/status/1805716517939724434) Recently I talked to a guy in our sales department and he said, "I don't feel anything when I get turned down because it's normal to get turned down," and "In fact, it gets interesting when I get turned down so many times. I was told "It's the same as debugging for engineers! I replied, "It's just like debugging for engineers! People who can't stand repeating failures are not suited for most jobs.
>  >hayakawagomi: I've been thinking lately that what's great about engineers is their mentality of assuming that errors will occur and patiently squashing those errors through trial and error. It seems that more and more people have the mentality that they can't stand failure.


> [MobileHackerz](https://x.com/MobileHackerz/status/1805620455489126573) I never thought I would hear the words "I will distribute the VRM data of your avatar" from the candidate for Governor of Tokyo himself.
>  >[takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1805615889582375383) Since I received a comment from a live streamer that she wanted a full body image of her avatar, I am distributing the VRM data of An's avatar. Please use it within the limits of common sense.

> [MobileHackerz](https://x.com/MobileHackerz/status/1805623937717702880) Mr. Takahiro Yasuno, I guess from a very personal and emotional point of view in terms of your use of the VRM avatar, but I also guess strongly in terms of fulfilling the simple indicators that I have been craving for a long time, "data and I also strongly recommend him because he fulfills the simple criteria that I have been craving for a long time: "policies based on data and facts" and "advocacy based on the will to make the future this way, not on the basis of a "no-no".

> [teppeis](https://x.com/teppeis/status/1805758657147322496) Why can't election posters be put up before the signs are put up? I thought it would be too wasteful and bad PR for the election to have each person go around putting them up. I thought it was a bad idea, but I guess it's a barometer to show that you have a certain amount of money or supporters.
> [kazuho](https://x.com/kazuho/status/1805760669712793872).
>  Election bulletins are distributed at the current reception desk within a few days of the public announcement of a candidate's candidacy (using a newspaper printing plant?), but I wonder if it is possible to print posters and install billboards at the same speed...
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1805765270340091956) In fact, more people have been putting up posters than we originally imagined, and we are realizing the spread of support.



[[Masuzoe, Kanameichi]]
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1805760339805618650) The discussion is underway with Yoichi Masuzoe and Takahiro Yasuno as major candidates. They argue that the affluent metropolitan government enables populist politics that focuses on apparent performance, that digitalization and EV (electric vehicles) are lagging behind compared to overseas, and that Tokyo must be made into a city where money can be made.
[Former Tokyo Governor's Perspective on the Issues in the Gubernatorial Election...What Policies are Needed to Make Tokyo a "City of Earnings" Again, Rather than Relying on Inbound Travel (Masuzoe, Kanekazu) | Gendai Business | Kodansha (1/6)](https://gendai.media/articles/-/132534)

This is interesting, too.

In terms of [[turning points in history]], I'm pretty sure it's a turning point now.
- Treated as "one of the main candidates" in various newspapers and other media.
- Diverse celebrities began to mention Mr. Yasuno.
- This means that, for example, those who participate in a talk session on elections or politics, when the other person mentions Mr. Anno, they are forced to do their homework because they will be embarrassed when they answer, "Oh, who's that?" they are forced to do their homework because they will be embarrassed if they answer, "Oh, who is it?
    - If you try to do a preliminary study, you'll find a 93-page manifest, and you'll get your information input in a very organized way.
    - And the more information input you have, the easier it will be to be the subject of your talk.
        - There are many subjects that are easy to discuss, much more enjoyable and future-oriented than the Gaien redevelopment or the allegations of career fraud.
- This is [[Rolling Snowball]].
- This will bring the grassroots awareness of the "intellectuals who are embarrassed that they don't know what others know" close to 100%.
    - While there is a lot of discussion on the details, the general response from this demographic is "very favorable."
        - It is interesting to note that this demographic is actually independent of age
        - Until now, the world has tended to portray the conflict as "young vs. old," but support from the elderly is also growing.
            - There are a relatively large number of elderly people who believe that 50 years from now, when they are gone, Tokyo will be at the crossroads between a "good Tokyo" and a "bad Tokyo," and that voting for Mr. Anno will increase the probability of a "good Tokyo.
    - And this place alone is enough to meet the conditions to become [[a turning point in history]].
- I think the rest depends on how well we can gain favor with the "people who are afraid of what they don't know or don't want to know".


[[Democracy of experimentation]].
- [[Fandomized]]
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/sge/icon' alt='sge.icon' height="19.5"/>Experimental Democracy: From Tocqueville's Thought [[digital]], [[fandom]]" by [[Shigenori Uno]] is a book that presents an image of "experimental" democracy that overcomes the divisions caused by technological progress. Focusing on the executive branch rather than elections, and on [[associations]] (fandoms) rather than political parties, the book explores social issues and draws a new political conception.
        - [/halsk/ファンダムと行使の民主主義](https://scrapbox.io/halsk/ファンダムと行使の民主主義)を見てソースが分からなかったので検索した<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1805795572760330427) #Takahiro Yasuno Candidate, from rather early on, I saw people describing it as a "guess", but I wonder if this is the "fandomization" talked about in Shigenori Uno's "Democracy of Experiment".

    - > [rrr_kgknk](https://x.com/rrr_kgknk/status/1716817691426906234) Shigeki Uno and Megumi Wakabayashi, "Experimental Democracy," is a ballyhoo good book and highly recommended. The dynamism of getting a lot of people together to do something experimental is visualized in a dialogue that is academic but also has the savagery of the zaino (which is what experimental is). The company is interesting, and that interest became quite clear to me after reading this book.

Hidehiro Mitani (Member of the House of Representatives / Kanagawa 8 Aoba and Midori wards)
> [mitani_h](https://x.com/mitani_h/status/1805743131679408556) I didn't know Ishimaru properly until now, so I only knew that he was a person who was trying hard to reform the Congress,
>
>  I have come to the conclusion that he is not the kind of person to whom I can entrust important work, judging from the various things he has said and done so far.
>
>  It is not that the reform did not progress because the Congress was a resistant force. What on earth does he want to do, throwing out reform without understanding it and suddenly challenging the metropolitan government?
>  >sivaprod: If you are a serious member of society, you should be able to tell from the way Ishimaru talks that he is the type of person who would not be able to get a project done if he were your colleague or boss, and that he would be the worst type of person if he were in charge of a client. If you were in charge of a client, you would know that this is the worst type of person to be in charge.
> [mitani_h](https://x.com/mitani_h/status/1805749703839301633) While it's a personal matter, I'm really glad that the Restoration didn't jump on the bandwagon too easily.

Some people are starting to criticize other candidates under their real names.




> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1805772761253789710) I feel the need to describe with more resolution regarding #DigitalDemocracy. There are many possible options. Do we replace the "current election" as defined in the Public Offices Election Law, or add another means of visualizing the will of the people? What do we choose by voting, politicians, for or against an agenda, or a budget proposal?
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1805774592545603861) Who decides the object of opinion expression, a politician running for office, a government official soliciting public comments on a particular subject, the media conducting a survey, or the people gather their peers by making proposals in a digital forum? None of these has to be chosen, they all have their own merits.

> [hrjn](https://x.com/hrjn/status/1805791331689939102) more like the Local Autonomy Law?
>  Since the governor is the head of the executive branch, he or she has the authority and responsibility for the execution of various measures of the municipality. The governor is the head of the executive branch, so he/she has the authority and responsibility for the execution of the various policies of the municipality.
>  I think it was built up that Congress would monitor this executive body.
>  I think #digitaldemocracy is how to deconstruct and reconstruct this.
> [hrjn](https://x.com/hrjn/status/1805791814806651367) Surprisingly, it's the congressional side that's interchangeable, isn't it? I guess that's what I'm thinking.
>  Doesn't IT seem to be rather good at monitoring by legislators who represent the will of the people?
> [hrjn](https://x.com/hrjn/status/1805792293921898878) Even if direct democracy is achieved, maybe the equivalent of a governor will remain, but there will be no legislators.

> [hrjn](https://x.com/hrjn/status/1805802841560563834) #Digital Democracy has evolved so much that if a governor says, "What Senator XX says is in his interest, not the will of the people. If he says "This is the evidence of the will of the people", it will be a singularity of democracy.
> [hrjn](https://x.com/hrjn/status/1805803035916222915) head of the executive agency who monitors those who monitor the executive agency
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1805819819352375615) Personally, I would release that means of obtaining "evidence of the will of the people" not only to the governor, but also to legislators and citizens w
> [hrjn](https://x.com/hrjn/status/1805821188775825756) The destination is likely to be indirect governance by electing councilor AIs instead of voting to elect councilors, because there are too many choices on the residents' side in response to the wildly growing number of councilor AIs.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1805821690787905955) I'd like to see an AI that allows residents to select the appropriate councilor AI for them from a wildly varying list of councilor AIs (er, what's that?).
> [hrjn](https://x.com/hrjn/status/1805822041901482195) Spam AI legislators show up and the AI that filters them (ry)
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1805822871010451770) Every legislator creates an AI interface, every citizen has an AI assistant interface that discards information, and all public discussion is 10,000 times more human W that takes place over HTTPS, which is faster.
> [hrjn](https://x.com/hrjn/status/1805823854851637706) Then politics became hyper-technological, and before long, mankind was out of control, and humanity declined.
>  AI became known as Mr. Fairy...
>  *Cartoon



> [otsune](https://x.com/otsune/status/1805810212307353695) In my experience of watching various cases, most of the reasons why projects fail are due to depletion of motivation or panic, "It is not a rational decision by any means, but I don't want to listen to others' opinions because I have lost my mental capacity and I am fed up. (This is the same as people who fail to invest). (This is the same for people who fail to invest. They get scared.
>  >nishio: In my lifetime, AI will become a "gentle lifetime dictatorship" for many projects. I believe we need to develop technology to make that dictatorship more people-friendly.
> [otsune](https://x.com/otsune/status/1805810883941253325) It's "strong" to make rational decisions and optimal solutions nonchalantly and without hesitation in any harsh situation, but people with a human touch get scared, so why would they do that? Why do you do that? (e.g., suddenly stop coming to a meeting, or cancel the whole thing).


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1805808978909077764) The Polis experiment so far has been to have the AI create a clean statement and then have humans vote on it, and once the new human post is also cleaned up by the AI, it is then published, but I wonder if we could try the direct I'd like to try it on the theme of "updating democracy" in the form that a human writes it and it is published immediately.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1805155914338742397) I didn't realize what they were talking about until I saw them actually putting the stickers on by hand. I thought that the sticker-pasted papers handed out during the relevant speeches are rare items with a limited number of copies.
>  >[yuyawatase](https://x.com/yuyawatase/status/1805155914338742397) During the election period, candidates are only allowed to distribute a limited number of documents in real life with a seal called a "certificate". This is because the election should not be unfair due to differences in capital strength.
context
> [yuyawatase](https://x.com/yuyawatase/status/1805145815989756357) Inquired to the Election Division of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications about the interpretation of the law regarding the large number of #Dotour Ishimaru books being sold in Tokyo. (Awaiting reply)
>  What happens if this is allowed under the Public Election Law?
>  It will be possible to set up a large number of Big Issue style people in the city about a particular candidate's book and have them run an election campaign in a way that generates their own income.
>  The whole framework of document violations for election offices, confirming organizations, etc. becomes meaningless.
>  That would be a complete overturning of the public election law framework.
>  The law needs to be amended this time because the legislative facts are now available.
>  Also, this situation is possible because it is not known when there will be a general election to dissolve the House of Representatives or other elections.
>  Since the term of office for gubernatorial elections is known in advance, whether or not such an action is ari or not will set a precedent for future campaigns.
>  ![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQ0qNhSaAAAjDLJ?format=jpg&name=medium#.png)

> [yuyawatase](https://x.com/yuyawatase/status/1805154249200005529) If it's not illegal, that is.
>  Next time a publisher publishes a book about a prospective candidate just before an election and sells it in large quantities around town using the Big Issue method, no problem (the format is the same as selling it in a bookstore).
>  because a revolutionary way of campaigning will be developed and policy debates will be possible,
>  I just want to know why this is not a violation of the document and why it is an ant.
