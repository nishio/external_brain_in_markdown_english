<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I heard, and explained, that "Japan's long-established businesses are a unique, long-lasting organization in the world."
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>It is estimated that there are more than 30,000 companies in Japan that have been in business for more than 100 years, which is a remarkable number of long-established companies in the world as a whole. Behind the large number of these long-established companies is a culture of passing down the family business from generation to generation and business practices that emphasize long-term relationships of trust with customers and the local community. In addition, the fact that they have gradually transformed their management to keep pace with the changing times while preserving traditions is said to have contributed to their long-term survival. These long-established companies have become unique in the world by continuing to utilize their uniqueness and the weight of their history as corporate values.

Specific discussions and analyses of long-established Japanese companies often include, for example, the following points

1.### Culture of family business and inheritance
.
    - Inheriting the family business from generation to generation, a strong sense of "protecting the store's sign even if it fails" takes root.
    - Instead of simply replacing owners and management, they tend to take a long-term view of the company, as it is tied to the honor of the house and the community.

2.### Close community relations
.
    - Emphasizes trust with local customers since the company's inception.
    - A structure that is closely connected to the local economy and community and that "helps each other in times of need" will lead to continuity.

3.### Balancing change with tradition in keeping with the times
.
    - Introduce new products and services in small increments while preserving traditional values (craftsmanship, history, brands).
    - Rather than making extreme and drastic policy changes, the company will gradually make improvements while leveraging its strengths developed over many years, allowing it to continue to do so with minimal risk.

4.### Conservative financial strategy/use of retained earnings
.
    - It is said that the company strongly believes in prioritizing "corporate survival" over shareholder returns.
    - There is a culture of setting aside a portion of profits internally and using that "[[retained]] earnings" to withstand economic fluctuations.

5.### Perspectives from sociological and historical studies
.
    - The unique Japanese corporate image of "family = company" ("lifetime employment," "seniority by length of service," etc.) is also affecting the survival of long-established businesses.
    - In studies of long-established companies, it is analyzed that Japan's unique [[community-oriented]] and customary practices, which are different from those in other countries, deeply influence corporate management.

For example, in the case of the oldest class of construction company "[[Kongo-gumi]]" (founded in 578) and ryokan inns "[[Keiunkan]]" and "[[Houshi]]," the change of management has been done by blood or adoption, and preserving the family business itself has become the mission of the family and community. It is argued that the fact that non-financial factors such as local community and the weight of the family name support the continuity of the business, rather than being driven by the stock market as in the West, is unique even from a global perspective.
