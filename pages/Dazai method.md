> But, your womanizing ways have come to an end. The world will not tolerate any more of your womanizing.
>  What exactly is the world? Is it the plurality of human beings? Where is the substance of the world? I have always thought of the world as a strong, harsh, and scary thing, but when Horiki said that to me, it occurred to me,
>  "The world is you, isn't it?"
>  the word was on the tip of my tongue, and not wanting to offend Horiki, I retracted it.
>  (The world will not tolerate that.)
>  (Not the world. You won't let it go, will you?)
>  (If you do that, you'll be treated badly by the world.)
>  (Not the world. It's you, isn't it?)
>  (He will be buried from the public now.)
>  (It's not the world. You're the one who's going to bury him, aren't you?)
>  Know thyself, thou personal horror, monstrousness, viciousness, old wickedness, and yokuban nature!　and many other words came to my mind, but I just wiped the sweat from my face with a handkerchief,
>  "Cold Sweat, Cold Sweat"
>  and just laughed.
>  But since that time, I have come to have an ideology that the world is an individual.
