Dynamics of Language and Cognition Based on Collective Predictive Coding: Toward New Developments in [[Symbolic Emergent Robotics]].
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This paper introduces the new concept of "[[collective predictive coding]]" and proposes a "collective predictive coding hypothesis" that explains [[language emergence and evolution]]. The main contents of the paper are as follows:
- 1.[[Symbolic emergent system]]: A model that explains the process by which symbolic systems, including language, emerge through individual cognition and social interaction.
- 2.[[collective predictive coding]]: A process in which multiple agents collectively learn a model of the world by performing Bayesian inference in a distributed manner.
- 3.[[Collective Predictive Coding Hypothesis]]: The hypothesis that human language is formed by collective predictive coding.
4. new developments in symbolic emergent robotics: Based on this hypothesis, we suggest the possibility of developing more complex models and co-creative learning between humans and robots.
5. relationship with existing approaches: Discuss the relationship with existing research such as [[emergent communication]], [[multi-agent reinforcement learning]], [[iterative learning models]], [[symbolic emergent robotics]], etc.
6. future work: extensions to the theory, experimental validation, and connections to computational linguistics.

This theory is an ambitious attempt to integrate individual cognition and [[social interaction]] into a comprehensive explanation of language emergence and evolution, and may offer new perspectives in cognitive science, linguistics, and artificial intelligence.
