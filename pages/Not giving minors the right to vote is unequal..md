from  [[Balance between life after birth and life before birth]]
- What would those who believe that [[one vote per person]] is important do if it is argued that "not giving [[the right to vote]] to [[minor]] is [[inequality]]"?
- All people, including 0-year-olds, should be given the right to vote equally, and those who cannot express themselves should be delegated to their parents or guardians.
- (Added) It was named [[domain voting system]].

Personally, I think it would be better to go one step further and give [[remaining life expectancy]] a proportional say.
- (Added) It was named [[life expectancy voting system]].
