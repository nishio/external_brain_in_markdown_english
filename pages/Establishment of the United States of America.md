Establishment of the United States of America
In late 18th century America, the debate between Federalists and Anti-Federalists determined the fundamental direction taken in the creation of the institution.
- Federalist:
    - He insisted on the need for a strong central government. Emphasizing unity and efficient governance throughout the nation, it sought to achieve large-scale governance by concentrating broad authority in a single pole.
- Anti-Federalist:
    - He stressed local autonomy and protection of individual rights, and expressed concern about centralization. He called for a decentralized political system that reflects the opinions and characteristics of diverse regions.
This controversy is connected to the challenge facing contemporary democracy of [[balancing centralization and decentralization]] in [[institutional scalability]].
→These debates were ultimately reflected in the articles of the Constitution and in the basic principles of federalism, which determined the direction of the political system of the United States.

assumption
- Confusion immediately after independence:
    - After the War of Independence, the old system of government under the Articles of Confederation was dysfunctional and a new system of governance was needed.
- Diversity by state:
    - Each state had its own traditions, political system, and sense of rights, requiring a balance between a centralized unified government and local autonomy.
- Conflict of Philosophy:
    - A fundamental debate developed between [[efficient central governance]] (Federalists) and [[protection of local rights]] (Anti-Federalists) regarding the scalability of government authority distribution and decision-making.

This situation became the premise for discussing [[the trade-off between centralization and decentralization]] in institutional design.

During and immediately after the American Revolutionary War, each state had its own government, military, and foreign affairs, and was virtually an independent nation. However, with the Articles of Confederation and the subsequent Constitution, these states were united under the federal government and positioned as components of a single nation.
