title: "We must create the power to move forward."
---

All we have in life is the power to [[progress]]. We must create that power. Solutions to problems are found [[posterior]] to progress.

I think [[Saint-Exupery]] said something like that in [[night flying]], but it's not an exact quote.
I did a quick search of the internet.
> All we have is the power to move forward. We must create that power. The solution will be found later.
I found the expression.
