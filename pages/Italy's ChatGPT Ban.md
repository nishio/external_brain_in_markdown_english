title: "Italy's ChatGPT Ban"
---

The banning of ChatGPT in Italy lowered productivity by 50% for two days. Then, productivity was restored to normal by using censorship circumvention tools, the report said.
- Some might interpret this as simply throwing away a day's worth of productivity.
- In the short term, yes, but in the long term, I think the disadvantages are greater due to the fact that domestic people will no longer be able to discuss and exchange knowledge on the beneficial use of new tools.
- I would love to see Italy continue Ban on a yearly basis and be a guinea pig to give us new insights (joke).

The Unintended Consequences of Censoring Digital Technology -- Evidence from Italy's ChatGPT Ban
> We analyse the effects of the ban of ChatGPT, a generative pre-trained transformer chatbot, on individual productivity. We first compile data on the hourly coding output of over 8,000 professional GitHub users in Italy and other European countries to analyse the impact of the ban on individual productivity. Combining the high-frequency data with the sudden announcement of the ban in a difference-in-differences framework, we find that the output of Italian developers decreased by around 50% in the first two business days after the ban and recovered after that. Applying a synthetic control approach to daily Google search and Tor usage data shows that the ban led to a significant increase in the use of [[censorship bypassing tools]]. Our findings show that users swiftly implement strategies to bypass Internet restrictions but this adaptation activity creates short-term disruptions and hampers productivity.

(DeepL)The Unintended Consequences of Censorship of Digital Technology--From the Evidence of Italy's ChatGPT Ban
Analyze the impact of the ban on the use of the pre-generated training conversion chatbot ChatGPT on personal productivity. First, we compile data on the hourly coding output of over 8,000 professional GitHub users in Italy and other European countries to analyze the impact of the ban on individual productivity. Combining the high-frequency data and the sudden announcement of the ban in a difference-in-differences framework, we find that Italian developers' output decreases by about 50% in the first two business days after the ban and then recovers; applying the synthetic control approach to daily usage data for Google search and Tor, we find that the ban revealed a significant increase in the use of censorship evasion tools as a result of the ban. Our findings show that users quickly implement strategies to circumvent [[Internet regulations]], but this adaptive activity creates short-term disruptions and impedes productivity.
