title: "Create a knowledge system inside/outside"
---

- Create [[body of knowledge]] inside/outside
- When you create a body of knowledge outside of yourself, you need to use common words to refer to common meanings with others.
    - The system needs to be carefully constructed.
    - So we should pay a reasonable cost for understanding the meaning of existing words.
        - [[coined word]] forces others to pay the cost

- When you create a body of knowledge within yourself, the words need only be consistent within you and need not be understandable to others
    - Relatively low operational costs of coined terms
    - The advantage of being able to easily point to a concept and increase resolution by coined terms will prevail because of the
        - [[Concept Handles]] should be created more and more as [[Concept Handles]].

- Metaphor for [refactoring
- When we think a name is not appropriate, we should change it to the one best suited in our present understanding, irrespective of past history
- For the names given to the past are only what was thought best at the time, according to an inferior understanding of the past.
- This is [[policy constraint]].
