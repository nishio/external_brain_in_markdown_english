Observe current thinking from different perspectives.

## Relation to Fragment

From the fragments of "KJ Method Study Session @ Loftwork_Lecture Material v1" and "KJ Method Study Session @ Cybozu," it is relevant to note that it is necessary to notice the goodness of "things that go against conventional thinking. This is consistent with gaining new insights through observation from different perspectives. In addition, the "write then think" and "process of thinking" fragments illustrate the idea of embodying thoughts and gaining new perspectives through observation of them. This is related to the idea of "observing current thinking from different perspectives" in the notebook.
