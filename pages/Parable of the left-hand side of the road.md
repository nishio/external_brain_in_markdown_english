title: "Parable of the left-hand side of the road"
---

There is no rational preference for driving on the right or left side of the road, but if it is not standardized in society, accidents will occur more frequently.
- In other words, [[unification]] decreases [[social costs]].
- Unity is a kind of public good.
- So [[freedom]] against unification would be restricted.
- This limitation of freedom is merely a social decision.
        - [[policy constraint]]
- So it can be turned over.
    - This usually requires shrugging off the cost society pays by turning it over
    - Is it possible depending on the administration or mood of the society to impose costs on society?

Probably originally from Vitalik
