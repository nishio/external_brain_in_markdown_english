title: "pile up riches in heaven"
---

There is a Christian expression, "accumulate wealth in heaven. This is a story about the importance of increasing eternal "wealth in heaven" rather than transitory "wealth on earth.

From the perspective of [[Accessism]], which states that "the totality of open-access information is the permanent transcendent," isn't writing one's thoughts in an open-access forum the equivalent of "piling wealth in the heavens"?
