Satisfactory flat binding

- I was playing [[Satisfactory Multiplayer]] and I said, "I wish I could see the train network and stuff," and they told me, "You can.
- [https://satisfactory-calculator.com/en/interactive-map](https://satisfactory-calculator.com/en/interactive-map)

And so I looked at my home base, which was already a mess, and I thought, "If I'm going to look at this, it might be more interesting to play it in a bind where the buildings are not stacked vertically.
Recently came an automatic connection blueprint, which is sometimes smoother to connect horizontally.

So I started and looked at it, but there was no map in the beginning and I got lost all over the place.
- I thought I had it in my head because it's a starting area that I cleared once, but that wasn't the case at all.


![image](https://gyazo.com/6560288061e128247452b3cab6e3044b/thumb/1000)
- I just finished researching chainsaws as the first milestone.
    - From here, it switches to power generation using compressed biofuels.

When I looked at the pull screen, I thought, "Oh, that's how it's positioned.
![image](https://gyazo.com/6116db95ed81a765917779100176b7a1/thumb/1000)
- You start from west of the last play.
- I think the lake above is where they built the first coal power plant (that's what I remembered from the stones).

Ah, well, there's still no branching out.
- At least I made a chainsaw.

![image](https://gyazo.com/81d44751048e1a1e3aa4e24611ccbee2/thumb/1000)
I just did a study of the branches.
- You can't tell from this diagram that he cut all the trees with a chainsaw.

The conveyor belt can now be branched out, so we can go around and fix the various messy factories.
- Now that we have more resources, we can pull conveyor belts for convenience.
- Instead of using HUB generators that require manual fuel delivery, we put four generators where the fuel produced is brought in by conveyor belt.
![image](https://gyazo.com/bd5e6215c181f7899c379edf2347682e/thumb/1000)
- I wasn't sure whether to do foundation construction or field research next, but I decided on the latter because I wanted to move forward with side studies.

Wouldn't it have been better to start with the blueprints being released? I'm inclined to think so.

Note what to do next
- I wonder what it's called?
- Parts Assembly
- orbital elevator
- delivery of goods
- coal power generation
- Basic Steel Production
- blueprint
- Logistics 3
- Advanced steel production
- delivery of goods
- Maybe a jetpack.
    - I like hover packs, but that's Tier 7.
- Maybe oil refining first?

Already a bit of a pain in the ass.

2025-08-14
- Parts Assembly had amassed the resources needed to liberate it.
- They also built an orbital elevator.
- What should we do about smart plate production?
    - We don't have a lot of material to spare either.
    - (screw + plate) + (screw + rod)
    - Before we can start building this plant, we first need to create the reinforced steel plates and rotors.
    - Either dig up nearby iron ore to produce new
        - While building a reinforced steel plate factory, four generators were not enough and the power went out.
    - We've got automatic production of rotors and reinforced steel plates, but what about smart plates?
        - Do you want to bring in 50 sheets of each and automate only the processing?
- Well, it's going to be a while before we get together, but let's take a break here.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/efd0946932cab35be91a8c65908d33a8/thumb/1000)
- We're running out of electricity again, six units aren't enough, we've got eight.
- We've got enough reinforced steel plates, but 25 more rotors, or we'll have to temporarily increase the number of factories.
- delivery complete
- Coal power generation is next.
- Not much production of rotors due to lack of screws.
- Steel production and modular frames will be needed next.
    - We could reorganize the rotor factory and build a modular frame factory as well.
    - First, power generation.
    - How to transport coal
    - I'd love to transport a vehicle.
    - The nearest coal is right on the cliff to begin with.
    - First, we need to study the construction of a Tier 1 foundation.
- Coal power generation started.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/9c240110930584ba949da5390b9181eb/thumb/1000)
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/9a24535336ab4a84c46dad6c7310801b/thumb/1000)
- Increased the number of coal power plants to four so that all electricity demand is met by coal.
    - This will make biomass power generation less fuel-intensive.
    - I'm not sure if it's right or wrong to leave it in this situation, but I'm of the opinion that it should be left alone.
    - The next time you play, you should have accumulated enough concrete and rotors to slow down the production rate.
    - With those two production improvements, modular frames, steel studies, and blueprints.
    - Well, we'll have to wait for the blue prints to come in before we can improve production.
    - I forgot to take a screenshot, so I guess that's my first priority.

2025-08-15
Check during lunch break
![image](https://gyazo.com/385a1d00211d91f9a003352e7547baf5/thumb/1000)
- Rotors and concrete are still slow.
- Rotors are slow because the screw requirement is 100/m while the production of the first stage is 40/m.
    - Even if we tripled the speed of the conveyor, the speed of the conveyor would not be up to par, so if we want to improve it, we need to do the research first.
    - I've got a full stock of screws and rods, so I'll have to do some extra production to hold me over until the blueprints come in.
- At 1 Pomodoro elapsed
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/ab035fb03ffd743659d852f4ce18f09d/thumb/1000)
    - Only about 20 modular frames were made, so they were delivered by hand production, and the steel production study was done.
    - But it's hard to know what to do with all the coal that's been found in only one place and used to generate electricity.
    - I guess I'll just make the amount needed for the blueprint study by taking from power generation, and then I'll transport the vehicles to increase the amount of coal I can get my hands on.
    - There's not much left of my lunch break, so we'll continue later.
        - I've noticed that there is coal in the north, but I'm not sure if that is easy to transport or if there are any enemies there.
            - The sense that there will be enemies.
            - If there's enough concrete, I can work without going down to the ground and see if I can get by with that.
    - Other Notes
        - I did a study on asset security and created a xenobasher.


- Buy concrete foundation material, ladders, and work paths with tickets.
- Make minimum steel
- Went to see coal in the north.
    - That's a long way.
- I made minimal steel and studied the blueprints.
- Create a facility to make blue prints.
    - W make the minimum steel for this purpose.
- It's done.
- What's next?
- Studied vehicle transport.
- If steel can't be mass-produced, whatever it is, it's in trouble.
    - But there is no coal. Do you want to transport it from far away?
    - Or Mk2 mining machines in the study of "advanced steel production."
- The option of drawing a road to the coal mines in the north because vehicle transport can be done and a road can be built with blueprints.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/a891a490637d9f42c3ba7927b57e5f83/thumb/1000)
        - Distant ......
            - That's roughly 100 blocks.
            - It takes 1,500 concrete to run 100 blocks of road 3 thick.
                - Huh? That's more than enough room.
        - Is it better to dig coal with Mk2 and start steel production and then pull the road?
- status quo
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/d33ca612bf399766af0494b2b7febc28/thumb/1000)


Miner to Mk2.
- However, since the coal was of high purity 120/m to begin with, it was not the mining speed that was lacking, but the speed at which the coal was carried out.
- The right thing to do is to update the logistics to Mk2 and the conveyor belt.
- Blueprint to make two steel products, half and half for now.
![image](https://gyazo.com/ed3d3406ecd9e871d827ad138b3bc21c/thumb/1000)
- I guess I shouldn't have put the blue prints at an angle.
- Next, we're going to destroy the old facility and produce all five types of iron products.
- Logistics 3 research and pulling from west concrete warehouse to steel and orbital elevator delivery.

![image](https://gyazo.com/e99937432830cb20380fd47c03da18ad/thumb/1000)

Miscellaneous deliveries in progress
- just a matter of time
- I researched everything but the jump pad.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/e26685df4a38b952a5f36f3da8ef7875/thumb/1000)
- The next tier will be oil plants.
- Electricity generation is now beginning to consume biomass stockpiles beyond coal generation
- If we start building oil plants, we will lose power, so we need to increase coal power generation first.
- We can double the amount of coal mined, so we can double the amount of electricity generated by re-pulling the conveyor belt.
- It has been left alone because of the trouble of transporting coal from the mines in the north, but electric lines have been run to the vicinity, so digging and burning is an option.
- Oh, and if you think the number of weapons doesn't increase at all, you're researching at MAM...
    - I forgot about it because I don't explore.
- Concrete is about 2 storage units.
    - With enough concrete, you can get a flat lot.
    - Maybe we can move the HUB too.

delivery complete
![image](https://gyazo.com/3d54145a77b8515e88e57a014db97cd5/thumb/1000)
I added two more coal power plants.
- I thought about pulling the floor north-south and running a conveyor through it, but then I reconsidered that if people are going to be moving along the path above, having a conveyor running through it would interfere with traffic.

I decided to look at the map without worrying about spoilers because I haven't explored too much.
![image](https://gyazo.com/a334dd8359bd7153c9c6a99fa9980757/thumb/1000)
- The last time I used sulfur, it was in the lower right corner of the screen, far
![image](https://gyazo.com/2a78e724b7ee5a70d52618525762fd58/thumb/1000)
- Crystal is even farther away.
![image](https://gyazo.com/8d48223d0bb7eb88bf03a30eb8acf901/thumb/1000)
- Crude oil used the east one last time, but the northwest one is a little closer in distance.
- Last time, sulfur and crude oil plants were single-track railroads, crystal was first vehicle transport and later drones.
- Let's try to connect all the double lines this time.
    - It makes the map more enjoyable.

The building was moved onto the floor.
![image](https://gyazo.com/eb798ca35ecdd2a829f348a5db7a8385/thumb/1000)
- I made a blueprint with six warehouses lined up on four tiles.
    - The system has a conveyor belt on the end so you can see what's in it.
    - And it also prevents you from putting it in the wrong direction by mistake.

I need to do some exploration and research in MAM before I can proceed with the main deliveries and research...
![image](https://gyazo.com/a1be2382e4a51eab71b5f9af3c4c7dfe/thumb/1000)
- He went to see SAM and died in a crash in a panic from poison gas from outside his field of vision.
- We need to make a mycelium -> mask, or sulfur -> novelisk.
- I'd give up on SAM for now and go east to the sulfur.
    - Or we could go on foot, pulling power lines, and drive back.
    - No, wait, I'll just pull off the road and go and make the car easier to find.
    - And it would be easy to pull the railroad upstairs on that street in the future.

I pulled off the road.
![image](https://gyazo.com/5abae7e54dd171d94b74a8e5a8474029/thumb/1000)
- I fell over the road barrier on the way there, but I got the summers loop and was happy with the result.
- Plants full of mycelium and plants that can take silica.
    - I would have liked to have released the side of the crystal study to go ahead with the silica first.
    - Crystals collected nearby were dropped into the valley of the SAM.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/7454722afc786f0ec799fe8c53e11bf5/thumb/1000)
    - Well, but if you stretch north from this bend in the road, you'll be in crystal country.
        - And you have SAM.
    - There's coal south of the road, and iron ore.
        - Or we could make steel here and transport it by truck.
        - Or bring in this coal to generate electricity.
        - The idea is that there is iron ore to the east of the coal power plant as well, so it could be switched to meet power demand.
        - If we can even generate power from crude oil with the current power margin, would we go that route of expansion without thinking about the details?
            - But we're still a long way from crude oil.
            - I'd say it's about 1.5 times farther than this road.
        - I thought coal power plants could generate electricity from compressed coal.
            - be made
        - Crude oil extractor 40W 120/m
        - Refiner 30W
            - Direct from crude oil 6:4
        - Fuel Type Generator 250W
        - If you build the generator first, then make the fuel directly to generate electricity first, and then expand it, you could do it.
    - I'd like to strengthen my weapons before the expedition.
        - But the blast rebar uses waste fuel oil?

I'm building a motor, so next time I'll do some research on trains.
- I think it would be a good idea to draw the railroad on a course that turns west at the northern lime and continues along the coast.
- Looks like a lot of hatchery.
- Drawing a path to quartz is also an option.
    - Build an exoskeleton
    - If we can get the mask, we can retrieve the package that was dropped in the SAM valley.
        - Maybe there are spiders, though.

![image](https://gyazo.com/b88d93196c726b1544e1473f5e012023/thumb/1000)
Automatic creation of motors before the camp
- Somehow it stopped on the conveyor with another one mixed in.
- Railroads, jetpacks studied
- You're generating electricity with oil, you need plastic for research.
- Computers are also needed for railroad signaling, and research on "industrial manufacturing processes" is needed for this production, and plastics are needed for this.
- After all, we need to manufacture plastic for a while before we can generate electricity from oil.

I got the crystal.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/70ce62c39a30d39e0f049c050020412f/thumb/1000)
- Blade Runners (exoskeletons) released
- Now that we've made the masks, let's go collect SAM's stuff.

Recovery complete, SAMs beginning to harvest.
- Production amplifiers: Plastics → Circuits → Research
    - We have three summer sloops and they still don't work.
- I need two Mercer Spheres for dimensional depot.
- Made it, started uploading.

What to do next
- Recovery of hard drives along the roadside while getting sulfur and crystals with a tractor.
- Power is not so much because we have accumulated a lot of inventory during the period when the camp was left unattended, and we will probably run out when the elevator deliveries start.
    - I think we could pull a railroad, but currently we don't use enough sulfur or crystal to transport by rail, so maybe YAGNI.

- ✅ Recovery of hard drives along the roadside while getting sulfur and crystals by tractor.
- ✅ Started producing small amounts of plastic and rubber from petroleum
    - I think I'll do some research, so I moved the HUB closer.
    - This will open up fuel power plants and then oil plants on a large scale.
    - I came here while pulling the road with one width concrete, went back once because I didn't have enough wire, and came again while pulling the electricity, but the feeling that the road is inconvenient for the stones.
    - Maybe I'll make a double track + tube blueprint and go home while pulling it.
        - We're going to run out of resources.

![image](https://gyazo.com/05edf2137b9908d4c997a0163cb4cc1c/thumb/1000)![image](https://gyazo.com/9e42261bbeb37d2ea073bbe78a5555ba/thumb/1000)
- In the meantime, we started generating electricity from oil.
    - I didn't expect to find a catherium.
- They're double-lined with railroad and tube blueprints.
    - After I got this far, I realized the tube wasn't straight.
- If it were true, I would like to start production for delivery preparation and leave it at that, but I'm too sleepy to do so.

Line connected.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/c322281148744b8f3b22b32f19bd7066/thumb/1000)
- Double track, but they used one single track to bring back plastic and rubber in a mixed load.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/0cb20a62d12e4e901219ed0c16c26adf/thumb/1000)
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/3b915e274937f67d263e6d93f3f950d0/thumb/1000)
- Let's study Conveyor 4 and liquid packaging.

![image](https://gyazo.com/faae50c6fd055a03b733863f81357527/thumb/1000)

Containerized diluted fuel
![image](https://gyazo.com/45fd94c79c436aed5f70ee8f481726d6/thumb/1000)
- 2400 m3 in industrial liquid tanks, 4800 in industrial storage in packs, and now we have both, so we have more than enough stock.
What's next.
- Signal and Blueprint Studies
- While proceeding with the delivery
- Advancing Research on Caterium and Sulfur

Ah, the blue print 4×4 makes the manufactures (large machine tools) tight...

Automated production of miscellaneous computers and heavy modulars before bed.
- After studying the blue prints, redo them nicely.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/6851b964efd4241cf4322f90e695ec75/thumb/1000)
- Of course there's an overwhelming lack of land to tie up that doesn't stack up the craft equipment...

Screws are in short supply, it seems.
- The hard disk research should have produced a cast screw, so we could make one with that.

It's fun to do refactoring that you don't have to do without doing what you have to do.
- Refactored copper lines.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/af87235245d5daa44e9a3f1dc3aa5798/thumb/1000)
- Studied production amplifiers.

![image](https://gyazo.com/0e2ce361eab71bd2b74b5631c1ae1f16/thumb/1000)
- I'd like to refactor the iron line to take advantage of the lower left area.
    - Early constructor blueprints are subtle, should be fixed.
    - Considering that we're going to be flat-bound and assembled, I'd like to have room to branch out and connect and merge.
- As for steel, now that both screws and pipes can be produced from steel ingots, maybe we can tear down all the equipment from the days when screws were made from rods and rebuild it.
    - It's on the ground. It's all over the place.
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/03291786821ae9c8b35fe30489ffa51a/thumb/1000)
    - I'm sure that's why we're not producing at full capacity.
    - I think we can build a facility to collect them first and turn them all into ingots, just like copper.
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/9e6847a221049c16ca66caf7da3c3699/thumb/1000)
        - Can we make it extendable seaward?
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/fe7fe9dc895d779807b7abb34dd85a4f/thumb/1000)
        - The structure could be extended to the south here.

I'd like to improve the railroads too...
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/554e2d04355353e3316b66c8b3b18ca5/thumb/1000)![image](https://gyazo.com/0aa507293e98541cc3a580760b340302/thumb/1000)
- I'm thinking of putting a station next to the double track.
- How long would it take to make a clean turn?
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/4d2b022dcba6f7b547f4a7a32f50c662/thumb/1000)
        - [https://wikiwiki.jp/sf-jp/自動化/自動運転輸送](https://wikiwiki.jp/sf-jp/自動化/自動運転輸送)
    - I see, so you can turn in 3 squares, add one for the signal, and the station itself has 6 squares, so 10 squares in all.
        - I wonder if I can make it with blueprints.
    - First I would build a plastic, rubber and fuel station on the crude oil plant side.
        - I probably have extra fuel, so...
        - And even if you want to use it as a higher level fuel, coal and sulfur are not on the crude side, so it's better to bring them in the fuel stage.
        - This time, it's convenient because it's packed in relation to making diluted fuel.
        - We haven't been trucking because coal is scarce and we don't have infinite fuel, but when the fuel starts coming, maybe we can truck in the quartz and sulfur...

Built a rubber station.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/f5173d62ab1e646c98a5ed29218209d0/thumb/1000)
- The recipient has to make it, too.

I thought I had studied production amplifiers last time, but was I imagining things?
- I studied it again.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/b41d820ddac86e65d9dec5b32751d97c/thumb/1000)


They stopped making steel pipe from steel because they could now make it from iron ingots, and they didn't make it from iron ingots.
- I need to do this before I run out.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/216ff2770764eafcc98d1d88e02cfeb2/thumb/1000)
- Assemblers from left to right: rotor, reinforced plate, modular frame
- The upper floor overhangs and overlaps, so it violates the FLAT binding.
- Rotor is rod and screw, reinforcing plate is steel plate and screw, modular frame is reinforcing plate and rod
- The stator is pipe and wire, which is combined with the rotor to make a motor.
