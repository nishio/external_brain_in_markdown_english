title: "When 1 to x is sufficient and 1 to x-1 is not, x is required"
---

Title needs improvement

For a predicate f that takes a set as an argument
- $f(S) = 0, f(S+\{x\}) = 1$
Then the thought pattern that x is required to be 1

What are the conditions for being able to say this?
- $f(S) = 1 \Rightarrow \forall T \supset S, f(T) = 1$

- [[Find one subset that satisfies the condition]] sometimes $2^N$ instead of doing a search, N is better
- [[2^N search is impossible.]]
