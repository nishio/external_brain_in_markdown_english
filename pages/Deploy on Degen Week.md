> [k_0214](https://twitter.com/k_0214/status/1782326980068917309) I submitted a new project as [[Senspace]] for Deploy on [[Degen]] Week! I submitted a game played with cards, which is a little more advanced than my last project!
>  The launch of the project is scheduled for mid-May, so please follow the [[Warpcast]] channel at the link below!

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Deploy on Degen Week is a week-long virtual program designed to accelerate projects that developers build on the [[Degen Chain]]. The event is co-sponsored by Degen and [[Syndicate]], in collaboration with other companies such as [[1confirmation]] and [[SeedClub]]. A total of 10.5 million DEGEN tokens will be subsidized to participants during the program.

The purpose of the event is to foster innovation and encourage creativity, highlighting the importance of collaborative talent in the Degen community and social currency as $DEGEN. The program will include developers, startups, and artists, providing a place where technology and artistic creativity can merge.

Deploy on Degen Week will feature workshops focused on specific engineering, integration, design, and conceptualization related topics to accelerate the development process. Some of these events are open to the public, and selected teams will receive special invitations. Ultimately, selected projects will be awarded grants and the results will be publicly announced.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Degen is a new Layer-3 solution in blockchain technology. It is specifically optimized for the [[Degen Community]] and is intended to provide low-cost, scalable applications. The [[Degen Chain]] uses [[Arbitrum Orbit]] and [[Base]] to increase transaction security and data reliability, and facilitates community engagement and ecosystem liquidity through $DEGEN tokens [[Arbitrum Orbit]] and [[Base]].
- (DataWallet [Degen Chain Explained: Ecosystem, Tokenomics & More](https://www.datawallet.com/crypto/degen-chain-explained))

The chain is primarily focused on the [[memecoin community]] and is often used to develop social networks and games. Also on the Degen Chain, DEGEN tokens act as native gas tokens and are used to reward user activity and [liquidity mining

- (The Defiant [DEGEN Launches Arbitrum Orbit-Based Layer 3 Chain - The Defiant](https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/degen-launches-arbitrum-orbit-based-l3-leveraging-base))​

Specifically, the chain is not designed to do anything technically special, but to function as an application layer chain, allowing for any customization the community desires. For example, it can be customized to make certain pre-compiled functions directly available at the blockchain level. This makes it easier for more application developers to design fun and useful applications using this platform!
- ​ (Blockworks [What is DEGEN chain? The L3 built for the memecoin community DEGEN - Blockworks](https://blockworks.co/news/community-focused-layer-3-degen-chain))​

Thus, Degen Chain provides a low-cost, innovative, community-focused blockchain platform suitable for the development of a wide variety of applications and games.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>A Layer-3 solution is a new layer in blockchain technology that is built further on top of Layer-2. It is primarily designed to improve the scalability and efficiency of the blockchain, with Layer-1 referring to the blockchain itself (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) and Layer-2 referring to technologies that improve transaction speed and cost efficiency on top of those basic layers (e.g. For example, [[lightning network]] or [[plasma]].

Layer-3 is built on top of these Layer-2 solutions to support more complex applications and protocols. This layer is specifically intended to improve interoperability between different Layer-2 solutions and to provide more specialized services and customization. For example, it can incorporate special features and protocols dedicated to a particular application or project.

Thus, Layer-3 technology plays a role in enabling the deployment of more advanced applications and improved user experiences in the blockchain ecosystem.
