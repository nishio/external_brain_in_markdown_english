> Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it. --- [[Brian Kernighan]]
    - [[debug]] is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. In other words, if you have written the code with all your wits about you, you are not smart enough (as is clear from the definition) to debug it.
