    - How can [[venture]] cause [[innovation]] when [[capital invested]] is small?
    - [[There are two types of ventures.]]
    - Type that raises funds from VC and other sources at an early stage of startup.
        - There has to be a story that the VC can understand at that point.
        - Research at large companies, etc., and spin out with the seeds
        - Chesbrough's "[[open innovation]]" also featured several examples.
    - Do business with one to a few people who can earn a living in a small amount of time.
        - Invest excess time in what you want to do
            - [[Innovation happens after the fact.]]
            - [[Incubation period is difficult to observe]]
            - [[Paul Graham]] described it as "[[earning]] ramen money [http://blog.livedoor.jp/lionfan/archives/52682058.html](http://blog.livedoor.jp/lionfan/archives/52682058.html)" and not money, but time.
