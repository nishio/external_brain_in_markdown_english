<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>Context collapse" refers to a phenomenon in which statements and actions that are originally made in different places and under different assumptions are consolidated into one place on the Internet and social networking sites. This creates a situation in which a statement is interpreted by unexpected recipients and in multiple different contexts, the message is misunderstood, and the sender is subjected to unintended criticism and pressure.

> Context collapse refers to the phenomenon in digital communication where distinct social spheres or contexts intersect, leading to challenges in managing audience expectations, privacy boundaries, and self-presentation. It occurs when content intended for one audience becomes visible to multiple, potentially disparate audiences, blurring the boundaries between personal, professional, and social identities online. Context collapse often raises concerns about privacy, authenticity, and social repercussions in digital environments.
> Contextual disruption refers to the phenomenon in digital communication where different social domains and contexts intersect, leading to challenges in managing audience expectations, privacy boundaries, and self-presentation. It occurs when content intended for one audience becomes visible to multiple, potentially different readers, blurring the boundaries of personal, professional, and social identities online. The disruption of context often raises concerns about privacy, authenticity, and social impact in the digital environment.
