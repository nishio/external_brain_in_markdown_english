Decisiveness] is cultivated by training one's [[Focus on Emotions]]" ([[Tomoya Tachikawa]]).

explanation
- If you don't [[verbalize]] your [[hope]], you won't be able to communicate it to others and you won't get what you want.
    - So you have to verbalize what you like and what you don't like, what you find interesting, what you want to do, in order to communicate!
        - My [[values]].
        - Liking, disliking, [[interesting]], boredom, wanting, not wanting, are all "my feelings."
- If you don't verbalize it, you can't consciously think about it.

- I thought there was a lack of explanation about decisiveness.
- During the two years, I came to believe that "the focus on 'interesting' is especially important.

- What is decisiveness?
    - Ability to decide "I do" about choices that may or may not be made.
    - Assumption of "unclear whether it is better to do" because we are not bothered about options that are clearly better to do.
        - Do not" tends to be chosen more than expected by [[risk aversion]].
        - [[Trade-offs between use and exploration]] From an exploration perspective, we need to choose "do" over "expect" for exploration.
        - So add the subjective plus term "interesting".

relevance
    - [[Properly subjective]]
