<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>A Designated Verifier Signature is a [[digital signature]] technology that allows only a specific verifier to verify the validity of a signature. This technology is used to protect [[privacy]] and enhance [[confidentiality]] of information.

In a normal digital signature, a signer signs a message, and that signature can be verified by anyone with a [[public key]]. However, in the case of a Designed Verifier Signature, the signature is designed to be verified only by a specific verifier (the Designated Verifier). That is, the signer generates a signature along with the message, and this signature cannot be validated without the private key of the designated verifier.

The main features of this method are as follows

- Privacy protection: Since only designated verifiers can verify the authenticity of messages, information can be sent and received without a third party knowing the contents of the message.

- Preserve the sender's [[anonymity]]: Since no one other than the designated verifier can verify the signature, the sender can send information without revealing his or her identity.

- [Non-repudiation: The signer cannot repudiate that he/she signed the document. However, this property is only valid for the recipient of the signature (the designated verifier).

The Designated Verifier Signature can be effectively used in situations where privacy and security are important, such as the exchange of confidential business information, private communications, and electronic voting systems. This technology can ensure that information is only shared with specific recipients while ensuring the security of the information.
