title: "From the subjectivity of one to the subjectivity of many"
---

Part of the title of the article "[Not subjective or objective, but from the subjectivity of one to the subjectivity of many.

- We tend to use [[subject]] and [[object (as opposed to subject)]] as the axis of opposition, but isn't that [[false dichotomy]], and isn't there another axis of "[[one person's subjectivity]]" and "[[many people's subjectivity]]"? I'm talking about that.

Making one person's subjectivity the subjectivity of many is "[[gaining]] empathy."
    - [[Should we be sympathetic?]]

You can't control what other people think.
    - [[Focus on what you can control.]]
