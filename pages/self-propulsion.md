- Self-drivenness goes beyond spontaneity and independence, and refers to the ability to set up the environment and resources on one's own to achieve one's goals.
- To develop self-drive, it is important to build up experience, intrinsic motivation, and to create an environment conducive to self-drive.
- Self-drivenness is shaped not only by the nature and ability of the individual, but also by the appropriate environment and resource management skills.

This Twitter thread discusses the concept of self-drivenness from a variety of perspectives. Self-drivenness is seen as more than just spontaneity or independence, and refers to the ability to set up one's own environment and resources and use the necessary skills and know-how to advance toward a goal in problem solving and project execution. Examples are given of children who are spontaneous but not self-driven, and the importance of setting deadlines for themselves and pushing themselves to achieve results.

It also emphasizes that self-drive is not just a skill or ability, but also the importance of personal disposition, intrinsic motivation, and the ability to create an environment conducive to self-drive. People who are self-driven are also considered to have the ability to successfully build an environment that capitalizes on their strengths and covers their weaknesses.

Furthermore, the viewpoint that accumulating experience in accomplishing something on one's own is essential for fostering self-drivenness and that the ability to be self-sufficient and to choose one's environment and tasks contribute to self-drivenness is also presented. On the other hand, even those who are considered highly self-driven sometimes lose their direction, and the importance of changing direction at such times is pointed out.

Throughout, there seems to be a shared understanding that self-drivenness is a complex characteristic that is formed as a result of the individual's ability, nature, and interaction with the external environment, all of which are important for the individual to effectively advance toward his or her goals.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1761246519985164795/quick_promote_web/intro) We often hear words like "spontaneity" and "independence" in the world, but when I listen to various discussions in the unexplored community I heard many discussions in the unexplored community, and I heard some people say things like, "We hired them because they seem to have the ability to run on their own. I thought, "What is really important is "self-drivenness.

> [hrjn](https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1761255689224433781) I wonder what the difference is between spontaneous or voluntary and self-driven.

>  Being able to run on your own is likely to include something about being able to manage everything, including the necessary environment, resources, and know-how, in addition to being able to move on your own initiative and be proactive.

- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1761285004280385852) Getting up and resuming when you stumble seems to be related to "self-propulsion", spontaneity seems to include only "running out".
- > [ringo](https://twitter.com/ringo/status/1761291936324067589) I'm impressed with your ability to keep going, but there are some continuations that don't produce any results at all.
- >  I thought it was necessary to change the direction in which we were going in order to run ourselves in an unexplored context. By "ability," I include it.
- > When I play Mario Kart with my kids, it's like I'm driving backwards but they don't realize it and it never gets resolved.
- >  There may be a pattern of failure in children that "keeps them going too long". Can't get out of a direction that doesn't have an answer.

> [voluntas](https://twitter.com/voluntas/status/1761270107266011505) I understand, self-propulsion is really important. I'm not sure where to get that self-propelled ability ... I have a question.
- > [fate_fox](https://twitter.com/fate_fox/status/1761372415647768898) at least not the kind you get by reading books.

> [inamoly](https://twitter.com/inamoly/status/1761282153638469800) I think it's about being self-sufficient. Recently, I have been thinking more and more that it is our job to think about how we can support them as they move forward with their projects in a self-driven manner.

> [yoshikikoji](https://twitter.com/yoshikikoji/status/1761278336876339232) Until recently, I wondered how to acquire "self-driving ability" and wondered if it was up to the individual. I used to think that it was up to the individual, but after learning more about coaching, I have come to realize that the surrounding environment is also important. In order to demonstrate self-driving ability, it is necessary to create an environment that facilitates self-driving.

> [shamo_ken](https://twitter.com/shamo_ken/status/1761285301576872212) Indeed. Self-running tends to be talked about like a skill, like "self-motivation," but people who are said to be highly self-motivated actually seem to have it as their own nature, so "self-motivation" is probably closer.
>  A person who has an engine driven by intrinsic rather than extrinsic motivation.

> [svslab](https://twitter.com/svslab/status/1761298715900510221) The topic of self-drive. While I think it is closely related to self-regulated learning, what I am personally wondering now is, "Isn't it possible to be 'self-driven' because you choose your environment and tasks well?" "Do you sacrifice something in yourself or allocate resources to other people or things in order to achieve self-drive?" These are the questions. (continued)
>  >nishio: We often hear words like "spontaneity" and "independence" in the world, but listening to various discussions in the unexplored community, statements like "we hired you because you seem to have the ability to run on your own" come up, so I wondered if what really matters is "self-drive. I thought, "What is really important is "self-drivenness.

> [svslab](https://twitter.com/svslab/status/1761299154805174453) It is highly disconcerting to think of self-propulsion in the sense of "a 'can do' ability attributed to an individual". If we were to speak of it as an ability, I think we would describe it as "self-propelled ability. In any case, the question is whether there is also "self-propulsion" that is shaped by the environment and circumstances in which the individual is placed. (continued)
- > [svslab](https://twitter.com/svslab/status/1761299467293327485) (To use an abrupt analogy with Power Pro, what defines an individual is a wide variety of special abilities rather than basic abilities, and the image of an individual is defined by the way he or she plays with both given abilities. The image of an individual is defined by the way he or she plays by making do with both abilities given to him or her.) (continued)
- > [svslab](https://twitter.com/svslab/status/1761299646960545832) The word "self-driven" tends to give the image of "being able to do everything on one's own," but in reality, I think there is an aspect of narrowing down the areas that one can do on one's own, and successfully leaving the areas one cannot do to the environment. In reality, however, I believe that there is an aspect of narrowing down the areas one can do by oneself, and properly leaving the areas one cannot do to the environment. In fact, however, I believe that people who are highly self-driven are good at this type of management, but I may be mistaken. (continued)
- > [svslab](https://twitter.com/svslab/status/1761300375989281142) Since this is a topic that I have not yet imagined, it may be that "self-drivenness," which includes not only the ability to find a niche where you can make the most of yourself, but also the ability to create and change the environment to suit yourself, is highly valued. In any case, the intention of "self-drivenness" and the message may be the same. In any case, I am curious about the intention of "self-drivenness" and how it is conveyed. (End)

> "If this project was accepted, what would you do first thing tomorrow?" I can't answer that question... If you can't answer that question, then you can't do anything unless I tell you what to do... Basically, I don't tell them what to do, so it doesn't work as a project... I don't pull people who don't move on their own.

> Even if the mentors help the students to succeed in the results presentation, it will only give them the experience of having succeeded with help, and they will not be able to run on their own after the junior unexplored period ends. The emphasis is on long-term growth, not short-term success in presentation.

On the other hand, the ability to drive oneself, especially technically, is not something that one is born with, but can be enhanced by "helping one to the point where one can drive oneself.
- The hurdle to entering an "environment where support is available" is the disparity in ability to propose, which determines whether or not support is available.
