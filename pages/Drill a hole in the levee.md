- Punch a hole in [[levee]].
Reduce the cost of the route you want them to go through.

> I was surprised by my friends when I wrote an article with a title that was unusually wordy, but the purpose was literally "I don't have time to go around pointing out things," and the title was a tune-up for that purpose. The Tweet has 500,000 impressions as of now. Just 0.1% of these people posting links is 500 times more productive than me doing it alone.

I'll lower the cost of pointing out "that's not good" in response to criticism that is not good.
- That would increase the number of people going that route.
- It is preferable to create a structure in which this increase calls for a further increase
- terms
        - [[Parable of the New Combination and the Surface of the Water]]
    - Drilling holes in appropriate locations is preferred
    - I haven't yet verbalized the idea of where it's appropriate, I'm kind of doing it.
