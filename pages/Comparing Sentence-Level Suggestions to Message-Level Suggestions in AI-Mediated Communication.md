title: "Comparing Sentence-Level Suggestions to Message-Level Suggestions in AI-Mediated Communication"
---

> Traditionally, writing assistance systems have focused on short or even single-word suggestions. Recently, large language models like GPT-3 have made it possible to generate significantly longer natural-sounding suggestions, offering more advanced assistance opportunities. This study explores the trade-offs between sentence- vs. message-level suggestions for AI-mediated communication. We recruited 120 participants to act as staffers from legislatorsâ€™ offices who often need to respond to large volumes of constituent concerns. Participants were asked to reply to emails with different types of assistance. The results show that participants receiving message-level suggestions responded faster and were more satisfied with the experience, as they mainly edited the suggested drafts. In addition, the texts they wrote were evaluated as more helpful by others. In comparison, participants receiving sentence-level assistance retained a higher sense of agency, but took longer for the task as they needed to plan the flow of their responses and decide when to use suggestions. Our findings have implications for designing task-appropriate communication assistance systems.

- (DeepL) Traditionally, writing assistance systems have focused on short or single word suggestions. In recent years, large-scale language models such as GPT-3 have made it possible to generate considerably longer, natural-sounding suggestions, providing opportunities for more sophisticated assistance. In this study, we explore the trade-off between sentence-level and message-level suggestions in AI-mediated communication. We recruited 120 participants to staff the offices of legislators, who often need to address the concerns of large numbers of constituents. Participants were asked to respond to different types of supportive emails. We found that participants who received message-level suggestions were quicker to reply and more satisfied with their experience, primarily because they edited their suggested drafts. In addition, their writing was rated by others as more helpful. In comparison, participants who received writing-level advice retained a higher degree of initiative, but the task took longer because they had to plan their response flow and decide when to use the advice. The results have implications for the design of task-appropriate communication support systems.

This is an experiment to confirm what GPT users know firsthand: that it is easier to save time by generating the whole of a product in one place than by generating small units of a product and combining them together.
- > Generation model. We use GPT-3 (specifcally, the text-davinci002 model without any fine-tuning) to generate suggestions.

Here's what's interesting

- (GPT3.5) Figure 9: Responses written with message-level suggestions were rated as significantly more helpful than responses written without sentence-level suggestions or AI assistance. 500 decisions were made for each data point. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals; Y-axis shows the average usefulness of responses as rated by participants according to the type of response displayed on the X-axis; responses that explicitly indicated AI involvement are color-coded in blue; responses that explicitly indicated AI involvement are color-coded in red.

- We are conducting an experiment in which 900 different people are shown the messages we have created and asked to rate their usefulness.
    - GPT generated the entire message and human reworked it, which is more useful than a raw human writing it on his/her own.
        - Disclosure of AI assistance lowers the usefulness rating, but it is still rated higher than that written by a live person.
    - Even those generated by AI and sent without human involvement are rated higher than humans without disclosure.
        - Much better than existing auto-responders.

It is amazing that this result is obtained with `text-davinci002 model without any fine-tuning`!
