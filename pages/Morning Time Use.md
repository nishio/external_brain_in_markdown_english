title: "Morning Time Use"
---

- There are two opposing claims about the use of morning time.
    - The theory that "the brain is not occupied in the morning and should be used creatively; it is a waste of time to use it for chores."
    - The theory that "in the morning, you have to get your chores done first in order to start the engine."

- discussion
    - Concerns allocate brain memory ([[zygalnick]] effect)
    - Creative work is undecided on the results obtained for the time spent.
        - It doesn't always produce results.
        - If you work for a day and don't get results, you're exhausted and have no energy left to do chores.
        - It is also unclear how long it will take to complete
    - Getting chores done is only as good as the results you get and the sense of accomplishment you get from doing them.
        - Engine warm-up operation
        - As is often said, "motivation comes after the fact when you start working" [[Work Excitement]].
    - Creative work is "heavy"
        - Takes time to start moving.
        - Whoever said, "It's good to do creative work in the morning" wasn't being lazy in the morning.
    - The worst thing you can do is say, "You should do creative work in the morning instead of chores," and then do nothing.
    - Thinking about which task to start with is a creative process in itself.
        - So it's equally prone to sloppy procrastination.

- Conclusion.
    - You can do it from either side.
    - The most important thing to avoid is to think, "I must do A first," which will cause B to be postponed.
