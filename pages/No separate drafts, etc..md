title: "No separate drafts, etc."

At [[Scrapbox Drinkup 20180810]], "Do you have a private project?" "Of course I do." "Then are you drafting it there?" I didn't do that." So here's my note.

[/shokai/not a warehouse to keep dead texts#5969b47097c2910000f3239f](https://scrapbox.io/shokai/not a warehouse to keep dead texts#5969b47097c2910000f3239f)
- [[Scrapbox]] is not just a tool for neatly scribbling out a document with a fixed content.
    - [[think in writing]] and sharing and consulting with others as they write.
- In cases where it is not necessary to do a clean-up, spending time on clean-up is a waste of time, and a mysterious "[[A sense of being at work]]" tends to arise when you are narrow-mindedly working on a task that is easy to understand, but when you think about it calmly, you are simply wasting your time by not thinking.
- Don't spend the cost of cleanup on anything other than what really needs to be cleaned up (e.g., product introduction brochures).

    - The thought of drafting and then publishing is like hitting the save button, which eventually becomes a barrier to output.
    - I've published drafts of my own, and some articles I've let sit for a month.
    - I have a draft tag on my drafts.

    - They don't even put a DRAFT tag on it.
    - You interrupt me in the middle of writing a sentence and leave the table, what's wrong with that?
    - I thought you were writing well." Because? In other words, "I thought I wrote it well before publishing it" is nothing more than self-consciousness, and in fact, there is no harm in publishing it while it is still in the process of being written.

Here is what I wrote a year ago about this operation by Dr. Shiozawa
> Surprising operation, what is the first place a visitor to your blog should look?
> Wouldn't you be confused by the draft if you saw the pinning?
>  but if it's mainly a search influx, then pinning is fine?
