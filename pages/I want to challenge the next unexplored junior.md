I would like to challenge the next [unexplored junior
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1683819926082191364) #Unexplored Junior Question Box Q: I want to try out for the next Unexplored Junior! and I'm on fire. What can I do to prepare for it this summer, and what seminars or events should I attend?
>  A: That sounds great. I've asked a few people in the community for their opinions, which I'll explain below:.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1683820536462446593) Looking for ideas. How many "ideas" do you have right now? If you already have an idea that you are working on with enthusiasm, I think it is a good idea to go ahead with it, but if you don't have any yet, it is important to search for them first. There are many problems in the world that have not been solved yet and many things that need to be improved. First of all, let's gather as many of them as possible.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1683821354519531527) The first one you find in normal life is usually not good. Instead, it is important to go looking for it yourself and collect a lot of them. By collecting a lot, it will gradually become clear what you are interested in and what you can be enthusiastic about solving. It is important to "know yourself.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1683824382844751873) Next, it is important to prototype early on. You may think that prototyping means software development, but it is not, but rather "doing something that allows you to experiment and gain new knowledge. This is because knowledge gained in this way improves ideas.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1683824931635892224) Some may think "hide the idea so it can't be taken down," but if the person who hears the idea can take it down, then the proposal is "at the level of an idea If the person who hears the idea can take it down, then the proposal is "only at the level of an idea". If you have created a prototype yourself and learned from that experience, you can write a better proposal than one written by just taking ideas.
- [[If the person who hears an idea can crack it, then the proposal is "only at the idea level."]]

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1683825974805405696) So if you are experimenting with your own hands, I think you should tell your ideas to various people without fear of being taken advantage of. Because observing their reactions is also a kind of "experiment" that can be done at low cost. However, most people do not share the same assumptions, so 90% of the advice is misguided. Discard and select.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1683826797480402944) Ignore negative reactions and observe only positive ones. Because no matter what you create, the people who will be its users are positive about it. Negative people are not the intended users, and eliminating their complaints is no guarantee that they will become users.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1683827449233313792) It is better to have one to a few dedicated fans than one that a lot of people say is kind of good. If such a thing can be created, it is better to observe those fans closely, communicate with them, and find areas for improvement. The first fan can be "just you".

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1683828239876395010) In finding these fans, it is also important to "make prototypes" and "show them to others" that we have been talking about. Just having an idea in your mind is not enough for others to see it. It can be recognized only when it is explained in words, but the form is still vague. When there is a shape, it becomes easier to understand.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1683829345775939584) I believe that by doing the things I have described here, you will not merely be preparing for the adoption of the Unexplored Junior, but you will also acquire the skills to live in a rapidly changing world where your existing values will be shaken and you will be able to create new values. I believe that you will acquire the skills to create new values and live in a rapidly changing world where existing values will be shaken. I am cheering for you!

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1683833373930979331?s=20): oh, I forgot to answer this. I was just wondering if there are any seminars or events you think I should attend."
> I think you should go to events that interest you. And if you're asking this question, you probably mean that you don't know what you're interested in, so you can't think of any keywords to search for. If so,

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1683834052787474432?s=20): Since it's summer vacation, I think it's probably a good idea to go to open campuses, open lectures for junior high and high school students, and public lectures at various universities. I think it's a good idea to go to all those things and look for "something you find interesting". Then, once you find something, I think you should ask more and more questions and dig deeper.

    - [[It is easier to explain if there is a prototype.]]
    - [[Use your own deliverables.]]
    - [[Good ideas inspire those around you to start growing on their own.]]
