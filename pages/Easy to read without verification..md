title: "Easy to read without verification."

Easy to read with no verification.
- After finishing the book, close the book and write down what you learned
    - If you can't write anything down, "I just followed the words with my eyes, there's nothing in there."
    - With no verification of whether you are in the state or not, it is possible that reading the book is the same as not reading the book
        - [[Not confident, but high grades.]]
        - After reading, try to remember, then read again
        - This method has the lowest confidence, but the highest comprehension
        - Conversely, those who have not verified whether or not they can remember [[have a low level of understanding but a high level of confidence]].

Additionally, [[Duplicating knowledge from a book in your brain does not lead to value.]]
