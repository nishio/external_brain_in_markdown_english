> [@mootastic](https://twitter.com/mootastic/status/1563876281556824065): Article examining the time it takes for an open source alternative to emerge for a given commercial software (Time Till Open Source Alternative, TTOSA) for a given commercial software.

> [@m_sekijima](https://twitter.com/m_sekijima/status/1563890012101685250): @twk @mootastic It's been 20 years since it came out and Photoshop hasn't been destroyed by GIMP, Office hasn't been destroyed by OpenOffice either, so it's not easy.

> It has gone unnoticed because it has created more demand at the same time than it has eradicated.
