My mind has been cleared and I'm feeling like, "Well, what was I supposed to do?" so I'll start by checking the backlog.

Today is 2/27, there should be no urgent tasks, I'm feeling like what was I supposed to do, help me organize.
Below is the backlog. It has not been updated since I have been busy for a while.
It is important to check and update the latest information

## 1. Check for past due tasks
.
(Abbreviation)

## 2. "No task should be particularly urgent" but should be checked
.
T0112: "Bring your My Number card on your next visit to 7-Eleven to get your insurance card."
- It is labeled "urgent" but does not appear to have a strict deadline. Consider setting a guideline for when to go if necessary, or treat it as a "habit task".
T0098: "Verification of Notepad + Night AI Input Flow" and T0113: "Examining Measures to Address Increased Information Channels"
- Both tasks are improvement tasks to avoid operational confusion. Recheck how information channels and flows have changed recently and whether the need for them has increased.

## 3. Items that have not been updated in a while and may need to be checked for progress
.
- T0051/T0002/T0003 series (XXX)
    - Include a note on whether you actually tried XXX (around XXX in T3261/T0061).
- T0096: XXX
    - There is a "T0109: Waiting for XXX" in dependencies; it's time to check and update to see if XXX is up.
- T0110: "Scrapbox Export JSON → Random Page English Translation Determination"
    - If not initiated, once the scope is reviewed, the priority is reevaluated.

## 4. "Things that would be refreshing to do today (2/27)" at this point
.
- Update status of expired tasks
    - Update according to the reality of the situation either finished or not finished, such as the lecture on 2/25 (T0057) and the guerrilla check due at the end of January (T3243).
- Labeled "urgent" but with no clear expiration date
    - If you have a good idea of what you are going to XXXX next, put in a date, or tie it to a scheduling application so that it can be done without omission.
- Inventory the progress of larger/seemingly important project tasks once
    - For example, TTTC related tasks (HDBSCAN integration T0026/T0066, TTTC Turbo stability T0027/T0067, etc.) and multi-source integration (T0089) systems.
- Reflect current status of personal tasks (shopping, health-related, etc.)
    - If you haven't "bought an inner lens" (T0106) yet, note the date when you're likely to do it next.

# Summary
.
- First, updating overdue tasks to the correct status will clear your head by reducing unnecessary "Open" tasks.
- Add specific action plans or set reminders for those with "urgent" labels but unknown timing for implementation (e.g., T0112).
- For larger tasks, it is helpful to clearly indicate the progress with a status such as "In Progress" or "Waiting" so that the next time you start the task, it will be easier to find your way around.
Once the backlog is organized in this way, it is a good idea to only "update the overdue status" and "confirm the dates of upcoming tasks" first today.

`% python scripts/mark_done.py T0057 T3243 T0112`

> Dependent has "T0109: Waiting for XXX" It's time to check and update to see if XXX is up.
- This is a nice assist.
- This too is complete.
- `% python scripts/mark_done.py T0109 `
> T3261/T0061
This too has been successful.

Buy an inner lens and find out what steps to take first.

> For larger tasks, it is helpful to clearly indicate the progress with a status such as "In Progress" or "Waiting" so that the next time you start the task, you will not get lost.
This is an important design decision that needs to be considered, and whether it is better to have a variety of status information or two open/closed statuses.
- I think open/closed is fine. The current "done" is overly detailed and causes "cancel" instead of "done".
- Would you rather have is_open: boolean and status: arbitrary string (if empty it becomes "Open" / "Closed")?
- [[AIPM WebUI]]

There are times when I focus on a single task to achieve performance, and times when I multitask, and I feel that this system is valuable for the latter.

Embodiment of T0098 "Notepad + Night AI Input Flow Validation"
- Keep track of the form and quantity of memos
    - Decide what form of notes you will actually take during the day: "paper notes," "text files," or "smartphone memo apps."
- Collective input to AI at night
    - Decide how to input the data (dedicated script or copy and paste into ChatGPT?) Decide on the
- Measurement of Effectiveness
    - We have clear indicators of whether the system is running well, such as, "Are there any input omissions?
- Operational Period and Improvements
    - Try it for a week or two and adjust the procedure accordingly.
It is easier to proceed if these are broken down as a single subtask and subdivided by assigning a task ID or adding a T0098 description.

I like the idea of splitting up the confirmation task.
