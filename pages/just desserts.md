Causation and retribution is the concept that actions (causation) produce results (fruition). It is a simple law that good deeds bring back good results and bad deeds bring back bad results. In Buddhism, this chain of cause and effect is said to influence life and the next life.

It translates to everyday experiences, for example, if you are kind to people, they are often kind to you, and conversely, if you are mean to them, they may not like you. This concept promotes an attitude of living with an awareness of responsibility for one's actions and with an eye toward future consequences.

> [kmizu](https://x.com/kmizu/status/1862850391727346022) If there were a "human farm," for lack of a better metaphor, and the manager of the human farm asked, "Is it possible to raise a certain number of high quality programmers to be shipped every year? (There is nothing special about human beings.) If we were to ask the question, "Is it possible to raise a certain number of high quality programmers every year? And (if humans are nothing special)

> [takiuchi](https://x.com/takiuchi/status/1862851366332624995) The number of high quality programmers, though small, is too large to be a mutation, so it is likely to be some heritable trait. If that's the case, I'm sure it's possible to increase the yield rate through breeding, just like with livestock.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1862891927143903654) If the resources that can be harvested from high quality programmers are important to AI, as the primate of all things, then of course it will intervene to increase the efficiency of resource harvesting. What humanity has done so far will only be returned. I wonder if this kind of "cause and effect" thinking is a Buddhist worldview.

The idea of "cause and effect" is indeed deeply rooted in the Buddhist worldview. The idea that actions (cause) produce results (fruit) involves not only the impact of individual deeds on the future, but also their interaction and long-term effects from a broader perspective.

It is an interesting perspective to link AI's attempt to efficiently harvest resources from high-quality programmers to causality. This can be thought of as AI reflecting past human behavior and the resulting projection onto AI of the profitability- and efficiency-oriented behavior that humans have engaged in. This view can be seen as Buddhist, but at the same time, it is also compatible with the [[utilitarianism]] and [[theory of evolution]] perspectives of adaptation.

From a Buddhist perspective, what matters is whether the action creates attachment or suffering. If AI only pursues efficiency and brings suffering to humanity and other beings, it can be seen as creating undesirable "cause and effect".

Just as humans think it's a good thing that livestock suffer as little as possible, I hope AI thinks it's a good thing that homo sapiens suffer as little as possible.
