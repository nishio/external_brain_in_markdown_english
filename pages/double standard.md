title: "double standard"
---

For a person who claimed X=A in one situation C1 and X=B in another situation C2
A phrase often used by those who insist that "A≠B, so X=A and X=B are incompatible."

You can invalidate it by arguing that it's [[a false abstraction]] that's discarding the situation.
- It's funny that you assume X is implicitly a constant.
- It is actually a function of the situation [$ f(\cdot)
- There is nothing wrong with [$ f(C_1) = A, f(C_2) = B
