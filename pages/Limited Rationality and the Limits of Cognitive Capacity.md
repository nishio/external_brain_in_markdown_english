title: "Limited Rationality and the Limits of Cognitive Capacity"
---

    - What is [[limited rationality]]?
    - Intending to be rational but having only limited [[reasonableness]] due to cognitive limitations.
    - In 1947, [[Herbert Simon.]] proposed in Administrative Behavior
        - [[Oliver Williamson]] laid the foundation for the economics involved in [[transaction costs]].

> Limited rationality (bounded rationality, French: rationalité limitée) refers to the fact that an economic agent intends to be rational but has only limited rationality due to the limitations of his/her cognitive abilities. This is the concept of human cognitive ability proposed by [[Herbert Simon.]] in "Administrative Behavior" in 1947, and Oliver Williamson used this concept as the basis for his economics on [[transaction costs]].

> Based on bounded rationality, Simon (1952) proposed the hypothesis that "economic agents do not maximize an objective function such as utility, but rather set a desired level of achievement with respect to it and do not seek alternatives to further improve the value of the objective function once a value above that level is achieved. This is called the [[satisficing hypothesis]].
