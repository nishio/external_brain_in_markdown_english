title: "There are two types of task management"
---

- The term [[Task Management]] is ambiguous and has at least two meanings. It means to "manage what a clear task looks like" and to "[[Crystallize Tasks]]" out of the mumbo-jumbo that is not yet clear.

    - There are two types of what is called [[Task Management]].
    - Task [[progress]] ・Resource management
            - [[Task Status Management]]
        - Dedicated tools are better.
            - Scrapbox is not designed for it.
        - How to do it with Scrapbox
                - [[The status display to be updated should be a pictogram at the beginning of the title.]]
    - Thinking about the task itself
        - What is the problem and how to solve it
            - [[What to make]]
        - I prefer Scrapbox.
            - why?
                - [There are so many things involved that you have to write them down and look at them.
                - Inconvenient for tools that assume one-dimensional communication
                - It's the same story here, that state management tools for tasks (things that have been decided what to do and how to do it) don't fit because they are not designed to support the process of deciding "what to do".
