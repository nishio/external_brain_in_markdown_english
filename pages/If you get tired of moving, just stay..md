title: "If you get tired of moving, just stay."

- If you get tired of [[movement]], just stay.
You can stay, rest, recover, and then move on again.

We have to keep moving." is not always true.
- Can switch between [[mobile lifestyle]] and [[sedentary lifestyle]] depending on the situation.
- This is "moving" at one layer of abstraction.
