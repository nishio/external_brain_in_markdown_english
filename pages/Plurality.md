> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1648559015331241985?s=20): Here comes the Plurality speech by Audrey Tan! It's 7 minutes long and machine-translated with Japanese subtitles, so if you're wondering "What is Plurality? I think it's a good idea to watch this first if you're wondering what is Plurality?
- > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1648572231885402112?s=20): I'm not sure how to translate "plurality" in Japan, but Audrey Tan herself has changed it to "plurality, or collaborative diversity", and I think I can come up with an image-friendly translation like "cooperative diversity". I think we can use "collaborative diversity" or something like that.
- > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1648619205678493696?s=20): collaborative diversity is technology that helps people with diverse values and perspectives work together
