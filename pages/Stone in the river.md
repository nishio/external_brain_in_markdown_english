There are stones in the river [[metaphor]].
- There is no reason why the river should stop just because there are stones.
        - Not strong enough to [[dam]] the [[flow]].
- Just because there are stones in the stream doesn't mean the river has to remove them.
    - There's a little [[friction]], but it [[keeps flowing]].
- Long-term.
    - The stones might [[drift and roll]] a little bit, but they're going to move a little bit and stop.
    - The river may be [[a winding stream]], but it's winding to begin with, so it's not an essential difference.
