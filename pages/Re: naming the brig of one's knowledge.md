title: "Re: naming the brig of one's knowledge"

from [/unnamedcamp/name your knowledge camp](https://scrapbox.io/unnamedcamp/name your knowledge camp).
For example,
    - [[Mind Garden]]
    - [[sweet potato field (Ipomoea batatas)]]
    - [[one's own castle]]
Such as.

By creating such a metaphor, it is possible to go one step further and speculate on what is being done there. We may be able to see what is missing or unnecessary.
- Things like, "It's a field, it needs to be watered," or "It's a castle, it needs repairs."

However, be careful not to be too drawn to the name (metaphor).
- If the gap between what you are actually doing and the metaphor grows, you should expand or modify the metaphor.

- interesting
- Of the three above, I was uncomfortable with the castle, and dare I say it, the garden, but I was also somewhat uncomfortable with that, and after thinking about it for a while, I realized that "all three are outside my body."
- In my case, it's in my own gut.
    - There is a [[dark cave]] and there is a [[subterranean lake]].
    - It's not quite to scale with the real physical body, but it's still pretty wide.
- There [[one flower]] sometimes blooms
    - Unlike [[Field Metaphor]], I don't take much care of the flowers themselves.
    - We need to make sure that the underground lake doesn't dry up or the water doesn't get muddy.
- Unlike a farm, we don't expect to have a regular harvest.
        - [You'll be lucky if it's in bloom.
    - Around here, I don't make a living writing books, so maybe it's more of a hobby.
