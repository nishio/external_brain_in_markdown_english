title: "Landslide Metaphor"
---

As the rain continues to fall, the probability of a gradual [[landslide]] increases.
- When and where it will occur is not clearly foreseeable.
- Small landslides, groundwater eruptions, and other "increasing [[signs]] of danger" can sometimes be felt.

> When and where this will occur is not clearly foreseeable.
- Short time between the appearance of observable signs and the development of a major disaster
- Observable signs" vary depending on the cost of observation.
    - For example, I think that if sensors that show displacement in millimeters are buried at one-meter intervals, it would be possible to predict the occurrence of a landslide five seconds later.
- The rate of [[exponential development]] is too fast for the cost of prevention to be worth it.

relevance
- [[avalanche metaphor]].
