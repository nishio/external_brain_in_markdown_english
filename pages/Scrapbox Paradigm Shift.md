title: "Scrapbox Paradigm Shift"

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1518167225521557505): i think there is no doubt that [[Scrapbox]] is a kind of [[paradigm shift]], something that cannot be explained in one word what Scrapbox is. I can't explain in one word what Scrapbox is. I've been using it alone for a long time, and this past year I started working on a multi-person project, and I feel like there's another paradigm shift. It's like a "conversation without the boundaries of synchronous asynchrony and without the linear constraints of chatting.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1518168523918671872): I guess you could say that the paradigm shift when you are alone is "I can save associative connections and when I am now trying to save associative connections, past associative connections are presented to you"...? Either way, it's a "increase the probability of unplanned gains" kind of thing, so it's hard to communicate to someone who hasn't experienced it.
