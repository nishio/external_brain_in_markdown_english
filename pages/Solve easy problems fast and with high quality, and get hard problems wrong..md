title: "Solve easy problems fast and with high quality, and get hard problems wrong."

[[GPT4]] finishes tasks 25% faster and 40% higher quality, but provides 20% fewer correct solutions to problems that are beyond GPT4's capabilities.
- So the question is, "What can GPT4 do for you?"

> [ai_database](https://twitter.com/ai_database/status/1704002496799384033/photo/1) Performance of intellectual workers using GPT-4 improved across the board, especially "those who were not performing well to begin with" significantly improved significantly...
>  (1) 758 BCG consultants were surveyed.
>  2) The 758 consultants were divided into the following three groups
>  ・without GPT-4
>  ・GPT-4 available
>  ・GPT-4 and prompt engineering training available
>  ③ The experiment was conducted in the following three phases
>  ・Demonstrations and psychological profiling were conducted.
>  ・Rated on performance of multiple tasks
>  ・Interviews were conducted
>
>  ■Report Contents
>  1) The population with GPT-4 was superior in the following ways
>  ・Tasks completed 12.2% more on average
>  ・Tasks completed 25.1% faster on average
>  ・Task quality is 40% higher on average
>  2) A person who did not have good grades to begin with improved remarkably.
>  43% of participants whose average performance was below the threshold were able to improve their own scores
>  (17% of participants above the average performance threshold)
>
>  ■Facts to note
>  When working on tasks considered "beyond the capabilities of GPT-4," participants with GPT-4 were 19% "less likely" to provide the correct solution compared to participants without GPT-4.
>
>  →It can also be interpreted that if you only rely on GPT-4 for advanced tasks, the quality may be lower than usual.
