title: "Assumption that unfairness is unhappiness"
---


- We have to disagree with the idea that [[equality]] and [[chopped burdock root (and sometimes carrot) cooked in sugar and soy sauce]] are good things.
That's because the word "[[injustice]]" is a force that gets in the way of [[100 people, 100 different ways of working]].


- Telework is prevented by [[assumption]] that "everyone needs to be [[chopped burdock root (and sometimes carrot) cooked in sugar and soy sauce]] or everyone will be [[misfortune]]"| Cybozu-style

    - [[Change is unequal, so fairness is important.]]
