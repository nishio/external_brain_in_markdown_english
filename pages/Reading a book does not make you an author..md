Reading a book does not make you an author.
    - [[natural]]

Sometimes people A don't understand this.
- Let's say there is an "amazing person X."
- Mr. A says, "I read Mr. X's book!" and appeals
- Mr. A does not gain any kind of "awesomeness" from it.

...and then I realized that this is "in my value system".
- For example, from the perspective of person B, who feels that "reading Mr. X's book is status", person A will say, "You read Mr. X's book, that's great!
- I guess a community where Mr. A and Mr. B compliment each other on how great they are for reading Mr. X's book could be, well, viable.
    - For me, that community is just [[not for me]].
        - [[incorrect cycle]]

- [[Easy to read without verification.]]
