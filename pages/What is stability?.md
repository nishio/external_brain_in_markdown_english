title: "What is stability?"

> I have been told that I am the opposite of stable, but I think that stability in my mind means that even if I don't find it worthwhile to live in Japan tomorrow, I can survive until the day after tomorrow when I am offered a job abroad.

Perhaps a few decades ago, many people would have considered "belonging to a large company" to be "[[a]] stability. But today's young people know about management failures and large-scale restructuring before they start working. They know that large companies will not survive. Therefore, the idea of "stability" is changing.

People who have always believed that "big companies are stable" and have made choices based on this belief may have difficulty believing that their situation has changed due to [[cognitive dissonance]]. There is a [[normalcy bias]] that the company they belong to will not go bankrupt and they will not be restructured.

I was born in 1981, and at this point in my life, I feel that "a situation in which one's source of income is 100% dependent on one economic entity is unstable, because if that economic entity collapses, you will go with it," and this means that "depending on only one company is unstable. Therefore, I don't get along with people who think that "belonging to a large company will bring stability.
