title: "Who is the resource for?"
---

If R that Mr. A has is [[Resources]] for Mr. B, then R is a resource for Mr. A if Mr. A can [[understand]] it and [[transfer]] R.

Otherwise, Mr. A exists as [[nature]] and Mr. B collects [[natural resources]] from it.


concrete example
- Mr. A makes a picture and program R
- Suppose R is valuable to Mr. B.
- If Mr. A understands that R is valuable to Mr. B and controls the distribution of R, then R is a resource because he can act to get what he wants in exchange for giving R to Mr. B.
- On the other hand, if you release R, for example, under a license that anyone can take for free, you can't "[[control distribution]]".
    - Therefore, B takes R on its own, and there is no binding obligation to demand a return for it.
        - At least in the eyes of the law and capitalist ethics.



I think we've talked about humans and natural resources before.
- There it is.
        - [[Value of Natural Resources]]
