<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamedcamp/nora/icon' alt='/unnamedcamp/nora.icon' height="19.5"/>As an example of my personal use, I have created a project for my diary in Scrapbox and have been creating more and more pages called "yyyymmdd_event". If you ask me whether it is date-based or event-based, it is event-based, but I am very conscious of the date.
- Create a project for your diary in [/noratetsu/Scrapbox](https://scrapbox.io/noratetsu/Scrapbox).
    - Since almost all pages are of the form "yyyymmdd_event", we do not have a situation where there are pages related to a date in a group of pages that have nothing to do with dates.
    - I didn't mention the most important thing, but usually we make multiple pages a day.
        - This "event" is not representative of the day or anything like that, but rather "an event unit page, with a date.

    - Then, [What is a date base?
    - yyyymmdd_event" is an object that contains date information as meta information.
        - What is the difference between this approach and date-based management?
        - The "date_event" method requires that the "event" be verbalized at the time of titling.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamedcamp/nishio/icon' alt='/unnamedcamp/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - If you're trying to keep a record in Scrapbox when you "haven't yet verbalized the events," it's going to be date-based.
            - For example, when you think "Today is an unscheduled holiday and the weather is nice, so let's go for a walk," you can make it "date_walk," or you can make it a "date" page with the event unspecified. It could be "Date_X Considerations" after the fact, after I gloss over what I saw and felt in the course of my walk, or it could be "Date_f" after I find some interesting facility f
            - One line sums it up from [Unnamed experiencing has only date information.
