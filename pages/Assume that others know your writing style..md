- [[One symptom of aging]]
When someone mistakenly thinks that Mr. X wrote something that wasn't written by Mr. X, they make the statement, "I don't have this style of writing."
If you really think everyone knows your writing style, you have a severe cognitive distortion.
Implicitly claiming that "it's normal to know my writing style" undermines psychological safety, and if you're not aware of it, that too suggests cognitive decline.

Isn't it a normal flow of conversation to say, "That's not what I wrote," "I'm sorry, I made a mistake," or "No, no, no, don't worry about it.
