title: "Phenomenon that the chassis version is not seen."

When using impressions as the denominator and displaying the percentage of people who viewed it, "RoboMasterS1 Assembly Video #4 Chassis" was unexpectedly 0.0% of the total impressions.

Cause Consideration
- I don't know what a "chassis" is.
- The "chassis version" doesn't sound very interesting.
- No one watches from episode 4.
- I thought it would be better to know from the title that it was a continuation, but it seems to have had the opposite effect?
