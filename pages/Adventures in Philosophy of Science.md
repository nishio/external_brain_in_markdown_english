    - Adventures in [philosophy of science
    - [[Kazuhisa Todayama]]
- [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2N6abV7)

- It was written in an easy to follow manner from the basics of the philosophy of science.
- The most memorable part was the introduction of the idea that "the truth of science is a [[social construct]].
    - The author's position is against it.
- It was an opportunity for me to think about "[[truth]]," which until then I had vaguely assumed to be self-evident.

- After this, I read [[Introduction to Philosophy]] by [[Geitaro Nishida]].
