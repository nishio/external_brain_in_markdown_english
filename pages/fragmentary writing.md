> Les Essais" or "The Essays" (French: Les Essais) is a collection of 107 essays published by the French moralist [[Michel de Montaigne]] in 1580. [[Montaigne]] invented the essay, [[a form of short, subjective writing on a specific topic]], and this book contains his essays. By reflecting on all human activity in intermittent sentences, Montaigne attempted a frank description of man himself, opening the tradition of moralist literature. The French word essai means "attempt" or "scheme.

- The [[antiphilosophical section]] is a compilation of unpublished notes left by [[Wittgenstein]] after his death.
- Beyond Good and Evil" is a [[literary fragment]] by [[Nietzsche]].
