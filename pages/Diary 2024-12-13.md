> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1867401299714879497) If an AI subscription of $300,000/month is available in two years, what conditions would justify signing up for it, and if you decide that you should sign up for it, what kind of money burden, and what we need to do now to be able to sign the contract.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1867490102194442355) Here's a discussion with o1 Pro on this
    - [[What if we get a $300,000/month AI subscription in 2 years.]]
> [banbiossa](https://x.com/banbiossa/status/1867402756853739979) o1 Super (tentatively named) trial lecture/training session or something like that for companies, and record it as an expense to offset the revenue?
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1867403364604280873) Indeed! That's a good idea.


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1867371096166871368) If the distortions in the talent market are eliminated, it's possible that everyone will start getting paid less every year in their 40s, except for a very few high performers (who won't get hired because of age discrimination. The distortion of continuing to be hired for life is a bigger group than the distortion of not being hired for life).
>  >hamukazu: I think the reason why the system of suddenly lowering salaries for rehiring at age 60 has been maintained is because the human resources market is distorted, and it is difficult to say "I'll go to a place that offers better benefits if I want to" (and people are discriminated against in hiring because of age), but recently I feel the situation is changing little by little. However, I feel that the situation has been changing a little bit recently.
