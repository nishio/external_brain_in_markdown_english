A major turning point seven years ago 7

2011-04 to 2014-09
As a working graduate student
Entered Professional Degree Program in Technology Management, Graduate School of Innovation Management, Tokyo Institute of Technology → Completed

There was a big change in the way I think and see things.

Want to know what I learned?  8

What did you learn in the Technology Management major?
There was a request for more information, but I didn't know how to tell them.

It is difficult to convey what I myself have learned over the past three and a half years in the limited time of about one hour.
→This time, the explanation focuses on the "first step.

![image](https://gyazo.com/6b7c62d425a3769a95a09363469e257b/thumb/1000)
Purpose of this issue 9

-We will make your future life better.
Fruit after 510 years, not today and tomorrow.

-Sow the seeds for it now. Focus on the first step of action and explain it.

-Follow-up for those who want to learn more.

Follow-up Mechanism 10

I have a group on Facebook called "Self-Management Strategies for 180324 Engineers".

I will post the lecture slides to this group later.
Answer questions and post additional information.

Learn something new 11

What is often said in front of a new subject of study
I feel like I should learn, but I just don't have the time."

- [[The parable of the lumberjack]] 　12

The woodcutter said, "Cutting wood is hard work. It's very time consuming, I'm exhausted."
[[traveler]] "You'll get more done if you rest a bit and sharpen your saw blade."
Woodcutter: "I'm so busy cutting I don't have time to sharpen my blade."

Anxiety about new things 13

        - Doing [[What's New.]] is [[anxiety]].
    - Anxious because it is unclear "what will be gained by doing it.
    - Unclear how long it takes to do something new, so there's a lot of mental strain.

Basic strategy: [[Limitation on the amount of loss]] 14
    - Limit losses to small amounts when making investments with uncertain outcomes
    - Bad example: let's understand this whole book.
    - Good example: let's look at this book for 15 minutes first
    - Good example: listen to a one-hour lecture first.
    - →If it's a failure, you only lose an hour.
You all made the decision to listen to the lecture in order to learn about business strategy.

- What is [[management strategy]] 15

Decisions on what to allocate limited resources to #Resource Allocation #Resource Allocation

There are many different definitions, but this time I'm going to delve into one rather than give a broad, shallow explanation.
        - [[strategic safari]]

![image](https://gyazo.com/478294263ebdfffb0f8ab21abccf2591/thumb/1000)
Same for both corporations and individuals 16

limited resources, whether corporate or individual.
The same decisions need to be made about what to allocate to what.

![image](https://gyazo.com/39fce0247f68707caa9a9fccd889fdcc/thumb/1000)

Focus on my personal management 17

- Focus on personal management this time, not corporate.
- It's hard to move big things. Try something small and simple to gain knowledge.
- Learn by experimenting with small code, even in learning programming. [[Small Start]].

Self-Management Strategies for Engineers 18

- "Individual Resource Allocation."
-What do you mean by "resources"?
-In the context of corporate management, it is sometimes called "people, goods, money, and information...

![image](https://gyazo.com/2ee8d9117611ab19c54bc0cde3822acf/thumb/1000)
- [[Doubt the enumeration.]] 　19

- When you see the enumeration, ask, "Is this all of it?" I will ask you.
- When we assume something is not all of it, we unconsciously overlook our options.
- You are all here this time "allocating your time to gain knowledge". In other words, "time" is a resource.

![image](https://gyazo.com/49179a40386b1d5ec0f0a58475af4fa2/thumb/1000)
What do you hope to gain from the allocation 20

- Management decides "what they want to get out of it."
- Profitability, competitiveness, employee satisfaction, ...
- You decide what you want to get out of it.

![image](https://gyazo.com/485017e6e154b428fe01d2a6598c393f/thumb/1000)
You feel knowledge is valuable 21

-in the time it takes to listen to a one-hour lecture,
I could work part-time at a convenience store and get about $1,000.

-you have your own limited "time".
We are here with the decision to allocate to the acquisition of "knowledge."

-In other words, you value knowledge. Be aware of your values and business decisions.

![image](https://gyazo.com/98da1e75f30b6b84c76fa0e467beb41a/thumb/1000)
The difference between knowledge and money 22

- Your "invest in knowledge acquisition" is a sound business decision.

    - [Money is gone when you spend it.

- Time is the "minimum money needed to live."
- Strategy to invest the remaining "spare time" used to acquire knowledge in the acquisition of

ref. Drucker, "[[postcapitalist society]]."

- [[Knowledge Acquisition Strategies]] 　23

Let's verbalize and dig into this.

![image](https://gyazo.com/6b13ad386fb436d972f9f3367b947264/thumb/1000)
Three types of knowledge acquisition 24

- 1: Teaching
- 2: Act on your own
- 3: Create a network for knowledge exchange

Related: Dependence, Independence, Interdependence (7 Habits)

![image](https://gyazo.com/37079bdafdda06f4915365cbc64396b1/thumb/1000)
Learning to be taught 25

knowledge
Teacher→Student

-There is a concentrated burden on the teacher.
-Knowledge flows one way.

Reading a book alone is equivalent to this.

![image](https://gyazo.com/29973a683d7cf586e08ef81538d9c308/thumb/1000)
Learning by Doing It Yourself 26

    - [[action]] → [[environment]] → [[result]]

- Learn by doing [[experiment]] and seeing the results.
- Concentrate the burden on yourself

![image](https://gyazo.com/b1facccf1ae92f5597555c3c2a488f64/thumb/1000)
Learning from the Consequences of Actions 27

    - [[PDCA cycle]] :
Do and learn by checking the results.

    - [[Lean Startup]]
Make minimal product quickly and learn from customer response

- How Programmers Learn:.
Write a program, run/compile it, and learn from the results.

![image](https://gyazo.com/d677d2db4f095246399bb5cbb5c16724/thumb/1000)
- [[Learning through the exchange of knowledge]] 　28

        - [[Knowledge flows both ways.]]
    - The burden is distributed

![image](https://gyazo.com/b59abada9e53f66a301393cc252ef3a5/thumb/1000)
- [[Learn from those with little knowledge.]]

![image](https://gyazo.com/25fb56047185e7d31b1fda4ce9697c06/thumb/1000)
- [[Knowledge Exchange Requirements]] = Know differently than the other party 30

Learning the same things as those around you does not allow you to exchange knowledge.
- [[Learning the same things as everyone else does not exchange knowledge.]]
#Knowledge distribution map

#Competitive Advantage
- Seller's advantage Your advantage
------------------------------------------------------------
- Buyer advantage You disadvantage

ref. [[Five Forces Analysis]] by [[Michael Porter]].

![image](https://gyazo.com/54b0efe45948890311b6ec769f9d9802/thumb/1000)
- Enter from [[school (position) hard to enter (get)]] 32
    - Many people try to learn what most people around them say is important when they ask, "What should I learn?" and many people try to learn what many people say is important...
    - Enter through the narrow gate. For great is the gate that leads to destruction, and many enter through it." *
    - Investing limited time in "what many are learning" is unlikely to lead to a [[competitive edge]].
    - ([[Market development costs]] have the advantage of being low.)
*Matthew 7:13

![image](https://gyazo.com/51184bb839b132ac631cb3dccd7ed68f/thumb/1000)
Create an exchange partner outside the company 33

-Requisite for exchange of knowledge: "I know differently than the other person."
-Tend to share knowledge with others in the company
-It is easy to have a "knowledge exchange relationship" with people from different companies, different industries, etc., who are in different positions.

![image](https://gyazo.com/c84e53b6dab22c234c93281b2adfcd7f/thumb/1000)
Participation in outside study groups 34

It's halfway realized in the form of a study group.

-Exchange of knowledge with people in different positions ◎
-Temporary groups only during study sessions x
-Presenters are doing most of the information dissemination and not knowledge exchange. x

→We want to make it more sustainable and interactive.

![image](https://gyazo.com/52650b9edd0174a80b6037cb319281e3/thumb/1000)
Networking for knowledge exchange 35

-A place for interactive and sustained communication for efficient knowledge acquisition
-Want a companion in the relationship to understand each other's situation and give each other knowledge.
-The first step to that:.
Create a small informal group and you become the originator.

Here's an explanation of why this is a good idea

![image](https://gyazo.com/a2020042befe92b2d7733e43554b1c45/thumb/1000)
I'll explain this first. 36

Create a small informal group and you become the originator.

![image](https://gyazo.com/b7e004d1e2d06e1dec78bd3438609eec/thumb/1000)
Why a small group?　 37

-The word "group" or "community" tends to conjure up images of something big with lots of people.
-this is because the larger ones are easier to observe*.
-Being big has its disadvantages.

*There are a lot of smaller ones, but most of them are not in your field of vision.

![image](https://gyazo.com/33b0f7d38429a8eb12cde5fc2c2ba944/thumb/1000)
Example of answering a question 38

- Larger groups separate words from [[situation]].
- If there were a myriad of questioners, I wouldn't be able to spend time understanding the questioner's situation.
- Responding to the questioner's words without understanding the questioner's situation
ref.  [[Situation-embedded learning]]

![image](https://gyazo.com/0a7455fa04e550abfb63f743caff23d8/thumb/1000)
Benefits of Situational Understanding1 39

    - Compare when respondents understand (do/do not) what and how much the questioner knows
    - The cost of answering the question will be reduced, and the probability that the respondent will be able to provide what the questioner was truly seeking will be increased.
    - Efficient knowledge exchange

![image](https://gyazo.com/c8a5b66df2b7c90064f8554b96cb41a8/thumb/1000)
Benefits of Situational Understanding 2 40

- When Mr. A consulted me about X.
Connecting Mr. A and Mr. B, remembering that "Mr. B looked up X before."
- This requires an understanding of "Mr. B"
- This "mediation" facilitates two-way knowledge exchange.

![image](https://gyazo.com/60a43f3869ff7a2d1337a3784719a0f0/thumb/1000)
Place gate 41

- One useful means of creating a small group: put up gates (limit who can join).
- What is the difference between not gated (anyone can join) and gated?
#Gated Communities

![image](https://gyazo.com/989bc51918c25e7535f6a2b1cec8b874/thumb/1000)
Generation of free riders 42

- Suppose there was a beneficial group without gates.
- People are attracted by the usefulness of the product.
- Most people come to "take" and not act to "give" to the group.
- Most "takers" eat up limited resources.

Information sharing is exceptional, whether the number of people taking it is 10 or 100.
Since the cost of the informant does not increase, it can still be done in such a situation.
ref. [[Tragedy of Common Land]]

![image](https://gyazo.com/688afeaf9f873016eedd8022bebad377/thumb/1000)
Duality of the OSS community 43

    - [[dual community]] to solve this problem.
    - Free to enter user community but not free to become a committer
    - Only those who have engaged in "giving" activities to enrich the place within that community will be selected to enter the gate.

Let's take a look at this.

![image](https://gyazo.com/af0e5eeaf287508649791604faf49b89/thumb/1000)
Description so far 44
Create a small informal group and you become the originator.

![image](https://gyazo.com/d9c5e840a5879a4efd52b6a33578c68d/thumb/1000)
Description from here 45
Create a small informal group and you become the originator.

![image](https://gyazo.com/27b18b969c99d9b5570847ccabeb87e2/thumb/1000)
Why create your own group 46

-a group created by someone else.
The chances of it being a "you can get in, and it's not a big group" situation are very small.
-If it takes the form of a private group, you will not even be aware of its existence.
-so you have to make it yourself.

![image](https://gyazo.com/b26820de5eee311eabbe6a7d52143e56/thumb/1000)
It is better to start out quietly and informally 47

-There are many hurdles to overcome when trying to build a solid organization from the start.
-Start Small!
-If you start quietly, it acts as a gate in and of itself.

![image](https://gyazo.com/53fbe93a5c9cd5833c6fd9f4ac28e54f/thumb/1000)
To make it a mutually beneficial community 48

-First, you do the "giving" side.
-Give & Take starts with Give.
-First, tell other members what you saw and heard at this event, etc.
Start by "providing information that other members don't have."
-If the other members give, it's a great success!

![image](https://gyazo.com/f90785d6b5e8723cce2a0237dd5776ab/thumb/1000)
The Next Step 49

-Create a small informal group and you will be the originator.
-Multiple group affiliations
-Set the recall trigger

![image](https://gyazo.com/ba8274cf78ad8a994be1016b060612d4/thumb/1000)
Why multiple groups? 　50

-Belonging to several groups with different members makes you a flowing pipeline of knowledge.
-Knowledge, unlike water, accumulates in intermediaries.

![image](https://gyazo.com/c09ee91935040d33f2d5de8ef88407ae/thumb/1000)
Creating Value through Intermediation 51

-Transmitting the knowledge you've gained in Group A to Group B, which is hungry for that knowledge.
Group B people are happy = customer value creation
-Practical experience in brokerage will develop your ability to judge what is worth brokering.
-Mediating information that can be googled and obtained does not lead to value.

Supplementary from the question [[Copying answers is futile.]].

Benefits of belonging to a number of organizations 52

Knowledge exchange requires you to have knowledge that those around you do not have
That there is more than one "perimeter"?

![image](https://gyazo.com/a915a6869326ff5adb2609b12d85577f/thumb/1000)
Knowledge exchange is possible in each organization 53

Give me this and take this.
Repeat this...

![image](https://gyazo.com/d62fa810ec8f4f0cc63cfb66d4de6b50/thumb/1000)
Human resources with knowledge of multiple fields 54
Also called "[[Serial Specialist]]" or "[[pi-type human resources]]".

![image](https://gyazo.com/f759dba82565e9da6daed47e46653f99/thumb/1000)
55
Q: But I often hear that "developing expertise is important"?

![image](https://gyazo.com/6af9c5d47f1e3628a07862e3637f9cb8/thumb/1000)

- [[Sea level rise due to technological progress]] 　56

The level of "readily available knowledge" (at sea level) has increased a lot over the past 10 years due to technological advances.

We need to get above this sea level to participate in the knowledge exchange.
That's why they say it's important to develop expertise.

![image](https://gyazo.com/6a441f7bbbd66a9f5016b94050033610/thumb/1000)
Level of expertise 57

But this term "expertise" is vague and it is not clear to what extent it should be done.
Need to have knowledge that is not available by Googling in order to face out of the sea surface.

- It's a much lower hurdle than the word "expertise" might suggest.

![image](https://gyazo.com/20870e9d64d84b13eeafa9db59b64e3f/thumb/1000)
Like two wheels on a car 58

Act and gain knowledge
- Obtain non-Googleable knowledge through action and experimentation.

Exchange knowledge with others
- Give them knowledge they can't Google, and they'll get different knowledge.

![image](https://gyazo.com/0c73c40dd3353805c448d1114ccf5f71/thumb/1000)
The Next Step 59

    - Create a small informal group and you become the originator.
    - Belong to multiple groups
    - Set the recall trigger

![image](https://gyazo.com/66919949d05a00ebdb3f709745e48ae0/thumb/1000)
Why trigger? 　60

- Sometimes the value is known after time has passed*.
- Long-term memory is more likely to stick if you touch it again after you've forgotten it for about six months or a year.
- The group is high-spirited and active right after it is formed, but it usually becomes a three-day group.

So I'll remind you when time goes by and you've forgotten.

*I was asked immediately after I completed my MOT, "How did your studies help you?" I was asked, "How did it help you?" I answered, "It broadened my perspective," "The book I was writing helped me make different decisions than I had made before," etc. The response was something like, "Hmm.
Supplement: [[be well-spoken]] [[Rushing to output results in a degraded copy.]]

![image](https://gyazo.com/7b7fbc556a9dac6f9a32f1347018c545/thumb/1000)
Trigger after 1 year 61

- No postings, no postings, no notifications,
No one reminds me of that group, so I don't post, and so the cycle goes
- Submissions may bring it back to life again.
- Use "it's been a year" as an excuse to post

![image](https://gyazo.com/33d1835c3efa1c8ade8eabfccc79d539/thumb/1000)
Filtering after 1 year 62

- When there are more free riders
- Gather [[Giver]] to create a new "enrichment group" after a year of activity.
- If more people think the enriched group is better, activities will take place there and the old group will disappear naturally.

Informal groups are not only cheaper to create, but also cheaper to terminate because they can die out naturally.

![image](https://gyazo.com/dca755d4dd307a0c16d80563492b3b89/thumb/1000)
Opportunities for review 63

- Many things can go wrong.
- Not just forgetting about it when what we set out to do does not work,
Looking back a year later, we can learn a great deal.
- However, people forget easily, so set a trigger to remind them when you start the project.

Summary 64

![image](https://gyazo.com/5c53f2ce86ca1321d3eeb6b47829dbc0/thumb/1000)
Your own management 65

- You made a business decision to "invest time in gaining knowledge".
- You make these kinds of resource allocation decisions day after day, and this is management.
- There is also an emphasis on knowledge acquisition in business administration, and there are many discussions and findings.

Your own knowledge acquisition strategy 66

- There are three types of learning: "taught" and "learning by doing," which many of us have probably already experienced.
- Often overlooked is "knowledge exchange.
- In order to do this, we need associates in a relationship where we understand each other's situation and give each other knowledge. How do we create this?

![image](https://gyazo.com/5bfd2f529bd7c538e99656ef034b4590/thumb/1000)
First Steps 67

- First, create a small informal group and you become the originator.
- Belong to multiple groups and become a conduit through which knowledge flows
- Set a recall trigger and look back a year later

A major turning point 7 years ago 7

2011-04 to 2014-09
As a working graduate student
Entered professional degree program in Technology Management, Graduate School of Innovation Management, Tokyo Institute of Technology → Completed

There was a big change in the way I think and how I see things.

Want to know what I learned?  8

What did you learn in the Technology Management major?
There were requests for details, but I didn't know how to tell them.

It is difficult to convey what I myself learned over three and a half years in a limited time of about one hour.
→This time, I'll focus on the "first step" and explain it.

![image](https://gyazo.com/6b7c62d425a3769a95a09363469e257b/thumb/1000)
Objective 9

-To improve your life in the future.
Not today, not tomorrow, but 510 years from now.

-Sow the seeds for this now. Focusing on the first step of action.

-Follow-up for those who want to learn more.

![image](https://gyazo.com/41b09535dac1c59303225b1f38450bf3/thumb/1000)
How follow-up works 10

I've created a group on Facebook called "Self-Management Strategies for 180324 Engineers".

I will post the lecture slides to this group later.
Answer questions, post additional information, etc.

Learning something new 11

What is often said in front of a new subject to learn?
'I feel like I should learn, but I don't have time.'

[[Parable of the woodcutter]] 12

The parable of the woodcutter: "Cutting down a tree is hard work. It takes so much time, I'm exhausted."
The traveler: "You'll get more done if you take a break and sharpen your saw blade.
The woodsman: "I'm too busy cutting to have time to sharpen the blade."

Anxiety about new things 13

    - I'm [[anxious]] to do [[something new]].
    - I'm anxious because I'm unclear about what I'll get out of it.
    - Mental strain because it's unclear how long it will take to do something new.

Basic strategy:[[Limit the amount of loss]] 14
    - When making investments with uncertain outcomes, limit losses to a small amount.
    - Bad example: I want to understand everything in this book.
    - Good example: Let's look at this book for 15 minutes first.
    - Good example: I'll listen to an hour-long lecture first.
    - →Even if it's a failure, you've just lost an hour.
You have made a decision to listen to a lecture to learn about business strategy.
- ref. [[Real Options]].

What is [[business strategy]] 15

Decision making on what to allocate limited resources to #Resource allocation #Resource allocation

There are a multitude of definitions, but this time we're going to delve into one point instead of explaining it broadly and shallowly.
    - [[Strategy Safari]]

![image](https://gyazo.com/478294263ebdfffb0f8ab21abccf2591/thumb/1000)
Same for corporations and individuals 16

Whether you are a corporation or an individual, you have limited resources.
It is the same for both corporations and individuals.

![image](https://gyazo.com/39fce0247f68707caa9a9fccd889fdcc/thumb/1000)

Focus on your own personal management 17

- This time, I'm focusing on my personal management, not a corporation.
- It is difficult to run something big. Try something small and simple to gain knowledge.
- Even in learning programming, learn by experimenting with small code. [[Start small]].

![image](https://gyazo.com/a6e6ab83c7077d72597367950f1c4979/thumb/1000)
Self-Management Strategies for Engineers 18

- "Personal Resource Allocation".
-What do you mean by "resources"?
-[] [] [] [] [] [] []

![image](https://gyazo.com/2ee8d9117611ab19c54bc0cde3822acf/thumb/1000)
[[Doubt the enumeration]] 19

- When you see an enumeration, ask, "Is this all there is?" When you see an enumeration, ask, "Is this everything?
- If you assume that something that is not the whole is the whole, you will unconsciously overlook the options.
- You are here because you have allocated time to acquire knowledge. In other words, "time" is a resource.

![image](https://gyazo.com/49179a40386b1d5ec0f0a58475af4fa2/thumb/1000)
What do you want to get out of your allocation?

- What you want to get out of it is determined by management.
- Profitability, competitiveness, employee satisfaction, ...
- You decide what you want to get out of it.

![image](https://gyazo.com/485017e6e154b428fe01d2a6598c393f/thumb/1000)
You perceive the value of knowledge.

-In the time it takes to listen to an hour-long lecture.
I could work part-time at a convenience store and get about $1,000.

-You allocate your limited "time" to the acquisition of "knowledge.
You are here because you made the decision to allocate your limited "time" to the acquisition of "knowledge.

-That is, you value knowledge. Be aware of your values and business decisions.

![image](https://gyazo.com/98da1e75f30b6b84c76fa0e467beb41a/thumb/1000)
The Difference Between Knowledge and Money 22

- Your "investing in the acquisition of knowledge" is a good business decision.

- [[Money is lost when you spend it]], but knowledge is not lost when you spend it.

- If you use your time to acquire the "minimum amount of money needed to live
- The strategy is to invest the remaining "spare time" in the acquisition of knowledge.

ref. Drucker, "[[Post-Capitalist Society]]"

[[Knowledge Acquisition Strategy]] 23

Let's verbalize this and dig deeper.

![image](https://gyazo.com/6b13ad386fb436d972f9f3367b947264/thumb/1000)
Three types of knowledge acquisition 24

- 1: Ask to be taught
- 2: Act on your own
- 3: Create a network of knowledge exchange

Related: Dependence, Independence, Interdependence (7 Habits)

![image](https://gyazo.com/37079bdafdda06f4915365cbc64396b1/thumb/1000)
Learning to be taught 25

Knowledge
Teacher → Student

-The burden is concentrated on the teacher
-The flow of knowledge is one-way

Reading a book by yourself is equivalent to this

![image](https://gyazo.com/29973a683d7cf586e08ef81538d9c308/thumb/1000)
Learning through self-initiated action 26

- [[Action]] → [[Environment]] → [[Result]].

- Learning through action and experimentation and seeing the results
- Burden is concentrated on oneself

![image](https://gyazo.com/b1facccf1ae92f5597555c3c2a488f64/thumb/1000)
Learn from the results of your actions 27

- [[PDCA Cycle]]:
Learn by doing and checking the results

- [[Lean Startup]].
Build a minimal product quickly and learn from customer response

- How Programmers Learn:
Write a program, run/compile it and learn from the results

![image](https://gyazo.com/d677d2db4f095246399bb5cbb5c16724/thumb/1000)
[Learning by knowledge exchange.

    - [[knowledge flows in both directions]]
    - Burden is distributed.

![image](https://gyazo.com/b59abada9e53f66a301393cc252ef3a5/thumb/1000)

[[You can learn from people with little knowledge.]]

![image](https://gyazo.com/25fb56047185e7d31b1fda4ce9697c06/thumb/1000)
[[necessary condition for knowledge exchange]]=knowing different things from others 30

Learning the same things as those around you will not enable you to exchange knowledge.
[[Learning the same things as those around you does not make you capable of knowledge exchange]]
#Distribution of knowledge.

![image](https://gyazo.com/7ad741005bd9d9108661842ca5394515/thumb/1000)
The more people offering the same thing, the weaker the provider's position becomes 31

#Competitive advantage
- Seller advantage You advantage
------------------------------------------------------------
- Buyer's advantage Your disadvantage

ref.[[Michael Porter]]'s [[Five Forces Analysis]]

![image](https://gyazo.com/54b0efe45948890311b6ec769f9d9802/thumb/1000)
[Enter through the "narrow gate.
    - I asked around, "What do I need to learn?" Many people ask, "What should I learn?" and try to learn what everyone else says is important...
    - Many people ask, "What should I learn? For the gate that leads to destruction is great, and many enter through it." * *
    - Investing your limited time in "what many are learning" is unlikely to lead to [[competitive advantage]].
    - (There is the advantage of low [[market development costs]].)
*Matthew 7:13.

![image](https://gyazo.com/51184bb839b132ac631cb3dccd7ed68f/thumb/1000)
Create an external exchange partner 33

-Requirements for knowledge exchange: "I know different things than they do."
-Tend to share knowledge with people in your company.
-If you are from a different company, different industry, etc., you can easily have a "knowledge exchange relationship".

![image](https://gyazo.com/c84e53b6dab22c234c93281b2adfcd7f/thumb/1000)
Participate in external study groups 34

Half of them are realized in the form of study groups.

-Exchange of knowledge with people in different positions
-Temporary group during the study session x
-The presenter does most of the information dissemination, so it is not a knowledge exchange.

→I want to create something more sustainable and interactive.

![image](https://gyazo.com/52650b9edd0174a80b6037cb319281e3/thumb/1000)
Creating a network for knowledge exchange 35

-A place for two-way and continuous communication for efficient knowledge acquisition
-We want a group of people in a relationship who understand each other's situation and give each other knowledge.
-The first step towards this:
The first step: create a small informal group and be your own transmitter.

I'll explain why this is a good idea here

![image](https://gyazo.com/a2020042befe92b2d7733e43554b1c45/thumb/1000)
I'll explain here first.

Create a small informal group and you become the originator.

![image](https://gyazo.com/b7e004d1e2d06e1dec78bd3438609eec/thumb/1000)
Why small groups?　 37

-The words "group" and "community" tend to conjure up images of something big with lots of people.
-This is because larger groups are easier to observe.
-There are disadvantages to being large.

*There are many small ones, but most of them are not in your field of vision

![image](https://gyazo.com/33b0f7d38429a8eb12cde5fc2c2ba944/thumb/1000)
Example of answering the question 38

- If the group is large, the words and [[the situation]] are disconnected
- If there are countless people asking questions, you can't spend time understanding the questioner's situation
- Responding to the questioner's words without understanding the questioner's situation
ref. [[Learning embedded in the situation]].

![image](https://gyazo.com/0a7455fa04e550abfb63f743caff23d8/thumb/1000)
Benefits of situational understanding1 39

    - Comparing when the respondent understands (does/doesn't) what and how much the questioner knows
    - Decreases the cost of answering and increases the probability that the respondent can provide what the questioner really wanted.
    - Efficient knowledge exchange

![image](https://gyazo.com/c8a5b66df2b7c90064f8554b96cb41a8/thumb/1000)
Benefits of understanding the situation 2 40

- When Mr. A asks me for advice about X, I say
When Mr. A asks me about X, I remember, "Mr. B did some research on X before," and connect Mr. A and Mr. B.
- This requires an understanding of "Mr. B".
- This "intermediary" facilitates a two-way exchange of knowledge.

![image](https://gyazo.com/60a43f3869ff7a2d1337a3784719a0f0/thumb/1000)
Putting up a gate 41

- One useful way to create a small group: place a gate (limit who can join)
- What's the difference between not having a gate (anyone can join) and having a gate?
#gatedcommunity

![image](https://gyazo.com/989bc51918c25e7535f6a2b1cec8b874/thumb/1000)
Generation of free riders 42

- Suppose there is a useful group without a gate
- People are attracted by the usefulness
- Most people come to "take" and do not "give" to the group
- Most "takers" will eat up the limited resources available.

Information sharing is the exception, whether there are 10 or 100 takers
It's a tragedy of the commons.
ref.[[The Tragedy of the Common Ground]].

![image](https://gyazo.com/688afeaf9f873016eedd8022bebad377/thumb/1000)
Duality of the OSS community 43

    - The solution to this problem [[dual community]].
    - You are free to join the user community, but you are not free to become a committer.
    - Only those who have done "giving" activities to enrich the place within the community are selected to enter the gate.

Let's take a look at this

![image](https://gyazo.com/af0e5eeaf287508649791604faf49b89/thumb/1000)
Explanation so far 44
Create a small informal group and you become the transmitter.

![image](https://gyazo.com/d9c5e840a5879a4efd52b6a33578c68d/thumb/1000)
Instructions from here 45
Create a small informal group and you become the originator.

![image](https://gyazo.com/27b18b969c99d9b5570847ccabeb87e2/thumb/1000)
Why create your own group?

- "If someone has created a group that
46 - The chances of someone creating a group that you can join and that is not too large are very small.
-If it's in the form of a private group, you won't even know it exists.
-So, you have to create your own.

![image](https://gyazo.com/b26820de5eee311eabbe6a7d52143e56/thumb/1000)
You can start out quietly and informally.

-There are too many hurdles if you try to build a solid organization from the beginning.
-Start small!
-Starting quietly can act as a gate in itself.

![image](https://gyazo.com/53fbe93a5c9cd5833c6fd9f4ac28e54f/thumb/1000)
To make it a mutually beneficial community 48

-You have to be the "giver" first.
-Give & Take starts with Give.
-Begin by telling other members what you saw and heard at this event.
Give & Take starts with giving - Start by telling other members what you saw and heard at the event.
-If other members give, you've succeeded!

![image](https://gyazo.com/f90785d6b5e8723cce2a0237dd5776ab/thumb/1000)
Next Step 49

-Create a small informal group and be the originator.
-Belong to more than one group
-Set a reminder trigger.

![image](https://gyazo.com/ba8274cf78ad8a994be1016b060612d4/thumb/1000)
Why multiple groups? 　50

-Belonging to multiple groups with different members makes you a pipe for knowledge to flow through.
-Knowledge, unlike water, can accumulate in intermediaries.

![image](https://gyazo.com/c09ee91935040d33f2d5de8ef88407ae/thumb/1000)
Value creation through intermediation 51

-Transmit the knowledge you gained in Group A to Group B, who is hungry for that knowledge.
People in Group B will be happy = customer value creation
-By gaining practical experience in mediation, you will develop the ability to determine what is worth mediation.
-Mediating on information that can be obtained by Googling does not lead to value.

Supplementing from Questions [[Copying the answers is futile]].

![image](https://gyazo.com/47ec3df31da51f32f316a83de24f7979/thumb/1000)
Benefits of belonging to an organization of numbers 52

Knowledge exchange requires that you have knowledge that others do not have
What if there is more than one of these "surroundings"?

![image](https://gyazo.com/a915a6869326ff5adb2609b12d85577f/thumb/1000)
Knowledge exchange is possible in each organization 53

Give this, get that.
If you repeat this...

![image](https://gyazo.com/d62fa810ec8f4f0cc63cfb66d4de6b50/thumb/1000)
Human resources who know more than one field 54
Also known as "continuum specialists" or "pi people."

![image](https://gyazo.com/f759dba82565e9da6daed47e46653f99/thumb/1000)
55
Q: But I often hear that "it's important to develop your expertise"?

![image](https://gyazo.com/6af9c5d47f1e3628a07862e3637f9cb8/thumb/1000)

[[Sea level rise due to technological progress]] 56

With the advancement of technology, the level of "readily available knowledge" (sea level) is much higher than it was 10 years ago.

We need to be above this sea level to participate in knowledge exchange.
That's why they say it's important to develop expertise.

![image](https://gyazo.com/6a441f7bbbd66a9f5016b94050033610/thumb/1000)
Level of Expertise 57

But this word "expertise" is vague, and it's not clear to what level we should go.
To emerge from the surface of the ocean, we need to have knowledge that is not available by Googling.

- It's a much lower hurdle than the word "expertise" implies.

![image](https://gyazo.com/20870e9d64d84b13eeafa9db59b64e3f/thumb/1000)
Like two wheels of a car 58

Gaining knowledge through action
- Gaining knowledge that cannot be googled through action and experimentation

Exchange knowledge with others
- Give knowledge that can't be googled, get knowledge from another

![image](https://gyazo.com/0c73c40dd3353805c448d1114ccf5f71/thumb/1000)
Next step 59

    - Create a small informal group and you become the originator
    - Belong to more than one group
    - Set a reminder trigger.

![image](https://gyazo.com/66919949d05a00ebdb3f709745e48ae0/thumb/1000)
Why triggers? 　60

- Sometimes we understand value after time has passed*.
- Long-term memories are more likely to stick if you touch them again after six months or a year of forgetting.
- When you first start a group, you are very excited and active, but it usually lasts three days.

That's why I remind them when time has passed and they have forgotten.

*When people ask me right after completing MOT, "How did it help you? I replied, "It broadened my horizons" and "I made different decisions based on the book I wrote.
Addendum: [[The word is ripe]] [[Haste in output leads to degraded copy]].

![image](https://gyazo.com/7b7fbc556a9dac6f9a32f1347018c545/thumb/1000)
Triggered after one year 61

- No posts, no notifications because there are no posts.
No one remembers the group, so they don't post, and the cycle
- Sometimes a post brings it back to life again.
- Use "it's been a year" as an excuse to post

![image](https://gyazo.com/33d1835c3efa1c8ade8eabfccc79d539/thumb/1000)
Filtering after a year 62

- When you have a lot of free riders
- Create a new "enrichment group" with Givers based on one year of activity
- If there are more people who think the enriched group is better, the activity will take place in that group, and the old group will disappear naturally.

Unofficial groups are not only cheaper to create, but also cheaper to terminate because they can disappear spontaneously.

Opportunities for Review 63

Your own knowledge acquisition strategy 66

- There are three types of learning: "learning by teaching" and "learning by doing".
- What is often overlooked is "knowledge exchange".
- In order to do this, you need a group of people who understand each other's situation and give each other knowledge. How do we create them?
