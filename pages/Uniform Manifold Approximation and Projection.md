title: "Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection"

> Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection ([[UMAP]]) is a [[dimension reduction]] technique that can be used for visualisation similarly to [[t-SNE]], but also for general non-linear dimension reduction. The algorithm is founded on three assumptions about the data:
- >  The data is uniformly distributed on a Riemannian manifold;
- >  The Riemannian metric is locally constant (or can be approximated as such);
- >  The manifold is locally connected.
>  From these assumptions it is possible to model the manifold with a fuzzy topological structure. The embedding is found by searching for a low dimensional projection of the data that has the closest possible equivalent fuzzy topological structure.
