title: "The idea is the originality"
---

> Umesao is said to be just a [[mere]] idea.
> If you ask me, [[idea]] is the [[originality]] and the [[originality]] is the [[originality]].
> Anything that doesn't come to mind is, in essence, a [[reference]] to a book, an [[imitation]] of a person.
> What is that [[just an idea]]? ...
>  [[Come up with an idea if you're frustrated]]
