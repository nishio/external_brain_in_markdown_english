> It is very likely that the "Data Sharing Incentive (free tokens)" is enabled due to recent changes. Projects with this turned on will have the tokens in the daily quota listed in Usage but the Cost will be $0 (reset daily at 00:00 UTC = 09:00 JST). The target models are 4o/4.1/o1/o3/5 series, etc. Depending on the account, a free quota of up to **1M/day (10M/day for mini series)** will be attached to the account. To check, go to "Organization → Data controls" and look at the "Free daily tokens" indicator.

Cosense's automatic English translation, this is fine (nothing wrong with it since it was originally public information and the translated version will also be made public).
