    - In modern times, they'd tell you not to use "black" to mean "bad."

I really feel that Yoshiyuki Tomino's greatness lies in the fact that he drew a vision of the future around the 1990s, in which "as a result of a centralized political system that is in shambles, the frontier regions will start a war of independence with aristocracy, new religions, and other prehistoric concepts, destabilizing the entire world".

In the early 90's, we were dreaming of a future where the Cold War had ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the European Union had been officially established, and we could continue to move step by step toward a wonderful society where all human beings are brothers and sisters, even though there were still many problems.

I guess that's the bottomless pit of it all.
