title: "cheating on area"
---

- My wife says, "I feel like I'm being cheated nicely," after watching the video about the surface area of a sphere, "What is the definition of '[[area]]' for an area on a curved surface that cannot be extended flat?" I think it is correct to say that I feel cheated because it is too much trouble to explain the foundation of the question, "What is the definition of 'area' on a curved surface that cannot be extended flat?
- Historically, [[Leibniz (German newspaper)]] and others brought in the concept of "[[infinitesimal]]" and created calculus without thinking about the details, and after the excitement of "Wow, this is useful, this is great! But what is this infinitesimal?
- Calculus was established around 1700, and [[Weierstrass.]] established the reason why we can do [[limit]] calculations as [[epsilon-delta calculus]] around 1860, so mankind has been doing calculus for about 160 years because it's convenient, even though we don't know much about it. I don't know why, but it's convenient.
