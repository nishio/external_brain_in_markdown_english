### Hammerspoon
 is an open source automation tool that runs on macOS and allows you to control various parts of the system with the scripting language Lua, making it easy to

- Control window position and size
- Automation of launching specific applications, opening URLs, etc.
- Hook and customize keyboard and mouse events

Although similar processing is possible in Python and other languages, the advantage is that it can be implemented simply and with relatively little code, since functions such as macOS integration and window manipulation are standard in Hammerspoon.
