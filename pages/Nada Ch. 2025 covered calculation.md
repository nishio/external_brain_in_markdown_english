If you give a problem to [[o3-mini-high]], it will give you the correct answer in a minute and a half. However, it only writes down the answer without explaining the solution.
So I attempted to see if I could give an explanation of how I solved the problem.

Conclusion.
- It took me a minute and a half to find a solution that satisfied the conditions, but it was not easy to explain it logically.
- It is not at all possible, especially to prove that it is the only solution.
- To begin with, the current LLM is taught in a way that "output the solution that seems most probable and score points if it is correct.
    - After finding a candidate solution by feeling and verifying that it is a solution by performing a calculation, it is time to output.
    - Further argumentation is not necessary to get a high score, so it is not trained, and therefore its ability is not as high as expected.
    - Therefore, even if you ask them to write a proof, they will say, "To give a concrete example," and then behave in such a way as not covering the conditional branch or making a feeling judgment like, "It is highly likely that ..." and it will not work as a proof.

So the problem is that "8 numbers 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0" correspond to A to H in order A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H all consist of different numbers. The problem is to consider "1ABC2" as a 5-digit number, and the quotient divided by D is the 4-digit number "EFGH." You need to understand how A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H are arranged and proceed with the calculation.

The condition is that "1ABC2" is a 5-digit integer, which when divided by D yields the quotient 4-digit "EFGH", where D is the fourth of 8 digits, i.e. D is one of a group of numbers arranged in the order A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. From the 8 numbers "3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0" we choose A to H and this number The first and last "1" and the second "2" are the numbers "1", "2", and "3". The key to the problem is how to assign the remaining numbers using the first and last "1" and "2".

Notice that the quotient of "1ABC2" divided by D is "EFGH." First, D is one of the numbers {3,4,5,6,7,8,9} except 0. The quotient "EFGH" is a 4-digit integer. The quotient is also based on the order of the numbers, and it must be determined which numbers are assigned to A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. After detailed calculations and ranges, the quotient is adjusted to the appropriate 4-digit number.

The last digit of the quotient "EFGH" must be 4. This is one factor to consider for the combination of D and H. Also, the quotient "EFGH" is a 4-digit integer that must be multiplied with D to obtain the result, and the combination of D and H must ensure that "3 * X" is 1ABC2. For example, if D=3 and H=4, try and list several candidates for X that satisfy this condition. Overall, we proceed with the long calculations in the order in which they are performed.

After checking various candidates, I am wondering about constraints regarding the end of the quotient "EFGH" and checking for combinations of D and H. I am trying each candidate, e.g. D=3, H=4 or D=9, H=8, etc., and calculating and thinking about the structure of the multiplication and the numbers that can be excluded from the candidate set of numbers. In particular, I need to work out the constraints associated with integer division by quotient and remainder.

We are in the process of narrowing down the numbers to use for A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. In particular, we are deciding on combinations of A, B, and C and then checking to see if the quotient and remainder fit the requirements. At this stage, we are trying several combinations to find the quotient's divisor, while at the same time being confused on how we should handle the remainder numbers. There is still a lot of trial and error to be done in order to deepen our understanding.

X must be between 1250 and 2499 and the last digit must be 4. Therefore, the candidate X must be chosen to be a combination of the numbers {0,3,5,6,7,9}, with the last digit being 4, and further multiplied by 8, resulting in the form 1ABC2. Furthermore, we are in the process of finding the appropriate X, making sure that the digits and the first digit of the resulting number of this 8 x X is 1.

Now X must be between 3000 and 3999 and the result multiplied by 4 must fall between 10000 and 19999. Furthermore, the thousandths place of X is 3. The remaining F and G are chosen from S, and A, B, and C are the three extra numbers. Based on these conditions, the appropriate X must be chosen. After calculation, the final number is checked for consistency to be in the form 1ABC2.

We are in the process of calculating Y = 4*X, considering the form X = 3FG8. Calculations are being made for each candidate, and the numbers in Y are being adjusted to match the order. However, in some pairs, the same numbers are duplicated and the results do not match the requirements; the combination of F and G must be chosen carefully.

Within X = 3FG4, we have tried the case D=3, H=4 and checked the value of X and the result of 3 * X. Several pairs produced repeated numbers, so they are rejected. Finally, we need to make sure that the quotient of X satisfies the conditions. In particular, we are checking that the quotient is 4-digit and then testing the assignment again.

The answer is 5694.

[Commentary
Put 8 numbers {0,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} in order A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and divide the 5-digit number 1ABC2 by D, since the quotient is the 4-digit number EFGH.

$1ABC2 = D × EFGH$

Also, since 1ABC2 ends in 2, the last digit of D × (EFGH ending in H) is 2. For example, when D = 3, 3 × 4 = 12, so H = 4 is a candidate.
In fact, if we put D=3 and H=4, then 1ABC2 = 3×EFGH, where 1ABC2 is from 10000-19999 and EFGH is approximately 4 digits from 3334-6666. Furthermore, EFGH and the remaining A, B, and C must be permutations of {0,5,6,7,8,9} excluding D=3 and H=4, so if we try EFGH=5694 as one candidate,

$3×5694 = 17082$

and seeing this as 1ABC2, A=7, B=0, C=8, and the 8 numbers in the sequence are {7,0,8,3,5,6,9,4}, which is consistent with the original set.

Thus, the solution satisfying the condition is EFGH = 5694.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3-mini-high/icon' alt='o3-mini-high.icon' height="19.5"/>
### Explanation

1.### Why D=0 and D=5 are impossible
.
    - If D=0.
        - 1ABC2 = D × EFGH, but if D is 0, then 0 × EFGH = 0, contradicting the fact that 1ABC2 is a 5-digit number over 10000.
        - Also, dividing by zero in division cannot be defined.
- If D=5.
        - The product of a number multiplied by 5 always ends in 0 or 5, but 1ABC2 ends in 2.
        - Therefore, when multiplied by 5, the tail cannot be 2.

2.### Narrowing down D using the fact that the product begins with 1
.
- Since 1ABC2 is a 5-digit number with a leading digit of 1, it is always in the range 10000-19999.
- Equation 1ABC2 = D x EFGH, where EFGH is 4 digits (1000-9999).
    - → Therefore,
        - 10000 ≤ D×EFGH < 20000
    - ⇨ 10000/D ≤ EFGH < 20000/D
    - and the range is defined.
- Furthermore, since 1ABC2 ends in 2, for the end of EFGH (let H
    - D×H ≡ 2 (mod 10)
    - is established.
- For example, if D=3, then 3 x 4 = 12 and the tail is 2, so H=4 is a candidate.
- Thus, D can be narrowed down by examining combinations of candidates excluding 0 and 5 (e.g., 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, etc.) whose products fall between 10000 and 19999 and whose last digit of D x H is 2.

The final condition is satisfied when D=3, at which time EFGH = 5694.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Can you explain why it cannot be D=9?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3-mini-high/icon' alt='o3-mini-high.icon' height="19.5"/>
### Explanation

1.### Constraints on the scope of EFGH
.
- 1ABC2 = 9 x EFGH, since 1ABC2 is a 5-digit number and fits between 10000 and 19999.
- 10000 ≤ 9×EFGH < 20000
- ⇒ 1112 ≤ EFGH < 2222
- and EFGH is a 4-digit number from 1112 to 2221.

2.### Constraints on the number of thousandths in EFGH
.
- Each digit of EFGH is taken from {3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0} without duplication, though,
    - The "1" and "2" in 1ABC2 are already in use.
    - If we assume D=9 this time, we can't use 9 either.
Therefore, the numbers available for EFGH are {0,3,4,5,6,7,8}, with the thousandth place being at least 3 since it cannot be 0.
- This means that EFGH will be at least 3000.

3.### Inconsistencies
.
- EFGH must be in the range "1112-2221", but if the thousandths are greater than 3, it is greater than 3000, which is incompatible.

From the above, D=9 is not possible because the value of EFGH is inconsistent with D=9.

1.### Exclusion of numbers where D cannot be taken
.
    - If D=0.
- Since it cannot be defined to divide by 0, and since 0 x EFGH is 0, it cannot be a 5-digit 1ABC2.
- If D=5.
- When multiplied by 5, the last digit of the product is always 0 or 5, but the last digit of 1ABC2 is 2.
- For D=9.
- 1ABC2 ranges from 10000 to 19999, but if D = 9
    - 10000 ≤ 9 × EFGH < 20000, and EFGH ranges from 1112 to 2221.
- However, since EFGH chooses from among the available numbers {0,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}, the thousands place must be at least 3, not 0, and must be at least 3000.
    - This inconsistency makes D = 9 unsuitable.

From the above, the candidate D is {3,4,6,7,8}.
- (Poking around: you don't seem to realize that 7 and 8 are also NGs for the same reason as 9 <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>)

2.### Refine H from the condition where the last digit of the product is 2
.
- 1ABC2 = D x EFGH because the end of EFGH is 2,
- D × H ≡ 2 (mod 10)
and so on. Solving for each D yields :.
(omitted)
Thus, the candidate for the combination with D, where the last digit of the product is 2, is,
- (D, H) = (3, 4)
- (D, H) = (4, 3)
- (D, H) = (4, 8)
- (D, H) = (6, 7)
- (D, H) = (7, 6)
- (D, H) = (8, 4)
- (D, H) = (8, 9)

There are less than 10 candidates, with a total of 7 streets.
(Punctuation: Actually, 7 and 8 are also NG, so the possible (D, H) here are (3,4), (4,3), (4,8), and (6,7) <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>)

[Commentary
Since the eight numbers {0,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} are placed all the way from A to H, 0 must always appear somewhere. However, placing a 0 in the following positions is inconsistent.

- Originally non-zero for D, E, and H:
    - D because it is the denominator of the division.
    - E is the beginning of the 4-digit quotient EFGH, and H is the last digit of D×H. 0 is also not valid from the condition that the last digit of H is 2.

The remaining five places are A, B, C (the three digits in 1ABC2) and F, G (the last two digits in EFGH), but placing a 0 in any of these will cause the following problems

- If A=0:
- 1ABC2 becomes 10BC2 and the value is limited to 10000-10999. For example, if D=3, the quotient is (10000-10999)/3 ≈ 3334-3666, and the quotient, E, is fixed at 3. However, D=3 and E=3 are contradictory because they overlap. Similarly, the other D(4,6) cannot satisfy the condition, since the first E of the quotient will have unusable numbers such as 1 and 2.

- If F or G=0:
- EFGH must be 4 digits and must be greater than or equal to 1000, e.g., if D = 3, EFGH must range from 3334 to 6666. 0 in F or G would greatly limit the number of possible digit combinations, and would be difficult to avoid overlap with other digits and be compatible with the range condition. In fact, the known solution is EFGH = 5694, and 0 cannot be placed in either as F = 6 and G = 9.

From the above, placing a 0 in A, C, F, or G causes inconsistency in terms of numerical range and overlap, and the only place where a 0 can be placed without inconsistency is B.

- If 0 is placed in F or G, the number of digit combinations that can be composed is very limited, and it is difficult to avoid overlap with other digits and to be compatible with range conditions.
    - If you're going to say something like "very limited" or "makes it difficult to balance the two," I'd expect you to make a good argument, but I don't think you understand those things.
- In fact, the known solution gives EFGH = 5694, and 0 cannot go in either as F = 6 and G = 9."
    - It's fundamentally wrong to use a known solution to make an argument.
- I expected him to say something like, "When F or G is 0, the carry forward is exposed to the product, so D=3 is impossible." but he didn't.

Ah, well, to begin with, the current LLM is educated in the way that "output the solution that seems most probable and score points if it is right", so once you find a candidate solution by feeling and verify that it is a solution by performing a calculation, no further argumentation is necessary.
- So you're going to say "to give a specific example" and then act like you don't cover the conditional branch or make a feeling judgment like "there's a high possibility of duplication".

After this, explicitly asking me to "prove that it is the only solution" didn't work at all.
- I gave up because they only considered the case D=3 and said they "proved" it.

In actual examinations, AI will probably solve the problem by enumerating all the answers once it has narrowed down the problem to a certain degree, and AI will probably reach the point where it can "think faster by enumerating all the answers than by thinking" earlier than humans, so this phenomenon of "the answer is correct even though it cannot be explained" may increase.
- Not necessarily "[[Smart people can explain things clearly.]]" There is a pattern of "[I don't know what you're talking about, but it's clever.
