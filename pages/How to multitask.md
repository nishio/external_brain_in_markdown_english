title: "How to multitask"
---

Me: "How do we execute [[multitasking]] efficiently?"
Wife: "Just turn [[single task]] around fast."

Me: "I think the size of the implicitly assumed single task may be different."
Wife: "In the end, humans can only do one thing at a time, so let go of the illusion of multitasking."

I said, "What do you do when you have multiple projects that can only be done one at a time and will take several months to complete?"
Wife: "There are countless smaller tasks in a long term project. One task that can be done."

I said, "For example, about this 'writing a paper' project."
Wife: "First of all, it's not good that it's not clearly stated what the paper is going to be about, and it's like, 'I'm going to be big! Like that."

- [You're not seeing the whole picture.
- How about [writing it out first
- I'm not sure you have an [[estimate]] of how long it will take for any of them.
- I don't like it much, but maybe by writing [[Gantt charts]] you can notice things like overcrowding.

- I think you are not able to [[subdivide tasks]].
- Time should be malloc for task segmentation.
