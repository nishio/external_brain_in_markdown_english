Spectrum of bazaars, clubs and collaborations
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1757787451962380350/quick_promote_web/intro) Rorty's [[Bazaar and Clubs]], [[Glen Weyl]]'s "[[collaboration on Spectrum]]". At one end of the spectrum is [[capitalism]]. It is the "thinnest relationship," mediated by money, where anyone can buy something for the same amount of money. At the other end of the spectrum is intimacy. This is an [[intimate]] relationship with a limited number of people.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1757787778933477398) Rorty saw the two as continuous rather than disjointed; Glen goes a step further and sees the [[feasibility frontier]] in economics terms created by the tradeoff between the two being pushed out by technological developments. Glen goes one step further and believes that the [[feasibility frontier]], in the parlance of economics, created by the trade-off between the two, will be pushed forward by technological developments.
