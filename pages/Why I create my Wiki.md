title: "Why I create my Wiki"
---


2023-11-04 I saw that the reason for creating a Wiki was mentioned in a well-written diary, and I wrote about the reasons why I would create a Wiki if I were to create one.
from [/villagepump/why-I-make-Wiki](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/why-I-make-Wiki).
- Want to work closely with Keichobot and Kozaneba
    - To be honest, I don't want to make it, so if Scrapbox has the functionality needed for collaboration, I want to use Scrapbox.
- Keichobot→Scrapbox
    - There is no summary writing API on the Scrapbox side and it's "I'll go as far as formatting it in Scrapbox format so you can copy and paste it", terrible!
- Scrapbox→Keichobot
    - It would be nice to be able to have a "let's have a conversation based on what we've talked about so far" while writing Scrapbox, but if you want to run it on Scrapbox, you have to use browser extensions, etc.
    - Keichobot is designed to be used while walking around with a smartphone, so the choice of browser extensions is not great
    - I can take data on a page-by-page basis and use it as a reference (just noticed).
        - When trying to POST from Scrapbox with UserScript, [[CORS]] prevents it.
            - GET is not long enough.
        - But if it's a public project, you can just give them the URL [[Keichobot can read it from Scrapbox]].
- Kozaneba→Scrapbox
    - There's no way to embed it, so I'll just have to post a screenshot.
- Scrapbox→Kozaneba
    - Can import
