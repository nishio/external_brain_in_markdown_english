> [sumikitijyukiti](https://x.com/sumikitijyukiti/status/1960635348750622974) What's great about this is that the guy in the lead is a big guy, with long arms and legs and blessed with DNA that gives him an advantage in the sprint.
> The picture perfectly illustrates that there are those who have an advantage from the beginning in what appears to be an [[equality]] competition.

- The cartoon illustrates that humans inherently have a desire to be superior to others.
- At the starting line, everyone is allowed the possibility of coming out on top.
- However, as the race unfolds and the winners and losers become apparent, "equality" becomes a rallying cry.
- This depicts the human psychology that when a winner emerges, the loser will seek equality.
- Ultimately, he suggests that humans are beings who oscillate between the desire to be superior and the desire to be equal.

In a BBC science documentary program, a biologist once said, "If organisms as intelligent as humans existed on other planets, they would be as belligerent as we are.
- Maybe this sounds right.
    - It's a story about aliens commenting on the Earth.
- I bought it and read it.


> [sinozaki2](https://x.com/sinozaki2/status/1960572779897741776) That's one of the strategies to take the lead, so I can't complain imho... I wonder if it's also a strength to silence those voices. I'm not sure if that's a strength.

> [hirosan1911](https://x.com/hirosan1911/status/1960653495767273697) It's like asking someone who can't even produce a good result to give you a share.
>  The religion created for such scum is communism, and in the end, the have-nots end up at the mercy of the smart exploiters.

> [peropero2548](https://x.com/peropero2548/status/1960868829543981415) You already have a different starting point.
>  Fujiko F. Fujio might have a different expression now.
