- [To Lead Across Cultures, Focus on Hierarchy and Decision Making](https://hbr.org/2017/07/being-the-boss-in-brussels-boston-and-beijing)
- [[Erin Meyer]] found that Japan is a hierarchical, consensus-oriented culture of extremes.
    - Bottom right edge is Japan
    - Culture in which individuals on the team feel less likely to disagree with the team's opinion once the team's decision is made (hierarchical)
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/618ecdca200efea9d4d81eb77979f753/thumb/1000)
            - Figure taken from [[The Culture Map]] (and the following two)
    - However, when the boss or team leader makes decisions for the team alone, there is animosity. (non-top-down)
        - Team members feel frustrated when they are not involved in the decision-making process. Leaders are expected to gather members' opinions and make decisions, rather than making decisions alone. (Consensus oriented)

In addition to this, another characteristic of Japanese culture is [[conflict avoidance]].
- Never say "I disagree" to another person's opinion.

Rough after this
- Strange Japanese who value consensus but are afraid to express opinions that differ from others.
- Broad listening could work very well.

- [[Intercultural Comprehension]]
[[DAO and culture]]
[[Consensus]]
