title: "Conflicting labels are placed close together."
---

If you're thinking of ideas for improving your office and you're looking at labels for opinions from various employees...
- The office is cold."
- It's hot in my office."
Suppose we find seemingly contradictory labels such as

Should these two pieces be placed close together or far apart?

This should be placed nearby. If it is placed far away, it will create an axis of conflict in the space.

By the way, these two labels are very abstract. To put it another way.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/川喜田二郎/icon' alt='川喜田二郎.icon' height="19.5"/>There is no [[aroma of soil]]."
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The Parable of the Floating Grass and the Trees.

Let's be more specific and ask the person who wrote this label to be more specific. Suppose, for example, you get a reply like this.
- When you come home after walking in the heat, it takes a long time for the sweat to subside if the temperature is low.
- I use a kneeling pad all the time because my legs get cold.

With the addition of the unlabeled information, I can see the situation more clearly. One side is talking about walking home from a hot outside office, and the other side is talking about being inside the company all the time.

In light of this, the two views are not contradictory. For example, this kind of compatibility can be conceived
- How about building one room with strong air conditioning and making it a free address system so that those who want to use it can use it?

In this way, by resolving seemingly contradictory data inconsistencies, we are one step closer to solving the problem.
