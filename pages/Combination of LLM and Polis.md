title: "Combination of LLM and Polis"

Where we have used Polis and felt it would be beneficial to use LLM.

Opinion Group Summary
- While the report provides detailed information on the opinions of opinion groups, many users prefer a summary in natural language rather than a list of precise data
- Examples of actual use
        - [[Polis Experience Report: Should we investigate the causes of terrorism?]]
- The cost of creating a human summary is too high for frequent updates, but if LLMs do it, they can, for example, create and tweet a summary of the day's discussions every day

Seed Opinion Preparation
- To start Polis, you must first create a seed opinion
- Seed opinions should be based on diverse perspectives
    - If you don't include a question on an axis, you won't see the conflict on that axis.
    - To better understand the distribution of opinions held by users, it is better to collect opinions on many axes that are independent of each other
- This, however, is too much work for one person to do.
    - Because the person needs to think based on diverse perspectives
- Assisted here by LLM
    - [[Polis Experience Report: Should Same-Sex Marriage Be Legalized?]]
