title: "A good group of groups that can make a nameplate."
---

from  [[Proposed additions to p. 150 - p. 168, Intellectual Production of Engineers]]
A good group of groups that can make a nameplate.
- It would be nice if a concrete example diagram was added to [(5.2.6.2) Groups that are good groups that can make nameplates

Before that, it would be nice to have concrete examples instead of abstract symbols.
Example
Column P167 [[(Column) Knowledge Integrity]].
- Q: Knowledge [[coherence theory (theory that a proposition is true if it corresponds with a specified set of other propositions)]] is about "definition of correctness" so p.222 [(7.1.1) Should it be placed near [[(7.1.1) Mathematical Correctness]]?
- A: No, I think this chapter is a good place to put it because the story bridges "reading a book" and "making sticky notes"
