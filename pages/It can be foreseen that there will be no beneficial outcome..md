title: "It can be foreseen that there will be no beneficial outcome."
---

The phrase "shall not" is used in two ways. Sometimes it is used not in the sense of being unethical, but in the sense that it is foreseeable to a sufficiently competent person that it will not have beneficial consequences. In this case, if you want to do the deed, you may. However, it is also foreseeable that a sufficiently competent person who sees it will think you are incompetent.
