title: "Nothingness is a more complex concept than existence"
---

    - [[Henri Bergson]] #Bergson #Bergson
    - [[nil]] is a more complex concept than [existence
- It is not a state of being that is added to a state of not being, but a state of being that is perceived as "not being" when the expectation of a certain state of being is betrayed.
- Nothingness is not the absence of things, but the absence of [usefulness

> It is undeniable that dissatisfaction is the starting point of human behavior, and that is why there is a sense of lack. One will not act unless one has a goal, and one will seek it only when one feels the lack of something. In this way, our actions proceed from "nothing" to "something," and embroidering "something" on the canvas of "nothing" is really the essence of action. However, the nothingness in question is not the absence of things, but rather a "Lack of usefulness. When I take a guest into an unfurnished room, I tell him, "There is nothing here. But I know there is air in the room. But since I am not sitting on the air, there is nothing in the room that is really of interest to either the guest or myself at the moment. Generally speaking, the work of man is to create usefulness. And unless work is done, there is "nothing," i.e., "nothing" that one would have wanted to obtain. Thus, our life passes in the filling of emptiness. ...We cannot help but do the same with our thought. ...The idea that events are a seething void, that nothingness in the sense of the absence of all things is by right, if not by fact, prior to all things, thus takes root within us. I have tried to dissipate this illusion. ...
