---

from  [[Kanban in Regroup]]
- Do not force them to wear a nameplate.
    - Significant changes in group structure
        - Groups with no nameplate] at the time I press grouping.
    - The Past.
        - Lasso selection and grouping of stickies
        - At this point, I used to open the add sticky panel and go into front cover edit mode.
