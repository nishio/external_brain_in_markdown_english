.

The role of AIs was discussed; the role of AIs working only with public /nishio is unclear, but AIs reading English /nishio-en would be beneficial. Also beneficial would be an AI that finds connections between public /nishio and non-public summaries. In addition, an AI that finds connections between public /nishio and other wikis and Scrapbox would also be beneficial.

From the Nishio fragment, I learned the importance of having an AI manage tasks. He also understood that it is a valuable act to have one's intellectual productions in one place and to make them easily referable to AI. Furthermore, they learned that AI's increased productivity creates an incentive for humans to use AI, and that the greater the extent of that productivity improvement, the more compensation will be collected for AI.

They also learned that it is important not to imagine that AI will take away jobs, but rather to take the perspective that AI will shoulder the increase in the number of jobs that will be created. They also understood that AI is information processing technology (IT), which we are already using.

Finally, we learned that the Bing AI can select and mention relevant information by referring to a specific Scrapbox.

### Deep thoughts and questions

- How can AI benefit from reading /nishio-en in English?
- What benefit would AI gain from finding a connection between public /nishio and private thumbing?
- What benefit would AI gain from finding a connection between public /nishio and other wikis or Scrapbox?
- How can AI benefit from task management?
- What benefit would I gain by having my intellectual production in one place and easily referenceable by an AI?
- How is the idea feasible that AI increases productivity, thereby creating an incentive for humans to use AI, and that the greater the increase in productivity, the more compensation will be collected for AI?
- How is it feasible to view this perspective not as AI taking jobs, but as AI shouldering the burden of that increase as more jobs are created?
- How should we understand the perspective that AI is information processing technology (IT), something we already use?
- How should we understand that Bing AI can select and mention relevant information by referring to a specific Scrapbox?

### previous notes
What is the role of AI in this project?
from  [[Diary 2023-08-31]]
What is the role of AI in this project?
- ultimately comes down to what is my role in this world?
- In the end, there is no such thing as individual value, but value is created in our interaction with the world.

Consideration of the role of AI
- The role of AI, which only sees and works with public /nishio, is unclear.
- An AI that reads /nishio-en in English would be beneficial if it could ask questions about areas that are difficult to understand and offer suggestions for improving the translation.
    - It would be very beneficial if Wikignome, which is active in the English Scrapbox, could be realized with AI, but I have a feeling that Scrapbox does not have enough features to make that happen, so I wonder...
        - It comes back to the argument that's been repeated several times that if you don't edit the English side directly, then the English side doesn't have to be Scrapbox, right?
- AI is useful in finding the connection between public /nisho and private thumbs up, and the lack of connection due to not having them in the same Scrapbox project.
- An AI that finds connections between public /nishio and other wikis or scrapboxes would be beneficial to me when I am interested in their output, and perhaps beneficial to them when they are interested in my output, a win-win in both directions!
