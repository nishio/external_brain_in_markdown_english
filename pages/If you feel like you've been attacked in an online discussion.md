[Unexplored Junior Advent Calendar 2023](https://adventar.org/calendars/9101)
Today, on the 8th day, I would like to introduce a selection of unexplored junior Scrapboxes that I think will be useful to others.

I was hoping to show the process of enrichment and crystallization of the findings with the involvement of multiple people, but when I asked the people involved for permission to publish, they wanted to remain anonymous, so it was a rather simple process.
I have a more robust page, but it's hard to cut it out in a publishable form: ......, well, as they say, "[Finish it first instead of trying for perfection. I'll end with this for today.

- I thought it was mentioned somewhere on [[unexplored junior]], but I couldn't find it on [[Scrapbox]], so I recompiled it. The original is [[Paul Graham]] @ [[Y Combinator]]'s essay "[[Life is Short]]".

Nishio's [[Scrapbox ]] article is well organized and I quote from it.
["I know [[your instinct is to argue]], but don't do it, it will take away from your [[precious time]].

> There are things in this world that can trick you into wasting your time. A familiar example for many is online discussions. When someone contradicts you, you feel attacked."
>
> You may be attacked openly. When attacked, you instinctively want to defend yourself.... But like many other instincts, "instinct" was not designed for the current era.
>
> Often, against all intuition, it is better not to defend against attacks online in this day and age. Playing defense will cost the attacker the time of your life].
>
>  Translation note: If you view online dissent as an attack and attempt to further defend yourself, you will be expressing disagreement with the other person's opinion. This is seen by the other party as an attack as well. Unlike physical attacks, online attacks do not result in injury or escape, so the form of mutual aggression continues endlessly and sucks up time.
