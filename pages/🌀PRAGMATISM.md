.

Lecture I points out that all people have a philosophy, that temperament influences philosophy, that positivism lacks religion, and rationalism lacks facts. Pragmatism is proposed as a system to mediate these.

Lecture II explains the history and characteristics of pragmatism as a methodology, contrasts pragmatism with rationalism and intellectualism, and pragmatism as a theory of truth. Truth is the good of beliefs, and pragmatism resolves conflicts between truths.

Lecture III examines pragmatic metaphysics issues such as matter, materialism, God, design, and free will. What the alternatives in each problem promise is important.

Lecture IV examines the pragmatics of concepts such as philosophy's search for wholeness as well as unity, the world being one in many ways, one origin, one purpose, one narrative, and one perceiver.

Lecture V explains the growth of knowledge, the concept of common sense as discovered by our prehistoric ancestors, and the comparison of scientific and philosophical critical stages with common sense.

Lecture VI explains that truth means congruence with reality, which means verifiability, the ability to make us successful through experience, and that truth grows.

In the fragment "The Present Dilemma in Philosophy," the question of how the conflict between rationalists and empiricists affects our daily life and social culture, and how these conflicts should be resolved, is important.

The fragment "What Pragmatism Means" argues that pragmatism has the potential to reconcile empiricist ways of thinking with human religious demands.

The fragment "Some Metaphysical Problems Pragmatically Considered" raises the questions of how pragmatism reconciles the conflict between rationalism and empiricism, how the debate between materialism and theism should be resolved, and how the conflict between free will and determinism How should the question be resolved?

Lecture I Current Dilemmas in Philosophy
Everyone has a philosophy. Temperament is a factor in philosophy; there are rationalists and empiricists, the tender-hearted and the strong-minded. Many seek both facts and religion, but empiricism offers facts without religion and rationalism offers religion without facts. Pragmatism is proposed as a system to reconcile these.

Lecture II: The Meaning of Pragmatism
Pragmatism is a methodology and contrasts with rationalism and intellectualism. As a theory of truth, it corresponds to "humanism" and takes into account old and new truths. Pragmatism mediates between empiricism and religion.

Lecture III: Pragmatic Considerations of Metaphysical Problems
Pragmatics examines issues such as substance, materialism, and free will. The pragmatic question in these issues is what does the alternative promise?

Lecture IV One and Many
Philosophy seeks wholeness as well as unity. Pragmatically, the world is one in many ways. It should oppose monistic dogmatism and follow empirical findings.

Lecture V Pragmatism and Common Sense
Knowledge grows and initial ideas remain. Common sense is one stage of mental evolution, and it is impossible to say which is more "true."

Lecture VI: Pragmatism's View of Truth
Truth is congruence with reality, meaning verifiability. Truth is good, convenient thought. Truth grows.

Lecture VII Pragmatism and Humanism
There are three kinds of reality that the new truth must take into account. Human contributions are everywhere and make up what is given.

Lecture VIII Pragmatism and Religion
Consider the usefulness of absolutes, and pragmatism is meritorious. We can create reality. There are "gentle" and "harsh" types of religion, and pragmatism mediates.

Lecture I
The Present Dilemma in Philosophy
Chesterton quoted. Everyone has a philosophy. Temperament is a factor in all philosophizing. Rationalists and empiricists. The tender-minded and the tough-minded. Most men wish both facts and religion. Empiricism gives facts without religion. Rationalism gives religion without facts.
The layman's dilemma. The unreality in rationalistic systems. Leibnitz on the damned, as an example. M. I. Swift on the optimism of idealists.
Pragmatism as a mediating system. An objection. Reply: philosophies have characters like men, and are liable to as summary judgments. Spencer as an example.
Lecture II
What Pragmatism Means
The squirrel. Pragmatism as a method. History of the method. Its character and affinities. How it contrasts with rationalism and intellectualism. A 'corridor theory.' Pragmatism as a theory of truth, equivalent to 'humanism.' Earlier views of mathematical, logical, and natural truth. More recent views. Schiller's and Dewey's 'instrumental' view. The formation of new beliefs. Older truth always has to be kept account of. Older truth arose similarly. The 'humanistic' doctrine.
Rationalistic criticisms of it. Pragmatism as mediator between empiricism and religion. Barrenness of transcendental idealism. How far the concept of the Absolute must be called true. The true is the good
in the way of belief. The clash of truths. Pragmatism unstiffens discussion.
Lecture III
Some Metaphysical Problems Pragmatically Considered
The problem of substance. The Eucharist. Berkeley's pragmatic treatment of material substance. Locke's of personal identity. The problem of materialism. Rationalistic treatment of it. Pragmatic treatment. 'God'
is no better than 'Matter' as a principle, unless he promise more. Pragmatic comparison of the two principles. The problem of design. 'Design' per se is barren. The question is WHAT design. The problem of 'free-will.' Its relations to 'accountability.' Free-will a cosmological theory. The pragmatic issue at stake in all these problems is what do the alternatives PROMISE.
Lecture IV
The One and the Many
Total reflection. Philosophy seeks not only unity, but totality. Rationalistic feeling about unity. Pragmatically considered, the world is one in many ways. One time and space. One subject of discourse. Its parts interact. Its oneness and manyness are co-ordinate. Question of one origin. Generic oneness. One purpose. One story. One knower. Value of pragmatic method. Absolute monism. Vivekananda. Various types of union discussed. Conclusion: We must oppose monistic dogmatism and follow empirical findings.
Lecture V
Pragmatism and Common Sense
Noetic pluralism. How our knowledge grows. Earlier ways of thinking remain. Prehistoric ancestors DISCOVERED the common sense concepts. List of them. They came gradually into use. Space and time. 'Things.' Kinds. 'Cause' and 'law.' Common sense one stage in mental evolution, due to geniuses. The 'critical' stages: 1) scientific and 2) philosophic, compared with common sense. Impossible to say which is the more 'true.'
Lecture VI
Pragmatism's Conception of Truth
The polemic situation. What does agreement with reality mean? It means verifiability. Verifiability means ability to guide us prosperously through experience. Completed verifications seldom needful. 'Eternal' truths. Consistency, with language, with previous truths. Rationalist objections. Truth is a good, like health, wealth, etc. It is expedient thinking. The past. Truth grows. Rationalist objections. Reply to them.
Lecture VII
Pragmatism and Humanism
The notion of THE Truth. Schiller on 'Humanism.' Three sorts of reality of which any new truth must take account. To 'take account' is ambiguous. Absolutely independent reality is hard to find. The human contribution is ubiquitous and builds out the given. Essence of pragmatism's contrast with rationalism. Rationalism affirms a transempirical world. Motives for this. Tough-mindedness rejects them. A genuine alternative. Pragmatism mediates.
Lecture VIII
Pragmatism and Religion
Utility of the Absolute. Whitman's poem 'To You.' Two ways of taking it. My friend's letter. Necessities versus possibilities. 'Possibility' defined. Three views of the world's salvation. Pragmatism is melioristic. We may create reality. Why should anything BE? Supposedchoice before creation. The healthy and the morbid reply. The 'tender'and the 'tough' types of religion. Pragmatism mediates.

Formation of new beliefs Old truths must always be taken into account. Old truths arose as well. The "humanistic" doctrine.
- Rationalist critique of it. Pragmatism as a mediator between empiricism and religion. The sterility of transcendental idealism. To what extent must the concept of the Absolute be called truth? Truth is good.

Lecture III: Pragmatic Considerations of Metaphysical Problems
- The Problem of Substance. The Eucharist Barclay's Pragmatic Treatment of Material Substance. Locke's problem of personal identity The problem of materialism. Rationalist treatment of it. Pragmatic treatment God" is inferior to "matter" as a principle, but not superior to it unless it promises something more A pragmatic comparison of the two principles. A matter of design. Design" in itself is sterile. The question is what kind of design. The issue of "free will. Its relation to "accountability. Cosmological free will. The pragmatic question at issue in all these issues is what does the alternative promise?

There is little need for completed verification. The "eternal" truth. Language, consistency with past truths. Rationalist Response Truth, like health, wealth, etc., is a good. It is a convenient thought. It is past. Truth grows. Rationalist objections. Answer them.
Lecture VII Pragmatism and Humanism

In the fragment "The Present Dilemma in Philosophy" we will discuss the impact of the conflict between rationalists and empiricists on everyday life and social culture and how to resolve it; in "What Pragmatism Means" we will discuss the possibility of pragmatism reconciling empiricist thinking and religious demands; and in "Some Metaphysical Problems Pragmatically Considered" we will discuss the ways in which pragmatism reconciles the conflict between rationalism and empiricism, materialism and theism, freedom and will. and "Some Metaphysical Problems Pragmatically Considered" discusses how pragmatism can reconcile the conflict between rationalism and empiricism and how to resolve the conflicts between materialism and theism, free will and determinism. and the resolution of the conflicts between materialism and theism, and free will and determinism.

### Relation to Fragment
.

The lecture and fragment "Some Metaphysical Problems Pragmatically Considered" share a common theme about the way pragmatism reconciles the conflict between rationalism and empiricism, and the way materialism and theism, free will and determinism It is also a good place to start.
