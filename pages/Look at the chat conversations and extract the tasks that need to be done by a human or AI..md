Look at the chat conversations and extract the tasks that need to be done by a human or AI.
Tasks to be performed by humans must have a level of verbalization that is feasible just by looking at the description of the task
Humans forget task details
If the situation is sullied and not suitable for a human to devote time to, starting over or giving up is an option.
