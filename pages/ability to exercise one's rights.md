> Part I General Provisions Chapter II Person Section 1 Capacity to exercise rights
> The enjoyment of private rights begins at birth.

Unless specifically overridden, a prenatal fetus has no rights capacity.

Specific Examples of Overrides
>  (Fetal capacity to claim damages)
> Article 721 An unborn child shall be deemed to have already been born for the purpose of claiming damages.

In other words, if the father of the fetus is unable to work due to the negligence of another person A, thereby damaging the benefits he should have received, the fetus can claim damages for it.
