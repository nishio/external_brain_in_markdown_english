- In the 15 years between 2015 and 2030, the population of 20-somethings will decrease by 1 in 7
- A job done by seven people will be done by six in 15 years.
    - The amount of work per person increased by 17%.
    - A 17% increase in work for someone working 20 days x 8 hours per month would mean an additional 27 hours per month.
        - Would you work at least an hour more overtime each day or would you reduce your days off by three days per month?

It is not realistic to deal with a 17% increase in workload by increasing individual work hours.
- By the way we work,
    - Increases work efficiency by 17
    - Reduce the work itself by 17
    - Increase the workforce by 17% by putting people who are not currently working to work
- Approaches such as the following are needed
