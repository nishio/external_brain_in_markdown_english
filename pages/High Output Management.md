Before calling a meeting, managers must ask themselves what it is they are trying to accomplish.

Saying yes to something means saying no to something else.

All managers can do is create an environment where people who are motivated by nature can thrive.

Basic principles of organizational design are the principles that drive society.
Manager's output = output of his/her own organization + output of neighboring organizations over which he/she has influence

- [[When people are not doing their jobs, they are either not capable or not willing]]
- The manager's job is to solve this problem.

Every day in our business, we have to connect people with knowledge power with people with position power."
p.8

Unexplored Junior is not a company, nor does it engage in commercial activities, and mentors and creators are not superiors and subordinates, so some reinterpretation is necessary.
- A manager's most important responsibility is to get the best performance out of his subordinates."
- All a manager can do is create an environment where people who are motivated by nature can thrive."
- The same goes for the mentors of the unexplored juniors around here.

Part II: Business Management is a Team Game
- Chapter 4 Meetings--An Important Means for Managers
- There are two types of meetings
    - Process-centered meetings
        - Knowledge sharing and information exchange takes place
        - Regularly scheduled
    - Mission-centered meetings
        - Decisions are made to solve specific problems
        - Performed as needed for special purposes
        - Ideally, ad hoc mission-centered meetings should not take place.
            - In reality, you'll need it.

There are three types of process-centered meetings
- 1on1
- Staff Meeting
- task study committee

1on1
- This is what the mentors and creators are meeting regularly at least once a week at Unexplored Junior.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- The main purpose is to teach and exchange information with each other."
- How much time should I do it for?
    - You have to be able to bring up a vexing issue and still feel like you have enough time to discuss it, and a meeting scheduled for 15 minutes limits you to simple topics that can be handled quickly."
- The important point is that this is a subordinate's meeting, and the agenda and tone should be set by the subordinate."
    - Your subordinates should do the outlining."
        - Related: [[How to Use Regular Meeting Time Efficiently]]([[Taking Minutes Before Meetings is a Good Idea]])
- What should we discuss? Of critical importance are potential problems. Problems are often ambiguous, and it takes time for them to come to the surface, to be considered, and to be resolved.
- "[[Ask one more question]]. If you think your subordinate has told you everything he wants to talk about, ask one more question just to be sure. Repeat the question until you both feel satisfied that you've reached the bottom of the matter, and let the train of thought continue."
- Write notes in the meeting outline.
    - Prevent distractions
    - Information is more structured because the outline is already written and written down.
    - It is especially important to share outlines in advance for remote meetings
- We should confirm our next appointment during the meeting.
- In a 1-on-1, the subordinate may teach the supervisor, and the supervisor will make good decisions based on that.
