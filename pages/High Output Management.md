Before calling a meeting, managers must ask themselves what it is they are trying to accomplish.

Saying yes to something means saying no to something else.

All managers can do is create an environment where people who are motivated by nature can thrive.

Basic principles of organizational design are the principles that drive society.
Manager's output = output of his/her own organization + output of neighboring organizations over which he/she has influence

- [[When people are not doing their jobs, they are either not capable or not willing]]
- The manager's job is to solve this problem.

Every day in our business, we have to connect people with knowledge power with people with position power."
p.8
