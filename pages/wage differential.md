title: "wage differential"
---

- There are people who try to make you share in the wealth of those who get more than you do by claiming that "wage inequality is undesirable."
- [Global Rich List](http://www.globalrichlist.com/)
    - A website that will tell you what percentage of the top in the world you are in if you put in your annual income.
- With an annual income of 1.03 million, the top 17%.
    - Annual income of 1,030,000 is the level below which no income tax is imposed in Japan.
- So, if you make more than 1.03 million a year and you really believe that the wage gap is undesirable, then you should quickly distribute your wealth to the less fortunate 83% of the world!
- Most people can't face up to their [[selfish desire]] to [[want more]], so they just wrap it up with the words "[[disparity is not good]].
