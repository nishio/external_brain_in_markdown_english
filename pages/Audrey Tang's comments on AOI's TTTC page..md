There is a comment by [[Audrey Tang]] on the [[Talk to the City]] page of [[AI Objectives Institute]].
I don't think it was there before.

[Talk to the City — AI • Objectives • Institute](https://ai.objectives.institute/talk-to-the-city)
> “Ten years ago, the vTaiwan scope was limited, because stakeholder groups needed to adapt to the technology at the time. Today, this is being bridged with the advent of language models that can adapt to their needs. Back in 2014, it was impossible with the capacity of g0v contributors to interview a mini public of people and aggregate their ideas while preserving the full nuance. But now, with Talk to the City’s help, that cost has been reduced to essentially zero. It’s broad-listening and it can change the nature of this recursive public.”

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Ten years ago, vTaiwan projects were limited in scope. This was because the technology was not yet developed and it took time for those involved to adapt to it.
- However, advances in language modeling (AI) have now solved this problem.
- In 2014, it was impossible to gather the opinions of so many people and retain all the nuances, but now, thanks to the "Talk to the City" tool, it is very easy and inexpensive to do so.
- This tool can gather a wide range of opinions and thus potentially change the nature of public debate.
