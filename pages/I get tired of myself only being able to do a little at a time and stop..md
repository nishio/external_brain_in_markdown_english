    - [[only do what you have a chance of winning]].
- > [sugimoto_kei](https://twitter.com/sugimoto_kei/status/1655729681860263936) It is good to have a high goal or vision, but in the long run, competing to win or lose every time, However, competing with each other to win or lose every time is not the way to get closer to your vision in the long run.
- >  The person who goes [[doing things at one's own pace]] toward a distant destination can go the furthest.
- > [sugimoto_kei](https://twitter.com/sugimoto_kei/status/1655730299119226880) It's really not good to say that if you don't do well in the competition, you've become nothing, that you're a loser. You are throwing your life down the drain.
- >  Winning over others is not the most important thing.
    - [[I can't be anything...]]
- > [sugimoto_kei](https://twitter.com/sugimoto_kei/status/1655732166272372736) Of course, in order to make a living, we need to be concerned about competition to some extent. But, then again, is it right to let the competition control everything about you?
- > [sugimoto_kei](https://twitter.com/sugimoto_kei/status/1655733942631436288) I think I am a very competitive person, but I compete as a game, not as a life-long competition. I don't bet my life on competition. I guess I'm not a bumblebee.
- > [sugimoto_kei](https://twitter.com/sugimoto_kei/status/1655737346183278592) I don't blame the world for seeing me in comparison to others. I don't deny that. I'm not trying to deny it.
- >  But I don't care about that, I just want to get a little closer to the land of goals that I can see in my mind's eye. From such a perspective, the world, the competition, and even the self disappear.

    - When you think that the growth rate of [[The Reality of Myself]] is not so fast compared to [[growth rate]] of [[Ideal self]] ([[Delusional self]])
    - People who realize that their ideals were delusions and recognize reality.
    - Instead of interpreting this as "I chose the wrong domain" and continuing in that domain, I go looking for a new "domain where I can ideally grow."
        - Maybe there is, maybe there isn't.

    - [[avoid competition]]
    - [[Running away from difficulties does not make you stronger.]]
    - [[vegetative growth]]
