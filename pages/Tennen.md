<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/> The term "[[natural]]" (tennen) literally translates to "[[natural]]" in English, which can refer to anything that comes from nature or is not artificial. However, when it comes to characterizing someone's personality in Japanese, "tennen" takes on a more nuanced meaning.

When used to describe a person, "tennen" typically refers to someone who is spontaneous, genuine, a bit eccentric or quirky. This is not because they intentionally disregard social norms or expectations, but rather because they are naturally oblivious or unconcerned. Their actions and reactions might be surprising or unpredictable to others, often resulting in amusing or endearing situations.

However, labeling someone as "tennen" can also gently point out that they are somewhat naive or absent-minded, indicating that they might be somewhat detached from the more pragmatic aspects of life.

Generally speaking, "tennen" individuals are often seen as refreshing and authentic, and are cherished for their ability to view the world from a unique perspective, even if they sometimes step out of sync with others. The term "tennen" captures a specific aspect of a person's personality, indicating their natural and unaffected character, often coupled with an undertone of affectionate humor.

So, while the term "tennen" might directly translate to "natural," its usage in describing personalities in Japanese carries with it these additional connotations.
