title: "Reading the air and dialectics"
---

- > The intellectual evolution of the West has always been a [[dialectical]] development in this way. What is important here is the meaning of [[criticism]]. If you look at criticism of an opposing viewpoint only from your own perspective, it can be seen as [[belief]] or [[intolerance]] (positive or negative), but from a third-party perspective, it can be seen as [[dialectical historical perspective]], it is justice (a good thing in principle) that leads to new ideas and advances humanity.
- > The reason why the nuance of "[[read the situation]]" is difficult to convey to Westerners is that this act of reading the air is based on the assumption that there is no clear [[antagonistic structure]].

Interesting assertion
- For the act of "reading the air" to be valid, there must be no clear conflict structure in place.
- In the West, where dialectical history is widespread, [[confrontation]] is considered a good thing, and there are conflicts here and there
- Therefore, "reading the air" is impossible in the first place and difficult to understand

relevance
