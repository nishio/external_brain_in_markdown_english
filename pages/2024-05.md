Aware of fatigue due to a combination of internal study sessions and private events.
- Almost without a break during Golden Week, "Interviews for Unexplored Junior" and "Plurality Study Session" were held.
- The Wednesday-Thursday study group attempted to prepare materials utilizing [[Fractal Summary]] and supplemented high context with questions.

Intensive support for unexplored junior interviews and feedback
- Conduct a series of unexplored junior interviews during the Golden Week period.
- Efficiency was increased by converting the interview recordings to text and introducing a summary in Claude.
- Feedback before and after the interviews was also handled for all participants, and although the workload was heavy, it was completed.

Plurality-related and data visualization-related initiatives
- Continued attempts to visualize political opinion data in [[Polis2024-05-13]].
- Further development of the "AI Pubic Visualization (Talk to the City)" and international collaboration with the Digital Agency of Taiwan were also topics of discussion.

Unexplored Junior Onboarding and Community Activities
- Onboarding began in late May, concurrent with participation in related events (such as Social Hack Day #61).
- Discussions and documentation at the "Nodes of Thought" to deepen community engagement.

Continuing to use AI to look back and make knowledge
- In between the busyness of work, interview summaries and study session materials are prepared by AI (e.g., Claude) to improve work efficiency.
- We had trouble with the Chrome tab crashing once, but we tried to make a habit of looking back on the work, putting it all together again while keeping our heads clear.

In general, May was characterized by an over-scheduled month, with the unexplored junior interview response and the Plurality study group and data visualization project running concurrently. while working with the AI summary and fractal summary, the month was so dense that fatigue was felt.
