2014 Hong Kong Anti-government Protests
> Caused by: In Hong Kong, where a high degree of autonomy is granted under the "one country, two systems" system, "universal suffrage" with one person, one vote was to be introduced starting with the next election for the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in 2017. However, on August 31, 2014, the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress decided that candidates for Administrator must have the support of a majority of the Nomination Committee and that the number of candidates would be limited to two to three. Subsequently, Hong Kong pro-democracy groups such as Gakumin Sichao mobilized students to begin boycotting classes as part of a policy of effectively eliminating the candidacy of anyone who does not align with the wishes of the central government because the majority of the Nomination Committee is made up of pro-China groups.
>  Originally, in 2011, the Hong Kong government attempted to add a curriculum to foster patriotism toward the Chinese central government (patriotism education) to compulsory education, but there was strong opposition from students who claimed that it was brainwashing education. The Hong Kong government was forced to withdraw the curriculum as a result of mass demonstrations by Gakumin Shichao, a group of teenage students led by Huang Ji-feng and others.
