title: "Mille-feuille-ization of the topic"
---

from [/villagepump/topic-milfoil-ized](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/topic-milfoil-ized).
The expression [/taberungo/topic millefeuille-ized](https://scrapbox.io/taberungo/topic millefeuille-ized) was too exquisite to be transplanted.
- I would like to use it actively.
- A situation where multiple topics are being discussed simultaneously in the same place?

- [/yuta0801/ more "channels" won't solve the problem](https://scrapbox.io/yuta0801/ more "channels" won't solve the problem) described it as "going backwards", but it was subtle.

- At the same time that Mr. B is writing about topic 2, Mr. A is ignoring it and writing about topic 1, which are interspersed with each other ([[mille-feuille (type of pastry)]] in [[topic]]).
- Mr. B sees the topic 1 and writes his reply after finishing what he wants to say (topic 2), and Mr. A writes his reply to topic 2 later as well.
- See that reply and start writing again.
- something like that<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - (In addition, more than three people may be writing at the same time.
    - [[voice communication]] だと過去の発言がどんどん消えるからやりづらいのだろう<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

- [[The topics are intermingled.]]
- [[I can rehash the conversation.]]
