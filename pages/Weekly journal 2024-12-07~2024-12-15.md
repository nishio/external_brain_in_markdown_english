What we did last week
- I had my wisdom teeth removed on Monday: [[2024 wisdom teeth]].
    - Max HP seems to have dropped.
        - Sleep and recover, but it will be gone by nightfall.
        - Alternative interpretation: [[slip damage]].
            - Because the flavored juices come out of the jaw hole...
        - And the effects of taking painkillers all the time?
- Plurality book-related correspondence, meetings, etc.
    - [[Shin Tokyo 2050 Broad Listening]]
    - Meetings, advice, etc.
- No progress: Metaverse and Identity / UTAS-UMAP
    - Well, neither of us are in a hurry, and Plurality and Sin Tokyo are getting more exciting and busy, so that's fine.

What to do next week
- Ah, so many meetings.
- I can't think too much, so let's take it slow.
