title: "Good to see thinking developing regarding Will/Can/Must and project adoption."
---

summary
- Project proposals are [[Will/Can/Must]]. It is important that this Must be voluntarily set.
- The project with the largest "Want to adopt" (Will) in Nishio will be adopted. The strength of the Will is determined by the compatibility between the proposal's Will/Can/Must and Nishio's Will/Can/Must.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "Must" is that "Must"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>What you think you should do, not what you are told you should do, and the new value you can bring to society by doing it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "should" is that "should"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Listen first.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Yes, sir.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>In the three hypotheses, "the proposer can make X," "making X solves problem Y," and "customer Z will be happy if problem Y is solved" are all hypotheses, where "can make" is a Can related to individual ability, "solve" is a technically solvable Can, and "Z will be happy" is a Must that "some people are happy" or "brings value to society. Must" is a type of "Must" that "brings value to society.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>In the "Strong/Interesting/Important/I want to cooperate" category, "strong" means that the proposer has "high technical skills," and "interesting" means that the proposal "brings benefits to Nishio personally in the form of interest. I was not aware of this when I wrote this, but if the proposal brought benefits other than fun, I would have said "sounds useful," "I want to use it," or "I want to have it. This is a weak Must in the sense that it provides value to Nishio personally, while "important" is a strong Must because it means "I feel that solving this problem will be beneficial to society. However, there is an unspoken assumption that Nishio's Can is "I can cooperate.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Ultimately, Nishio's Will to "adopt" the largest project will be adopted.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>「Will」
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Be careful with the word Must, as it tends to cause interpretative sway. A proposal is a trio of what you want to create (Will), what you can create (Can), and what benefit you should create (Must, what benefit you will provide to society). Providing benefits to society is not essential in unexplored juniors, but in a broad sense, it provides benefits to the person and the mentor, so it can be said that "the customer is just very narrowly focused" and "providing value to the customer is still essential.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I found some themes that seemed relevant, and it would have been nice if they could have been specifically verbalized how they were relevant. Mostly accomplished.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Spontaneity is required. It is important to think about what you should do and decide for yourself, rather than doing what your parents or teachers tell you you "should" do.

- What kind of "Will" is this "Will"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's what we want to build. It's the future we want to see coming.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Since only a limited number of people can have the experience of looking at 120 applications for the Unexplored Junior, turning the findings into words and turning them into information that can be distributed will make the world a better place in the long run. So there is value in turning unspoken sensations into words.
