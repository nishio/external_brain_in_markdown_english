While "shame" is a broad term that can be used to describe a range of emotions in English, the concept of "haji" in Japanese has specific nuances that reflect societal expectations and social harmony.

"Haji" is not just a personal feeling, but a societal one as well. In Japanese culture, maintaining [[face]], or [[reputation]], is critical, and this is closely related to the concept of "haji". It's about feeling embarrassment or shame not just for oneself, but for one's family or even the wider community, especially when societal norms or expectations are violated.

"Haji" can be experienced if an individual's actions or failures are thought to reflect poorly on their group, whether it's their family, school, company, or the larger society. This is why the concept of "haji" can be such a powerful force in influencing behavior in Japan. It serves as a social mechanism to ensure individuals act in accordance with societal expectations, thus promoting [[social harmony]].

This was done to encourage girls to exhibit quiet behavior. Although there has been some relaxation of these norms in recent years, they still persist to some extent.
