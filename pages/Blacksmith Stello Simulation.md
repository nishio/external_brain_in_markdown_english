title: "Blacksmith Stello Simulation"

I'll do it when I feel like it.

- [[Blacksmith Stello]] Simulation

- The goal was to "eventually be able to verify this" with [[Average gold volume]].
- [Would you buy a second copy of Blacksmith Stello? | Urihari | note](https://note.com/urihari/n/na0f211e8d264)
- but as I was doing it, I realized it had nothing to do with the average amount of money, so I split the page.

Verification is
- Two blacksmiths are stronger than two blacksmiths in a two-card game.
- But in a four-card game, one blacksmith is stronger than the other.
So, since there is no choice in the action, we can simply play the computers against each other and see the win rate.
Strategy options include whether to buy two blacksmiths or not, as well as whether to buy coins or victory points

Uh, if you buy four gold coins, okay?
- If you have 3 gold coins and you get 8 gold, buy gold coins if there are 4 or less left in the deck, or the province if not.
    - Reason: if you have 4 or less, anything you buy here will be shuffled back on the next draw and returned instantly, so gold coins are better
    - If there is more, it is better to buy a genshu because the same probability of getting 8 gold here will be the same as getting 8 gold the next time (probably.... Need to verify)
