    - [[Yotaro Hatamura]] [[creation]] and [[design]] of [[technology]] p.207

- He read the book in 2013 and wrote, "I'm surprised someone else thought the same way." [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10201961860424649&set=a.1175498944176.2027303.1129148772&type=3&theater)
- I wrote about climbing up and down [[metaphor]] in a book I wrote in 2017, but completely forgot about this book
- If you have room, you may want to reread it and add to the bibliography with footnotes, etc.
    - I was not inspired by this book, so there's no ethical problem if I don't add to it.
    - It's just an opportunity for [Comparing similarities is a new way to learn.

        - I opened a book on the subject of [[sectionalism]], so I looked this up while I was at it.

    - p.209
    - Hatamura believes that [[design]] is "[cite
    - The means of "putting [[context]]" is "[[group together under a common concept]]" and "[[select the concept you want to use]]."
    - The above tree can be created by working with common concepts.
        - Hatamura's unique expression "grouping by [[common concept]]" seems to me to refer to the same thing as [[grouping]] in the [[KJ method]] or the "[[Stack boxes on top.]]" metaphor in my book.
    - How it differs from how I use it.
        - Hatamura is in the "contextualizing" phase, which is the phase of creating something, and in order to design a way to create it, he first asks, "Can we do it this way? If the answer is "no," he goes up to a higher concept and changes it to "another way.
        - This representation makes it look like there is a fixed tree first and then a trial and error process according to it.
        - In my expression, after the practice of trial and error, there is a phase of gathering new information
            - And then after that, after going through the box-stacking phase of abstraction, we get to the practice phase again.
            - The tree itself is updated during the stacking phase.
            - Newly observed facts may reveal errors in your previously held tree
            - So the tree does not grow unilaterally, but branches can break off.
