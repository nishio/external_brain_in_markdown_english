When I thought about what I could do right now to make the biggest impact, I felt like I should [do TikTok.

Today [[eye exam]].
- Subjectively, my eyesight has gone down, but they said the test results were unchanged.
- My astigmatism, especially in my left eye, has worsened and [[Landolt ring]] is blurry, but even if it's blurry, I can tell which one is out of focus!
- I wonder if I'll have to get a traditional eye exam in passing, but also get a detailed exam for the insert lenses every time I replace them with new XR goggles.
    - The main thing is regular checkups for detection of [[glaucoma]], but I have the feeling that this visual field test could be something better.
- Next time in 6 months.


[[30% effort, 80% results]].
- A story about the skin feeling of
- Expressing it as a percentage is misleading because it is unknown what is 100%.
- In 3 hours, you can do 80% of what you think you can do.
    - It takes me 10 to do 95% of what I thought I could do the first time.
    - Should we use 7 time to lift 80 effects to 95 effects?
        - Or do related but different, synergistic things in 7 hours to make it about 60 or so.
        - Or start something completely unrelated.
- We shouldn't stick to our original plan.
    - So I'll move on to something else right away.
    - This may seem "irresponsible" to the type of people who stay.
    - But "continuity" is not the only value.
    - These are different values, and if you can't afford the cost of persuasion, you should ignore it and move on on your own.
- I have no doubt that 80 to 95 is the better solution to the problem of the IIDOBATA policy system failing due to errors, but in the case of the goal of maximizing votes in a limited time, people who "discuss for a long time to try to use the IIDOBATA policy" are already loyal, so the investment of limited time is not a priority.
    - It could be more efficient to decide "not to do it" and swing the attention elsewhere.
    - That kind of decision making can't be done bottom up from supporters, the PdM should decide and announce it.


A sense under the skin that increasing the number of contact channels is futile.
- Case 1
    - People who view chat as [[Metaphors for face-to-face dialogue]] cannot act in a way that says, "Identify a place where you should post and post there.
        - In response to the general announcement, they'll post something they associate with the topic discussed there, such as "Oh, by the way, I'm in this situation, what can I do about it?
            - Then someone else does it, "This is for announcements, so I'll forward it to the channel for questions.
                - I appreciate this.
    - In other words, "where to write" and "where not to write" is information that can only be found among those who are continuously working within the organization
        - Even if you verbalize the rules in the form of "posting rules" or something like that, people who read and follow them are rare, which discourages decent people from posting, and people who don't read the rules post whatever they want, which makes the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] worse.
- Case 2
    - If the appropriate "place" is not known, an abstraction of it is used
        - If "PR-tiktok" is not available, "PR-yokoshiki" is used.
        - When "public relations is different," "chit-chat" is used.
            - This is when the chat is "a place where you can put anything you want".
                - When there is a chat as something like an object type or any type.
            - What happens when chit-chat is defined as "a place to share information for hands-on activities"?
                - → People don't read those rules and don't stop posting their good feelings.
                - [[Now the North Face Issue]]?
                    - In an environment where new people keep coming in, you can't expect that person to know `where to write' and `where not to write.
                    - So the only way to control the quality of reactions is to create a common belief on the part of those who are here originally that "this is not the place to respond to your feelings".

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1942171122994483283) I tried Election.com's vote matching! It's interesting to see the tally of everyone's matching results, since users don't directly enter their party, so it's a coverage of the distribution of user opinion. Maybe the 11% for Team Mirai is due to its recent addition, so I'll take another look after some time.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1942374854365438098) Yes, the [[vote matching]] question item still doesn't match my interests. I wanted something like "Japan should grow through aggressive technological investment" in the question item.
>  I hope that by the next election we will be able to better determine "what are the appropriate questions".
>  >marblelife_blue: to be honest, the closest party to my idea is not Team Mirai, even if you try election.com or something like that
>  But I want to support Team Mirai because I want to support their attitude of trying to change society through proper "discussion" and system operation, rather than "something close to my current ideology".

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1942227172640665774) Roughly "seats x 100 million yen" will be distributed from everyone's taxes as a political party subsidy, so it's like crowdfunding: "If you achieve these seats, you can do this! !" I wish they would say, "If you win this seat, you can do this! There are too many parties that don't know what they are going to do with everyone's tax money.
>  >chokudai: I've always wondered about the manifestos that political parties put out, basically what they can do should depend on the number of seats they win, so I'm not sure why every party only puts out one. Isn't it correct to say, "If we win 0 seats, we will accomplish this," or "If we win x seats, we will accomplish that." Otherwise, doesn't it make sense?
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1942227653467254901) Well, as far as existing political parties are concerned, "how they actually spent their party grants" is disclosed, so I guess we just need to visualize that more clearly.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1942228099258823076) Is it better to summarize on a party-by-party basis or on an individual basis?
>  There are too many individual politicians, so I still think it would be better to organize them roughly into political parties.

>  On April 1, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) determined the amount of [[party subsidy]] allocation for 2025.
