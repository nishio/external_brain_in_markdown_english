title: "interpersonal barrier"

I think it is an argument that a certain attitude is a [[barrier]] to keep [[pain in the ass (arse)]] away. For example, when a student chastises an old man who approaches him thinking, "I can control him as I want because I am a student," such an old man will not approach him, while an old man who is confident in himself will say, "Hey, he's an interesting guy, On the other hand, an old man who has confidence in himself will say, "Oh, he's a funny guy!
If you continue to use that at 40, you're simply "[[a]] pain in the ass old man.
