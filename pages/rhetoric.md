Rhetoric as the Art of Persuasion" is a concept that originated in ancient Greece and holds an important place in the history of philosophy and thought. Its development and significance in the history of philosophy are explained as follows.

1. the birth of [[sophist]] and rhetoric
- Historical Background: In ancient Greece (5th century B.C.), in [[democratic]] Athens, citizens needed to participate in decision-making through political and legal debate. This led to the development of rhetoric as "[[the]] art of persuasion.

- Sophists:.
        - Sophists such as [[Protagoras]] and [[Gorgias.]] taught the art of argumentation and persuasion through the teaching of [[oratory]] (rhetoric).
    - They pursued arguments with "[[persuasive power]]" rather than "truth" and often took a [[relativistic]] position (e.g., "[[Man is the measure of all things]]").

2. plato and rhetorical criticism
- Plato's position:.
    - In "Gorgias." and "Pied roe (species of sea lion, Pterois volitans)," Plato criticized rhetoric.
    - For him, rhetoric was considered nothing more than "flattery" or "soul-cooking," a technique to manipulate the emotions of an audience and lead them to false conclusions, in contrast to philosophy, which seeks "truth."
    - We believed that the true art of persuasion should lie in philosophical argumentation, which rationally arrives at "truth" through dialogue.

3. systematization of [Aristotle.
- Formation of "The Art of Speech":.
- Aristotle, unlike Plato, saw rhetoric as a useful and ethically operational skill.
    - If the speaker is ethical, that is, if he/she persuades for the public good rather than for private gain, then even "techniques that manipulate the emotions of the audience to lead them to a particular conclusion" would be useful and ethical, although that's not entirely true.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- He defined rhetoric as "the art of speaking about a matter as persuasively as possible within a given context" and positioned it as a complement to logic (logos).
- Three means of persuasion: 1.
    - logos - Persuasion by logical argument.
    - pathos - The power to arouse emotions in an audience.
    - ethos - The character or reliability of the speaker.
- He held that rhetoric was ethically important as part of practical knowledge alongside "dialectic" (dialectic).

4. the Roman period: Cicero and Quintilian
    - [[Cicero]] :
    - The Roman orator Cicero saw rhetoric as an indispensable skill in politics and law, which he described as "the art used by good men for good ends."
    - In "On Orators," he lists a wide range of knowledge and ethical behavior as qualities of an orator.
- [[Quintilianus]]:.
    - In his "Oratorical Instruction," he placed rhetoric at the center of his education, aiming to make the "ideal orator" a "morally superior human being."

5. medieval to modern: rhetoric in transition
- Middle Ages:.
    - In the Christian context, rhetoric was used as a tool in the art of preaching and theological debate.
    - Augustine made rhetoric a means of preaching God's truth.
- Renaissance and Modern:.
    - During the Renaissance, classical rhetoric experienced a revival and regained importance in politics and literature.
    - Although Francis Bacon and Descartes emphasized the establishment of the scientific method and criticized rhetoric as emotional and illogical, there was a reevaluation during the Age of Enlightenment.

6. modernity: re-evaluating rhetoric
- Since the 20th century:.
    - In philosophy of language, sociology, and rhetorical studies, rhetoric is being reevaluated as more than just a persuasive technique, but as a broader skill involved in human interaction with language and the construction of meaning.
    - [[Kenneth Burke]], [[Scheyon]], and others defined rhetoric as the induction of human behavior through the "use of symbols" and analyzed its role in politics and culture.
