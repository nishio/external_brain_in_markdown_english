title: "Arguments about rightness are futile."
---

I got a very concentrated expression, so I wrote it down.

    - [[Relativization of correctness]]
    - [[Definition of correctness]]
    - [[Useful Knowledge]]

    - [[Being beneficial is right.]] If you start saying that, you're stepping into another futile argument about rightness, so it's more useful to distance yourself from the argument about rightness and take the attitude, "This is futile to me."
