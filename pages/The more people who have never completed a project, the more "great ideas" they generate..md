title: 'The more people who have never completed a project, the more "great ideas" they generate.'
---

The more people who have never completed an idea, the more "[[great idea]]" they create. The idea is [[worthlessness]] because it is [[unfeasible]], but since they have no [[experience of completing it]], they cannot understand it and it will always be a [[great idea]].


> It may sound strange, but I believe that "people who have never created a finished product can create the most wonderful ideas," and you can finally realize that "the work you thought was great was unrealizable" when you create [[the finished product]], but if you don't complete it, it will always That work will remain great.
