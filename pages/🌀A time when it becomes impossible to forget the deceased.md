title: "🌀A time when it becomes impossible to forget the deceased"
---

Case in point: [[A tweet from 12 years ago is circulating now.]]
- A casual post on a social networking site is still out there 12 years later.
- Assuming he was dead right after this tweet, the "dead person's post will be seen again 12 years later" will happen.
- In the past, when most communication was voice, the "death of the output subject" was the end of the story because it was something that would disappear as soon as you were not there when the output took place
- Writing was created and what was written could be read after death.
    - But the cost of keeping the letters was so high that they were ignored by the general public.
- The cost of keeping the letters, and the cost of others to distribute the letters that are left behind, has decreased dramatically over the past few decades.
- Even if you don't want to remember, you can't reduce the probability of seeing the most circulated information and remembering it to zero.
    - The cost of going to zero is rising.

- The story of how the creation of YouTube has increased young people's knowledge of songs from a time when they were not yet born.
- In the past, it was difficult to access even if interested.

### Summary of notes
.
A discussion of the times when we cannot forget the deceased.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The notebook and the "fighting the past" fragment are related in terms of the influence of past memories and experiences on the present. The "forgetting more than we realize" fragment is also related in terms of the theme of the imperfection of human memory.

### deep thinking
This note emphasizes the psychological aspect of human beings that past memories and experiences influence present actions and thoughts. At the same time, however, it also shows the importance of dialogue with our past selves and self-understanding.

### Summary
.
Social networking posts continue to circulate after the death of the poster. Writing was born, and what was written could be read after death, but was ignored by the general public because of the high cost of leaving letters behind. Recently, however, the cost of preserving the written word has been greatly reduced, and information is now widely distributed. However, the probability of seeing and recalling the circulated information cannot be reduced to zero, and that cost is rising.

### Relevance
.
This note is related to fragments of Nishio's research notes "Between Tweet and Long Text," "Text Transcription CUMOT2018," and "A Case of New Sprouts Growing from Socially Triggered Dead Text." These fragments include a discussion of social networking posts and text output, and are related to the circulation of social networking posts, which is the subject of the note.

### Opinion
.
While the phenomenon of persistent circulation of social networking posts increases information accessibility, it can also lead to information overload and privacy issues. In addition, the observation that the cost of zeroing in on the probability of recalling information is rising indicates a new challenge in the age of information overload.

### Summary of notes
.
Social networking posts circulate over a long period of time, and the deceased's posts may be visible to the public. In the past, voice communication was the norm and information was quickly lost, but with the creation of letters, information began to remain. However, the cost of leaving text was high, so the public ignored it. Recently, however, the cost of retaining text has dropped dramatically, and information is now widely distributed. As a result, it has become impossible to completely avoid information that one does not want to recall.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The notebook is directly related to the "age in which it becomes impossible to forget the deceased" fragment. Both deal with the theme of information circulating over long periods of time and the impact of past information on the present.

### deep thinking
This phenomenon represents a new phenomenon in which the increased persistence and accessibility of information increases the likelihood that information from the past will have an impact on the present. This provides a new perspective on information distribution and memory persistence.
