schedule
    - Organize the table of contents of [[KJ method Let the chaos speak for itself]] in Kozaneba.
    - I've seen "The Importance of Achievement and the Experience of Achievement" and that's it!
    - It is important to have the experience of accomplishing the KJ method alone, rather than in a team of several people.
        - [[The KJ method is not powerful without individual work.]]
    - Organize [[KJ method]] pages
    - Last time I tried to delve into the "nodes of thought" that weren't organized in the first place, I got lost along the way.
            - [[Organize Scrapbox links in Kozaneba]]
        - No, I saw a lot of improvements in the tools, so fixing them was a priority.
    - This was not done today.

- [[Fixed size group titles are unreadable when zoomed out]]
- I can't read it, and neither can KJ Law.
