- > Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit, published in 1807, depicted the process by which "[[awareness]]" starts at the lowest level of "Perception of the object," passes through "experience" to "[[self-consciousness]]," and then to the higher level of "[[reason]]," that is, pure self-knowledge in the absolute [[reside elsewhere]]. reason]", i.e., the process of reaching the "absolute intelligence" of pure self-knowledge in the absolute "reside elsewhere", which marked an era in modern philosophy.
