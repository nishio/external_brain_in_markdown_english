title: "A book as a collection of characters"
---

- The reason [[book]] is in the form of a "collection of letters" is because when the cost of reproduction became cheaper through letterpress printing, it was the "collection of letters" that benefited from the lower cost.
As a result, when letterpress printing increased the volume of books in circulation, the "collection of letters" form became the de facto standard, and people assumed that this is what a book was supposed to be.

There is no guarantee that this [[Legacy format of books]] is still the best means of knowledge transfer in this day and age.

In Japan, there used to be [[woodblock printing]] publishers.

modern times
- Color printing is an additional cost compared to two-color black-and-white printing of text, but it is not significant, and color books are normally distributed.
- Digital does not increase distribution costs when illustrations are included.
- Production costs will rise.
    - In the normal flow, the author draws a draft of the illustration, the illustrator finishes it beautifully, the author looks at it and gives feedback for minor corrections, and so on.
    - This is high cost because [[anchoring]] on "what the book's figures should look like" is high.
        - The state in which "the quality is not really needed, but because it is the one we see most often, we assume that we need it."
        - The author cannot meet that high "assumed demand level" alone, which is why the illustrator's clean-up phase is necessary.
        - Especially 10 years ago, it was difficult to publish as is because what the author could produce was "hand-drawn pictures taken from photographs" or something like that (low contrast, hard to pull out backgrounds).
        - Now you can write with iPad +Apple Pencil to get clear contrast lines on a homogeneous background.
            - You can draw in path format and output as PDF for later editing.
    - There is room for this to be destructive.
        - In other words, the quality of the diagrams provided is reduced from "illustrator's clean drawings" to "author's drawings".
        - More illustrations can be added by making the illustrations less expensive.
        - If what the market wants is "more illustrated commentary," then it should sell.
