title: "Close tasks when you are not motivated."

>  If you don't have [[willingness (e.g. to do something)]], you can look for "issues that are done but somehow not closed" or "issues that don't need to be done anymore" and close them, and you will feel like you are working hard even though you are not actually doing anything. It contributes to mental health.
> When there is nothing left to close, the next step is to create a smaller issue, saying, "This is too big an issue for me right now. ...... I'm going to make a smaller issue. This also contributes to [[mental health]] by making you feel like you're working hard even though you're not actually doing anything.
