title: "Intellectual products are colored by money."

> [[Money has a color.]] That's my theory. [[intellectual production]] goods have a high [[profit ratio]] and money has a color. （If the total value of [[intellectual production]] exports is 100, the profit ratio is 40 to 50. On the other hand, if the total amount of manufacturing hardware exported from Japan is 100, the profit ratio is 3 to 5. The color of money is very light.
    - [[Masayoshi Sun]] is reported to have said.
