The self-referential dilemma is that if one assumes that "all knowledge is regulated by social and ideological conditions," then the sociology of knowledge itself, which makes this claim, is subject to the same regulations, and thus cannot ensure an objective position.

Late 1920s
- [[Karl Mannheim]], [[Ideology and Utopia]] (German 1929, English translation 1936)
    - Ideological generalization: every position's thinking is "situated" in social and historical conditions
    - Advocate of the sociology of knowledge, and a holistic relativization of "everyone's ideas are rooted in some position" based on an analysis of class, generation, education, and other factors.
    - Self-treatment in the same book
        - Awareness of the danger of falling into relativism
        - Relativism: Claims to approach a "higher synthesis" by comparing and integrating multiple perspectives [[a reflective method]].
        - Tried to get by with a relative synthesis of "[[floating intellectuals]]" rather than complete objectivity
            - Mannheim assumed a semi-peripheral position of "[[free-floating intelligentsia]]" as the research subject and said that the paradox could be avoided by attempting to [[integrate multiple perspectives]].
                    - [[relativism]]
                    - Truth is totally subjective. It cannot be superior or inferior between viewpoints.
                    - Result: [[epistemological nihilism]].
                - Relationalism (Mannheim)
                    - The viewpoints are partial, but comparative and integrative methods are possible. Multiple perspectives can be approached from a "broader perspective.
                    - Result: [[progressive relativization]] and [[self-reflection]].
    - Manheim's Aim
        - Extend the ideological concept and make visible the fact that "[[everyone is]] relative"
        - Nevertheless, as a way to continue academic criticism, we propose the model of "[[relationalism]] + [[free-floating intellectuals]]".
1964 (re-recorded in 1973)
- [[Clifford Geertz]] "[[Ideology as a cultural system]]"
    - Criticizes postwar theories of the "end of ideology" and redefines ideology as a symbolic system that weaves meaning
    - In the process, he named Mannheim's self-referential problem "Mannheim's Paradox."
    - Pointing out the trap of self-nullification: "The viewpoint that exposes an ideology is also an ideology."
    - Prescription for Giatsu
        - A thick reading (THICK DESCRIPTION) of how a culture's "stories, symbols, and rituals" support world perception, without reducing it to interest reduction or social positioning only.
            - In order to avoid the infinite regress of "expose the position → be exposed again," we shifted our focus to cultural analysis at the symbolic/narrative level.
            - Re-understood ideology not as a "false perception" but as a "symbolic framework for grasping and ordering the world.
        - Converting the impasse of positionality into a "weave of meaning" analysis



Background - Mannheim's Sociology of Knowledge
- Karl Mannheim (1893-1947), in Ideology and Utopia (1929 German edition / 1936 English translation), proposed "[[relationalism]], [[a]] way of thinking that is tied to the social position of its bearer.
    - This expanded ideological concept relativizes the thinking of all positions, not just a particular class.
Paradox Contents
- Self-destruction of universal claims
    - If "everything is an ideology," then the proposition "everything is an ideology" itself becomes an ideology and loses its foothold as a truth claim.
- Infinite regress of criticism
    - No matter which viewpoint exposes the ideology of the other, it falls into a chain of events that exposes that viewpoint as yet another ideology.
Raising and naming
- The term itself was made explicit in 1973 by anthropologist Clifford Geertz, who likened it to Zeno's paradox and described it as "a problem that shakes the objectivity of sociological analysis.
