title: "handle"
---

- The [[concept]] is connected to the easy-to-mention word "[[handle]]" and is usually operated with that handle.
    - [[Concept Handles]]
    - The term "[[Concept Handles]]" comes from [Douglas Carl Engelbart
    - However, when you say "[[handle]]" in Japanese, the image of something you turn on your car comes to mind.
            - [[Difference between Japanese and English handles]]
    - I'm using it in the sense of [[handle]] to operate.

Referring to papers, etc. is something I have no choice but to do when I have to state the source, and it's usually hard to keep the title of the paper or something else in my brain, so I make up my own easy-to-reference words and use those.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I've even tried to rephrase it as "handle" because "handle" makes me think of a car steering wheel, but "handle" is still the word I usually use to refer to this concept...

> When you have a word, you can use that word to do [[THINKING]]. The elusive, fuzzy idea is given a "handle" called "[[term]]" and can be manipulated by grabbing the handle. Water is not portable as it is, but when you put it in a container, you can carry it around.
- [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]] p.136 "Get the [[Tools of Thought]]" [[(4.5.3.3) Get the tools of your thinking]].

> Even if it is something that only you can communicate, words are the handles, and it is easier to [[operate]] with them.
- [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]] p.207 "Summary of [[verbalizing]]" [[(6.2.6) Summary of Linguisticization]].

> [[Engelbart]] held that language is a means by which individuals break down their perceptions of the world into "[[concepts]]" for modeling the world. Language maps [[symbols]] to these "concepts" and is used to consciously manipulate the "concepts. Consciously manipulating this concept, he believes, is "[[consider]]. What does it mean to model the world? It means observing the world, finding common [[patterns]] that appear repeatedly, and selecting only the useful ones to model. Design patterns were created by observing many programs and naming the structures that appeared repeatedly. This is exactly what creating a "language" is. By creating a language, humans can think, "Let's make a mediator pattern here," instead of thinking, "Instead of lots of things interacting with each other, let's make a design that feels like it creates something that mediates the interaction," which reduces the effort of thinking. This is the benefit of mapping symbols to concepts.
- [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]] p.36 Column: [(Column) To name the pattern.

Q: I think "[[container]]" or "[[container]]" is more intuitive, but why the handle?
A: [[AUGMENTING HUMAN INTELLECT: A Conceptual Framework]].
>  The grasping and handling done by these mechanisms can often be facilitated if the concept is given an explicit "handle" in the form of a representative symbol.
The literal translation of "handle" in "handle" and the indefinite [[Metaphor of liquid in a container]] is a chronological sequence that came about after the fact in the process of my writing.

Q: Why not [[glass (i.e. drinking vessel)]]?
A: In my brain, it's [this](https://www.biccamera.com/bc/item/3643684/). w

> If you use "[[pot]]", the image of "a vessel that can hold multiple ingredients at the same time" becomes stronger. If you prefer it that way, "[[pot]]" would be easier to understand, or simply "[[cup]]" for a single container and one type of liquid.

see  [[handle]]
- When we use the expression "handle of a concept," we are using it in the sense of [[handle]] for manipulation.

handle
In [[Douglas Carl Engelbart]] [[AUGMENTING HUMAN INTELLECT: A Conceptual Framework]]:

>  The [[grasp]]ing and handling done by these mechanisms can often be facilitated if the [[concept]] is given an [[explicit]] "[[handle]]" in the form of a representative [[symbol]].
