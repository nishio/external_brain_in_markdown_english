It's probably the only time it's not magic.
> [mizchi](https://x.com/mizchi/status/1909108047135584511) It's probably only now that [[coding agents]] are not [[magic]], and if we don't get the experience of stacking [[building blocks]] against [[complexity]] with the trial and error of the community If we don't experience the experience of building up [[building blocks]] against [[complexity]] with the trial and error of the community, we're going to be [[black-boxing]] next year.

> We need to experience the stacking experience with the trial and error of the community.
- [[Experience with the community]]
        - [[collaboration]]
    - [[Trial and error together]].
- [[building blocks stacked on top of each other]].
        - [[Stack boxes on top.]]

    - [[The Magic Century]]
        - [[Re-magic of the world]]
