- [The "don't make money" is not about morality, it's about science. It's a logical no-no - Special Talk Project with Kawakami Ryosei: "Gamers should aim for more management! Part 2 - 4Gamer.net](https://www.4gamer.net/games/000/G000000/20111205001/index_2.html)
    - [[Energy Transition Diagram]]   [[Kawakami, Masao]]

- To get from A to B, you have to invest a great deal of energy once to get past the C barrier.
- Low C makes it "doable," but low C makes it [[red ocean]] because anyone can enter
        - [[barriers to entry]]
- The perception of "low C" may itself be a fallacy.
    - There are problems I don't know about.
    - Mis-estimating the height of the mountain.
- Find something that has a high C pile and only we have the [[catalyst]] to lower it
- After exceeding, B must be in a state where energy is available from outside

    - Stable without continually putting energy into it.
    - That is, [[energy level]] must be lower
    - Taking money out of the equation increases the B energy level.
