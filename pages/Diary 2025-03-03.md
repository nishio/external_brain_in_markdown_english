- [[Automatic Translation System 2025-03-02]]
- The automatic translation system, which had been stopped for a while, is now working properly.

- [[AI Task Management 2025-03-03]]
- Add UI for adding tasks to AI task management system (for people to add tasks)
- Added UI for review when AI suggests additional task updates to AI task management system

The test is broken with the addition of the UI, so I've instructed them to improve it.
- More reviews later: [https://app.devin.ai/sessions/3a88adbea0f849a4937e9b4b751eef9d](https://app.devin.ai/sessions/3a88adbea0f849a4937e9b4b751eef9d)

You know, making materials for the LT.
Editing videos, for example.
AI still doesn't do it for me.
