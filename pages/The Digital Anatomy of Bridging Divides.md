The speaker had a background in [[peacebuilding]] and spoke about the role of technology in the [[conflict resolution]] process. Main Topics:.
- The stages of conflict resolution include [[relationship building]], [[information gathering]], [[careful deliberation]], and solution generation. We are exploring suitable platforms and algorithms for each stage.
- Interdisciplinary collaboration between peacebuilding experts and technology specialists is important.
- Three principles to transform conflict:.
    - Moving from fixed positions to deeper interests and needs
    - Moving from simple conflict analysis to interdisciplinary complex understanding
    - Transition from Lose-Lose to Win-Win.
- Symbolic communication as well as rational discussion is important. Ritualistic elements help improve people's relationships.
- Existing SNS platforms lack [[ritualistic signals]] and good intent features. Identity tags, reputation systems, various reaction buttons, AI coaching, etc. are needed.

He argued that there is a need to design a platform that brings together interdisciplinary knowledge and supports symbolic communication.

- It also introduces initiatives in each foundation that are designed to bridge the bottom three conflicts, as well as initiatives that would not bother to show attitude, such as Twitter, in the top two rows.

- In the system diagram for collecting opinions mentioned earlier, it may be possible to narrow down the contents of the form and indicate the intention when communicating opinions to others. Polis 2.0 ([[Talk to the City Study Group]]).
- When I checked with [[Patcon]] at Polis earlier to see if there were any plans for similar functionality, he said there were no concrete tools yet, but that was about six months ago and a long time ago.
