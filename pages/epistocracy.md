title: "epistocracy"

from  [[Urban liberals are insensitive to rural racism]]

In the name of "epistocracy," [[Brennan]], an American political philosopher, proposes in "Against Democracy" a written test to examine [[voter qualifications]].

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757306241985249404) This argument is not new. Since the dawn of the [[representative]] ([[electoral]]) system, those who have argued that [[it is dangerous to give the right to vote to uninformed voters]] have attracted widespread support. It is no secret that it took a long time to break through this debate and bring about [[limited elections]] to [[universal suffrage]].

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757306774745714794) All I can say in response to Brennan's proposal is that it is impossible to "test" political knowledge or political ability. I can't go into details here, but if you think for a moment about, say, who would create and grade that written test, and how to assure that it is valid, the problem would be obvious.
- Well, that makes sense.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
