- It analyzes the relationship between combustible (what burns) and combustible (what is burned) and denies the independent existence of the two.
- It criticizes both the idea that combustion and combustible are the same and the idea that they are different.
- He points to the [[interdependence]] of combustion and combustible and argues that one cannot exist independently of the other.
- The relationship between combustion and combustible is explained by extending it to the relationship between the [[recipient]] (experience) and the [[recipient]] (the entity experiencing).
- It acknowledges the concepts of burning and combustible as secular discourses, but denies their ultimate reality.
- Through the analysis of combustion and combustible, the emptiness (nonautonomy) of all phenomena is explained.
- Finally, he criticizes views that assert the independent existence of a fixed ego or various laws, stating that such views do not understand the true essence of the Buddha Dharma.

This chapter discusses the concept of emptiness, which is at the core of Chūkan thought, through the relationship between combustible and combustible, emphasizing the interdependence and nonentity of phenomena. It shows that this is a logic that can be applied to the analysis of the receiving and the receiver, as well as all phenomena.
