    - People who come up with a lot of [[ideas]] value [[Value of Ideas]] less than those who can't think of any ideas at all and finally come up with one. More emphasis is placed on the existence of [[Execution Resources]] than on the ideas themselves.
    - People with low interest in [[business]] or low bizdev skills are less accurate in estimating the [[Business Value]] of their ideas.
- If you are not good at [[communicating]] with others, especially communicating your [[vision]] and [[involving]] others, think in [[My operating base]] when considering resources to implement your ideas
- People who combine these three attributes will inevitably implement ideas that can be implemented in their own operation, not ideas with high business value.
- How can this situation be resolved?
- Think outside your viability constraints when considering ideas
- When evaluating ideas, don't judge them alone; listen to someone who is good at estimating business value
- But there is a problem: I can see a future where "an idea that has high business value but cannot be implemented by me personally" is selected, and then "I don't see [willingness (e.g. to do something) in this idea".
- Unless you have nothing else to do and you're bored, but if you have a myriad of ideas and they're juxtaposed with things you can execute on your own, you'll leave the ideas you can't advance alone and do the ones you can advance on your own.
- Is it ultimately a question of how [[enthusiasm]] is generated?
- In many cases, the skills for estimating the business value of an idea are not correct, and the estimation is not correct in the first place. and then, when the first shot is a dud, they lose motivation and start working on other ideas.
- The Power of Persistence
    - [[Trade-offs between use and exploration]], which puts the emphasis on exploration.
