title: "Realization of the presence of others"
---

- It's common for people to say to things, "If I put it out of sight, I've forgotten it exists.
- Whether what we don't continue to observe continues to exist while we don't observe it.
    - Logically, they think they exist, but in reality they often feel they don't.
- The same applies to others.
    - While not meeting or communicating online, there is no sense of the other person's presence.
    - Not all of them, it varies from person to person.
    - First-time visitors become non-existent as soon as they leave.
    - By meeting repeatedly, I gradually come to realize that this person exists even when I am not looking.
- People who frequently disseminate information online are more likely to substantiate it because they "see" it frequently
    - However, since it is recognized by social networking icons, if it is not a real person, it is like "I don't remember the actual face, but I have the feeling that it exists".
- The reason we don't talk to other people online as often is because we don't really feel like they are real in the first place.
    - DMing someone when they don't exist is a meaningless act like talking to a void.
    - So many transmissions are in the form of writing and posting in a place that can be read later, this is a style of communication that does not identify the recipient.
- The reason we don't feel much of a sense of community is because we don't have a sense of existence for its members in the first place.
    - A community is only viable if its members feel that they have an ongoing presence.
    - On the other hand, during the execution of the project, there is close communication, so there is a real sense that the other party is real.
    - Close communication is maintained while playing Murder Mystery, so there is a real sense that the other party is real.

        - [[Where individual recognition is possible.]]
        - Interesting perspective on whether [[individual recognition]] / [[ID]] is possible
        - There are about eight of us in play at Murder Mystery, so we have individual recognition.
        - I participated once in a Murder Mystery with about 30 people, which I find difficult because of the lack of individual recognition.
        - It's like dissolving a project and the members dissolve into a sea of about 100 million unidentified individuals.
