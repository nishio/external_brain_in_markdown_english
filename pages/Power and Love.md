<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3/icon' alt='o3.icon' height="19.5"/>
The core definition given by [[Tillich]] ([[Paul Tillich]]) in [[Love, Power and Justice]] (1954)

    - [[power]]  (Power)
    - The drive of everything living to realize itself. It is the drive of everything living to realize itself ... the self-affirmation of life in its self-transcending dynamics, overcoming internal and external resistance"). ... the self-affirmation of life in its self-transcending dynamics, overcoming internal and external resistance").
    - Force is not mere violence or coercion, but refers to "the ability of a being to hold and extend itself against non-being. Thus, legitimate authority and institutions are also considered a form of force.
    - [[love]]  (Love)
    - The drive toward the unity of the separated").
    - Love orients toward union without erasing the uniqueness of the other. For Tillich, love does not negate power, but acts as a self-transcendent orientation of power.

The Interplay of Power and Love
- Tillich regarded "[[love without power becomes]] powerless, and power without love becomes destructive," and placed the equilibrium between the two at the center of ethics. Power aims at [[the self-affirmation of existence]] and love aims at [[the integration among beings]], and when both are integrated, [[right]] (Justice) rises up.


- [[Collaboration with the Enemy]]  p.119
- Most people feel comfortable with either [[love and involvement]] or [power and assertiveness
    - this (indicating an item near the speaker, the action of the speaker, or the current topic)[[親和欲求と達成欲求]]だな<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I'm on the "power and assertion" side.
        - So we need to increase our "love and involvement."
