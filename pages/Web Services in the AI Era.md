Web Services in the AI Era
> [fladdict](https://x.com/fladdict/status/1882764245831721057) People don't understand the real point and threat of [[GPT operator]].
>  In an age when AI does all sorts of things for you in your browser, sites that block AI will not be shopped, researched, or used in the first place... you're facing the possibility.
    - Experienced at [AI Agent Drinking Party

> [hybridhybrid2](https://x.com/hybridhybrid2/status/1882834668342685872) The time has come when the basics of web marketing, access analysis, will become useless,


> [kazunori_279](https://x.com/kazunori_279/status/1882850028911493617) I mean, we don't need browsers and HTML anymore, do we?　All we need is authentication for LLM, RPC and semantic service discovery infrastructure.
> [kazunori_279](https://x.com/kazunori_279/status/1882856575821574321) HTML and UI will be needed only when the AI agent finally shows it to people, but behind the scenes, when the agent searches and makes payments on tens or hundreds of sites, HTML and UI will not be needed. I think only the infrastructure like public MPC will remain.
> [kazunori_279](https://x.com/kazunori_279/status/1882857142685942201) Maybe like Expedia. Maybe everything will be like that one.


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1883091683493249315) In the same way that services were developed for mobile devices and then screens for desktop devices were developed, a development style has emerged where services are developed for AI and then human-oriented screens are developed. This style of development makes the human-oriented screens more cluttered in places where development energy is not strong (and AI-oriented screens are easier to test).
- From [[Mobile First]] to [AI First


> [takiuchi](https://x.com/takiuchi/status/1883195490856223098) The problem with services for AI is that the AI's data processing power is so high that it's like taking the whole data once it's out there, so pay-as-you-go is not viable. That's right. If you want to buy the whole company, yes.

> [kenn](https://x.com/kenn/status/1883468583096688977) "Operator (agent) first" is coming after "mobile first", if you reduce JS code and write element roles declaratively in Aria, you can kill two birds with one stone in terms of accessibility. If we reduce JS code and write the role of elements declaratively in Aria, we can kill two birds with one stone in terms of accessibility.
>  I might even go so far as to make it possible to call agent-specific JS functions if I wanted to.
>  >[threepointone](https://x.com/threepointone/status/1883468583096688977) “operators” should/will eval javascript
>  we’re already talking about building websites and apps that will be easier for LLM driven automation / “operators” to, er, operate. it’ll start with simplified dom and css, clearer aria descriptions, a resurgence of non-js driven forms,
>  "operators" should/will evaluate JavaScript
>  We have already talked about building websites and apps that are easier for LLM-driven automation/"operators" to operate. It starts with simplified DOM and CSS, clearer Aria descriptions, and the return of non-JS driven forms.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1883498681460244582) And I think it's almost a definite future where operator-mediated computer viruses will appear and there will be leaks from companies and some companies will ban them.
> [ringo](https://x.com/ringo/status/1883508015250497705) I can almost see a future where some companies will only allow the operators on Microsoft 365.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1883510018831708358) Too much is there!

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1883528722416112033) Well, but this could be an argument about which is more trustworthy, a human who only logs operations or an AI who logs all the thoughts...
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1883529721574785528) Reaction to this (forgot to paste)
>  >iriyak: I bet this will happen. I'm sure it will be hard for those who chase after them when they think of scenarios like operators (agents) cooperating and splitting the work to do big bad things. x.com/nishio/status/...
    - [[I can see the thought process.]]

> [hrjn](https://x.com/hrjn/status/1883499625979719851) I don't know about viruses, but I'm sure there are a lot of third-party JS (like ads) that embed instructions for operators or XSS-like things.


> [mizchi](https://x.com/mizchi/status/1883527824990171566) In the web2.0 era, there was endless talk about how UI implementation was unnecessary if there was an API, but in the end it didn't mesh with the [[billing model]], so it was enclosed in an app. I don't think it will change so easily unless the [[microtransaction]] mechanism changes, and not for the convenience of the AI side.


> [tokoroten](https://x.com/tokoroten/status/1883530250153521324) After this, I believe that "AI operations are [[rollback]]-enabled IT systems" will become a requirement, and the cost of developing IT systems will explode (or middleware will be developed on that basis). Or middleware will be developed based on that).
