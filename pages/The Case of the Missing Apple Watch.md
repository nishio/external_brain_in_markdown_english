The Case of the Missing Apple Watch
- Wash dishes, get wet, sit on chair outside, realize they are wet, remove them, leave them there forgotten, realize they are not there when you go to the convenience store to pay for them, look at the charger, but it is not there, so you are in trouble.
- Don't leave it there when you remove it.
