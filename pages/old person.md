title: "old person"

> For an old man like me, "[[young person]]" should be thought of as "someone I don't understand and can't admit to.
>  If we only accept those who understand, we will all grow old together.

I sympathize with the direction, but I feel uncomfortable with the expression and am trying to figure out what is causing the discomfort.

After two days of reviewing it, I understand a little more.
- Feeling of drawing clear boundaries between oneself and the youth [[False dichotomy]].
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/204c428508d6b7b68879487b10153611/thumb/1000)
- First, the imaginary Mr. A thinks that "there are young people who 'I can understand and tolerate' and those who are 'inexcusable' and those who are 'not so inexcusable'.
    - Implicitly ignoring or downplaying the values of young people who don't understand them.
    - Ignore them so they appear to be a minority.
- Mr. T. says the antithesis to that is that the latter is the majority.
    - Ignoring the values of young people who don't understand will leave them with old values.
- What bothered Nishio was that this discussion dichotomized the set of "youth" into "those that can be understood" and "those that cannot be understood."
    - In reality, understanding is a gradient
