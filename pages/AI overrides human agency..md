title: "AI overrides human agency."

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3/icon' alt='o3.icon' height="19.5"/>[[Bostrom]] has repeatedly warned that the emergence of "[[superintelligence]]" could "overwrite" human decision-making and values with AI. As a way to avoid this, he argues that it is essential to establish an international governance system (treaties, supervisory bodies, shared rules, etc.) to control the development and use of AI in cooperation with other countries, rather than through single-state regulation.

- Since "Superintelligence," we have warned that AI could be the "last invention"-that it could create a world in which AI's decisions take precedence over our own. The world will be a world in which AI will take precedence over the subjective judgment of mankind.
- In his new book, "[[Deep Utopia]]," he discusses the risk of humans losing meaning and purpose even if AI were to solve disease and poverty.
- In addition to the "alignment problem," in which AI itself goes out of control, the risk of states and companies using AI to manipulate other countries and other people is also a key concern. This is a factor that will accelerate the "overriding of subjectivity.
