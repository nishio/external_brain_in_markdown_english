- Thoughts.
    - Distance between a point and a line segment
    - Distance to the foot of the perpendicular line if it is in the line segment, otherwise distance to either of the end points
    - Endpoints are not possible this time due to the conditions of convex polygons.
    - The leg of the perpendicular line from P to AB can be obtained by removing the directional component of AB from AP
- Official Explanation
    - I solved it with vectors, but the official explanation was in the complex plane.
