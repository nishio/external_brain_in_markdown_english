Order of appearance of the five basic questions
- Once we stopped trying to randomize and put the questions in score order.
    - Where? →Where? →What kind? →What else? →What kind?
- fixed in this order. What kinds of things in this [[FIVE BASIC QUESTIONS]]`? What else? are important, so the order should be changed.`
- Right now (7/2019) I'm rearranging the order of the list of questions to achieve this, but I'll take care of it when I eventually make it NN.
    - What to watch out for?
- Now (2021/1) we're trying to get clogs on the "what kind" and "what else" scores to come out ahead.
    - The other three are NN, which are smaller than these two

- [[Use Case: Importance of Grouping]]
