AI Page Marks

It doesn't make much sense to put a 🤖 mark in the page title.
- Some AI-generated pages already do not.
- How to mark [Pages that sometimes emerge
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>We offer the following proposal for a pictogram that symbolizes something that grows and develops over time.
    - 🌱 (sapling) - indicates an early stage of growth or development.
    - 🌿 (new green leaves) - a stage of gradual growth.
    - 🌳 (mature tree) - Indicates something that has become a solid entity over time.
    - ⏳ (hourglass) - Indicates the passage or flow of time.
    - 🌀 (whirlpool) - represents a flow that continues to change and develop.
    - 🕰️ (table clock) - represents a long passage of time or history.
I like that the spiral "🌀" also corresponds to the loop "🔁", it has a [[neri neri]] feel.

current legend
- 🤖🔁: pages developed by AI every day
- 🌀: [[pages sometimes emerge]].
- 🤖: attached to AI generated pages in the past history.
    - Some AI-generated pages are not attached.
            - [[Extending the Red Link with AI]]
    - I don't believe at this point that it should be attached.
        - [[🌀Human-AI Boundaries]]
        - [[Boundary between humans and AI]]
use case
- I'm extending the red link when I want to expand on a certain keyword right now.
- Not in the form of a red link, but let the thought sleep overnight (🤖🔁) on what you want to see go first.
- It doesn't have to float every day, but after a while it will 🌀 something good if it floats.
    - Only one floats per day (not implemented).
        - PS: Implemented ✅[[Iterative Commenter]].
