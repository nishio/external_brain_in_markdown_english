title: "Who knew the knowledge and who made it."
---

A person A who created some knowledge X as a result of thinking about it, and a person B who saw it and knew that "it already exists." and person B who saw it and knew that "it is already there".

Person A who made it has a [[Knowledge Network]].
- The X that floats on the surface of the water is the result, there is a lot of thinking going on below the surface.
    - [[Pyramid of knowledge]] is building up.

Not sure if person B who knew has a [[knowledge network]].
- Can present [[Related Knowledge]] if available
    - A "I think it's like this" B "Oh, it's a concept called X, and you can use it to draw the conclusion that, for example, choice Z is better in situation Y."
- People who cannot present relevant knowledge
    - Raises suspicion that there may be no network

        - [[Knowledge consumers]], not [[Knowledge producers]].
    - [[Easy to say after you've seen it.]] :  [[Columbus' egg]]

Why does B sometimes act like a big jerk to A?
- has demonstrated that A has [[knowledge production capacity]], whereas B has not.
- The world as a whole would be richer if resources were concentrated in A.
    - Since the knowledge generated by A enriches the future B
- It is better to give [[Peripheral Knowledge]] more and more so that A's production capacity is not consumed by "reproduction of what has already been produced
    - A B that can do that is a "good B."
    - B who cannot do it but makes statements that discourage A is a "bad B."
    - Bad B's are harmful to the world.
        - Because of the personal greed of personal pride, we are dragging the producers down and undermining the public interest.
