title: "Future Generations Bill"
---

> The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) has compiled a draft framework for a "Future Generations Bill" (tentative name) that would establish an independent study committee of experts and young people in the Diet to examine environmental and energy policies and make recommendations to the government from the perspective of future generations. The bill is intended to create a stir in the current situation in which the government is deciding important policies, such as allowing the rebuilding of nuclear power plants, bypassing parliamentary debate. The bill will be submitted to the ordinary Diet session next year in a bipartisan manner after reflecting the opinions of citizens. （The proposal will be submitted to the ordinary Diet session next year in a bipartisan manner.)

Progress to date
- December 2022 - The Tokyo Shimbun scoops up the draft framework.
- June 2023 - A trial version of the "Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan Committee for the Future Generation" is established within the party. Eleven members meet once or twice a month to review policies.
- October 2024 - Policy Book 2024 states that the company aims to enact the Future Generations Act.
- Spring 2025 - Bipartisan discussions are ongoing as members of the ruling and opposition parties have mentioned the need for a "Future Generations Committee" during the discussion of related pension and energy bills (timing of submission has not yet been determined).

4. issues and challenges
- 4-1 Difference in temperature between ruling party and ministries
    - Cautious stance on the part of the LDP and bureaucrats, stating that "if it is limited to environmental energy, the effect will be limited."
    - The Legislative Secretariat is concerned about "conflicts of authority with existing committees".
- 4-2 Pros and cons of scope expansion
    - Civil society groups requested that social policies such as poverty and education be included in the scope.
    - The dominant theory in the party is that it will first target climate and energy, and then expand in stages as it gains a track record of success.
- 4-3 Ensuring Effectiveness
    - The key is not to keep the recommendation as an "effort obligation" but to connect it to KPI setting and budget assessment tied to EBPM.
    - The Welsh law ensures effectiveness through "accountability obligation + inducement of judicial review," and designing a Japanese version of the system is also an issue.
