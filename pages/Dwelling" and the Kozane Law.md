title: 'Dwelling" and the Kozane Law'

2021-12-08
One specific methodology for "[[reside]]" is to place sticky notes such as [[knee-swing (gymnastics)]] or the KJ method.
By creating a pseudo "symbolic space for the other party" through the placement of sticky notes, we "live" by working within that space.

example
    - [[Segmentation of experience]]

relevance
    - [[Heidegger]]
        - [[reside]]  = [[dwell]]
        - [[Housing - Thoughts]]  = [[dwell-think]]
    - [[Mind Palace]]
