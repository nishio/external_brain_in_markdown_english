## digest of notes
.
It describes the idea that "the best way to predict the future is to create it yourself.

## Relation to Fragment
.
The note "The best way to predict the future is to create it ourselves" is related to Nishio's research fragments such as "Make the Future Self Understand," "Thinking to Create the Future," and "Using Easy Methods to Focus on Intellectual Production." These fragments complement and deepen the claims of the note by advocating the perspectives of self-creation, proximity to others, and invention as methods for predicting the future.

## deep thinking
Emphasizing self-creation as the best way to predict the future is important from the perspective of intellectual production. Self-creation enables us to enhance our own knowledge and skills and to produce knowledge that our future selves can understand. This concept is also valid in that self-creation allows us to create the future we desire for ourselves.

[[**Title of Thought]]
"The Possibility of Predicting the Future through Self-Creation."
