Background of the construction of the corona countermeasure system in Saitama Prefecture
[Municipalities are on the verge of a flat tire due to the spread of corona infection. Saitama Prefecture created a kintone x corona countermeasure system in a week - Log Me Biz](https://logmi.jp/business/articles/323753).

> In the context of Corona support, there are tasks that have never been done before, and I think it is difficult to find a system on the market that can handle such tasks.
>  I think that the strength of kintone, which can build operations very quickly, fit in well where there was no system on the market and we had to do urgent work in an analog manner.

When the time comes for new business, it cannot be covered by existing systems and there are no off-the-shelf products
That's where [[kintone]], which is "[[a system that]] creates systems," was good.

> Kakogawa City employees built a system on kintone from scratch... An example of an application template created and published on Kakogawa City's open data catalog site
>  Although different in size, the content of the work of local governments does not differ greatly, so it is easy to deploy this kind of system horizontally. In addition, since the municipalities are non-profit organizations, it was easy to share the system with them.

- The [[platform]] will be common, so that what you make on that platform can be [[horizontally]] deployed.

Case Studies in [Saitama Prefecture

- Ability to move horizontally from other municipalities.
    - Fast track to release in just one week.
- Free trial period and no initial cost.
    - [It's easy to take on a challenge with a "no-no.
    - > In municipalities, budgets are sometimes allocated for the actual system, but the cost was so low that it could be done in the execution of the system without a budget.
            - [[budgetary uncertainty]]
- Items can be added and functions can be added quickly after installation.
    - > The third is that even someone like me, who is not well versed in the field, can make various changes in a flexible manner. It is designed in such a way that it can be easily created by drop-and-drag, and I intuitively felt that I could do it myself.
        - [[Ease of change on site]]

[[Sagamihara City]]
[It's not just the number of infected people that has increased due to the coronary disaster, Sagamihara City realized with kintone, the benefit management system for ups and downs - Log Me Biz](https://logmi.jp/business/articles/323754)
- When we considered this system, the grant had begun.
    - The more time passes, the more the demand for this system itself disappears. In such a situation, we needed to be fast enough to prepare a system that could be used right now.
- There were several similar systems available from other companies and vendors, but all of them were template-based offerings.
    - Sagamihara City wanted to prepare a very simple and clear search system
    - There were some areas where there were a very large number of input items or items could not be deleted.
    - So the system had to be [[flexible]] enough to accept the so-called specifications and needs of Sagamihara City.
- We, the Information Policy Division, absorbed detailed requests from the sections in charge and conveyed them to Cybozu.
    - The next day, roughly overnight, the requests we had given them were actually reflected in the system, and we could already see and touch it.
    - We then feed the feedback back to the section in charge, have them touch and look at it, and we compile the opinions that come up again and communicate them to Cybozu.
        - [[agile]] type development could actually be done.
