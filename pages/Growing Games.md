title: "Growing Games"

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>I find tokoroten's series of tweets an interesting discussion on how to give games to children. Using the four elements of play ("competition," "luck," "simulation," and "vertigo") from [[Kaiyowa]], he analyzes the types of games and how to play them.
In summary, tokoroten's argument is as follows
- It is not a good idea to get too carried away with a game that is predominantly "dizzy" or "lucky." There is a danger of cognitive outbursts or being dominated by pleasure.
- On the other hand, games that focus on "competition" or "simulation" help develop metacognitive and learning skills. Habits of planning and introspection are developed.
- However, it does not matter if the game contains elements of "luck" or "vertigo". What is important is that they are subordinate.
- If cognitive skills are underdeveloped, there is a danger that the "competitive" element of the game will not be recognized and the player will react only to "luck" or "vertigo".
- If they can recognize that the game is "competition" oriented, they will not be happy or sad about a single win or loss, but will make improvements in order to increase their winning percentage.

In my opinion, tokoroten's point is spot on. [In order to avoid dependence on games and to encourage constructive play, parents need to understand the characteristics of games and give them to their children appropriately according to their cognitive development. I felt that games can be a good tool for learning and growth if they are used well.

>  "Trying one's luck" is a state of forced pleasure that bugs the future prediction part of the brain.
>  "Competition" and "monomania" require meta-cognition through recognition of others and self, and pleasure through learning (future prediction, intervention, success)

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1785225590649569479) It's hard to get a "try your luck" -> "competition" sequence.
>  There is quite a bit of "luck" to get into the game and "competition" to improve.
>  Mahjong, for example.

>  Underdeveloped cognitive abilities prevent recognition of the competitive elements of the game and react to the luck and dizziness part of the game.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1785309266192240898) Once you can properly recognize that it's a "competition", you'll realize that it's a game of winning and losing, so you won't be happy or sad at a single win or loss! ......
