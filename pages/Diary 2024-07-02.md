- [[Daimine Climbing 2024]]

I'm keeping track of tweets because I think the gubernatorial election is a historical epoch.
- I'm too busy to organize it, but I can keep it for now and organize it later.


Media and Advertising
- Both Asahi and Mainichi newspapers had Takahiro Yasuno as a major candidate as of 6/20, but not TV?
    - Why is that?
    - Is it correct to interpret that the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has become Dentsu's client and that Dentsu is influencing the TV station's news coverage by projection mapping of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, as discussed in X, or is it a conspiracy theory?
- At least, what I have learned from this case is that I used to underestimate the mass media as a whole, but there are many different types of mass media.
> [momopoukss2008](https://x.com/momopoukss2008/status/1802294814123475199) My eldest daughter asked me, "Why do they only report Koike and Renho as Tokyo governors? That in itself is already ridiculous. It would be so interesting if Ms. Yasuno became the governor of Tokyo. Politics is really boring, isn't it?
>
>  Who is Yasuno-san? I looked it up without thinking, but now high school students are amazing!

> [loverubywan](https://x.com/loverubywan/status/1807780416612696422) I voted today. I voted for Takahiro Yasuno. I'm not sure how much more votes I can get, but NHK's biased news coverage is terrible, and they only show the main 4 candidates. I guess commercial broadcasters are still better. Even though I'm an NHK watcher, I'm so disgusted by the lack of fairness that I've drastically reduced the amount of time I spend watching TV.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1808099148249587724) As of the public announcement date of 6/20, several newspapers reported on #TakahiroAnno, many magazines and newspapers reported on him, and the Waseda University Manifesto Institute gave him the highest score. Waseda University Manifesto Research Institute gave him the highest score. If TV does not report on this situation, what is strange? Will not the eyes of the people of Tokyo turn to the TV for doubt?


> [n0_vnr](https://x.com/n0_vnr/status/1807706543028388227) I tried Yasuno's live delivery for the first time. He talked about specific things that were not sterile. He talked about how things could be better if we did this and not that. It was like, "Let's talk about how we can make it better. It was very ordinary, but I think this is what they were looking for.



> [jujunjun110](https://x.com/jujunjun110/status/1808083029841399956) Then the article about broad listening. I felt that by interspersing this visualization process, we can get a bird's eye view of opinions and make more appropriate decisions, rather than simply the number of posts or the wordiness of the posts. We also use this information to make decisions on the acceptance of policy proposals.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1807789387989823754) "I made this public because I thought it would be one factor for voters to clarify who the media offered and what the results were. If your strategy is to go to media outlets that favor you and reduce exposure to debates and interviews, I think that stance is one important piece of information." This is an interesting conceit.
>  >[nanatakamatsu](https://x.com/nanatakamatsu/status/1807781256115200510) [[Status of coverage of the gubernatorial election]]...


> [kc_p_2](https://x.com/kc_p_2/status/1807782325079658712) If you ask me if Renho is a challenger, she is not. I think Ishimaru-san, Himasora Akane-san, and Yasuno-san are the challengers. Ishimaru-san will go directly to Yuriko Koike to beat her up in a public debate, and Himasora Akane-san will bring attention to the public money choo-choo and expose the dark side of Yuriko Koike. Ms. Yasuno will fight on her own lines.



> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1807589775807025464) To put this into words that I feel are often overlooked, the feature of this project is that there are many IT engineers among the volunteer supporters, not in the form of outsourcing systems or outsourcing work, and that is why the project was initially not planned to be created. Therefore, "Phone AI Anon", "Poster Map", and "Advance Voting Map", which were not planned to be created at the beginning, were created based on the situation, which is a bottom-up business improvement.
>  >takiyori0608: I find it interesting that there's a "tech blog" thing in the election, or that there's a "development team" to begin with.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1807782757533356253) I've never heard the expression "libero" before, and I'm not sure if I understand it correctly, but probably it's a "ranger" kind of thing. I guess that kind of person is what makes a "young organization" possible.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1807737408852832716) "I don't like Ms. Koike, so I have to put in Ms. Renho."
>  While saying such things, they say, "It's terrible that we have to choose between these two options. We are the ones who are trapped in the composition of the two choices, and we are the ones who are reproducing the composition of the two choices. Why don't they just read the manifestos of the 6 main candidates and choose the one they think is the best?

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1807751975074988230) There were nine of us.
>  >The Waseda University Manifesto Research Institute has released a website, "#Kurarabe Erabu," which examines the promises of nine candidates.

> [Holms6](https://x.com/Holms6/status/1807374864699084859) I don't think Shinji Ishimaru has any intention of getting elected. I think he ran for the purpose of publicity for himself and to drag down Renho who relies on independents. If Yuriko Koike wins this election, she will surely run for the LDP's endorsement in the next national election. In my opinion, voting for Shinji Ishimaru will help Koike.

> [marumasa58](https://x.com/marumasa58/status/1807724435933446499) Justice Ginsburg is a good example, but an aging liberal is an authority in itself, and the idea of liberalism itself can't legally exclude old people. That's why this happened sometime ago.

> [miura_takako](https://x.com/miura_takako/status/1807623569834451181) Young people may not know this, but 30 years ago, there was a political group that ran a singing and dancing campaign. After losing the election, they carried out a series of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, causing many casualties and shaking the world.
>  Since then, the Japanese have come to feel threatened by singing and dancing election campaigns.

> [sabiuyack](https://x.com/sabiuyack/status/1807681207716745571) I don't think it is true that Takahiro Yasuno has only policies in his manifesto that are pro-IT-AI technicians' constituents. Or rather, the contents are even disadvantageous to engineers. If talented engineers came from all over the world, it would increase their rivals and make it harder for them to get a job.

> [YNrisada](https://x.com/YNrisada/status/1806971171742884035) One of the many things I realized after serving as a board member in my previous position is that the presence of female board members seems to have a certain effect in eradicating discrimination against women in organizations.
>  When female executives express their honest and frank opinions at management meetings, it naturally creates an atmosphere that makes it difficult to engage in sexist discussions and decisions, and this is conveyed to the members of the board.

> [paddy_joy](https://x.com/paddy_joy/status/1807467166603628678) Incidentally, there was a study that showed that women are not disciplined because they are dealing with a male community, but they are disciplined inside a female community. In other words, it is easy to say something because you are an outsider. On the other hand, it may be difficult to point out something without discovery in a community such as PTA, where women are the majority.

> [vottom](https://x.com/vottom/status/1807574428840272295) I interpret what Takahiro Yasuno is doing in the Tokyo gubernatorial election as perhaps his intention to present a prototype of local government using digital technology to get people to imagine it. If that is the case, I think that 90% of the voters (even if they could see it) would not get the message.

Just like a rubber band, once it loosens in an election, it will not return to its original state.

If you don't agree with this, then you don't share Mr. Anno's ideology in the first place, and I think you are right not to vote for him. If you think "cut your hair," then you don't share Mr. Anno's vision of society.

I'm not sure how much more votes I can get, but NHK's biased news coverage is terrible, and they only show the main 4 candidates. I guess commercial broadcasters are still better. Even though I'm an NHK watcher, I'm so disgusted by the lack of fairness that I've drastically reduced the amount of time I spend watching TV.

> [n0_vnr](https://x.com/n0_vnr/status/1807706543028388227) I tried Yasuno's live delivery for the first time. He talked about specific things that were not sterile. He talked about how things could be better if we did this and not that. It was like, "Let's talk about how we can make it better. It was very ordinary, but I think this is what they were looking for.

> [toriyamazine](https://x.com/toriyamazine/status/1807726044054683817) I have written about this many times, but the method Lenin employed when he destroyed democracy in Russia was to deliberately increase the number of deputies so that nothing would be decided in the parliament. He deliberately increased the number of deputies so that nothing would be decided by the parliament, and then he created "committees" composed of a small number of deputies and transferred the decision-making power to them to achieve dictatorship. Debate in the open is no good for the same reason as this.

> [Holms6](https://x.com/Holms6/status/1807374864699084859) I don't think Shinji Ishimaru has any intention of getting elected. I think he ran for the purpose of publicity for himself and to drag down Renho who relies on independents. If Yuriko Koike wins this election, she will surely run for the LDP's endorsement in the next national election. In my opinion, voting for Shinji Ishimaru will help Koike.

If you looks something interesting but the auto-translated English is not good enough to understand it, feel free to let me know at [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en).
