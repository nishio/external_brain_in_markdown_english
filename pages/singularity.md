<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The concept of singularity is the idea that science and technology will evolve exponentially, fundamentally changing human life and knowledge. The term was originally used in mathematics and physics, but it was not until the 1990s that it became commonly known as the technological singularity.

In the 1980s, artificial intelligence researcher [[Vernor Vinge]] popularized the idea by using the term "technological singularity." In his 1993 paper, "[[The Coming Technological Singularity]]," he stated that when technological evolution reaches a point where it creates "[[superhuman intelligence]]," it will radically change the way humans live, society, and solve problems.

The concept has since been cited and developed by many scientists and technologists, especially futurists like [[Ray Kurzweil]]. In his 2005 book, "[[The Singularity Is Near]]," Kurzweil predicted that the Singularity would be reached in the middle of the 21st century, leading to its widespread popularity.
