title: "Creating Links and Meaning"
---

2025-09-18
In the explanation of [[Meanings are likenesses and vice versa]] in [[Study Group 3#61fcad9aaff09e00004a8bdb on "Experience Process and Meaning Creation"]], the relevance to [[Scrapbox Link]] was pointed out (2022-03-22).
Consider this again.

I think it is important to consider this in conjunction with the next section "[[Relation or relata]]" ([[Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning" Study Group 3#61fcad9aaff09e00004a8be9]])

- 1: The naive concept of a link is that there exists a target B to be linked to first.
- 2: However, as anyone familiar with Scrapbox/Cosense knows, Scrapbox/Cosense often makes links to a target X that does not exist
- 3: The reason why we do it is because it is beneficial to connect A and B via X when another page B links to target X in the future
    - When A links to X in (2), this link becomes a bidirectional link with a reverse link.
        - Not useful at (2), but very useful at (3), with links to A and B on page X

- 1: It can be interpreted that A and B are bi-directionally linked by an edge called X.
- 2: It can be interpreted that there is a bidirectional link from A and B to the tag X.
- 3: In Scrapbox/Cosense terms, X is not a special object such as a "tag", but a page object like A and B
    - In addition, a direct link is created between A and B by the [[2-hop link]] mechanism

    - [[Gray Translucent Meaning Diagram]]
- 1: [[bracketing]] feeling that X has more value than just one word in a sentence at the time A is verbalized
- 2: Similarly, when we verbalize B, we feel the value of X and [[bracketing]] it.
- 3: This is connected by the system to discover the existence of A
    - Related: [[Story intersections become atoms...]].
        - The realization that it is an intersection can be achieved without relying on the human brain.
- 4: The fattening of the description of X creates an aspect of A created by X and an aspect of B created by X.
        - [[When a "new aspect" is created, there are three ways in which it can be expressed as a symbol]]
        - In this case, it is first expressed as a "relationship" that "both A and B are referring to X".
        - After that, "aspects of A" and "aspects of B" are derived: "how X is used in A" and "how X is used in B".
        - The comparison of these will encourage the verbalization of X
            - "Aspects of A (derived by X)" and "Aspects of B (derived by X)" become "Aspects of X (derived by A)" and "Aspects of X (derived by B)", due to the fact that X becomes clearer.
- 5: Bracketing the description of X also has symbols of value such as Y and Z.
    - Aspects of A created by X and aspects of B created by X create new Cs and Ds.
        - This looks like [[CIRCUMLOCUTION]].
            - [["Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning" Study Group 3#61fcad9aaff09e00004a8c01]]
        - but the GPT5 commentary made me feel a little differently.
            - [[activation diffusion]] is closer.
            - [[Clarification of blurriness by what you write.]] it clearly says CIRCUMLOCUTION, which means either GPT5 is misunderstanding Gendlin's particular phrasing or I am misunderstanding it.
