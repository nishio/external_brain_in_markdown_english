>  In order to accumulate [[knowledge capital]] and [[SOC]] in a company, it must necessarily be [[membership-based employment]], not [[job type]]. Am I wrong?

>  Nemanja (@udarnik.net)
>  [[cooperative]]?

>  Nishio
>  Membership-based employment is closely related to [[lifetime employment]], which was once common in Japan. It is an employment system that incentivizes being a member of a corporate community throughout one's lifetime.

>  Nemanja
>  It is similar to a cooperative because cooperatives like the one in the Basque Country are also membership based. We had something similar in my country ([[former Yugoslavia]]). It used to be called "[[a]] communal labor organization. The good thing about it was that [[workers also participated in supervision]].

>  Nishio
>  Interesting. I'll have to google it.

>  Nemanja
>  This may be useful: [Mondragon Corporation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation) I don't know the details of how it works as a legal entity, but other types of cooperatives in Spain All cooperatives require some form of capital or membership to participate and become a member.
- [[Mondragon Cooperative]]

>  Nemanja
>  In the case of Yugoslavia, "lifetime membership/lifetime employment" was more tied to the fact that it is legally difficult to fire a worker and workers generally do not fire workers (given that company decisions are shared by employees/union members).
    - [[layoff restrictions]]

>  I didn't know much about Mondragon Cooperative, but I found it very interesting when I looked into it. Thanks for letting me know!
