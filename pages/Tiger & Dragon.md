- Only played 3 times while waiting for a late comer to [[Age of Atlantis (Day2)]].
- interesting
- The rules are simple, and variations are made by replacing the evaluation function for victory points.
- Still not sure what a good play strategy is.



consideration

Assume no Tiger/Dragon and no face down cards to simplify matters.
- Only one card
    - If you put it out on offense, you can come back in without being taken advantage of, and you can discard one card you don't need.
    - We'll call this +1.
- When you have one card with two cards.
    - If I go on the offensive, I'm taken advantage of, and my turn is taken away from me.
    - If the opponent puts it out on offense, you get it and it's your turn.
    - So I don't want to put out as much as possible.
- When you have two cards with two cards.
    - Both +1 card
- When you have one card with three cards.
    - When you put out on offense, someone else receives and someone else gets +1
        - So I don't want to put it out there.
    - Q: Is it the best move to take when you can?
        - Is there a difference in the value of the move number and the +1?
            - probable

For example, when you have three 5s.
- I would describe this as a 3-2.
- If I put myself on the offensive, it's 2-1.
- If someone puts it out and you take it, it's 2-1 and your turn.
- If someone puts it out and someone else takes it, it's 3-0.
    - But it's hard to say if it's best to knowingly skip it, since the person who put it out may have two copies.
    - Either we assume it's best to take it when we can to simplify matters, and assume that other players will behave that way, or we assume that they will behave that way.

The number of cards decreases with each advance and the "probability of getting your turn back" increases.
- When your turn comes back, you can discard cards you don't need.
- Cards that have a high "chance of coming back to play" are difficult to use for receiving.
- Tiger/Dragon is an easy card to use for receiving
