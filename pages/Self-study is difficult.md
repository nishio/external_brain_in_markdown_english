title: "Self-study is difficult"
---

I have heard that some people interpret the phrase "[[self-study]] is [difficult (e.g. customer, guest, child)" to mean "don't be self-studying" or "self-study is [[impossible]]," and I have seen a reference to this, so here is a note
- You don't read what is written as it is written, but distort it with your own interpretation.
    - It is more difficult for such people to learn on their own than it is for those who don't.
    - It is more difficult to realize alone that you are "distorting and interpreting" than it is to realize it when someone else points it out to you.

I say "it's hard to study by yourself" not to tell you not to study by yourself, but to neutralize the poison in the "it's your [[lack of effort]] that makes you unable to study by yourself" discourse that sometimes circulates on the Internet.

I have been thinking about that for a while.

> [taketo1024](https://twitter.com/taketo1024/status/1687246888826011649) When experts say that self-study is difficult, they are humbly saying so based on their own experience and reflection as one of the parties who has studied the field.

>  However, to non-specialists, it sounds like a rejection, "Those without professional education should not enter this field.

>  I am saying here that "self-study is difficult" is a general statement, not limited to the professional level. In fact, there are many adults who are having a hard time relearning high school math. (3/7)

> [taketo1024](https://twitter.com/taketo1024/status/1687246894991560705) The difficulty of self-study lies in the fact that one has to provide the necessary elements for learning alone:.

>  ・Selection of appropriate teaching materials
>  ・Set up a study plan
>  ・Regular assessment of understanding
>  ・Non-verbal knowledge/techniques
>  ・Maintaining motivation

>  The third, "evaluation," is the most difficult part, with the risk of proceeding without realizing the mistake. (4/7)

> [taketo1024](https://twitter.com/taketo1024/status/1687246897956933633) The issue to be discussed is not whether self-study is possible or not, but rather the reality that those who are outside the standard learning route have no choice but to study by themselves I think it is not.

>  In particular, to obtain a professional education in mathematics, it is necessary to enter a university mathematics department, and the environment and opportunities to do so are not equal for all. (5/7)

> [taketo1024](https://twitter.com/taketo1024/status/1687246900737486848) I think the above is not limited to mathematics, but can be said in other academic fields, and even in sports and the arts. (6/7)

> [taketo1024](https://twitter.com/taketo1024/status/1687246903346626560) Summary: In discussing self-study, isn't it constructive to acknowledge that "self-study is difficult" in general terms, and then discuss what individuals or society can do to overcome this difficulty? It would be constructive for experts and non-specialists to exchange opinions on what can be done to overcome such difficulties on an equal footing. (7/7)
