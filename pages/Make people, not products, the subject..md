title: "Make people, not products, the subject."

> [Sales_writing20](https://twitter.com/Sales_writing20/status/1412018673015873538) Write to you. Don't write, "A computer with a high-performance battery for 8 hours of continuous operation." Write, "can work for long hours even in cafes with no power supply." In the former, [[subject]] is the product, whereas in the latter, the subject is the person. This is the basis of how to create benefits/benefits. You can be a muso just by learning this.

I see. Let's give it a try.

- [[Product Description]]
- [[large text that appears in ads or brochures to catch the reader's attention (in copywriting)]]
- [[use a person as the subject]]
- [[sales writing]]

Those connected by suggestions (delete them later if they don't seem relevant)
- [[Make the customer the subject]]
