- Hatred or envy harbored by the ruled or the weak against the ruler or the strong. (Daijirin, 3rd ed.)

Nobuaki Ishikawa
- >  A central concept in [[Nietzsche's]] Christian criticism, meaning "resentment" or "envy".
- >  In "[[Moral Genealogy]]" (1887), Nietzsche traced the origins of Christianity to the Jews' lusantiman against the Romans, and the essence of Christianity to a distorted value evaluation born of lusantiman.
- >  The Jews, the ruled class, harbored resentment and envy toward the Romans, the ruling class, for their strength, active enjoyment of life, and self-affirming nature, and out of this resentment they created a refracted value evaluation: the strong are "bad" and I, the not-strong, am "good".
    - #Self-affirmation
    - #Monarchical morality and slave morality
- >  This shift in values became even more refractory, giving rise to a value evaluation, represented by the phrase "[[Blessed are the poor, for they shall be blessed]]," in which weakness, denial of desire, and failure to enjoy real life are "good," ultimately leading to the Christian idea of [[original sin]], [[asceticism]], and [[nepotism]], Nietzsche believed. Nietzsche believed that this led to the Christian idea of [[original sin]], [[asceticism]], and [[nepotism]].
