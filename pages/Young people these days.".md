Older people who make big assumptions about the subject, "Young people these days are xxxx," are shunned by young people and have no opportunity to correct their misconceptions.

It is widely known that negative descriptions such as "It's inexcusable to be a young person these days" are not good because they are said to have existed since the time of the pyramid.
