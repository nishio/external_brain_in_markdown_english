title: "Genius Channel"

> I created a genius channel on my company's Slack. Whenever a comment is made on a public channel with the emoji "Genius! emoji on a public channel, that comment will automatically appear on the Genius channel. Only the comments that made other people call me a genius will be streamed, so it's a great channel [Wisdom gathers on its own. It's fun to watch.
