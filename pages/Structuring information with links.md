title: "Structuring information with links"
---

- Structuring information with links is not "structuring information with [[layered structure]]".
- The author didn't understand it at first, but it's not "structuring information through tagging" either.
- Scrapbox's [[information structuring]] mechanism is somewhat different from what we are used to. It is better to think so first.
    - Otherwise, they will try to [[stratify]] or pre-tag
- The link can be summed up in one word: "[[suggestion]]."
        - [[mind-map]] Relationships such as "B appears after A when you are running strokes in [mind-map
    - A relationship in which topic B comes up after topic A when you are having a casual conversation with another person.
    - Relationships such as when you are working on a presentation material and after mentioning topic A, you want to mention B.
- Scrapbox is a good tool for describing this relationship
- You may link to a page that does not yet exist.
    - If you think, "I'd like to refer to XXX from this article," you can put a link to XXX at that point.
- There is no need to have a description of the relationship when writing
    - If you're reading page A again and think, "I'd like to touch on the topic of page B from this topic," you can link to it then.
    - Or if you're writing page B and you associate it with page A, you can link to it then.
    - The link is always bidirectional, and the linked page will also indicate that it is linked.
    - Example
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/5f657e0f13f9f58fed5c4cd032d5a547/thumb/1000)

- As this process is repeated, a network of information connected by associative links gradually grows.
- In addition to the human's realization that "Oh, I want to touch on the topic of page B from this topic," there is also a way to write a sentence and then make a link to words that seem important in that sentence.
- In this case, it will usually be a red "unconnected link," but if the same word happens to be a link on another page, it will appear in the associative display at the bottom of the page.
    - Example
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/c2884ea8d44104c34658df4ef25036f9/thumb/1000)
- I wrote that it is usually an "unconnected link".
    - Example
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/cc0733360681e7ebeede575001910390/thumb/1000)
    - The term "link" can easily be misinterpreted as "linking something to something else" at the time of its birth.
    - Rather, it is an image of "a door that may be connected to something in the future.
