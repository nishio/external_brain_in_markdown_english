<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT-4/icon' alt='GPT-4.icon' height="19.5"/>The phenomenon to which you refer is commonly referred to as "[[cross-referencing]]" or "[[mutual evaluation]]." This refers to a situation in which certain individuals or groups of individuals give each other high ratings, which may undermine the intent of the original rating system. This is often considered part of "[[gamification]]" or "[[system gaming]]" and is recognized as an instance where an individual or group manipulates the system and takes advantage of it for gain.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT-4/icon' alt='GPT-4.icon' height="19.5"/>The phenomenon you are referring to may be a "Sybil attack" ([[Sybil attack]]). A Sybil attack refers to an attack in which a single entity creates many fake identities to exploit a system. This is generally done against distributed systems, especially peer-to-peer networks and distributed hash tables.
- However, with respect to folksonomies and rating systems, the phenomenon of "[[rating inflation]]" may be applicable. Rating inflation refers to the phenomenon in which overall ratings increase over time, rendering the original rating scale meaningless. This can occur when a user gives an extremely high rating to another user, resulting in a distorted rating system.
- As for the "˜attacks' you specifically mention, a little more information might provide a more accurate answer.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT-4/icon' alt='GPT-4.icon' height="19.5"/>A "clique attack" is a type of attack on an online social network (OSN) that can easily access third-party information by engineering the OSN's functionality, thereby making the user vulnerable to [[penetration attacks]]. . Such attacks can be dangerous tools in the hands of spammers and phishers.
- Specifically, the "3-Creek attack" is formalized as part of a series of primitive attacks, and its effectiveness is demonstrated using an automated attack system, iFriendU. This attack has shown that it can friend at least 75% more users than any existing attack.
- As a defensive measure, a new OSN security framework, MORPH-x, has been proposed and demonstrated its effectiveness through extensive simulations against large Facebook social graphs. The solution successfully blocks 93-98% of the attacks studied with little computational load on the user1.
- So, a "creek attack" may refer to a phenomenon in which some members manipulate the rating system by giving each other high ratings, thereby deviating from the original purpose. However, it depends on the context of your question, so please choose the appropriate terminology for your specific case.

Collusion can take many forms but it generally implies a strategic cooperation between parties with the intent to deceive or cheat. In the context of online systems, this can often distort results or rankings, leading to an inaccurate representation of public opinion or quality. It can be seen as a form of "gaming the system".
- In the realm of online reviews or ratings, this might also be referred to as "review padding" or "review stuffing". When it is used in a negative sense to bring down the ratings or reputation of competitors, it is often termed as "review bombing".
- It's worth noting that these practices are typically against the terms of service of the platforms where they occur, and they can lead to penalties for the parties involved when detected.
