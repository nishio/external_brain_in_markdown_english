A story with three patterns

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>This image appears to be a diagram showing a step-by-step guide or process using stars and rectangles. The description of each step is as follows
- Step 1: A rectangle containing a single star is transformed by adding a horizontal line in the center. This line bisects the rectangle and the star remains in the upper section.
- Step 2: In the next transformation, three dots or dots appear in the lower section of the rectangle, which become the bases of three lines or bars. These bars support the newly appearing star, which is placed in the lower section directly below the original star.
- Step 3: Here a rectangle is shown divided into two sections. The upper section has a large star and the lower section has a smaller star, with lines or bars between the stars suggesting movement or connection.
Overall, this image may depict a process, game, or educational activity that shows the organization and interaction of shapes and elements.

Title: "Three Patterns"
Upper right legend: above the line "language" below the line "experience
Box (1), left box is "book" and right box is "self
(2) boxes, both self, with t indicating the passage of time on the arrows.
(3) The top two boxes are "books" and the bottom box is "self

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Based on additional information about the image, this diagram, under the title "3 Patterns," seems to show a process of learning and experience, perhaps. Each step is described in detail in Japanese:
- Step 1: The left box ("book") to the right box ("self") is marked with "language" above this line and "experience" below the line. This may represent how [[knowledge gained from books]] and language affect [[personal experience]].
- Step 2: There are two "self" boxes, with arrows marked with a "t" indicating the passage of time, [[growth]] or change. This step presumably represents how an individual evolves as they [[accumulate experience]].
- Step 3: Two [[book]] boxes are placed at the top and a [[self]] box at the bottom. Here it could show how information from [[multiple sources of knowledge]] is [[integrated]] into personal development.
Overall, the diagram seems to represent the interaction between [[Knowledge Acquisition]] and [[Personal Growth]]. Each step depicts how individuals evolve and adapt through language and experience.
