Organizing style of putting things in boxes
- Which box do you put it in?" Question.
    - [[bat problem]]

Organizing style of "tagging" things
- Can be in multiple boxes at the same time.
- Associations: [[the "box metaphor" and "tag metaphor" for "assignment"]].

What determines the tag?
- Create a tag that is too abstract, like the `#book` tag, and 100 items will have the same tag.
- You will not be able to see through the list of tagged items.
- After this state, create a subdivision tag.
- This is [[Top-down classification]].

- In [[Information Organization 3.0]], information is organized by creating links between items.
- Putting things that seem to be related near each other" and "making links between items" in the KJ method are almost the same.
    - Placing them close together increases the probability that they will be in working memory at the same time.
    - Reasons for placing it nearby" and "Meaning of the link" will be fleshed out after the fact.
    - The concept of a [[Scrapbox Link]] is different from a typical link.
    - No need for both ends of the link to be linguistically defined first, only the link can be created first.
    - Items with the same link can be combined after the fact.
        - This behavior is almost identical to the tag
    - Can be created with a UI "like highlighting with a highlighter from within the text" as a difference from tags.
        - This is like doing [[concept extraction]] in [[GraphRAG]] manually.
    - Unlike the `#book` tag, its use in a sentence loosely expresses its relationship to other concepts.

"Bottom-up tagging" super-summary (3 lines)
- Instead of a pre-designed classification tree, a knowledge network is developed by adding links (=tags) that spontaneously arise from the memos.
- This is a practice that transplants the KJ method's "nameplate creation/convergence" to digital and turns the cumulative effect of ideas (underdevelopment → stability → inclusion → downfall).
- Scrapbox/Cosense emphasizes "divergence = branching/convergence = links across branches" in a lincographic manner, with page links and row links at the core.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I think it's amazing that you were able to generate this with only 4 lines of input.
    - It's all missing from the generated product because there was no mention of the crucial Information Organization 3.0 in the range that can be traced by the link.
    - I asked GPT5Think and got an easy answer.

Core Principles (excerpts)
- Top-down classification is minimal: assumption that structure changes with additional knowledge. Fixed trees lead to "dead text". Store in a network.
- Linking is the tag: **page link** rather than #hash, and use line links to establish a concrete relationship. Do not break references just by copying them.
- Visualize moments of convergence: lines connecting different groups = convergent thinking (critical backlink). This is the point of progress of knowledge.
- Life cycle of ideas:
    - Undeveloped (hypothetical sprout) → Stable (reappearance of isomorphism) → Inclusive (combines with other elements and becomes higher order)/Falls (dismissed due to contradiction). Record and turn.

Operational flow (divergence → convergence in the shortest distance)
1. divergence (10 minutes)
    - Drop a small specific memo (1 memo = 1 claim/1 fact).
    - If in doubt, don't force tagging = put it underdeveloped.
2. light convergence (10 minutes)
    - Add at least two links to each memo (e.g., related concepts/ counterexamples).
    - Use line links to clarify "which line and which line resonated" (aiming for critical backlinks).
3. making a nameplate (10 minutes)
    - Attach headings and one-sentence summaries to adjacent pages (the "faceplates" of the KJ method).
    - Assign a "state tag" on the spot: 🍼Undeveloped/🧱Stable/🕸Inclusive/🗑Fallen.
Point: Write first, then connect later, then summarize, in this order, and then write a clean copy (one-dimensional book) at the end.

Linking & Tagging Conventions (Mini-Conventions)
- Noun for page name (short and unambiguous)/synonym puts a thin page for redirects.
- Line link first: Copying and pasting quotations is convenient, but breaks references. Link to the original line whenever possible.
- A minimum set of related terms (optional): `is-a / part-of / supports / refutes / example-of` may be written at the beginning of each line (over-labeling is x).

Measure and review (lightweight KPIs)
- Isolation rate: Isolated pages divided by total pages (the lower the better).
- Average number of backlinks: a measure of convergence (the higher the better).
- Critical ratio: percentage of rows with multiple backlinks (the "bud" of convergence).
- Number of inclusive events: Number of newly established links between different clusters.
In both cases, it is sufficient to use Scrapbox's list of links for manual measurement → count only monthly.

anti-pattern
- Make a huge category table ahead of time/struggle with classification as you write.
- Reference cutoff by copying and pasting (erasing evidence of convergence).
- Premature clearing (tree fixing) kills the network.

A move right now (in 15 minutes)
- Select 5 items from today's notes and add 2 links + status tag to each.
- Add a nameplate line (title + one sentence) to the connected islets.
- Make sure to create "one across the branch" (i.e., one seed of convergence).
If necessary, this operation can be canvassed into a one-page "Operating Rules" (with sample templates).
