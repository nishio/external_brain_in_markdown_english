title: "Cybozu Labs Study Session"
---

- In-house study group started as [[Machine Learning Study Group]] of [[Cybozu Labs]] in spring 2011, rotating every week.
- Known as the [[PRML Study Group]] because of its early reading of "[[Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning]] ─ [[Statistical Prediction]] by [[Bayesian Theory]]" (Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, [[PRML]]).
    - Article on how it started
        - 2012: [Learning Machine Learning" at Junkudo when the wind blows - Cybozu Inside Out | Cybozu Engineer's Blog](https://blog.cybozu.io/entry/654)
        - 2013: [Because it looked interesting to me - Hidehiro Nakatani - Cybozu Inside Out | Cybozu Engineer's Blog](https://blog.cybozu.io/entry/3645)
        - 2014: [If you can't afford the cost, just admit it - Shigeo Mitsunari, Engineer (4) | Cybozu Style](https://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m000354.html)
    - Now that the [[machine learning]] input has been completed, the theme has expanded beyond machine learning.
    - Especially after [[Plurality Tokyo]], Nishio has been presenting more and more Plurality-related topics, so looking at Nishio's recent external brain, it looks as if he is doing a study session on Plurality, but that is not true at all, he is also doing OS, concurrent control, cryptography, and philosophy.
