Commentary by David Rusenko
- Asking users "[[What features do you want?]]" and "[[What you want]]" is meaningless because they don't know if they want it until they see it in person.
- If a user suggests that a feature like this would be nice, dig into the "what [[errand]] they want to accomplish" behind that statement!
