- [[telomere destruction problem]]

In [[Pioneer Mode]], the latest data is taken from the Scrapbox API, which includes the update date and time, so it was surprisingly easy to solve the problem.
Other modes are reading from the Exported JSON, which is tricky because I've never needed it before, so I'm exporting without an update date and time.
That pathway has yet to be fixed.
