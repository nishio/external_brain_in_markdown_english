title: "situated learning"
---

> Situated learning (English: [[Situated learning]]) was first proposed by Jean Rabe and Etienne Wenger as a model of learning within a [[community of practice]]. Simplistically, situated learning is learning that occurs within the very context in which the learning is being applied. [[Lave & Wenger (1991)]] argue that learning should not be viewed simply as the transfer of abstract, context-detached knowledge from one individual to another, but as a social process in which knowledge is co-constructed. Such learning is embedded in a particular contextual situation and in a particular social and physical environment.
[Situated learning - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/状況学習)

Learning is a social process in which knowledge is co-constructed
- Not the transfer of knowledge divorced from context.
