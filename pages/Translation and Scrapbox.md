title: "Translation and Scrapbox"
---

I'm rather negative about the suitability of Scrapbox for writing books from scratch, but it might be excellent for [[translation]].

Why do you think so?

Where we have chosen a translation that is not just a literal translation, it is a [[handle]] for special [[Lumps of concepts]], and there is no way to express that in a normal translation, but Scrapbox can do the bracketing.

Bracket it, make a page, and note that this is how it was in the original, but changed with this intention, so that when you come up with a better translation later, you can correct it all together by renaming the page.

In other words, Scrapbox is very useful in managing the "I have a chunk of the concept, but no handle.

The reason why I don't find it useful when writing from scratch is because it's a tool that keeps the book in an undefined form, not a tool that makes it a tight, finished book #tools that keep it undefined

- [[Structuring pressure]] is not there.

what is translation?

We call it translation, but it may not be translation in the first place.

The author himself is looking at the Japanese text and outputting it in English, often ignoring the original...

This is intellectual production using "[[Format Change]]" of changing the language.
