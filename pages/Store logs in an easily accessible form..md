title: "Store logs in an easily accessible form."

from [[pKeicho-done]]
Store logs in an easily accessible form.
- I'm copying and shaping it by hand right now.
    - When I run it locally, I keep it in a readable form on hand, but now that it's running on the server.
    - Store and view on server
    - API to return in a form that is easy to import into regroup
- Make sure to log to env.

Can now be displayed in /log/<name> on heroku
