title: "Forming connections across topics and contexts"
---


- After the fact, the context is connected to the larger story.
- The key here is "contextual connection". For our presence to be recognized by others, we need to connect our thoughts and actions in a context that others can understand. This is a reference to the Scrapbox-like pattern of thinking, meaning that we represent things by their connections, not by the content itself.
