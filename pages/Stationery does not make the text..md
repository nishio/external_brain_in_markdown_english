title: "Stationery does not make the text."
---


The story is that "[[stationery]] doesn't make [[sentences]], people just think about them and write them down using stationery, but good stationery makes writing easier than bad stationery."

I think until a year ago it was a parable that could explain the relationship between [[tool (esp. software, etc.)]] and [[skill]] in a simple way, but then [[LLM]] came along and the cloud has gone up.

The [[ambiguous concept]] pointed to by the term "making sentences" separates into two, but it's hard to explain.
