Compare with [isolated individual
    - A kind of [Ignorance is a resource
    - It is useful to observe people who are not taking information from the community they are using as a source of information.

- [[Social Physics]]  p.56
- >  [[diversity]] is important...When everyone around you is going in the same direction, you should consider that your sources are not sufficiently diversified. In that case, you should [[quest]] for an even wider range. [[Social learning]] also carries a great danger of "[[groupthink]]. How can we prevent groupthink and the creation of [[echo chambers]]? It is necessary to compare the behavior of isolated individuals ([[those who have no sources of information within the group]]) with that of social learning. If what is called "[[common sense]]" brought about by social learning is simply an overconfident version of the isolated individual's thinking, then there is a high risk that we are in a groupthink or echo chamber situation. In this case, acting against "common sense" can be very effective. In fact, in Eatro's experiment, users who adopted this strategy performed best among all but the top traders.
