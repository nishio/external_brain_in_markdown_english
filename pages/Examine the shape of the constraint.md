- [[constraints]] to [avoidance
    - From [[status quo]] to [ideal
    - From the current state to the ideal state
    - I want to move with simple implementation.
- left
    - However, unexpected constraints may be discovered during implementation
    - We work around it haphazardly.
    - Actually, I should have turned left instead of right at the first end of the street.
    - Lessons Learned Here
        - Having willingly run into the constraints, I realized that the constraints existed.
        - I should have looked into the shape of the constraints instead of haphazardly avoiding them.
- right
    - Patterns that occur because of the well-known pattern on the left
    - There is a vague "there may be constraints" concern up front.
    - When you willingly run into constraints, you need to change your policy.
    - Fear of it avoids a great deal of vague anxiety.
    - But in fact, they didn't run into any restrictions if they went straight ahead.
    - Lessons Learned Here
        - Avoided a major detour due to anxiety/interpretation that "we might run into a constraint."
        - This also neglects to examine the "shape of the constraint" as a fact.

relevance
- Fear of things I don't understand.
        - A version of avoidance by fear of [Attack without looking closely.
        - [[The fact that there are barriers ahead is not a reason not to proceed.]]
