> [gweoipfsd](https://twitter.com/gweoipfsd/status/1694151508311564652) There are many people who want to be good and do the right thing. But the standard of goodness is determined not only by oneself but also by others, and perfect goodness is impossible to begin with.
>  But many people think they are more than enough, almost completely right, by bringing up the mysterious rule that it is OK to do as much as possible or as much as the world does, if you think about it.
>  It's a realistic way to live, and in some ways it may be right, but it's not something you can say you're not abandoning others.
>  Or rather, it is impossible for any good person to live without abandoning others. That is the same as saying that human beings live by killing other life. You are turning away from such a natural reality.
>  That's not why I'm telling you what to do, that's just the reality. I'm just saying.
>  People can be very cruel when they turn away from concrete facts and live in an abstracted reality. Not that that's wrong, it's simply a fact.

> [gweoipfsd](https://twitter.com/gweoipfsd/status/1694156310248640787) I don't think the discussion of what good is in the first place makes much sense either. Because I only think that the concept of goodness is something that developed in evolution, as humans as social animals became more likely to survive as a species when the brain rewarded behavior that put the interests of the herd above those of the individual.
>  And furthermore, it may be that they are becoming more and more complex to mimic behavior that is supposed to be good, resulting in further increasing their effectiveness by generating feelings of sanction against self-centered individuals who are contrary to the interests of the herd.
>  Well, putting that kind of logic aside, I think the issue as an individual way of life is how to deal with the irrepressible feeling of wanting to help those around you. It's fine if it's something that can be easily helped, but if you really want to help, it often requires a tremendous sacrifice. It is practical to abandon them somewhere. I don't think that's wrong. However, as for abandoning them and assuming that this is something that society should help them with and that they are not abandoning themselves, I find that to be deceptive.
