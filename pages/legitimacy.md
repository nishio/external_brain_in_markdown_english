    - > "Legitimacy is a conception of what the ultimate criterion of rightness is. It must be distinguished from [[justification]], which is about whether or not we can determine that something is right given a given criterion of rightness. Legitimacy is more fundamental. If we consider how the criterion of correctness is given in the first place and trace it back, we will find that it is either circular, or else it leads back to a final ground of correctness, which cannot be traced back any further after a finite procedure. This final ground (criterion) of correctness is called [[authority]] ([[authority]]). Authority itself, of course, cannot be proved ([[justification]]). It is straightforwardly correct" (Hashizume [[2002:628]]).
    - >  "A ruler or superior (act) is said to have legitimacy when a particular ruling relationship, institution, social relationship, or act is maintained on the basis of reasons that are sufficiently justifiable to the ruled, that is, when it is sufficiently justifiable. Not only the ruler or his/her acts, but also the institution or organization itself may have legitimacy. It is an indispensable resource or attribute in maintaining non-objective social relations that typify the domination relationship" (Kitada [[2006: 516]]).

> [@yuiseki_](https://twitter.com/yuiseki_/status/1631816393946718208?s=20): I have a dim memory that there were studies on the social construction of the concept of legitimacy in post-Max Weber sociology (ethnomethodology and social constructionism). I have a dim memory that there was a study on the social construction of the concept of legitimacy in sociology after Max Weber (in the lineage of [[ethnomethodology]] and social constructivism), but it may be a false memory because I can't find the exact one when I google it

Legitimacy
> Legitimacy is a pattern of higher-order acceptance. An outcome in some social context is legitimate if the people in that social context broadly accept and play their part in enacting that outcome, and each individual person does so because they expect everyone else to do the same.
