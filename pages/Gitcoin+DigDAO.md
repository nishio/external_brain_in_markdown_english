Dig DAO is a community dedicated to the research and development of Web3 technologies, with the following main objectives

1. explore, develop, and share insights on the Web 3.0 ecosystem
2. implementation of the Verifiable Credential model for global interoperability
3. research on DAOs and experiments in funding public goods using Quadratic Funding
4. support for digital public goods
5. equitable investment in projects that bring significant value to society

We are currently developing a quadratic funding (QF) platform that supports not only cryptocurrencies but also legal tender (Japanese yen), and we plan to release a prototype at [[Funding the Commons Tokyo]] and [[EDCON Tokyo]] in July.

Funds from this round will support the matching pool for the ongoing QF round.

The team consists of members from [[Code for Japan]], [[DeSci Tokyo]], [[Fracton Ventures]], and others with experience in funding public goods and contributing to civic tech for civic engagement.
