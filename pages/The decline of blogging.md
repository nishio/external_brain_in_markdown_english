The decline of blogging
> [tokoroten](https://x.com/tokoroten/status/1808553724400578836) "The decline of the blog"...
>
>  I think that the blog culture has become much less expensive to consume content than the web diary culture that preceded it, because the format has become more uniform, like [[container story]].
>  Also, blog culture is centered on citation references, which was another factor that lowered the cost of consumption.
>
>  "The format is consistent and easy to read."
>  "It's a citation reference, so it's short, easy to read, and gives perspective."
>
>  Nevertheless, today they have been replaced by Twitter
>
>  As a result, blogs are paradoxically required to be long-winded, image-rich, and original, and the cost of content consumption has jumped, so they have declined!

The emergence of [[SNS]] has reduced the advantages of [[Blog]].
