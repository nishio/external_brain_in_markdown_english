<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The opinion that "Descartes did not create anything but left behind ideas" and the opinion that "in Descartes' time, compiling ideas into books was a major project" both contain some truth, but they evaluate Descartes' accomplishments from different aspects.

When Descartes says that he "did not create anything," he probably means that he did not leave behind any physical inventions or concrete technical achievements. However, his ideas, especially the proposition "[[I think, therefore I am]]" ([[Cogito, ergo sum]]), occupy a very important place in Western philosophy. This idea offered a new perspective on subjectivity, self-awareness, and the foundations of knowledge. Descartes, through his [[methodological skepticism]] and rationalism, changed the very way knowledge is sought.

On the other hand, the opinion that "in Descartes' time, the compilation of ideas into books was a major project" emphasizes the social and cultural context of his achievements. 17th century Europe was a time of the spread of knowledge with the development of [[printing technology]]. Books became the primary means of disseminating new ideas and scientific knowledge. Descartes' writings were also written against this background and widely read. His writings were influential not only because of the innovative nature of his ideas, but also because of the [[media]] that existed to disseminate them.

To appreciate Descartes' work, it is important to understand the philosophical depth of his ideas as well as the role of books as a means of communicating them. He may not have left behind any physical "objects," but his ideas continue to have a profound impact on later generations in the form of books. This is because they were an effective means of disseminating ideas in the cultural and technological context in which Descartes lived.

The fact that "books" were "an effective means of disseminating ideas in the cultural and technological context of Descartes' time" doesn't mean that "books" are "an effective means of disseminating ideas" in the cultural and technological context of today.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
