> [ogawa_kimiyo](https://x.com/ogawa_kimiyo/status/1867409048695611665) [[Tsunehiro Uno]] I just finished reading "The Story of a Garden". If information that is not directly relevant to me today is "[[noise]]", I was overwhelmed by the vividness of Mr. Uno's inexhaustible examination of the question of how to accept it in today's society in this large book. Highly recommended for those who have read Kaho Miyake's "[why can't I read books when I'm working?

I was unemployed for 8 years. I think the BOOKOFF in Kusebashi has given me more than a few things. I happened to come across a paperback copy of Yoshio Kataoka's "Let Me Be a Slow Boogie" and a book of the same title at a bookstore in Kusebashi,

It is not that I was looking for these books in particular, nor that I had wanted to read them for a long time. ...It was just "by chance," my mood that day, my physical condition, the conversation I had with a friend a few days before, and so on.

When I was unemployed, I often went to Book-Off, and the books I chose were essays by Kuniko Mukoda, Muneyoshi Yanagi, and Keiji Nishitani, which made me feel alive as a human being. I had plenty of time to go on a bicycle tour of used bookstores.

Consumption" has no end, but the solution to this problem is the strategy of "luxury," which Kokubu recommends. Here, Kunibun introduces "Billy Budd" by [[Melville]], which he discusses in "[[The World of]] Mesodynamics. I couldn't help but groan at this point.

> [ogawa_kimiyo](https://x.com/ogawa_kimiyo/status/1867419689674322400) I never thought that the tragedy of Captain Claggart's uncontrollable jealousy in "Billy Budd" that drove Billy to the brink of death and the platform on which slander swirled over "TERRACE I never thought that I would consider the platform where slander swirled around "HOUSE" as analogous to the tragedy of "Billy Budd" where Captain Claggart, who could not control his jealousy, drove Billy to the death penalty. The issue of "platform users are quite strongly liberated from their 'bodies'."

This is also true of the "English garden" that has been created in Shinjuku Gyoen, and Mary Shelley was one of the leaders of the 18th century Picturesque movement that gave momentum to Romantic literature.
