- Derived from [[Difference between "aiming at a certain point" and "going in a certain direction."]] and [You need to go in one direction, but not if you only go in one direction.

    - [[goal]] is [[Assume it's a point.]] but it may not be correct
- You think there are no obstacles on the way to the goal, only [[Not visible yet.]] You can see it when you get closer.
- After obstacles are seen, [[change of policy]] is needed.
- The goal reached after a change of policy is different from the point we planned to reach when we started

relevance
    - Second figure in [Goals may be modified.
