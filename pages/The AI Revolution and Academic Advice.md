<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/> Some important points about the content and meaning of "[[encouragement of learning]]" in [[Yukichi Fukuzawa]] are summarized as follows.
- He encourages the pursuit of education and enlightenment to achieve individual and national independence and self-reliance. Fukuzawa opposes relying on government or blindly following tradition.
- He criticized the status and hierarchical system of Tokugawa Japan at the time and promoted equality among people. Fukuzawa argues that [[all people are born equal]].
- We advocate learning practical Western knowledge and skills to strengthen Japan and enable it to stand on equal footing with Western powers. This includes economics, law, and science.
- He criticizes the [[Confucianism]] that was dominant in Japan at the time, such as excessive [[filial piety]] and [[blind obedience to authority]]. Fukuzawa emphasizes [[independent thinking]].
- More broadly, it reflects the spirit of early Meiji Japan's emphasis on modernization and Westernization as it rapidly developed into an influential world power on par with the United States and other European nations.
- It is considered one of the most important works for understanding the ideas of that transformative era that had a profound impact on Meiji Japan and opened Japan's doors to the world.
In summary, the Japanese people are eager to modernize their nation and achieve true independence through education, egalitarianism, and the incorporation of practical learning from the West. The traditional worldview of [[Tokugawa Japan]] is directly challenged.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>When considered in the context of the AI revolution, Fukuzawa Yukichi's "Encouragement of Learning" has insights that are relevant today.

First, the importance of education and [[practical knowledge]] that Fukuzawa emphasized is becoming increasingly important in the age of AI. as AI and digital technologies are rapidly developing and revolutionizing our society and economy, it is essential to develop human resources who can understand and utilize these technologies. Acquiring AI-related [[practical skills]], such as programming, data science, and machine learning, is critical to [[individual careers]] and [[national competitiveness]].

In order to adapt to the changes brought about by AI, [[flexible and independent thinking]] is needed, without being bound by [[old customs]] or [[Existing framework]]. We will need to calmly evaluate the possibilities and risks of AI, and make [[proactive decisions]] while considering the ethical and social implications.

Furthermore, the independence and self-reliance of individuals and nations, which Fukuzawa aimed for, is also an important theme in the age of AI. as AI begins to surpass human capabilities in various aspects of labor and decision-making, [[individual autonomy]] and the meaning of existence will be questioned. Therefore, to survive in the AI era, we need to have [[our own sense of value]] and strengths, and demonstrate creativity and sensitivity unique to humans that AI does not have. At the same time, strategic efforts at the national level are also indispensable to ensure that the benefits of AI are enjoyed by the entire nation and to prevent social fragmentation and disparities caused by AI.

As the "Encouragement of Learning" advocated, individuals should be enlightened through education, acquire practical knowledge, and develop a [[self-reliant spirit]]. The nation must also adapt to the changing times and actively adopt new technologies while pursuing the welfare and happiness of its people. These principles are also suggestive for contemporary Japan, which is in the midst of the AI revolution.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>From the perspective of William James' pragmatism and pluralism, there are interesting parallels and divergences in Yukichi Fukuzawa's "The Encouragement of Learning".

The central idea of pragmatism is that the true value of ideas and beliefs should be judged by how they affect practical outcomes. In this respect, Fukuzawa's argument is very pragmatic. Fukuzawa advocated learning about Western knowledge and technologies because he believed they would have concrete, practical benefits for Japan's development and independence. The emphasis on real-world utility over abstract theory is truly in the spirit of pragmatism.

On the other hand, however, James' pluralism denies a single absolute truth and allows for the coexistence of multiple perspectives and interpretations. From this perspective, there seems to be a somewhat one-sided aspect to Fukuzawa's argument. While Fukuzawa acknowledged the need to adapt Western knowledge and values to the Japanese context rather than uncritically accepting them, he also seems to reject the traditional Japanese worldview outright. James might have been more willing to appreciate the diverse insights offered by different Western and Japanese perspectives.

Nevertheless, there is also a pluralistic element in Fukuzawa's thought. Fukuzawa, who called for the overthrow of the status system and the equality of individuals, aimed for a society in which diverse individuals could demonstrate their individual talents. This vision is probably in line with James's vision of a "pluralistic universe.

James also emphasized the necessity of verification through practice in the process of searching for truth. Fukuzawa similarly emphasized the importance of applying learning to the real world and verifying its validity, rather than merely [[academic gossip]].

In this way, Fukuzawa Yukichi's thought does not completely coincide with William James' pragmatism and pluralism, but they do have important points in common. Both may be said to exemplify the modern intellect in their flexible thinking unbound by fixed dogma and their emphasis on practice.
