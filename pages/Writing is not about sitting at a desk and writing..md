title: "Writing is not about sitting at a desk and writing."
---

Original title: If you think "[writing (e.g. as a profession)" means "sitting at a desk and writing", there is nothing you can do in [[free time]].
- It was a little too long, so I cut it down.
- Example of taking writing as a big [fuzzy task

- Separate "[[Output fragments]]" and "[[Summarize output fragments]]" phases.
    - [[breakdown]] of the task
- Outputting fragments can be performed in a skimmer.
        - [[Intellectual production in small time slots]]
    - For example, one can write a sticky note while riding the escalator on a train transfer.
        - The original inspiration for this text was actually written out that way.
        - Related: [[Examples of sticky notes written in skimmer]].
