- Here's the interesting part.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Try to write whatever comes to mind on X
    - After a period of time, reread X, and transcribe into Y what you still find interesting after rereading it.
    - Set aside some time to reread Y, and transcribe to Z what you still find interesting after reading it again.
- In [/villagepump/Scrapbox Best Practices 2022 manuscript](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/Scrapbox Best Practices 2022 manuscript), I wrote "[[metanote]] looks good" meaning "this is X, rewriting it twice to make Z looks good".
- The naming "[[metanote]]" is not communicative.
    - You can also [[transplantation]] further from Z.
        - [Replant after a period of time.

        - All you need is "a good vibe to add."
