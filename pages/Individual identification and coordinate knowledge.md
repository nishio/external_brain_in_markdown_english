title: "Individual identification and coordinate knowledge"
---

- [[Exploratory Studies of Knowledge]]  p.104

- Observation of monkeys
    - As we recognize and observe individuals, we discover relationships between individuals.
        - Example
            - Which monkey is the offspring of which mother monkey?
            - Which one is the boss monkey?
            - Pecking Order among Boss Monkeys
            - Differences in the types of food preferred
    - This gradually forms [[coordinate axis knowledge]] after the fact.
    - Coordinate knowledge facilitates individual identification
- social anthropology
    - Long-term participation in a specific region
    - Match each resident with a face and name = individual identification
    - Parallel to the creation of a family tree, list of positions, and other coordinates.

- [[ID]] and [[coordinate axis knowledge]] nurture each other
