    - [[Get the big picture]] I want to.
    - Major desire
- For books
    - Table of Contents
        - Trees and maps maintained by the author
    - Enhance [listing
    - glance
    - Hard to get over 100 pieces.
        - Field of vision/eye performance issues
        - Compression required
            - Stick to the bottom-up
                - KJ method
- hierarchical classification
    - I want to build a tree.
            - I want to create [[Table of Contents]] and [[Map]].
        - Maps are not limited to trees.
        - two-dimensional representation
            - KJ method
            - proximity
                - Relationships that do not explicitly state the relationship
                - Can express relationships without verbalizing them.
                - Linguization is done after the fact.
    - The tree that was created is always wrong.
                - [[All models are wrong.]]
        - Improvement must be easy
            - After the fact, the tree becomes a network.
            - symbolic link
            - Leaf-to-Leaf Links
                - [[Restrictions on one thing and one place are a hindrance.]] So.
                - The same issue with [[Reuse of sticky notes]] in the KJ method
- Searching solves the problem?
        - [[There must be power.]] and [Keyword Recall
        - Suggestions to solve the problem?
