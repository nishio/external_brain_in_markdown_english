<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This article discusses the challenges and areas that need to be strengthened in Japan's [[cybersecurity personnel]] development, while introducing advanced efforts in overseas [[white hacker]] development.

The main contents are as follows
- In South Korea, the Department of Cyber National Defense was established at [[Korea University]] in collaboration with the Ministry of National Defense to train elite white hackers. The system also provides generous career support after graduation and enables students to work in the private sector.
- Japan's [[security camps]] recognize career potential and invest enthusiastically in educating students. It also fosters an attitude of [[giving back]] to graduates.
- Cyber security measures for SMEs are limited only by the private sector due to budget shortfalls. In Thailand and Australia, the government is working with universities to support student training by linking it to practical operations.
- In Japan, there are attempts to simultaneously develop human resources and solve problems, such as training programs at medical schools and free legal consultations at law schools.
- Japan's cybersecurity human resource development requires the full-fledged establishment of a "human resource development ecosystem" in which industry, government, academia, and various regions collaborate, based on good examples from overseas and excellent efforts in other fields.
