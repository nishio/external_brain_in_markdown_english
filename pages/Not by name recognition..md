title: "Not by name recognition."

2018-03-16
- The theory that "[[gaining recognition]] is important."
- I feel uncomfortable about this.
        - A sense that the goal is not to gain [[a degree of familiarity]].
        - [[needs-seeing matching]] is the source of value
    - It's important to connect with [[key people]] who can do that.
        - This is just hard to understand because it is unobservable.
- Behaviors that increase visibility are also positively correlated with connections to key people.
    - So there is still a positive correlation to value.
        - Even if there is [[correlation]], it is not clear whether there is [[cause and effect]] or not.

relevance
    - [[Eating a lot of junk food does not make you healthy.]]
    - [[Attention from a few strong people]]
