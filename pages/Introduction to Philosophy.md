- The most "easy-to-understand" philosophy textbook I've read.
    - I guess "easy to understand" is different for everyone. I don't have a problem with the old font.
    - The PDF above is not the one I read, but the old kana usage has been changed to the new one.
- The [[theism]] area of the book has helped me a lot in my commentary on [[correctness]].
