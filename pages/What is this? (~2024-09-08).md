- Personal [[Scrapbox]] of [[NISHIO Hirokazu]].

# What is Scrapbox?
- It's a place to store and put information.
- Unlike blogs [[I write for future me to read.]]
    - You [[You may read it, but you don't have to.]]
- More fine-unit fragments than a blog.
        - It is more like the [[information card]] introduced by [[Tadao Umesao]] in [[The Art of Intellectual Production]].
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/情報カード/icon' alt='情報カード.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Many authors, not just him, have used similar mechanisms.
        - Once it was written on paper and placed in a private study.
        - So only he could see it.
        - This is not the final work, but to assist the person in the intellectual production of the work at the stage of creating it
    - What is placed on this site can be interpreted as an information card that NISHIO Hirokazu uses for his own intellectual production
    - I've been using it for about 5 years now and have 14,000 cards.
- Scrapbox is vastly superior to paper information cards.
        - [[Knowledge Network]] is represented by a mechanism for [Structuring information with links
        - The [[link to an unexpected destination]] and [[Scrapbox's link suggestions are useful]] will help you discover pages you have written in the past.
            - [[Comparing similarities is a new way to learn.]]

# Guide for New Scrapbox Readers
.
- The best way to understand Scrapbox is to use Scrapbox yourself
    - I've written a lot of verbal explanations here [[Increased skill in using tools leads to a more detailed perception of the world]], so the understanding of those who don't use them doesn't lead to those who do.
    - As a function of Scrapbox, when you search within your own Scrapbox project, a cross search is also performed against the Scrapbox projects you have viewed, giving you the opportunity to discover other people's ideas about what you are thinking.
    - Since this service is focused on "growing your network of knowledge", it is best to try to grow your own network of knowledge

- Meaning of the color of the links in the page
    - Red links are "doors that don't lead anywhere yet" and therefore not useful to click on.
        - Think of it as highlighting keywords.
    - Blue links are links to other pages in Scrapbox
        - This page can be EMPTY.
            - empty is also useful because it displays a card at the bottom of the page with a list of "pages linked to that keyword".
        - Example: [Philosophy of [/shokai/Scrapbox](https://scrapbox.io/shokai/Scrapbox)]
            - This is a link to Scrapbox's "Other Projects" page
            - This example links to a page in the shokai project that is developing Scrapbox
            - For English reader, currently auto-translation supports only in this project. Links to other Japanese project may broken because of translation of title.
    - Blue underlined links are links outside Scrapbox

- Meaning of the green and gray lines on the left edge of the page
    - They are called "telomeres." For a detailed description, see [/shokai/telomere](https://scrapbox.io/shokai/telomere).
    - Unread lines (= lines that have been updated since the last visit) are green
    - The more recently updated, the thicker.
    - Click here to get the permalink to the line so you can mention it.

- Q: Where do I start reading?
    - Option 1: Search for keywords of your interest
    - Option 2: Follow the links by clicking on the links that interest you at the bottom of each page.
        - Here's a starting point for readers: [[Links for Readers]].
            - [[For visiter of /nishio-en]] is the start point for English reader.


## About Quotations and Licenses
.
    - [[Anything published can be cited.]]
    - We think it is a very good thing to cite, mention and develop
- We believe that it is a bad idea to make it difficult to utilize information because it is not clear who inherits the rights upon the death of the copyright holder
    - The information on this Scrapbox is licensed under a CC-BY license upon the death of NISHIO Hirokazu
