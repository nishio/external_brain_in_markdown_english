Small steps are hard to see.
> [rashita2](https://twitter.com/rashita2/status/1650641694390616065) "Intellectual production" conjures up images of large deliverables, but it is the ability to ask questions and organize questions that supports This ability is useful not only when creating large deliverables.
- > [rashita2](https://twitter.com/rashita2/status/1650643813076209665) For example, asking the right question is not the act of suddenly asking a consistent question, but the act of gradually adjusting a standing question. It is important to understand this.
- > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1650657168885166080): Since a "big product" cannot be produced in a day, it is necessary to accumulate "small steps" on a daily basis, but this "small step" part is often overlooked because it is difficult for consumers to see. I think this "small step" is often overlooked because it is difficult to see from the consumer's side.
