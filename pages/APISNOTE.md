>  For example, in 2011 or 2012, he created an "online sticky note tool.
>  At the time, I thought to myself, "Why not just use paper sticky notes?" But now I realize that it was a very early version of online whiteboards such as Miro, which became popular after Corona 2020.

>  I searched the web and found a poster for a conference presentation? I found a poster for

At the time, websocket technology was starting to be implemented in browsers, and I thought, "I can make an online sticky note tool with real-time synchronization! I thought "I can make an online sticky note tool with real-time synchronization!

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1944205643277287437) I think it's engineer-like to talk about the means and technology of "websocket" in these situations. I wish they would talk about the purpose and value of this system, such as "This system will enable us to generate ideas and discuss them over the Internet using sticky notes".

There are minor mistakes in English, such as the lower case of fig, There are some minor mistakes in English, such as the lower case of "fig."... There is no list of references, the novelty of the idea does not seem that new even from the level of the time, and the number of participants in the experiment has not been verified. It looks like an ordinary student presentation.
>  Since the literature information is unknown (I looked up the title and was a little unclear as to which presentation it was), it is unclear if there is a presentation with a preliminary paper and it is possible that the preliminary paper is well written.
I understand what you mean, but it's not right for people on social networking sites who are not usually exposed to papers to get excited and say, "Wow, it's in a paper! is not a correct evaluation, because it tends to be an overestimation.
- If it is 2012, Mr. Yasuno, who was born in 1990, would be 22 years old, so I guess he developed, experimented, and presented a poster in his 3rd~4th year of college.
    - That in itself is not unusual for an information university.

>  I made it when I was in middle school.
