When the consequences of an action are [[uncertain]], they often [[avoidance]] the action [[human bug]].

- Don't worry about it, act on it and see the results.
- Take action to increase information and reduce uncertainty
        - [[star shell]]
- just wait
    - If waiting changes the situation
        - Time may be the answer in some situations.
    - If the priority of doing this is not so high
        - High-priority tasks can be done to reduce losses and "wait for resolution by time".
