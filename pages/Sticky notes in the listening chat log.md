Make the chat log into a sticky like this

- [[Listening Chat System]] logs as stickies.
- In the [[Tools to organize your head]] import window, [[✅ longest line is ticked with one click]].

The original conversation took place on [Mattermost Version Listening Chat System
The first pasted "keywords extracted by the listening chat system and human input to them side by side" is not difficult to automate but not yet implemented, so I made it by hand.
One click export on the part of the chat system would be nice.
