<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3-mini-high/icon' alt='o3-mini-high.icon' height="19.5"/>The relationship between the democratic debate and the principle of one person, one vote has evolved with the expansion of political participation and the development of the principle of equality in each era.

1.### Ancient and medieval
.
- The Athenian direct democracy did not lead to the modern "one man, one vote," as only men with civil rights could participate, and there were significant restrictions on eligibility.

2.### Early Modern Period (Age of Enlightenment and Revolution)
.
- During the 18th and 19th centuries, the ideas of liberty, equality, and benevolence spread, and the American and French revolutions promoted the idea of sovereignty over the entire nation.
- It was here that "[[equal]] political participation" was discussed and the foundation was laid for the gradual formation of the concept of one person, one vote.

3.### 19th-20th centuries: establishment of universal suffrage
.
- A movement to expand the right to vote from the traditional ownership qualification system to all adult citizens is gaining momentum.
    - Through the [[women's suffrage]] and [[minority rights]] acquisition movements, a substantial one-person, one-vote system was established.
- After World War II, [[equality before the law]] was emphasized as an international standard of democracy and adopted by countries around the world.

4.### Contemporary Discussion
.
- While one-person-one-vote is considered a symbol of formal [[equality]], issues of equality and [[representativeness]] of substantive political participation continue to be debated, including [[electoral district districting]], [[vote weight imbalance]], and new forms of participation in the information society.

Thus, it can be said that throughout history, the one-person, one-vote has developed as the foundation of democracy in the process of evolving from limited civic participation to universal political participation.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3-mini-high/icon' alt='o3-mini-high.icon' height="19.5"/>The following is a list of additions.

1.### When to separate voting rights from tax payments
.
- In the medieval and early modern periods, a qualification system based on wealth and the amount of taxes paid was common, and those who paid more taxes tended to be given more rights to participate in politics. However, with the Enlightenment in the 18th century and the American and French Revolutions, the idea of "equal sovereignty of the entire nation" spread, and the need for political participation independent of tax payment status or amount began to be recognized.
- Particularly in the 19th century, countries moved from a system of ownership qualifications to universal suffrage, establishing the principle of "one person, one vote" in stages. This effectively decoupled the amount of taxes paid from the right to vote and transformed the voting system into one based on individual citizenship.

2.### Criticisms of limiting the study to adults and their considerations
.
- On the other hand, the current system, in which the right to vote is limited to adults, has been criticized for violating the principle of one person, one vote from the perspective that all people are equal.
- Underlying this criticism is the sense of inequality that children and adolescents are not given opportunities for political participation, even though they too will be affected by society in the future.
- In modern democratic systems, however, the voting age (18 in most cases) is set from the perspective of political participation based on the assumption of a certain capacity for judgment, social experience, and sense of responsibility. In other words, being an adult is not merely a restriction based on age, but is based on the assumption that one is capable of making rational political decisions, and is interpreted as a measure to ensure effective political participation while maintaining the equal value of "one person, one vote" in the system.
- Note that there are arguments for lowering the voting age, and the possibility that the issue may be revisited in the future in light of the social and educational context is part of the future discussion of democracy.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>If we affirm restrictions on the right to vote based on the condition of "being capable of making rational political decisions," then logically, wouldn't it be equally affirming to restrict the right to vote of "adults who are not capable of making rational political decisions equivalent to 18 years of age," such as elderly people with dementia, for example?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3-mini-high/icon' alt='o3-mini-high.icon' height="19.5"/>If the condition "capable of making reasonable political decisions" is listed as a reason for limiting the right to vote, then theoretically the same argument could be applied to adults with significantly impaired judgment (e.g., elderly persons with dementia). However, the following points are important.

1.### Guarantee of individual dignity and fundamental human rights
.
- All adults have the right to participate in politics as a fundamental human right, and uniformly depriving them of the right to vote on the basis of impaired judgment may violate the principles of individual dignity and equality.

2.### Unclear criteria and operational difficulties
.
- The criteria for what constitutes "capable of making a reasonable political judgment" are very vague. Since the ability to make judgments varies according to individual circumstances and degrees, and it is difficult to set objective standards and apply them, uniform restrictions pose significant challenges.

3.### Social consensus and institutional stability
.
- The right to vote is the foundation of democracy, and without society-wide agreement, restrictions on certain groups are likely to be viewed as problematic as unequal treatment. Even when restrictions are made on the basis of impaired judgment, very careful consideration must be given to the criteria and method of application.

In conclusion, logically, if the condition is that a person is "capable of making rational political decisions," then restrictions on voting rights for adults with impaired judgment could theoretically be justified. However, the general view is that in a real democratic system, broad voting restrictions are unlikely to be adopted under the current system because of practical problems such as the protection of individual dignity and basic human rights, ambiguity in the criteria for judgment, and lack of social consensus.

- Funny how you sound very human, "logically I think so, but realistically it's hard to adopt as an institution."
