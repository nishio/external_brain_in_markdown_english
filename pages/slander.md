> [@honnoinosisi555](https://twitter.com/honnoinosisi555/status/1689545766166290432): "Using foul language is not swearing, but expressing [[superiority or inferiority]] by [[Comparison]] is. Therefore, even if one is superficially complimenting the other person, insofar as one is indirectly expressing superiority or inferiority, the statement is a swear word." (Yu Izumi, "What is a bad mouth?" Chikuma Primer Shinsho, p. 80)
