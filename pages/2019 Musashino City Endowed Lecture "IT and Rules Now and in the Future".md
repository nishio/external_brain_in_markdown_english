--- September memo below

- Use Keynote for presentations.
    - Recording at hand with presentation recordings.
    - It would be good to take a picture of the presentation scene with Osmo Action
- Put presentation materials on Scrapbox in advance, one slide and one image per slide.
    - People who can only listen to audio, such as part-time receptionists, can also participate.
- Announcement at the beginning:
    - Speakers' speeches are transcribed and later published on Scrapbox.
    - So there is no need for you all to work hard at recording what was spoken. The recording equipment will do that for you.
    - On the other hand, only you yourself can record what you think and question after listening to the talk.
    - Record your thoughts, whether in Scrapbox or in a paper notebook!
    - After the presentation, if you have time, search the Scrapbox for "questions" and answer them, so you can write your questions in the Scrapbox.

- After the presentation, have the participants write their questions in the Scrapbox at [[One-minute thinking time]].
    - Create a "question" zone at the end of the presentation and write questions there during the one-minute period.
    - In the meantime, I copy and paste the questions from my presentation into it.
        - If you do it in split screen, you don't need to switch screens.

    - [[population structure]]
    - Population is shrinking and time is running short.
    - [[Wako Model]]
    - Instead of treating a large number of people uniformly.
    - Adapt to individual people

    - [[equality]]
    - People have personalities.
    - Diversity.
    - Is it a good thing to ignore that and treat them uniformly?


Need to come up with a report assignment for students.
- Find one physical constraint and one policy constraint?
- Find someone's "must" or "should be" statement.
    - rule
    - Find what is a policy constraint
    - Consider how to take action to loosen that constraint.
