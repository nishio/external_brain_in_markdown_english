title: "accumulate"

- 「 [[The only way to go to extraordinary places is to accumulate the little things.]] 」  [[Ichiro (fifth highest of the eight hereditary titles)]]
- Continuous resource devotion is a prerequisite for greater [[deviation]] from the average.
    - Requires a large amount of money or strong enthusiasm to keep pouring resources
    - Money buys weak enthusiasm from others and pours it in.
    - Given that, the resource needed here is "[[enthusiasm]]."
- A necessary but not sufficient condition
    - The expected value of divergence is very different between repeatedly going in a fixed direction and repeatedly [[random walk]].
    - In a two-dimensional random walk and a random walk that rejects when x is not going in the positive direction, the latter will have a larger x
        - What probability of rejection would result in the same degree of deviation from the mean?
    - The distribution of deviations from the mean in the absence of rejection is [[chi-square distribution]]
