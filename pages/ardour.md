> Aadhaar (English: [[Aadhaar]]) is the name of India's [[national identification number system]].
>
> Compared to the U.S. [[Social Security Number]], Aadhar has biometric information such as fingerprints and iris, as well as facial photo information that can be matched, making it possible to use it for identification and biometric authentication. In addition, various SDKs and APIs are available to the public, making it possible to incorporate Aadhar into various existing systems, such as payment and medical systems, and to develop new services.
