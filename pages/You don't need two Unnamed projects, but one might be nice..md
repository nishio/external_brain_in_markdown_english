You don't need two Unnamed projects, but one might be nice.
- Not too sure about whether "one is good to have."
- I'm thinking a little more strongly about "I don't want two."

Create a new unnamed project when Unnamed Camp is no longer Unnamed
- Well, actually, we're making them, we're just not actively announcing it.

The same approach done by different people would surely produce different things. It will be interesting to see what differences will emerge.
