In an era where [[demand]] is clear and [[supply]] is lacking:

- It is clear what needs to be produced.
- The more you produce, the more you sell.
- Producing in large quantities tends to lower the cost per unit, leading to [[mass production]].
- There is a race to reduce manufacturing costs.
- There is also a race to improve quality.
- This is the [[Era of the Race]].

Eventually, this race surpasses actual demand:

- The notion of "produce more, sell more" no longer holds.
- It mirrors the structure of [[disruptive innovation]].
- The need arises to find customers.
  - As discussed in [[Why Invest in Intellectual Production Techniques, a Supplement]].

An era where finding customers is the top priority:

- Known demand is already sufficiently supplied, leading to excessive competition.
- Unknown demand must be discovered.
  - This is the [[Creation of Customers]].
- It becomes a game of exploration.
  - Related to [[The Trade-off Between Exploitation and Exploration]].
  - This is the [[Era of the Game]].
- Previously valued practices like "mass production" and "cost reduction" become hindrances.
  - Not inherently bad, but "quickly finding customers" takes precedence [[Lean Startup]].
  - It is detrimental to allocate too many resources to past customs that do not contribute to quickly finding customers.
  - There arises a need to break past patterns [[Double-loop Learning]].

When a promising customer vein is discovered, everyone enters, and the race to meet demand begins anew.
