Impact of [[ChatGPT]] on the [freelance market

> [gijigae](https://twitter.com/gijigae/status/1722961816026820988/photo/1) A recent study in the US shows that in the months following the launch of ChatGPT, leading online freelance copywriters and designers reported a significant drop in the number of jobs they had and a sharp drop in their income ↓. In other words, not only is generative AI taking their jobs, but it is also reducing the value of the work they are doing.

Note that the values on the vertical axis are scores calculated by a mathematical formula and are different from the actual numbers (there are no concrete examples of the calculations, so it is hard to know what the values will be...).
