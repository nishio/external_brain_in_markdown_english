title: "Kings and Clowns"
---

- A [[king]] with dictatorial power is threatened by the fact that his power prevents "information inconvenient to him" from being communicated.
- Inconvenient information is very important when change occurs
- But if you push for efficiency in maintaining normalcy, you end up with a [[hierarchical organization]].
- Hierarchical organization does not properly communicate inconvenient information
- Requires an irregular presence that does not belong to a hierarchical organization
- That's where [[clowning]] needs to come in.
- Clowns are not part of a hierarchical organization.
- A clown is not punished for giving the king an earful.
- Clowns can criticize the nobility.

- But how does a clown get to know the king?
- A clown can't suddenly meet the king.
- In other words, the clown must first be liked by the nobility and intercede with the king.
- If you gain the king's trust and create a state of shelter, you may strike a nobleman.
- These two phases are separate.

It just happened to be the same title.
> [realNuun](https://x.com/realNuun/status/1812053080600654147) In social games, players who play a role in motivating others are generally divided into two types: the "king" type and the "clown" type.
>
>  Kings are the type that what they say comes true, and clowns are the type that tell the truth.
>  Kings gain by having a high predictability of their actions as seen by other players in non-cooperative games, while clowns gain by having a low predictability of their actions.
>  In a repeat Prisoner's Dilemma game, the king is the type who takes the clobbering strategy and the clown is the type who doesn't.
>
>  It seems important to keep consistency during the same game because mixing kingly and clownish play in a single social game tends to be a weak strategy.
