title: "Disadvantages of Communication Rules"
---

    - Knowing [[rule]] is one thing, being able to play by the rules is another.
    - If someone hears the rule in basketball that you can't walk three steps with the ball, can they play by that rule?
- If there is a large difference in rule proficiency, only certain people will be called out for infractions by the referee.
- It interferes with the smooth progress of the game, and if the penalty for foul play is too great, it is not a game.
- If the goal is to make it a game, the rules should be loosened.
    - When the goal is to facilitate smooth communication, gather many points of view, etc., it is not desirable to suppress some participants.
- On the other hand, if the side that is more proficient aims to win, it will seek to uphold the rules.
    - The best personal strategy for those who want to control the field.
    - This is often not the overall optimum
