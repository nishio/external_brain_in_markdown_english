*1440668865*Resolution: "Invalid JSON string" when trying to update a record in the kintone API.
PUT and got "Illegal JSON string." I got angry and asked "Is it an invalid JSON string? Is it because of the newlines? Is it because it is a multibyte string? But it was because I had set {foo: 'bar'} when I should have set {foo: {value: 'bar'}}.
