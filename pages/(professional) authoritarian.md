title: "(professional) authoritarian"

> [asakura_yusuke](https://twitter.com/asakura_yusuke/status/1736241191841370344) A "professional authority figure" who is regarded as a "[[intellectual]]" or "[intellectual giant" and makes a living from his or her [[authority]]. people." This type of person is common among cultural figures, but there are also many such people in the business world. The source of their power lies in the fact that they are regarded as "[[authority]]" themselves.
>  People who are not quite sure what they are, but are recognized as "authorities" because they are called "authorities".
>
>  They are often [[pedantic]], and they often make meaningless statements in a definitive tone, but the more difficult the statement is, the more the recipient appreciates it. The more difficult the discourse is, the more the recipient appreciates it, because a plain discourse that anyone can understand lacks authority.
>  If the discourse has poor [[practicality]], the discourse will be exposed to evaluation, but if the discourse is highly abstract and has no practicality, there is no need to worry about it. It is their special skill to speak of [[word play]] without [[falsifiability]] as the hidden truth of the world.

>  Some recipients will claim to "[[be]] known" for such discourse. This is because they want to be recognized as an "authority" by aligning themselves with the discourse of a recognized "authority. In satisfying this [[desire for approval]] and [[desire for authority]], the "professional authority figure" is a valuable presence.
>  Empirically, it seems that many intellectuals such as high-level bureaucrats and large corporate executives, as well as the academic elite, have this kind of "understanding".

>  The authority of the "professional authority figure" is further cemented by the support of these admirers.
>  In this respect, the "professional authority figure" and his or her admirer are in a mutually beneficial dependency or complicity relationship.
>  Because the worshipper's adoration strengthens the authority's position, and the worshipper can win the status of "honorary authority" by being described by that authority as "he knows what he is doing".
>
>  It is rare for a "professional authority" to have his or her legitimacy challenged head-on. However, once an ambitious challenger arises to point out the obscurity of their discourse, the lack of evidence, or the leaps in logic, they are thoroughly crushed. This is because, more than anyone else, it is the "professional authorities" themselves who understand that their authority is maintained by being seen as "authorities.
>  Anyone who tarnishes his prestige in the slightest way in front of his worshippers must be beaten to a pulp.
>
>  When challenged by someone who questions their legitimacy or discourse, the "professional authority figure" tends to respond with a flurry of idealism, using his or her specialized knowledge and rhetoric. They leave no room for the other party to interject. They will go on with their usual activities, and before the audience has time to understand them, they will intimidate them by saying, "You don't understand anything.
>
>  When asked about the merits of the content of their discourse and they respond, "You don't understand," the point is not being made and there is no answer. As they have done many times in the past with the same trick.
>  This is similar to the "[[art of]] debunking" of the anonymous forum founder who is a commentator.
>
>  At best, their discourse is composed of a vast amount of "[[education]]" and clever "[[rhetoric]]. However, a closer look at the reality reveals that it is nothing more than [[word play]] based on [[cutting and pasting fragments of knowledge]]. Rather than "giants of knowledge," they are either trivia kings or quiz kings. I would call him a "know-it-all" or a "sophist" at best. Rather than "giants of knowledge," it would be more accurate to call them "[[vain men of knowledge]].

>  These "professional authorities" often behave like hermits, detached from the world and critical of capitalism, but most of their income comes from lectures, training, and consulting for large corporations and other organizations.
>  But more than that, I can't help but think that "professional authority figures" are really capitalistic beings, given that their authority is secured by the so-called "beauty vote," as it were, in the marketplace.
>  It is a very well developed business model.
>
>  This is a summary of what my friend told me at the banquet.
