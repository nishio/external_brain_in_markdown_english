[[Audrey Tang]] often quotes the motto "Nothing about us, without us. This applies to all [[human rights]] issues, not just digital policy, and is the reason for institutionalizing [[multi-stakeholder dialogue]].
- Visualize continuity with everyone's basic rights, rather than isolating the controversial [[Minority Rights]] as "[[wedge issues]]."
- To achieve this, open data + public minutes + immediate feedback will be combined to create a cycle of "transparency → trust → participation.

The contextual flow in which "Nothing about us, without us" appears
- Trigger (beginning of conversation)
    - Antaraa of Civis (India) explains the mission of "[[bringing]] the voice of affected parties before legislation
    - Mr. Tang summarized and endorsed in one word and presented "Nothing about us, without us (no decision about the parties without the parties)."
- Explanation of Current Status Comparison
    - India: short application period/notices dispersed to different ministries/paper-based/22 language support issues.
    - Taiwan: Participation facilitated by notice subscription, 60-day principle, and unified window. Here, it will be shown how the purpose of the slogan (participation of parties) will be ensured as an institution.
- Backgrounding the political transition
    - Backlash against opacity in 2014 (occupation of the parliament) → election of a chief of state with an "open government" policy → change in cabinet policy.
    - Mr. Tang reiterated this trend as "Nothing about us, without us," the will of citizens regardless of party affiliation.
