> If a man's heart is not in the right place, there can be no deception. But, nevertheless, there is nothing wrong with a man of honesty. It is common for a man to envy others when he sees them being wise, even though he himself is not. A foolish man sees a wise man and hates him. They slander him, saying, "He is so eager to gain a great advantage that he will not take a little advantage, and he will make a name for himself by deceit and falsehood. He knows that he is being mocked because of his own heart, and that he should not be a fool, nor should he pretend to have a small advantage, nor should he learn to be wise.
>
>  If you imitate a madman and run along the main road, you are a madman. If you kill someone by imitating a bad person, you are a bad person. To learn from the leader is like a leader, and to learn from the Shun is like a Shun. To learn to be wise is to be wise, even if it is a lie.

A person who imitates a madman is a madman.

That is just an analogy. The main argument is: "Foolish people look at wise people and criticize them for hypocrisy, but they do not try to imitate wise people. They do not try to imitate the wise man. A wise man imitates a wise man.

In the present day, if you look at a lunatic's vocabulary and imitate him or her, the algorithm determines that you are a lunatic because you use a lunatic's vocabulary, and recommends content for lunatics, matches you with a lunatic, or freezes your account because you are considered a lunatic.
