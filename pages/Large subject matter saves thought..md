title: "Large subject matter saves thought."

> "I don't particularly want to assert that [[the subject is large]], but it's easy to talk about it in a messy [[generalize]] way, so the subject is large as a result" theory.
> "It is not my intention to make the subject matter larger, but simply because I have a small sample size for my [[small world]], and the subject matter is larger as a result of constructing the argument within that sample size" theory.
>  As a thinking game, so when you see a "claim with a large subject", it would be interesting to think "how small can that subject be?
>  The assertion "[[I am a 00.]]" is also a great subject in some cases. There may be additional conditions, such as time constraints.
> When the mind is tired, be especially careful. The judgment "I am already a 00" is an [[Excessive generalization]] and is likely to be a "[[big subject]]". When the mind is tired, the vision becomes narrower and the world becomes smaller.

- [[Clarification]] of [[boundary condition]] requires [[thinking]]. When the [[thinking cost]] cannot be raised, omitting the boundary condition results in a larger set.

    - [[When the mind is tired, the vision becomes narrower and the world becomes smaller.]]
    - [[narrow-minded]]
    - [[big subject]] is [[Saving Thought]].
