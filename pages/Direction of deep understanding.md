title: "Direction of deep understanding"
---

In Japanese, the expression "[[deep understanding]]" is used. According to this expression, the "deep understanding" axis is downward, but for the author, upward seems more natural. The higher the level of abstraction, the higher the "why" of why something is done or why something works, and the lower the concrete knowledge or "how-to" (how to do something). I also think that "[[wide field of vision]]" extends to the left and right, and "[[application]]," which is difficult to see, is in the depth direction (Fig. a). I have no firm evidence for this.
