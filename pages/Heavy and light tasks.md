title: "Heavy and light tasks"
---

[[Heavy tasks]] are expensive, but you can't avoid them and do only [[light tasks]].

Precisely because there are [[people without eyes to see]] who positively evaluate [[people who only do light tasks]], [[strategies that only do light tasks]] will also have some success.

Can people who experience heavy tasks identify if others are only doing light tasks?
- Not all the tasks you're doing are observable, so it's possible that you're doing heavy tasks that you can't see.
    - [[Behind the Scenes]].
- The reverse is likely.
    - People who only do light tasks underestimate those who do heavy tasks.
    - I sometimes think, "I'm doing [[inefficient]] tasks."

Light tasks are not evil.
- In fact, sometimes it's essential.
- You're so busy doing the light tasks that are needed that you don't have time to do the heavy tasks.
    - [[first big stone in]].
- I want to [[sit down]] and do [Big Tasks
