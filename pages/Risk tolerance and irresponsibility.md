title: "Risk tolerance and irresponsibility"
---

- I think they have a high [[risk tolerance]], are [[early adopters]] of more and more [[New Challenges]], have strong [[irresponsibility]], and avoid risk by [[escaping]] as soon as the [[wind's direction]] gets bad. It occurred to me.

Note that "[[irresponsibility]]" and "[[escape]]" are used as terms with very positive meanings, contrary to their original nuance.
