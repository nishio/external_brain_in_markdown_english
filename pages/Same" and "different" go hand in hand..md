- Another expression of rereading
    - It is easy to assume that "[[same]]" and "[[not match the correct (answer, etc.)]]" are incompatible, but this is because it is assumed that X and Y are a single point, and if both are [[set]], a situation can arise where "the set is not [[equal]], but is largely [[ overlap]]' situation can occur if both are [[set]]. In that case, if you focus on the common part, they are 'the same', and if you focus on the rest, they are 'different'.

- When we say, "X is Y (the same as) Y," we are thinking "X=Y" if we consider X and Y as a single symbol.
- However, if the assumption of a single point is incorrect,
    - If X or Y is a set
- There could be a discrepancy between X and Y.
- In that case, it is compatible for X to be (nearly) the same as Y and for there to be a difference between X and Y.
- It is not "the same," but "the sets overlap significantly," or, to put it more softly, "[Similar.
