(2) Think, "What if others were involved in a similar situation? (3) Think about what you fear the most. Surprisingly, you will often find that the situation is not a big deal.

- It didn't feel like there were 40 clues, but it was an explanation of what [[anxiety]] is, citing various references.
- [[People are insecure when their value is threatened.]]
    - People are anxious about being abandoned because we are all [[lonely]].
- "Humans differ greatly in [[their ability to handle crisis situations when encountered]]. "Rollo May, "[[The]] Anthropology of Anxiety."
    - So striving to improve that processing capacity is important for life.
    - People who are afraid of anxiety avoid [[opportunities to test their strength]].
        - Avoiding opportunities for creativity from themselves.
- There are two types of anxiety: realistic anxiety and neurotic anxiety. Unreasoned anxiety or fear, [[sense of anxiety]].
- When you are anxious, it is important to identify the cause of your anxiety.
- "[[A]] solely results-oriented attitude often robs life of its joy."[[Ellen Langer]].
- [[Karen Hornai]] lists "pandering," "attack," and "withdrawal" as three ways to escape anxiety.
    - [[Pandering makes people less confident in their own worth]].
    - Pandering is roughly defined as the following three things
        - １： [[submissive]] 、 [[discretion]]
        - 2: [[work hard]], [[serious]], [[try to excel]].
        - 3: [[Forced to act cheerful]].

- Children have anxiety about being abandoned by their parents. Hence, they play the good child.
    - As a result, the child becomes anxious about life itself.
    - The threat of "be good or I won't love you."
    - For children, it is indeed a threat. You as an adult need not be intimidated by it.
    - Interpersonal relationships in adulthood are built up in the life of the infant and repeated in later life" [[Fromm-Reichman]] "[[The pathology of human relationships]]."
        - [[Erich Fromm.]]'s idea.
        - [[People become anxious when they lose their primary bond and cannot gain a secondary bond]].
        - The [[primary bond]] is the [[sense of oneness with the mother]] that existed before individuation.
        - In the process of [[individualization]], they become physically and mentally stronger, but on the other hand, their loneliness increases.
        - I don't feel [[my role]] or [[the meaning of life]] anymore.
        - Feelings of helplessness and insignificance grow.
        - The impulse to throw away [[individuality]] and run away from [[solitude]] is [[obedience]]. Erich Fromm, "[[Escape from Freedom]]", p. 44-45

        - Obedience is not communicating by conforming to the other person.
    - Those who pander want to be seen as nice. But in many cases, they are taken lightly.
    - "[[You can't be happy because]] you make sacrifices."[[Tatarkevich]].
    - Children raised by parents with strong neurotic tendencies perceive that their surroundings are forcing them to be obedient even as adults. Even though the other person is not demanding obedience.
    - Why do you feel threatened by the world?
        - Because my parents expected me to be different and I tried to live up to them.
        - A basic sense of security that they are accepted by their parents as they are.
        - A sense of insecurity that if you say "no," they will throw you away.
        - The world is not a threat to you as an adult.
        - You just feel threatened on your own.
        - I tell myself, "I'm not afraid of the world around me."
    - Seriousness and work ethic are desirable. But for what purpose? Is it an escape from reality from insecurity or the pursuit of a goal?
        - The [[good]] boy is [[honesty]] being hunted down to protect himself from the fear of abandonment.
    - Fear of failure.
        - What happens when they fail?
        - I can't live up to people's expectations."
        - This is highly stressful for obedient people who have lived by meeting people's expectations since childhood.
    - Isn't a happy person someone who looks like they are working hard from the side, even though they don't think they are?
        - [[Effort motivated by love and effort motivated by a sense of inferiority]] are completely different.
        - It is the effort motivated by love that brings victory.
    - When you work hard with a goal, you don't work too hard.
        - [[You can't achieve your goals if you work too hard to maintain them]].
    - People who work hard because of anxiety are always tense and easily tired.
        - People who have support in their hearts are not afraid of any changes in their surroundings. Those without it are vulnerable to difficulties and changes.
    - I don't know how to deal with people other than being serious. That's why I can't communicate.
        - I made an effort, but it was not an effort for me to live.
        - It was an effort to meet the expectations of others. And those expectations were too great compared to my abilities.

        - A person who exploits others. A person who takes away power.
        - Cut down.
        - [[People with poor mental and physical health need to sort out their relationships or they will get stuck]].
        - Cut out those who do not do anything specific for you, but only offer a few words of pleasantries.
    - Drop the mask of forcing yourself to act cheerful.
        - Cheerfulness is sometimes just a mask to cover up insecurity.
        - They say things like, "Why a bright kid who committed suicide?" Why?" and so on. Wasn't brightness a way to hide her insecurities?
    - Try to stop doing something (such as attacking another person) and you will become anxious, which will show that the anxiety was the reason for the behavior.
    - If you want to essentially quell anxiety, you need to be able to communicate.
    - Ultimately, your life is your responsibility.
        - With that in mind, I think about my life from many angles.

    - The idea to actually take action.
        - The next best thing is to do the best you can do.
        - [[obsessed with the best solution]] and taking the worst without being able to do the next best thing.
        - For example, it's best to sleep and wake up healthy, but if that's not possible, the next best thing is to take sleeping pills to sleep.
        - And yet, he adamantly refuses, and as a result, he can't sleep and gets sick.
        - What is the purpose?
        - [[Humans are not supermen]].
        - Realistic solutions, not idealistic pursuits.

- I get tangled up with [[people who attack other people]] when I go in and say that they are making claims that I don't agree with and that's not true. I used to think I was the victim, but I guess not. People like that are insecure, and they find [[peace of mind]] by criticizing others to relieve their insecurity. They resent me because I suddenly pull them away from it with an "attack" in the name of "[[good argument]]. I guess they are the victims.
    - I just don't like information that I think is wrong to be circulated without being corrected, so I guess I should correct them but not fold them in with more righteous arguments if they are offended by the correction.
