<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It seems to me that there are many variations of the "1000 people come up with the idea, 100 people start it, 10 people finish it, and 1 person publishes it" type of story, but I'm interested in what variations there are.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The phrase "1,000 people come up with the idea, 100 start it, 10 complete it, and one goes public" relates to the selection and effort involved in the process of bringing an idea or project to fruition. There are many variations, but here are a few examples
    - "A thousand think, a hundred [[act]], ten continue, and one [[succeeds]]."
    - "A thousand people dream, a hundred [[try]], ten [[continue]], one [[achieves]]."
    - "A thousand people hope, a hundred [[challenge]], ten fight through, and one will be the winner."
    - "1,000 people have an [[IDEA]], 100 people work on it, 10 people evolve it, and 1 person initiates [[innovation]]."
    - One thousand people have hope, one hundred work hard, ten never give up, and one makes their dreams come true."
- These variations are used in a variety of situations and contexts to describe [[goal achievement]] or the effort or process of working toward success.


People who want to do it, 1,000. 100 people who want to start. People who continue, 1.

1,000 people come up with the idea, 100 people start, 10 people continue, and 1 person succeeds.

As an aside, "complete and publish" is stuck in the [[assumption]] that [[you can't publish unless you complete]], and "continue and succeed" is stuck in the assumption that success is achieved by continuing.

A million people have already come up with ideas that you can come up with. Out of those million, only about 1,000 people have put their hands to it and only about 10 people have completed it, and you will be the first one to write something interesting.
