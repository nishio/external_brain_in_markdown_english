*1279767600*Send a fax.
I received a call from someone who wanted to delay faxing something I had as text data, but I don't have a fax machine. So I searched and found this service

<a href='http://internet.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/column/biz_tool /20090617_294353.html'>[Free tool for business] Send faxes from your Web browser for free!ã€€MyFax Free" which can send to 41 countries -INTERNET Watch</a>.

I was worried about whether I could send it properly (there was no preview), but it seems to have been sent properly. I asked the recipient if he received it correctly, but it took him a while to understand that I had sent it from a browser instead of using a fax machine. Well, that's how it was sent without any particular oddities. Also, browser is a technical term, so you have to say "Internet" to get through to the recipient!
