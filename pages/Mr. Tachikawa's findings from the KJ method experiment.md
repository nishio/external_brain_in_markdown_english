title: "Mr. Tachikawa's findings from the KJ method experiment"
---

The following is a summary of our findings from the KJ method with Mr. Nishio.

- The impetus to start the KJ method came from Nishio's idea and Tachikawa's reaction.
- In the process of [[preparing 100 sticky notes]], I learned the importance of [[setting deadlines]] and [[setting step-by-step goals]].
- It is easy to forget the original [[purpose]] while working, but [[a thought-provoking diversion]] or [[a detour can be an opportunity to gain new knowledge]].
- On the day of the KJ method, we prepared various devices to [[log the place]].
- I realized that it is important not to think about [[Classification Criteria]] first, but to [[group]] things that are close together.
    - In the process of [[grouping]], [[a story of things]] can become [[a worthwhile side trip]].
- As I thought about [[the relationship between the groups]], I discovered that [[the likes are]] close to me.
- It is thought that likes are close because of [[individual differences in humans]] and [[habits of thinking]] that [[people do not want to think for themselves]] and [[do not want to leave their reach]].
- Finally, we created sentences from the remaining sticky notes and discussed [[the relationship between liking and individuality]].
- The idea for a service to expand, notice, and visualize [[likes in close proximity]] was born.

Through the KJ method, we can see that new discoveries about human thinking habits and likes were made, which led to ideas for services. From the interaction between Nishio and Tachikawa, we also learn important skills in collaboration, such as goal setting, flexibility, and how to correct others without denying them.
