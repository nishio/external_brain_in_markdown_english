What the public really wants is a resilient social system that can adapt well to emergencies such as coronas. It would be a real loss if resilience is also lowered as a result of cost reductions.
> [fpocket](https://twitter.com/fpocket/status/1763835786431217828) I am from a rural area, so I understand the plight of rural areas well, but I believe that the disregard for the principle of group autonomy in the Constitution has led to a decline in motivation among local government officials, which in turn has led to a lack of creative measures. I believe that the decline of local governments is partly due to the fact that the principle of group autonomy, as set forth in the Constitution, has been disregarded, resulting in a decline in motivation among local government officials and a lack of creative policies. Local councils have also lost their raison d'etre.
> [fpocket](https://twitter.com/fpocket/status/1763836234810712260) If we truly want to save the regions, I think we should start the discussion from the state of the nation, going back to the main purpose of local autonomy (the principle of group autonomy) as stated in the Constitution. I think we should start from the state of the nation.

I believe that this is precisely what Japan needs now in such a critical situation.

>  Where to strike a balance between decentralization and aggregation is also a difficult issue in Web3.
>  If we simply diversify, we will run into chaos and the cost of decision making will be enormous.
>  To begin with, the issue is complex, and that is precisely why we need a multidisciplinary discussion with higher resolution, not dualism.
>  There is a "Plurality Movement" happening, especially in Taiwan, and by making good use of technology, we may be able to have a pluralistic and inclusive discussion.
>  So, I wanted to use [[Pol.is]] to discuss the issue of this case.
