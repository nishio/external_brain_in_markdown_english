title: 'To invent a metaphor to express a prior felt meaning is "comprehension."'
---

from  [[Study Session 1 on "Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning]]
To invent a [[metaphor]] to express a prior felt meaning is "[[comprehension]]."
- It already has a felt meaning and we want to symbolize it.
    - But none of the existing symbols fit perfectly with what I want to say.
    - So combine existing symbols.

        - > To invent a metaphor to express a prior felt meaning is "comprehension." (p.117)

    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>So, for example, "understanding" in "reading a book and understanding what it says" or "seeing a metaphor and understanding what it means" is different from COMPREHENSION. Please note.
