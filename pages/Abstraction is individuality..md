title: "Abstraction is individuality."
---

Reading [/rashitamemo/individuality in fragmentation](https://scrapbox.io/rashitamemo/individuality in fragmentation) reminded me of [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]], p.155, which says that [[group composition is subjective]].
- The [[abstraction]] is to [[start to pull out]] where [[I think it's important]], and the [[subject]] is what you "[[think]]" is [[important]].

- [[Abstraction is subjective]]
