title: "Self-conscious bug that thinks it's an air rip."
---

- I think [[replying to someone's email without replying to their email address]] is the [[excessive self-consciousness]] bug.
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1431500059628097540): when one person A writes something that another person B feels is an "air rip", often A does not intend to air rip to B or even communicate anything to B. B is self-conscious.
