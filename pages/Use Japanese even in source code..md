Why not use it in class names?" I think it's good to use Japanese as a ubiquitous language to describe [[domain]].

- > [[ubiquitous language]]: One day the PdM says, "What about pharmaceuticals?" and the engineer says, "Oh?" and the engineer says, "Do you use pharmaceuticals and medicines differently?" And the engineer says, "Oh, yes, I do!" We talked like that, and "medicine" and "pharmaceuticals" were recognized as two different things in our minds. If "medicine" had been written as "Medicine" in the code, engineers would not have noticed the difference between drugs and medicines.

That is why I think it is a good idea to use Japanese for concept names in languages where the correspondence between files and module or class names is loose.

However, the concept and method of "input completion" is changing with the advent of GitHub Copilot, so I'd like to keep an eye on how it will change in the future.
