In his Politics, Aristotle divides the forms of state governance into "good forms" that pursue the common good and "[[perverted forms]]" that run on private interests. Among them, the "politia" is a moderate political system with the following characteristics.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Isn't "Politeia" the name of the book, not the political system? Is there a separate political system called "Politeia" mentioned in the book? : [State (dialogue) - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%BD%E5%AE%B6_(%E5%AF%BE%E8%A9%B1%E7%AF%87))
        - Plato's "State" (Πολιτεία, Politeia)
        - Aristotle's Politics (Πολιτικά, Politica)
            - Polity itself means "state system/polity".
                - Isn't it a common noun?
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3-mini-high/icon' alt='o3-mini-high.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Within the Politics (Πολιτικά), when classifying polities into "good forms" (pursuing common interests) and "perverted forms" (pursuing private interests), the Politeia is treated as one of the moderate (correct) forms of government.
        - In other words, Aristotle uses "politia" not as the name of a specific work, but as a concept of a polity based on the common good.


- Middle class domination
    - Avoiding extreme conflicts between the rich and the poor, the middle class takes the lead in governing the country, focusing on the interests of the whole rather than individual interests.
- Pursuit of Common Interests
    - Compared to a monarchy (ideal individual virtue) or an aristocracy (rule by a small number of superior individuals), this system aims for the well-being and stability of the entire nation through the participation of a wider segment of the population.
- Resistance to alteration.
    - Monarchies and aristocracies are considered prone to tyranny and oligarchy, respectively, while polyteia [[maintains moderation]] reduces the risk of alteration and is more feasible in realpolitik.

In short, Aristotle's "polyteia" is positioned as a realistic and desirable form of governance based on the public good, not private interests, and led by the middle class to achieve stability and harmony.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3-mini-high/icon' alt='o3-mini-high.icon' height="19.5"/>
It is so. Aristotle divided political systems into "correct forms" and "perverted forms," and criticized democracy (perverted form), in which the many govern in their own self-interest, as prone to instability because of its disregard for the public good. On the other hand, he positioned the politia, led by the middle class, as an ideal form of governance that is realistic and stable.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3-mini-high/icon' alt='o3-mini-high.icon' height="19.5"/>I cannot conduct an up-to-date web search, but based on previous academic discussions and knowledge, the following perspectives can be mentioned

1.### Classical criticism and modern reassessment
.
- Aristotle criticized democracy (in its altered form) because of the risk that the majority would be driven by self-interest. However, some contemporary political science appreciates that [[division of power]], [[rule of law]], and institutional design mitigate that risk, and that mechanisms are in place to reflect the views of the majority.

2.### [[tyranny of the majority]] and populism
.
- Some contemporary commentators have pointed out the possible dangers of democracy, such as the rise of [[information handling]] and [[populism]], and there is a movement to reevaluate Aristotle's concerns. On the other hand, there are those who emphasize [[citizen participation]] and [[openness of debate]] as the basis of democracy, and the debate continues to seek a balance between the two.

3.### Limitations of application due to differences in historical background
.
- Some critics argue that Aristotle's argument is based on the ancient social structure and character of citizens and is not directly comparable to the modern [[diversity]] or [[global information environment]]. In other words, his critique of democracy is based on an acute understanding of the problems specific to his time, and it is believed that modern democracy requires new perspectives and institutional improvements.

As described above, Aristotle's critique offers one insight into the challenges of contemporary democracy, but it is currently being reevaluated from a variety of perspectives in light of major changes in institutions and social conditions.

- You didn't say that "democracy" in today's terms is bad, just that the way we name concepts is a little different than it is today.
- All three types of polities are at risk of being transformed.
- That it is best to be careful to maintain moderation in a polytechnic in which a wide range of people participate.
    - People's opinions are [[polarized]] by [[filter bubble]] and [[moderated]] by [broad listening
