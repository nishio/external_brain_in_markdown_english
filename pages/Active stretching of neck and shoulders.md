- I did it in the bath.
- In the picture, you're sitting along the long feature of the tub, but then one of your hands is in contact with the wall next to the tub.
    - Distorted posture from side to side when trying to avoid it.
    - You should sit at right angles to the long section of the tub.
- I've always thought, "When I rotate my shoulder, I don't hear a bang," but the resolution of that "rotate" has increased.
    - Both shoulders buckle when the scapular is lowered.
    - Right shoulder also says pack rotation.
- I was bummed out by the end of the 10×3, but it seemed to be decreasing.
    - Shoulder may improve if done often in the future.
