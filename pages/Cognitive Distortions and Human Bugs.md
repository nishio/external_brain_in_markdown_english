title: "Cognitive Distortions and Human Bugs"
---

- I've been using [[cognitive distortion]] and [[human bug]] vaguely to refer to similar concepts, but maybe I should clarify the boundaries.

The fact is X, but some people fail to recognize that it is X, and they perceive that it is Y.
- This is a cognitive distortion.
- Metaphor that the robot's camera sensor gets bent and decides that what is in front of it is not in front of it and acts on it, causing a collision

Because of the connection between the trachea and the esophagus, drinks get into the lungs and make you gag.
- This is a human bug.
- We have had strange implementations that have caused inconveniences when a more appropriate design could have been in place.

Once beneficial, but not in today's context.
- Like how the body tries to store fat right away.
    - [Humans continue pointless procedures.
- We have called these human bugs, but are they bugs?
    - You just haven't been able to update your specs to meet changing circumstances.

Bugs can be beneficial at times (image of bug technique)
    - [[Bug or Ability.]]
