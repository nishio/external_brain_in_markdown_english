    - [[Murder Mysteries]], a story about how some people subjectively "have a hard time putting on airs" in response to
- Which is it:.

    - Since Nishio is enjoying himself, he must actually be able to read the air."
- The latter is not a zero-factor in whether one can read the air or not, so I think Nishio-san can read a little bit.

[[not zero and one]].
- [[0 or 1]]
- Whether or not [[air can be read]] is [[False dichotomy]].
