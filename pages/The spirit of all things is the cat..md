title: "The spirit of all things is the cat."
---

Today's Nishio Family
I "went to see a friend and told him that [the spirit of all things is the cat.
Wife: "[[cat]] and [[maize]] are peacefully sharing the earth."
I said, "Which way is up?"
Wife: "Neither one is better than the other, both are the type to [[ignore things that don't concern them]]."

- The very concept of [[the lord of creation]] was tainted by the idea of [[Homo sapiens]] [[apes]] trying to put a [[pecking order]] between species! The real [[higher beings]] were not interested in hierarchy!
