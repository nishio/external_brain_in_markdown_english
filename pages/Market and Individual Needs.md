## What's been bothering me lately
- [[Sell first rather than make good products]]

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/tatekawa/icon' alt='tatekawa.icon' height="19.5"/>
I totally agree with this!
The opinions of customers who haven't bought (or even something else) is just a random survey. There is no blood in them. The opinions of the customers who are buying are poignant, earnest, and bloody.

I completely agree that the opinions of people who haven't bought the product are not helpful, but I'm having a hard time deciding whether I should prioritize "[[making something that meets my needs]]" or "[[making something that meets the market's needs]]".

I see
If we get Mr. Nishio's words, isn't it possible that it is [[choosing the wrong two options]]?
Also, [[my needs]] seem about right in and of themselves, but [[the market's needs]] seem to be, in our words, "[[whose subjectivity is it]]?" in our words.

"[[No one called the market]]."
- Related: [[There is no Mr. Company...]].

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/tatekawa/icon' alt='tatekawa.icon' height="19.5"/>
that's right
Which should be prioritized, [[needs whose subjectivity is obvious]] or [[needs whose subjectivity is not obvious]]?
I thought it might be a good idea to go through these two options once before making it an open question

- [[good prospect (e.g. marriage, business)]] so put it all together in Scrapbox later

### digest of notes
.
Ms. Nishio and Mr. Tachikawa discuss the needs of the market, the needs of individuals, and their priorities. Ms. Tachikawa argues that the opinions of customers who have not purchased the product are merely an appropriate questionnaire, and that the opinions of customers who have purchased the product are important. On the other hand, Ms. Nishio wonders whether she should make products that satisfy her own needs or those of the market. Mr. Tachikawa suggested that choosing between one's own needs and the market's needs is a fallacy and that one should ask whose subjectivity determines the market's needs.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The "Tachikawa-san Communication Theory" is a discussion about where customers find value, i.e., whose subjectivity determines value, and is directly related to the discussion in the notes. Also, in "[[One Night Werewolf Transcript 2-7 Discussion]]," Nishio's opinion that when creating something new, one should create a prototype based on one's own sense of value and present it to the customer is related to the discussion in the note.
- Did I ever tell you that?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Oh, I do: [[one-night werewolf transcript 2-7 discussion #5c501695aff09e0000dc4ba0]]


### deep thinking
Prioritizing between market needs and individual needs is directly related to the question of whose subjectivity determines value. Market needs are the aggregate of the subjectivity of many people, while individual needs are determined by a person's own subjectivity. Therefore, the question of which to prioritize is a question of value, the subjectivity of the many or the subjectivity of the individual, and which is more important.

### summary of thoughts and title
.
It is a question of values, of whether the needs of the market or the needs of the individual should take precedence over the subjectivity of the many or the subjectivity of the individual."
