[ASCII.jp: Cybozu explains "Share DX" for sharing kintone applications among local governments](https://ascii.jp/elem/000/004/076/4076466/) #Share DX
> The Tokyo Metropolitan Government is one of the municipalities that are using [[kintone]] throughout the government. Kawaguchi City started small, but the Tokyo Metropolitan Government started with 2,000 users to conduct [[inquiry operations]] within the government, which had been done with Excel and e-mail. The system is now being used to confirm the licenses of medical personnel involved in vaccinations. In the "Shin-Tosei Acceleration Policy" announced at the beginning of fall, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government clearly stated its intention to promote the use of kintone, and plans are in place to use it in the future as well.
