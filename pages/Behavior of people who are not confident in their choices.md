title: "Behavior of people who are not confident in their choices"
---

- [[People who are unsure of themselves beat others.]]
- > If you don't have [[confidence (in yourself)]] in your choices, you will be tempted to think that your choices are right by criticizing those who made different choices.
- [[The good and bad of multiple options]]
- > A person who chooses option A thinks that choice is [[anxiety]] and claims that "choosing option A is the right thing to do" or is happy with an article claiming so.
- [[People who are unsure if what they have learned is beneficial.]]
- > People who have no [[confidence (in themselves)]] whether [[what we learned]] was [[beneficial]] or not, claim it was "beneficial" because they don't want to think it was a waste, and when others deny it, they [[repulsion]] it/they are convinced it was beneficial. If they are convinced that it was beneficial, they just think "what a stupid person" when they see someone who says "it was beneficial," and they don't repulse them.

    - [[Peace of mind to follow the rules]]
    - Psychology of feeling unsure about choosing one's actions from many options, and feeling secure by following the rules.

    - [[I want to brag about how hard I'm working.]]
    - The psychology of wanting to be free from the fear that one's efforts may be futile by appealing, "I'm working so hard," and having people say, "That's nice."
