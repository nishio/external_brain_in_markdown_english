title: "New maps can be created offline."

from [[pRegroup2020]]
I think we should be able to create new maps offline.
- Is this quite difficult?

- In the first place, it is still possible to create a blank new one at this point.
    - It is "saved as new map" after the fact and stored in the cloud.
- The state before saving is not saved locally, so reloading will make it disappear.

- Add the top page to [[Add to Home screen]].
    - Recent Maps on the top page
        - Put in [IndexedDB
    - You can see there whether the server storage is available or not.

I thought it had to work offline... but when I actually try to use it outside, it asks me if I want to connect to a nearby phone tethering.
