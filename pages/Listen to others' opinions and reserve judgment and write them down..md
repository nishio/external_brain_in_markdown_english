Listen to the opinions of others [[reserving judgment]] and write them down.

- In order to notice blind spots, it is useful to ask others for their opinions [[reserving judgment]] and write them down.
- I've asked people, "What do you think about this problem?" When I ask someone "What do you think about this problem?" and I get a response, I tend to [[repulsion]] and say "No, that's not what I was looking for" or "That's not a valid solution, so it's useless" or [[shutting out]] and throw away the question. For some reason, I tend to do such a wasteful thing.
- Instead, take "at least this person thinks this" or "this person thinks this is relevant" and write it down, and then think about it carefully.
