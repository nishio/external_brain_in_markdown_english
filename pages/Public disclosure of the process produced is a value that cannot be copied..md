from  [[Diary 2023-04-25]]
Public disclosure of the process produced is a value that cannot be copied.
- About [Uncopyable value
    - I think [[Nodal Point of Thought 2023-04-24]] is clearly a [[personalize]] of "[[Better than Free]]".
    - This column, "Better than Free," discusses what value is found in an age of easy copying.
- Personalized and produced to the public is equivalent to creating "[public goods (i.e. goods or services such as parks or highways)".
        - When you asked me about [[KJ Method Study Session @ Loftwork]], I answered, "I don't care how much money it costs, but the condition is that what we make must be available to the public.
        - At the time, the concept of public goods was not yet a word in my vocabulary.
- from  [[Condition when it arises]]
    - To understand the concept, it is good to look closely at "the state of affairs ([[In statu nascendi]]) when it arose"
        - Because it is the closest in terms of "mental state before the concept is acquired".
- Better yet, it is even better to look at "[[the]] process of being produced" itself!
        - I think the best way to communicate the method of [[intellectual production]] is to visualize the process of intellectual production itself.
    - And this disclosure of the "process of being created" can only be done by those who are creating
        - Those who just copy what is produced can't do that.
        - This is another one of those values that cannot be copied.
