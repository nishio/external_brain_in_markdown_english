Verbalized notice in the 2015 [[Arrange sticky notes on a polypropylene sheet.]] experiment.

Need to get more output to more people to get more feedback

- I rearranged them based on my findings from the last [[Clean Space Experiment]] and came up with a few more.
- I had previously thought that manuscript writing needed to be enhanced by software and methodology, but I had not really thought through why. Only to reduce the burden or something like that. If that is the reason, then it should be okay to stop writing.
- When I thought about it in combination with various other things and the reasons for doing it, I realized that fundamentally, there is a feeling of "[[Want to get more feedback]] and need to [[Deliver more output to more people]] in order to do that.
- Learning English because I feel I will get more feedback if I extend the reach of my output to the English-speaking world.
- I give out [[free text questionnaires]] when I give talks because I want to get [[feedback]].
