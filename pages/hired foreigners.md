> Oyatoi gaikokujin (お雇い外国人) is a general term for foreigners employed by the Japanese government and various prefectures from the end of the Edo period (1603-1868) to the Meiji period (1868-1912).
>  People were hired for the purpose of introducing Western technology, learning, and institutions to promote "[[industrial development]]" and "[[wealthy country and strong military]]". These people had knowledge, experience, and skills that were hard to obtain from among the Japanese of the time, and included a few Chinese and Indians in addition to Westerners.

> As of 1871 (Meiji 3-4), the highest monthly salary for a foreigner was 1,045 yen for William Kinder, the manager of the mint.
It's great that you're paying them well.
