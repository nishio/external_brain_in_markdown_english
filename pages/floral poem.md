A system that makes it easy to borrow money
> Why do Alipay users prefer to pay with Huata? One reason is simply that the interest cost is more favorable. By utilizing Hua Hao, the actual payment can be postponed, just like a Japanese credit card. As of 12/5, the interest rate of Yuehua Bao is 3.99/year. In China, this may be a training to improve financial literacy by utilizing such financial instruments and worrying about the interest rate burden on a daily basis. I envy them because in countries with low interest rates, people tend to be insensitive to interest rates.
