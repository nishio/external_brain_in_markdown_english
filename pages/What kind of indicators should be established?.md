> 3 "Ease of doing" is important (p. 192)
- > [[Ease of action]]. For a report to [[lead to action]], the [[causal relationship]] must be clear. Otherwise [[Vanity Indicators]]. If [[total number of visits]] goes up or down, we don't know what to do.
- > [[Clarity]]. If the data is not understandable to the reader, it is meaningless. I recommend using "person" as the unit of measure because it makes it easier to understand.
- >  [[Ease of verification]]. Can the report be verified through other means (e.g., by asking the customer directly) to see if it is correct?
>
>  The third one is quite difficult.
