title: "Wall Resolution"

> [@0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1685450807540666368?s=20): it's perfectly fine to take time for what you want/need to do, but put [[milestone]] against it, I need to move forward manually, even if it's just a little bit. Not moving forward is completely different from saying, "This is the problem now, so we have to do 00. This is [[the difference in resolution]] and [[the ability to move forward into the future]].
> [@0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1685451155701424128?s=20): anything that is not in a state where every task is "if 00 is XXX, I can get my hands on it" is nothing but limbo. This tends to be the case for those who haven't put their hands in the air.

- When you get away from the wall, you say, "[[I can't go on because of the wall]]" and [[stop]].
    - The [[Cognitive Resolution]] is low, so the wall looks like "[[wall without holes]]".
- The closer you get, the better you can see and the [[hole in the wall]] may be discovered.
- [[You have to get close to the wall to see the hole in the wall]].

There are people who say, "I have an idea of a good future vision, but I can't move forward because [[the wall]] is in the way." without getting closer.
- This is a variant of "[Attacking the unfamiliar without looking at it properly.

- Seemingly non-aggressive patterns
- Claims that "I can't implement my [[brilliant idea]] because of [[constraints]]."
    - No one can deny that they have a great idea.
    - It's the constraints that are bad, not you.
    - [[the world is bad]], [[myself confronting evil]].
- [[Ideas that are not validated by action have no value.]]
    - [[An idea that cannot be implemented is not a great idea.]]
            - [[Unfeasible ideas seem original.]]


old title
- [[future resolution]].
        - [[resolution (e.g., display, dpi)]] in [[future tense]]
