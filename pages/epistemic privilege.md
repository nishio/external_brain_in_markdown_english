epistemic privilege
> [wagashi_no_yosa](https://x.com/wagashi_no_yosa/status/1808295445611045293) It was pointed out before why [[sociology]] only studies [[minority]]. I think one of the reasons is the idea of "cognitive privilege" that "more accurate knowledge is likely to be produced from a [[marginal]] [[social position]]". Majorities have difficulty seeing their own society objectively.
