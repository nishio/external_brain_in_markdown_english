> In 2013, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) launched the "Study Abroad Promotion Campaign" "Tobitate: Study Abroad Japan" to encourage all Japanese university and high school students with ambition and ability to take the first step toward studying abroad! Study Abroad JAPAN" was launched in 2013 to encourage all Japanese university and high school students who are willing and able to take the first step toward studying abroad.
>  In the first stage (FY2013-FY2022), approximately 9,500 young people have grown into global human resources through various practical activities overseas, and have been remarkably active, receiving various awards in Japan and abroad and starting their own businesses.
>  Based on these results, we are implementing the second stage (FY2023-FY2027) with a new vision and concept starting in FY2023 in order to continue to strengthen our efforts to develop global human resources through industry-academia-government collaboration.
>  In the second stage, the "New Japan Representative Program" (more than 4,000 high school students and 1,000 university students over 5 years) is being implemented with expanded support at the high school level in order to link overseas experience from a younger age to future study abroad.
>  The second proposal of the Council for Creation of Future Education (April 27, 2023) aims to increase the total number of Japanese students studying abroad to 500,000 by 2033, and "Tobitate! Study Abroad JAPAN" will continue to serve as the flagship program to help build momentum for studying abroad.
