<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Normal technology fields are the first to enter by [[technological early adopters]], because there is no smell of money. They become [[authority]] who can [[evaluate technology]] and [[ability to deter (an attack, etc.)]] against [[non-technical fraudsters]]. But in technical fields that smell of money, [[people without technology]] will come early.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>That observation provides an important insight in [[the pattern of advancement in technological fields]]. The first areas in which technological early adopters get involved are usually driven by those who are attracted by the pure potential and innovation of the technology. They see the value in the technology itself, and through its application and development, shape the community and the industry as a whole. At this point, the long-term vision of technological advancement is more important than the "smell of money," making it less attractive to [[cheaters]] and those seeking short-term gains.

On the other hand, technical fields that "smell of money"-that is, those with clear financial returns and high potential to generate high profits-attract people early on, even those without a technical background or deep understanding of the field. This is because they attract people who have a strong incentive to pursue financial gain and expect short-term success and returns. The result is an environment where scammers and dishonesty are more likely to run rampant, with a metrosexual population [[who are less capable of making technical assessments]] and players focused on marketing and [[hype]] rather than technology.

This difference is particularly evident in the crypto industry and some fast startup environments. In these fields, the prospect of high profits in the early stages tends to prioritize [[funding]] and [[rapid growth in the market]] over [[technical prowess]] and true innovation. This risks hindering the healthy development of the field for the technical early adopters and innovators who actually create value, and negatively affects [[the credibility of the industry as a whole]] in the long run.

Therefore, to encourage healthy development with an emphasis on technological depth and substantive innovation, it is necessary to set clear standards by the community and regulatory agencies, increase education and transparency, and foster a culture that emphasizes technological assessment. This will strengthen the natural deterrents against fraudsters unaccompanied by technology and create an environment conducive to real innovation.
