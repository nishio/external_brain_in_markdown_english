I used to have a hot carpet until the year before last, but I haven't felt static electricity in winter since I switched to this.
This may be due to the influence of [[Zojirushi Thermal Humidifier]].

A common [[hot carpet]] is rated at 380W or so.

I used to pull a rug over the hot carpet because the cat might throw up. This is waterproof, so I don't need to pull it down.
Rugs collect cat hair and other debris, but these have a smooth surface that maintains hygiene.
