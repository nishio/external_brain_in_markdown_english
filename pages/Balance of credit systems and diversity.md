## Diversity and the personal credit system
.
- Does technium evolution refer to a dynamic change in technology or is there a deeper meaning?
- Further study is needed on the relationship between collective free will and diversity.
- The balance between credit systems and diversity may lead to new value creation in firms and organizations. In this connection, aspects of lower costs and lower barriers to activation that cause discontinuous change should also be considered.

    - Does implementing a credit system and placing a higher value on one individual than another undermine diversity?
    - To think that this undermines diversity assumes that each individual is of equal value, but that's like saying "bad because it's bad."
    - For example, if there are 10 people and 9 people have the same opinion, it is more diverse to give only 1/9 vote to 9 people
        - It is reasonable to assume that people's values are equal as [[uninformed prior distribution]], but perhaps subsequent observations should update the values in a Bayesian manner.

There's also a one-line mention in the [[🤖2023-08-11-5]] phase.
