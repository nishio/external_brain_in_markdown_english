title: "Cybozu Days Keynote Manuscript"

I have organized the AI-related situation surrounding Cybozu in order to create a story for the AI part of the Keynote session at [[Cybozu Days 2023-11-09]].
- Record the stories, including the ones you didn't use.

1. in general: What's so great about AI these days?
- Computers now understand "communication".
- Until now, computers have been good at dealing with numerical data and classification data. That's why companies have been accumulating such data and analyzing it with [[BigQuery]] and other tools.
    - The contrast between [[data and communication]] here was cut from the day's talk.
    - The reason I included the BigQuery keyword is because the previous section talks about connecting kintone as a front end to external services.
- Computers, on the other hand, could not understand human speech. Therefore, to give instructions to computers, "programmers" had to write them using specialized "programming languages.
- Computers have come to understand "communication," making conversations and discussions on groupware a subject that can be analyzed, and allowing non-programmers to give instructions to computers in Japanese.
    - I also cut "Conversations and discussions on groupware became an analyzable subject" here.
        - Because the two parallelisms, "Even non-programmers can now give instructions to a computer in Japanese," would confuse the listener.
        - When I thought about narrowing it down to one or the other, I thought "making conversations and discussions analyzable" would make everyone except those who work analytically say, "Analyze? What makes you happy?" and so on.
            - [[broad listening]], but I don't have enough time to explain it.

What will happen when Cybozu products, kintone and groupware are combined with AI?
- Groupware's mechanism for storing and sharing information and discussions is a good match for AI.
- The style of creating a "place for information sharing" recommended by Cybozu is particularly compatible.
- why?
- In a mail-like culture where information is owned by the individual, it is only reinforced by the individual.
- Use it with a team to strengthen the team.
    - ("Improving teamwork" gives a sense of communication, so "strengthening the team" is better.)
- For example, with the advent of Mailwise, teams can now share the history of exchanges that were difficult to manage with personal mailers.
- Information sharing strengthens the team.
- You can imagine that "Mr. AI" is assigned to this shared place and shared team as a new employee.
    - [[Mr. AI as a new employee]]
- Mr. AI" doesn't know much about his job yet, so we need to teach him in the future. On the other hand, unlike humans, it can work 24 hours a day.
- For example, a 2023 paper has a study that looked at user satisfaction with AI-generated autoresponders.
- User satisfaction was higher than with conventional auto-response emails. Also, when AI wrote a draft and a human reworked it and sent it, satisfaction was higher than when only a human wrote it.
- This "reworking" is a kind of "teaching AI-san to do his job".
- Everyone on the team will bring their knowledge together on the groupware to make their teammates' "Mr. AI" better.
- The organization's use of knowledge is progressing.

What is important to utilize and introduce AI?
- The current state of the art regarding AI is about where it was in 1995, when the Internet began to spread.
- Cybozu was founded in 1997.
- In 2000, Internet penetration reached 40% of the population, and Google and Amazon launched their services in Japan.
- It is now about 25 years since then.
- In other words, AI technology will spread from here, and a wide variety of services will be created in the future.
- It is necessary to learn how to use this service to draw beneficial results.
- Just like learning how to create a kintone application so you can improve your own business on your own.
- Basically, you have to use it more and more and see for yourself how you learn.
- To make it easier to do so, a ChatGPT-like service has been developed and operated within Cybozu.
- And it is important to create a mechanism for knowledge sharing for AI utilization.
- Just as the change from personal mailers to mail-wise was beneficial, it would be beneficial for ChatGPT-like services to move from being individually owned to being "groupware" shared by a team.
