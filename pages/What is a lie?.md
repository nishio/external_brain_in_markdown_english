title: "What is a lie?"
---

- [Stupid is good, but lying is not.

Suppose I say "it's Y" when the fact is X.
- Idiots if they assume that "the fact is Y."
- Lying if you know "the fact is X" and knowingly say something different

when the fact is X.
- Suppose someone who believes "the fact is Y" says "the fact is X."
    - This is an idiot lying, and as it turns out, it was true, but it's not forgivable.

Is the act of saying Y when you know the fact is X, when it would be better to say Y, a lie?
- I think it's a lie, but we'll see.
    - [Truth is the best policy in the long run.
- Better to say Y" is a personal interpretation, and there's no guarantee that it's correct.
- I have good intentions, but I'm trying to do [[Strategic Operations]].
- The problem is that there is a consensus that "lying is a bad thing" and "what is a lie" varies from person to person.
    - Someone is going to think "of course we should do it" on this one as well.
    - Such people, on the other hand, can't accept being told that this is a kind of lie.
    - Those people think they're doing something good.
        - That "good" is based on personal subjectivity.
        - It clashes with the idea that "it's better to share the facts as they are, even if it makes waves in the short term."

Is it a lie if someone who knows the fact is X doesn't point out when they see someone who thinks the fact is Y?
- This must be another lie.
- If you don't realize someone is mistaken, or if you saw it but tried to point it out later and forgot all about it, you're an idiot.
