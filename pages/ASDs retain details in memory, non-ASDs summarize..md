Exploring the different cognitive, emotional and imaginative experiences of autistic and non-autistic adult readers when contemplating serious literature as compared to non-fiction

Thirteen adults on the autism spectrum ([[ASD]]) and 13 adults with non-ASD were asked to "read short texts while listening to audio readings" (four literary texts and four nonfiction texts). The results showed that ASD readers tended to identify with the inner life of the characters while retaining "details and ambiguity," and tended to remember the characters "as persons" after reading the texts. Non-ASD readers tend to extract the main points and compress them into a "message. Recorded readings may slow down the reading rhythm to help immersion, but this is not the same as the benefits of live shared reading. [Re-examining the design of live reading is key to overcoming the double-empathy problem.

Research design (rough)
- Participants: 7 ASD, 6 non-ASD (adults).
- Stimulus: 8 short sentences (3 pages each).
    - Group A: Subjects related to autism and mutual incompatibility (double empathy) (e.g., Sherlock, Eleanor Oliphant, Uta Frith interview, Chris Packham article)
    - Group B: More general human disadvantages and emotions (e.g. Great Expectations, essays, etc.)
- Procedure: listen to the audio reading → reflective questionnaire for each text → follow-up interview (reread excerpts and reimmersion).
- Analysis: literal close reading + thematic analysis.

Major Findings
1. reading transition: Surface → Intuitive immersion
    - Fiction** gives "room for imagination by not telling the story, "** and immersion occurs because of sudden "moving emotions.
    - Non-fiction (commentary style) **"teach/tell "** comes to the fore, and imaginative empathy is difficult to generate.
- Imaginative Feeling
    - ASD Readers: express themselves with musical metaphors** (in tune / rang true, etc.) that are **"attunement" with the characters and text. Naturally moves back and forth between reevaluating one's own past experiences and observing oneself from a third person's point of view. Easy to maintain multiple perspectives of a person or scene at the same time.
    - Non-ASD readers: tend to flow into the application of normative/procedural empathy, "you should empathize with ~," and conclude before getting inside the person.
        - [[Normative empathy]]/[[Procedural empathy]]
3. retention and utilization after reading
    - ASD: The person itself (per complexity) can be kept in mind and used later to reinterpret specific social situations.
    - Non-ASD: data compressed and retained as core messages and lessons learned (easier to generalize, but reduces complexity).

            - [[AI Summary]] has a common structure with uninteresting problems.
        - When we had this discussion, we talked about how AI summaries are uninteresting because they throw out all the branches and leaves and just use abstract descriptions.
            - [[Story intersections become atoms.]] In [[Associative connection of branches and leaves]] we talked.
            - ASD is able to discover atoms because it retains the experience stories of others as stories

4. implications for theory
    - The authors reject the simplistic model that "autism is a lack of empathy," and suggest that ASD is a highly empathetic person with details and ambiguity, and that social "spaciousness" is not impaired.
    - On the other hand, **differences in cognitive style (detail retention vs. summary compression) can contribute to mutual misunderstanding (double empathy)**.
5. design of reading/pre-reading
    - Recorded reading: while it reduces speed reading and aids immersion, the surprise and interaction of live-ability is weak.
    - Live co-reading (existing research): Possibly effective in promoting mutual understanding between different neurotypes. Suggestion to consider less burdensome formats such as live online.

Practical Implications
- If you want to create a place that goes beyond double-empathy:
    - Start with fiction, especially contemporary literature that includes "difficulties and discrepancies" (classics can be easily superimposed due to anxiety about "reading" them correctly).
    - Live (or pseudo-live) readings + small-group dialogues are designed to explore the "unsaid parts" together.
    - Thoughts should be **"What did you perceive (the tremor in the person)?", then "Why did you feel that way (the words of the text)?", then "From a different perspective?" **If you deepen in the order of **, retention (as a person)** is more likely to occur than compression.

limit
- Sample small/highly educated bias, positive reading demographics. The demographic in need of reading support has not yet been examined.
- The effect of live co-reading was not directly tested with recorded readings only.
- Long-term transition to the real world has not yet been evaluated.

in a word
Literature trains us to live with the "complexity in the other person," with ASD having a strong "power to hold complexity" and non-ASD having a strong "power to summarize. The key to going beyond double empathy is to have a "near-live, collaborative reading space" where the strengths of both can meet."

relevance
    - [[ASD is not a lack of empathy.]]
