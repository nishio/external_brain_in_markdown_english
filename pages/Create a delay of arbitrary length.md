Using [[PULSER]]([[MC2500]]) in [[CraftBook]]'s [[Integrated Circuits]]
- [https://craftbook.enginehub.org/en/3.x/mechanics/ics/](https://craftbook.enginehub.org/en/3.x/mechanics/ics/)
- I configured pulselength=10, startdelay=20 (in Game Tick)
- The actual delay was 22. This includes the delay caused by the lever.
- The actual pulse length was 11.
