[[False dichotomy]] of [[intellectual desire]] and [[job readiness]]
> [1T0T](https://x.com/1T0T/status/1792112533664571609) "[[post-secondary education institution, incl. university, college, etc.]] is a place you go for academics and research. It's a place (it is)" and "In reality, you go there to get a job (it is)" are common arguments, but why is it a zero-factor? I'm wondering if it would be inconvenient to discuss the issue by assuming that the students are 50% there for intellectual gratification and 50% for job preparation.
