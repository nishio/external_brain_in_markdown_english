- I used to use a rotating head electric toothbrush in the shape of an A
    - But my dentist pointed out that I'm not doing a very good job of cleaning out my periodontal pockets.
    - I talked to my wife and she recommended TePe.
- TePe Supreme has tapered hairs that protrude about 3 mm
    - This cleans between the teeth and into the periodontal pockets.
