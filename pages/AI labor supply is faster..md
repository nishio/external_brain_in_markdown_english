title: "AI labor supply is faster."
---

[LLMs [[that can describe processes in natural language]] will accelerate [[prototype generation]] by [[people who cannot write programming languages]]. The demand for work to convert them into [[stable operating programs]] will increase. However, the conversion itself will also create a supply of [[AI labor]]. The direction of the [[supply-demand]] imbalance depends on which is faster. I think supply is faster.

Surprisingly Consensus Yes
- [⿻Natural language processing LLM accelerates prototype generation for those who cannot write programming languages. This leads to an increased demand for converting it into stable operational programs. However, the conversion process itself will also see an increase in AI labor supply. The direction of imbalance in supply and demand depends on which side accelerates faster. I believe the supply side will accelerate faster.(Yes/Yes/Yes)](https://magi-nishio.vercel.app/t/cOlHaQDgs8BJQ5L4wSh4)
