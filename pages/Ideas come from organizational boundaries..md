title: "Ideas come from organizational boundaries."
---

I haven't been able to determine if I'm original in this expression, or if I'm remembering seeing it in something else.
I think I read something about it, but I can't find it in my research.

- There is a book titled [Ideas come from intersections.

Chemical reactions also occur at the [[interface]] where different kinds of things are in contact

- [[idea]] arises from [Organizational Boundaries

PS
    - [[Innovation starts at the frontier.]]
    - [[frontier]], [[border]].
