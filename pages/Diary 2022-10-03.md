- I saw [[Oya Oni Jisshu (fifth of the six classical Japanese history texts)]] on Twitter and thought it was interesting, so I OCR'd it.
- Originally from Dentsu [[the ten cardinal Confucian virtues (justice, politeness, wisdom, fidelity and benevolence)]].
- I wouldn't try to make something like "Nishio's 10 rules" myself, why not? I thought.
- Once a decision is made, it is difficult to change it.
    - You'll be less likely to change it, and others won't be able to change it once it starts rolling out of your hands.
- Mostly it depends on the situation.
    - Using unconditional "do X" type words as a basis for action is [[acting without thinking]].
    - In that sense, is [[Think about it.]] the highest order?
        - No, but there are situations where it's optimal not to think about it.


Scrapbox can now be updated.
- I updated it and it's just barely less than 1000 pages.

Maybe I'll add a mode that automatically pages through in 5-10 seconds for TV.

I can now review on my iPhone.

- It works on my iPhone, but if I open 1500 images or something, my iPhone gets sluggish.
    - I still need to create an API to get 18 or so as well as the TV display.


The Okoso series is easy to understand: "a series of works born from a common seed."

    - [What is Mikogoso Toukin - Kotobank](https://kotobank.jp/word/御高祖頭巾-40157)
- You could say it's a sibling cat.
- Some of the past works actually came from a common seed.
    - In some cases, people don't even realize it.

        - One of them is deformed...
        - My wife put this variant on the GOOD list for some reason. w

Interesting series on the same theme with seed fixing feature.
- More Okoso series.
- The Okoso series isn't in Scrapbox yet, I wonder why?

- What, magic?
        - [[It looks like magic to me.]]
- Twitter seems to be on fire with this accuracy and the use of unauthorized sites in the training data.
    - People who are angry but can't complain to the provider in English are beating up on the appropriate Japanese.

    - I see.

        - ["AI will take our jobs" is a low job resolution.

Modern Luddites
- Flaming service providers on social networking sites
- Flaming users in their own country if they do not speak the language used by the service provider

In that case, the next step is to "shut up and use it."
Next, "If you place an order with the condition of not using AI, the unit price will go up, and the client will start saying, 'It's OK to use AI.'"
Skills will be required to make minor modifications when AI-generated products subtly do not meet customer needs.



> [@n_en_u](https://twitter.com/n_en_u/status/1576889839907409920?s=21&t=yBdTO3yMojjkBLbZLEDIEQ): @chanakikun You are working, but that doesn't necessarily equate to having a job. It's not necessarily equal.
- I'm not sure of the context, but I'm thinking that "whether or not you're working", "whether or not you have a job", "whether or not you have a job" might all be independent.
