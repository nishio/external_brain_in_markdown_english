title: "Reverse when choosing, forward when being chosen."

> [realNuun](https://x.com/realNuun/status/1821136665936871663) I've been thinking a lot about how [[being on the wrong side of (e.g. an attack)]] should be combined with [[forward]], I've been thinking a lot about how to combine [[being on the wrong side of (e.g. an attack)]] and [[being on the wrong side of (e.g. an attack)]], and I'm getting the feeling that there are a lot of good patterns where you should be on the wrong side when [[choosing]], and being on the right side when [[being chosen]].

In your own actions [[avoid competition]] Make choices while allowing others to compete when they choose you
- And after organizing with [[5 Forces Model]].
