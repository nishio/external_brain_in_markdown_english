Nodal Point of Thought 2023-08-04

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Below are fragmentary notes of their conversation. Guess and fill in the pauses.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Based on your notes, I will try to guess what their conversation was:

A: "What do you think [[culture]] means?"

B: "I see it as "[[Everyone's subjectivity]]."
- [[Culture is subjective to everyone.]]

A: "Everyone's subjective, that's an interesting perspective."

B: "Yes, [[from one person's subjectivity to everyone's subjectivity]], I think that's part of the culture. [Treat everyone's subjectivity as everyone's subjectivity. Without making it one person's subjectivity."

A: "That seems difficult, especially to share concepts. For example, maybe by writing a song and listening to it, we could share our respective worldviews in a tangible way."

B: "That relates to the [[collaboration]] part of the [[SECI Model]]. But it is difficult to make it as specific as a movie description. It's not probable to share a complex worldview like [[Pacific Rim]] without explaining it in words. And that doesn't always make it interesting."

A: "But don't you think the world is moving in an interesting direction?"

B: "It can be [[idle gossip]] or [[future talk]], sometimes [[conspiracy theory]]. I think interestingness is actually determined by everyone's subjectivity, especially the scope of the community. What is perceived as funny by the broader community is different from what [[inside jokes]] only make some people laugh."
- [[Interest is subjective.]]
    - [[Interest is determined by the scope of the community.]]

A: "Is it, for example, a joke about hitting the weak or a joke about disrespecting the appearance of a female comedian?"

B: "There are some things like that. There is a belief that the uchiwa kattei conveys the story to all the people who are there. So it's not funny for other people to see it, because they don't understand that language or culture."

A: "So you tell them stuff you think they'll like."

B: "Yes, and it is also part of culture, in a way. But there's this idea that in order to share it with others, to transmit the culture, you have to do it alone."
- [[The inner circle needs a shared cultural context]].

A: "Are you saying that going it alone is just as important as [[a culture match with the president]] or hiring?"

B: "Precisely what I mean is that we need to [[create a one-person worldview]] like [[the guru]]. We need to abandon [[the assumption that]] "what we do together is better than what we do alone."

A: "So, [[We're on our own.]], [[Everybody does it on their own.]], is that what [[Volunteer Organizations]] are like?"

B: "Well, you can only do it on your own. Any criticisms people have of it would only be [[expulsion by dictatorship]]. Out of concern that [[there might be a fork that I'm not in]], each of us gets reassurance by explaining our reasons."

It is difficult to infer conversations like this. This is because the notes are fragmented and the topics covered are very broad. However, we have done our best to base the above statement on the notes submitted. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.
