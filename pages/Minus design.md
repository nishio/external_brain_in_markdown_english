Positive designs are easier to predict and evaluate if the amount of the positive design itself is included in the evaluation of the work.
Negative design must increase customer value while reducing features.
This is exploratory, not a "sure to accomplish if you work hard" kind of task. #Certainly achievable task
If we fail to manage these processes well, we will fall back on positive design.
