title: "A game to get under the skin of probabilistic events"
---

- I thought it would be good to have a [[game]] to observe [[probability]] events in order to understand [[statistics]] studies firsthand.

After all, not being able to feel [[probability distribution]] with a physical sense from one's own experience may be the situation of those who find it difficult to learn statistics.

- Even if you draw a gacha with a probability of 1/100 a hundred times, you won't be surprised to find it won't hit you.
