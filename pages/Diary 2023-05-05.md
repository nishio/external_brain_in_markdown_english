Today was the last day of the two English conversation lessons I had for a week.
- What to do after tomorrow
- Frankly, it's subjectively tough.
- With several instructors we have confirmed that "we can have a discussion without text for 40 minutes."
- Then you don't have to pack it in so tight, do you?
- Pros
    - I'm in there at the same time every day, so I'm like, "Is it going to be there today? Or not?" I don't have to think about it.
- Cons
    - Obviously, the review is not in time.
- There are 17 frames left.

No, I still think the status quo is over-scheduled.
- Let's dispense with it for now and give ourselves time to reflect.
- If you are busy reviewing, you [[lack of vision]] on the most recent review subject

finished!

Tomorrow is a day of nothing!
