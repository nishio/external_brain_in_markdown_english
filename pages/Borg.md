title: "Borg"
---

> The Borg are a group of fictional mechanical life forms that appear in the Star Trek series.
>  A race of beings depicted in Star Trek as "near pure evil" with extraordinary scientific powers. The "zombie" is a combination of "zombie" and science fiction cybernetics, a favorite antagonist in American TV dramas and movies, and is basically portrayed as a powerful antagonist of the main character, a Federation starship captain. No straightforward strategy will work against the Borg ships, and the protagonist must develop a unique tactic in order to survive. In the film, the Borg are portrayed as terrifying entities that, like zombies, seek to forcibly assimilate and take in other intelligent humanoid life.

> The nature of the Borg is similar to that of bee or ant colonies: extreme [[totalitarianism]] with no respect for the individual. This is due to the "[[collective consciousness]]" in which all the trillions of Borg drones share consciousness at all times.

>  Upon assimilation, they make unilateral announcements such as "We are the Borg" ([[We are the Borg]]), "[[You will be assimilated]]" ([[You will be assimilated]]), and "[[Resistance is futile]]" ([[Resistance is futile]]).
