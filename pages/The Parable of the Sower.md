title: "The Parable of the Sower"
---

A parable of what happens to seeds that fall in various places.
- The seed that fell on good soil grew a hundredfold.
    - [[Seeds that fell on stony ground sprouted quickly but died because they had no roots]]
    - Nishio often uses the [[rootless grass]] metaphor

In [[Plowing/Seedling/Growing]], the reason why [[Plowing Phase]] is necessary is that seeds cannot grow if they fall on land that has not been plowed.
- Might it sprout?

- [[Gospel of Matthew 13]]
> 3 ... The sower went out to sow his seed.
>  4While sowing, some seeds fell by the roadside and birds came and ate them.
>  5 Other seeds fell on a stony area with little soil, where the soil was shallow and sprouted quickly.
>  6But when the sun rose, it burned and died because it had no roots.
>  7Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and blocked them.
>  8But other seeds fell on good land and bore fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.
