- When you see y increase right after x increases, many people interpret it as "as x increases, y increases".
- But in reality, that often doesn't happen.
- It's a system where "as x increases, y decreases, but there's a delay in that change."
- Humans have difficulty recognizing this [[delay]].

- context
    - A state of emergency was declared due to the spread of COVID19 infection.
        - > I strongly urge you to refrain from leaving your homes during the month of April 7 to May 6.
    - Number of suicides in April, down about 20% from the previous year

    - From this observation, we observed a case that was interpreted as "if you curb going out, suicide will decrease."
    - That interpretation is a leap, an interpretation that overlooks the delay.
        - [[stress reaction]] is a delayed process, so the stress reaction of curtailing the outing has not yet occurred.
