title: 'Reconstruction of the knowledge system and the relevance of the "noticing" behavior'
---

Human [[body of knowledge]] understanding and [[ability to reconstruct]] shows intelligence.
- When encountering a new concept, the ability to reconfigure the knowledge system itself, rather than locating it in one's own knowledge system, is important.
- In addition, the ability to objectify/relativize and reconstruct one's own knowledge system, rather than the material completeness of the knowledge system, indicates intelligence.
- The "[[Dig into the behavior, not the abstract concept.]]" fragment leads to a reconstruction of the knowledge system by delving into the "[[notice]]" behavior that combines new knowledge with experience.
- The fragment "[[I'm reading about metaphors.]]" indicates a reflection on the observation and reconstruction of knowledge systems.

The ability to reconstruct knowledge systems is closely related to the "noticing" behavior that combines new knowledge with experience. The observation and reconstruction of knowledge systems is also related to the ability to objectify/relativize one's own knowledge systems.

### Digest
The ability to understand and reconstruct human knowledge systems is a sign of intelligence. When encountering a new concept, the ability to reconstruct the knowledge system itself, rather than locating it in one's own knowledge system, is important. The ability to objectify/relativize and reconstruct one's own knowledge system is more important than the quantitative completeness of the knowledge system.

### Relationship with fragments
The fragment "Digging into the behavior, not the abstract concepts" leads to the reconstruction of the knowledge system by digging into the "noticing" behavior that combines new knowledge with experience. The fragment "reading about metaphors" also shows a reflection on observing and reconstructing knowledge systems, which is relevant to the given note.

### Thought
The ability to reconstruct knowledge systems is closely related to the "noticing" behavior that combines new knowledge with experience. The observation and reconstruction of knowledge systems is also related to the ability to objectify/relativize one's own knowledge systems.

### Title in Japanese
"Reconstructing the knowledge system and the relevance of the 'notice' behavior."

However, the real intelligence is shown by how well you digest a concept when you are confronted with a concept that you cannot find any analogy in your experience. Instead of locating "it" in one's own system of knowledge based on one's experience, one reconfigures one's system of knowledge to fit "it."

> [sugimoto_kei](https://twitter.com/sugimoto_kei/status/1698197787408777283) In other words, smartness does not depend on the quantitative completeness of a person's knowledge system, but rather on the person's ability to objectify/relativize and reconstruct his or her own knowledge system from time to time. In other words, smartness does not depend on the quantitative completeness of a person's body of knowledge, but rather on the ability to objectify/relativize and reconstruct his/her own body of knowledge from time to time.
