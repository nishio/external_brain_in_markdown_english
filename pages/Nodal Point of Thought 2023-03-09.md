- Nodes of Thought
        - [[Linkable Scrapbox with revisions]]
        - [[Scrapbox as an outliner is inadequate]]
        - [[Scrapbox is an IDE for thinking]]
        - [[AI sets the naming chain in motion.]]
        - [[Scrapbox text may be easier to read for LLMs.]]
        - [[Digital traces of human attention]]
    - I have a feeling something might come of it, but I don't know what yet.
        - Not "Scrapbox now" but "Scrapbox in the future."
        - We can find something relevant in separate projects.
        - Should the content be fixed?
        - The theory is that "pages" are the unit of reference in existing blogs, etc., but as far as Twitter and Scrapbox bullet point discussions are concerned, "lines" were the appropriate unit of reference.
- I can't do it tomorrow, but I hope to be able to [[Search across multiple projects]] in the near future.
    - It has the feel of something that you put in a question text, but it simply creates an embedded vector and calculates the inner product, so in fact, if you do "insert the contents of your newly written page", you should find a similar page
    - What do they return when it's not a question statement?
    - I'll include the tree of "nodes of thought" above.
:

```
Scrapbox is an IDE for thinking, and even separate projects can find a connection. Something is likely to emerge in a future Scrapbox, but it may be better if the content is fixed. There is also a theory that the "line" is the appropriate unit of measure in Twitter and Scrapbox bullet discussion.
 [Conversion from flow to stock]   [Scrapbox in the History of Information Dissemination]   [Put a spur-of-the-moment idea in Scrapbox]  [ScrapboxDrinkup]  [Collaboration between projects in Scrapbox]   [The advantages of Scrapbox]  [Scrapbox Drinkup 20180810]
```

    - Basically, it's like a summary.
    - Finally, "What do you think?" I put it with
    - For some reason, I responded in English, so I translated
        - > The text discusses various aspects of Scrapbox, including the metaphor of "paths" rather than "links," support for associative thinking, the potential for collaboration across projects, and the challenges of organizing ideas that do not fit neatly into categories. It also examines the potential for AI to assist with naming and linking, and discusses the value of recording one's thoughts and reviewing them over time. Since no specific questions are presented in the prompt, the response is a summary of the main points discussed in the text.
        - He said the questions are messy, so it's still a summary. But there's more content in the link, maybe by accident.
    - What Will the Scrapbox of the Future Look Like?"
        - > There has been some discussion about the future Scrapbox, including the possibility of AI doing naming chains, digital traces of human attention, and the ability to find relationships even in separate projects. Some also believe that while "pages" are the unit of reference in existing blogs, "lines" are the appropriate unit for Twitter and Scrapbox bullet point discussions.
- I think it would be very useful to use UserScript to take a selection as a query and answer it.
    - I wrote that in [[Link completion with vector search]]...
