- I guess heartbeats get slower and slower while we sleep.
    - Observe heartbeats with another app

Day 2

- Deep sleep is kind of scarce, but what to do about it is a mystery.

Day 3

- Today's results are almost the same as the day before yesterday, but it's a mystery to me why yesterday didn't work out, even though the overall hours of sleep are the same.
- I can't say for sure until we get a little more sample size.

Day 6

- Isn't it difficult to do 8 hours of sleep at a level that would be recognized as sleep by autosleep? I thought it would be difficult to get 8 hours of sleep that would be recognized as sleep by autosleep, but on the other hand, even 6 hours of sleep is enough for "deep sleep" itself, so maybe I shouldn't worry about the outer circle?

- Only on the second day you don't get enough deep sleep, and the rest of the time you get enough deep sleep, even if you don't get enough overall sleep.

A day of staying up too late

I slept a lot.

- I thought, "I don't need that much sleep." I had a week of rough sleeping, but in the end, staying up late was unsustainable, and unsustainable sleep patterns disturbed my autonomic nervous system in the form of "unstable patterns," and I felt that I might be happier if I just followed the instructions of the machine.
- And when I tried to get a lot more sleep on top of that, I didn't get more "deep sleep".
Worst sleep ever
