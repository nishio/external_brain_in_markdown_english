title: "Understanding and splendor"
---

Don't throw things away [[Wonderful.]] because you can't [[understand]] them.
However, we should not consider it wonderful just because we don't understand it.
What should we do?

- Of things not understood [[underestimation]].
- Of what we don't understand [[overestimation]].
- You can't properly evaluate something you don't understand without understanding it.
