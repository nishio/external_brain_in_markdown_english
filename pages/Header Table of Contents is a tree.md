- The [[headline]] and [[Table of Contents]] of the book are [[(Christmas) tree]].
- Relationships between elements in this tree are not [be similar
    - Related: [[Associations, not analogies]].

- Some types of [[source data]] do not have much useful information in the table of contents tree
        - [[thought]], [[fictitious]], [[Proverbs (book of the Bible)]], and other [[literary fragments]].
    - Is there some grouping of the two, in case you're wondering?
    - When a long sentence is given, it is chopped into a reasonable size
        - This also does not have a tree, just a back and forth relationship.

- [[Relational connections between fragments]]
