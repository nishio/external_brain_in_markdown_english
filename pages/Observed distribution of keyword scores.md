title: "Observed distribution of keyword scores"
---

- I don't want to be asked all the questions for one keyword, and I don't want to be asked one question for all the keywords.
- Both the keywords selected and the questions selected in the course of the chat should be moderately mixed
    - That depends on the distribution of keyword scores over the course of the chat.
- I've never observed the distribution of keywords, and I've been fiddling with them rather randomly, so I can't predict what the distribution would look like.
- Should we create a mechanism to observe
    - [[View to see what's in env in real time.]]

- Should it be in real time?
    - I'm torn between being in the chat and being an observer.
    - Replay later?
- A replay function would be beneficial in many ways in the future.
