title: "intellectual production"

> When you say "learn," don't you have the implicit image that knowledge is outside of you and you take it into yourself? However, knowledge that is outside of you, e.g., knowledge in textbooks, is "knowledge that someone has already created and circulated. Since knowledge can be replicated, at the time the knowledge is circulating, there will be a number of people who already have that knowledge. This means that even if you take in outside knowledge, that knowledge is unlikely to lead to [[differentiation]].
> On the other hand, knowledge that is generated as needed in the field of actual application is highly valuable knowledge that is not in circulation and fits the situation in the field. In other words, the source of value is not the possession of knowledge, but the ability to create new knowledge. This would seem obvious if we consider a concrete example. Memorizing what is written in a programming textbook is not a source of differentiation; the source of value is the ability to create new programs in response to situations. It is natural, isn't it? This concept of "the ability to create is the source of value" applies to areas other than programming as well.
- [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]]  p.243  [[(7.3) Create knowledge]]

Intellectual production is [[Generating Knowledge]].
- This "knowledge" is an abstract concept and needs to be made more concrete.
    - Knowledge in textbooks is "knowledge that is already in circulation.
            - [[Better to learn than not to learn.]] but such knowledge is [[duplicable]] and therefore unlikely to lead to [differentiation
        - Knowledge generated in the field of [[application]] is highly valuable.
        - So there is value in "creating knowledge for the situation".
        - [[Knowledge is outcome-focused information]] (Drucker)
        - Knowledge must be proven by deeds.

[Definition of intellectual production and the "mindset" that emerges from it | shigotano!](https://cyblog.jp/2888)
Neatly organized article on intellectual production
- I found it by searching for "intellectual production."

> Intellectual production is the process of submitting something new - information - in a form that can be understood by others, using the mind.
    - [[The Art of Intellectual Production]]  p.9
- element (e.g. in array, in programming, in programming)
    - use one's head
    - new
        - [[output]] do
    - Comparison with [intellectual consumption
        - [[Learning alone is not production but consumption]]
        - [[Input is not output.]]
- Value of what is produced
        - [[input-output balance]]
- The conditions for "submission in a form understandable to others" are strictly enforced.
    - [[(6.2.5.5) Public Words and Private Words]]
        - He explained that first, it is verbalized in a way that only he can understand, and then, by refining it, it becomes an expression that can be conveyed to others.


When I used to translate it with Google Translate, it was translated as [[intellectual production]], and I thought it didn't feel right.
- I translated it at DeepL and it became [[Production of knowledge]], I think it's closer.
- [[(7.3) Creating knowledge]]

I believe that intellectual production does not have to be defined linguistically. Same with Wittgenstein's [Game Definition
    - [[(5.2.4.6) Family resemblance]]

I think it would be good to involve Drucker's [[knowledge worker]] concept.
- > Knowledge workers produce knowledge, ideas, and information
    - They said roughly the same thing.

- What is [[knowledge]]?
- Drucker explains it all in great detail.
- There it is. Here it is.
        - [[There are different kinds of knowledge.]]
- It's a long story, so I'll summarize.
    - Humans have improved their abilities through the use of tools.
    - Capabilities are enhanced not only by physical tools but also by knowledge.
    - There is merit in generating such knowledge.
        - = Need for Intellectual Production
        - There is knowledge that would improve our ability to generate knowledge.
        - = Intellectual Production

Intellectual Production
I thought about what kind of title I would give to a compilation of what I had learned and thought about after reading various books, and came up with the title "[[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]]," but when I thought about it, I realized that I had never done any survey on intellectual production techniques. I realized that I had never done any research on intellectual production.
So I'll list the ones that caught my eye when I searched for "intellectual production techniques".

- [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2uZ0uwy)
- > Modern businesspersons are constantly required to output some kind of information, whether it is "new projects and ideas for work" or "information on a blog for personal branding". Business people are expected to be efficient in these tasks and to produce high quality output in as little time as possible.
- >  Evernote is a "database of knowledge" and a "second brain" that can streamline your intellectual production. It will also enable you to draw out new ideas and inspiration that did not occur to you before!
- Efficiency in generating output
- Although you have chosen Evernote as the service to use, it appears that you are essentially focused on "extracting ideas from large amounts of data".
