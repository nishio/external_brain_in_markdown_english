> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1804292603229409421) I woke up early because I was too excited. I woke up to pull requests for additional features, and they were merged in. AITuber team was worried about the viewers and told to go to bed early. Marathon for the next 2 weeks or so, health is important!
- [Update contribution.md to make easy to tweet by t-kurimura · Pull Request #28 · takahiroanno2024/election2024](https://github.com/takahiroanno2024/election2024/pull/28)

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1804295345247261065) It's too early, but I'm not going to stay home and worry about getting to the next scheduled venue, so I'll just move on. Here is today's schedule. Not directly related to Mr. Anno (related in that it's civic tech and digital democracy).

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1804303870816063983) I often get feedback when I give a talk that I enjoy it because I sound like I'm having fun, but he's not aiming for anything. He is just having fun from the bottom of his heart. Considering that the strength is that it is not a burden to the person in question but valuable to others, I think it would be good to do this "transmission of enjoyment" more and more.
- > [ya7ce](https://x.com/ya7ce/status/1804304709769146429) I also like that the icon of Mr. Nishio X looks like he's having fun!

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1803666653739421882) I see that Anno's manifesto has already been viewed about 7 million times and over 2000 people have posted quotes. It will be interesting to analyze these quote posts.
- [X-user Takahiro Yasuno, candidate for Governor of Tokyo: "Today, I would like to share with you the detailed manifesto of Takahiro Yasuno, an independent candidate for Governor of Tokyo, who has interviewed over 100 people and is thinking about the future of Tokyo. It is 93 pages long, but please take a look! #TOKYOAI https://t.co/unAbJuLrRw https://t.co/6aydROqavj" / X](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1803666653739421882)


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1804308085097533843) Watching a live show yesterday night that I was too busy to see because of train travel.
Let's talk with Takahiro Yasuno himself! Daily Live Question Session (June 21, 2024) - YouTube []](https://www.youtube.com/live/6jXnc2Kr_98)
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1804313469594075241) Very interesting, note: The speed at which society improves used to be tempered by the rate of technological development, but now the speed of technological development has accelerated to the point where the human decision-making speed has turned into a bottleneck. To improve this situation, we should put people who understand technology in decision-making positions.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1804314711795847632) I also feel like the GitHub talk is too sideways because I'm improvising and talking about good things but I'm not getting through to the people I should be communicating to, if I had more room here, I could be more concise. I'd like to make a concise and coherent commentary here if I could afford it.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1804319176515031544) Interesting idea for "[[tocho-kun]]" that learns Tokyo's administrative information. I think most of the system can be diverted. The system to improve the data is also a social experiment in the GitHub manifesto right now, and I have a feeling it will work rather well.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1804322074779095328) Today we will be doing a reading of a book written by Audrey Tang and Glen Weyl on GitHub with collaborators from around the world! #DigitalDemocracy #Plurality

> [karaage0703](https://x.com/karaage0703/status/1804298204214890538) I'm not a Tokyoite, so I'm not particularly interested in the manifesto itself, but it's interesting that you use GPT-4o in GitHub Actions to check issues and PRs for violent language. I'm not a Tokyoite, but it's interesting that they are using GPT-4o in GitHub Actions to check issues and PRs for violent expressions. I think I'm most interested in this part.

> [MLBear2](https://x.com/MLBear2/status/1804349948428980263) I noticed that Karaage wrote about this, but the CI for Tokyo gubernatorial candidate Takahiro Yasuno's manifesto GitHub repository is excellent.

[[Intelligentia penetrating through generations]].
- Some people say that elderly people do not understand Mr. Anno's activities, but the story actually has supporters in their 70s and 80s.
- You are delusional about the "age-based conflict structure" on your own.
    - Not so when observing real world data.



> [kenn](https://x.com/kenn/status/1804142955235807712) Yasuno, of course I support you as an individual, but I felt that you should be attentive to the argument that politics fosters division when it is pushed through by technocracy. Since, as Sandel says, the current dire situation in the U.S. was born out of [[populism]] as a reaction to the "arrogance of the meritocracy".
> [kenn](https://x.com/kenn/status/1804144604805042457) If you're wondering what "rampant meritocracy" means, watch this video anyway.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1804448491395338402) Would it be legal to sign a petition during an election cycle saying that a particular candidate is in violation of the Public Offices Election Law and his/her civil rights should be suspended?
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1804448723671691411) If the logic is that an unsuccessful campaign is not a campaign, then it would seem that this is not a campaign either!
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1804449185732636738) Please note that this is just a thought that a layman to the law mumbled when he saw a legal expert talking about suspension of civil rights!

I tried to explain to a non-engineer who wants to do Talk to the City, but I stumbled on the development environment and concluded that it is a "technical entry barrier to digital democracy". I think it is something that needs to be resolved. For example, web services, Google Colab...

> [masanork](https://x.com/masanork/status/1804338179891228831) I saw the very thick pledges, and while I thought they were well researched, I couldn't form a concrete picture of industrial competitiveness, and by the way, what we are looking for from our politicians.... I stopped and asked myself, "Is that what we are looking for from our politicians? I stopped and wondered what we were looking for in a politician. If I had been involved in politics or civic movements, I might have a better idea of who they are.
> [masanork](https://x.com/masanork/status/1804339355441598488) In the end, what we expect from politicians is not only whether their promises are beautiful or not, but also how they confront the reality that we can't control, how they live their lives in terms of public policies that tend to get lost in the maze of incomparable values, and not whether they are smart or not. In the end, what we expect from our politicians is not whether they are smart or not, or whether we agree with them or not, but whether they are willing to face up to the reality that we have no control over, and how they will approach public policies that tend to get lost in the maze of incomparable values.

>  Are only TMG residents allowed to express their opinions on Yasuno's repository via issue? I read contribute.md, but it doesn't say anything specific, so maybe non-townspeople are allowed? (I don't really want to submit an issue.)

Interesting question.
Personally, I don't think it needs to be limited to Tokyo residents.
- But, then, can someone from another country, who has nothing to do with Tokyo, make an issue?
    - ... No? Isn't it good?

I have a feeling that some people will be repulsed.
- Don't let someone who has nothing to do with it talk to you.
- Don't let strangers talk to you.



> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1804515480943940001) What makes you think that wearing a suit short hair will maximize results? What reason do you have to think that making the suit short hair will not be counterproductive by making it lose its character? The hypothesis that the reason for not wearing a suit short hair is because you are not serious, and the fact that it contradicts the observation that you are giving 7 town hall speeches a day, which is more expensive.
>  >overlast: I understand that when someone who can be quite smart and rational to get results doesn't wear a suit and short hair, they're not doing their best in terms of maximizing results, and they don't want to be accepted.

> [hkawai3](https://x.com/hkawai3/status/1804518725263233062) This was my experience in OSASK development. At the time, I took it to heart and worked hard to implement those zeros. However, they did not use it. When I asked them why they did not use it, they gave me another reason.
> [hkawai3](https://x.com/hkawai3/status/1804518729629503892) So I finally figured it out. These people are just making excuses not to use it, when in fact they won't use it no matter what. ... You don't have to make such strange excuses. They just don't have to use it.
>
>  From then on, I ignore all "use it if you do 00" type requests, and only listen to the opinions of those who have already started using it.
> [hkawai3](https://x.com/hkawai3/status/1804518732745887752) did. That worked very well, so I feel this was the right thing to do.
>
>  I was reminded of OSASK when I saw an opinion about the gubernatorial election that candidate A is no good because he/she doesn't do B. > I don't know if this is a similar situation or not. ... I don't know if this is a similar situation.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1804535751918686236) I felt something close - when you have a team of 50 people working hard day and night to get something done, and you say something like, "It's no good because you didn't do X (which is a better way I thought of)." I felt like someone who tells someone who is building something on an Arduino that it's not a PIC so it's not good enough - it's appropriate when you're not giving an effort to build it.

> [shakuji](https://x.com/shakuji/status/1804646023345971466) It looks to me like you are doing a simple [[Lanchester strategy]].
>  Yes, I feel that it is.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1804651942083260926) What do you mean by Lanchester strategy?
> [shakuji](https://x.com/shakuji/status/1804660606840246444) I feel that when you take on a new challenge in a situation where there are already strong players with market share and resources, you start by sharply focusing your appeal and actions on your own areas of greatest strength and appeal value, rather than responding to every single area where others are (also) good at. I feel that you are starting by sharply focusing your appeal and actions from your greatest area of strength and appeal value, rather than responding to the areas where others are (also) strong,
>  I thought it was exactly the same as the Lanchester strategy for startups.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1804660752017727714) I see, that makes sense!

> [kmizu](https://x.com/kmizu/status/1804578924116230283) About Mr. Yasuno. I'm sure there are different opinions about his promises and other things, but I don't think "[[critic's gesture]]" of "I want to support him, but he won't get elected unless he does more here" is the attitude you should take if you are really supporting him.
>
>  I think that if you want Mr. Kosaka to be elected, you can just support and vote for him, and if you support him and have concerns about his promises and policies, you can write > him. But I feel that "It's not bad, but it's too bad he wears a suit and doesn't have short hair" is not "the attitude of a person who is supporting him".
>
>  That would be the same as saying "I can't support you because you don't wear a suit and have short hair" in the end, so I feel it would be more "honest" and likable to write "I don't support you because you don't seem to follow general working person protocol".
