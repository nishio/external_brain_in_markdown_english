1 Pomodoro to improve the motivation system.
- 256 to 78 and 321 to 94 for whether visitors initiate the system in the two different version patterns, and no significant difference in the chi-square test.
- Would you like to be motivated?" and to eliminate those who have been in an unmotivated state for more than 4 days, but no one goes down that path. However, no one went to that path, and yet there were those who went to the last free-answer question and answered, "I'm completely blind. Are you in a state of not being able to recognize that you are in a long-term unmotivated state...
- Browser distribution of those who initiated the system

- (About Google Analytics) It's nice to be able to test new ideas on the GUI, but if you want to keep track of "how do I reproduce that result", you'll have to write a lot of documentation in natural language or write scripts. I guess you have to choose between writing a script or writing a document in natural language to keep track of "how to reproduce the result".
    - So let's look into the Google Analytics API a bit.
