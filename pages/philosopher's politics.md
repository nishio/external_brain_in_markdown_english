title: "philosopher's politics"
---

>  A type of [[dictatorship]] regime, as contemplated by [[Plato]], in which the philosopher-king is the ruler.
>  When a democratic government loses its self-cleansing power, it becomes a [[popular]] government. Therefore, the people long for strong reforms by giving strong power to the rulers through [[dictatorship]], and by making decisions quickly. However, a strong leader is not always a good ruler, and it is possible that the [[dictatorship]] will use the position of ruler to satisfy its own desires. Therefore, Plato wanted to give power to those who had studied philosophy, so that they could rule unselfishly.
>  Plato became suspicious of democratic government after his teacher Socrates was executed by an unjust trial under [[democratic government]]. As a result of his various speculations, he arrived at the idea of philosophical politics.
