- I remember this.
    - [Why "just try it" and "think for yourself first" don't resonate with today's youth. | Books&Apps](https://blog.tinect.jp/?p=77189)
    - > It's "petty" not to share strategies.
- I wonder if they are annoyed because I want them to tell me what they want to know without being pretentious, but they are pretentious (and even more annoying when they include a sermon or something like that).
- I see it all the time on Q&A sites.
    - I'm asking about the answer to question Q, and you ask me something irrelevant like, "Why are you doing Q in the first place?" or asking irrelevant questions like "Why are you doing Q in the first place?

- Ehh, you don't think that's "relevant"?
- If there is a certain question Q and you can't find the answer to it by Googling it, then the person asking the question is either doing something cutting edge that no one else in the world is doing yet, or [[You're asking the wrong question.]] to begin with.
    - Of course, the probability of the latter is much higher.
- The shortcut to the solution is to "fix the wrong question Q into the right question."
    - So I ask, "Why did Q come up?"


- [[Wrong question.]]
- [[the question is wrong]]
- [[The Bad Question]]
