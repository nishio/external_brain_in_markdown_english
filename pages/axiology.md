axiology
    - [[categorical imperative]]
    - Should be done regardless of conditions.
    - 'A murderer was chasing his friend and hid his friend. What if the murderer said, 'Did you hide him?' ?"
    - Kant: "I shouldn't lie, so I should answer, 'I hid it.'"
        - 'We do not cause harm to victims by telling the truth, but by chance.'
            - [[principle of dual results]]
    - Obligations do not conflict in the first place.
        - If your duty is "don't lie," then you don't lie.
        - If your duty is to "save lives," then lie and save lives.
        - If you think it's wrong to rationalize the loss of life without lying in this situation, then you have an obligation to "save lives without lying."
    - [[Personality as an objective]]
