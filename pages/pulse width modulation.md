### Summary of notes
.
Pulse width modulation is a method of representing real values using averages in the time direction of signal lines that can represent only 0s and 1s.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The note and fragment 1004: [[pulse width modulation]] discuss pulse width modulation and are consistent in content. Also, fragment 1016: [[{0, 1} for real numbers between 0 and 1]] is related to the idea of pulse width modulation. Pulse width modulation uses 0 and 1 signals to represent real numbers, and this fragment illustrates the idea of converting real numbers to 0 and 1.

### deep thinking
Pulse width modulation is a method of expressing information using the constraints of digital signals, and the concept can be applied in many fields, including information processing and data compression. The Fragment 1016 concept also provides an opportunity to reconsider the way information is represented and offers a new perspective.

### summary of thoughts and title
.
Pulse width modulation and the idea of converting real numbers from 0 to 1 into {0, 1} provide a new perspective on information representation.
