title: "Plurality and Cybozu"
---

2023-12-12 I created this document to talk about what Plurality is within Cybozu, but I felt it would be useful for people outside the company, so I published it.

[[Plurality]] and [[Cybozu]].
- What is Plurality?
    - A concept proposed by [[Audrey Tang]] and [[Glen Weyl]].
    - [[Plurality: Technology for Collaborative Diversity and Democracy]]
            - [[collaboration]]
            - [[diversity]]
        - [[Technology to help diverse people work together to get things done]].
    - Cybozu's objective: [[Creating a society full of teamwork]]
            - [[teamwork]]
            - [[100 men, 100 ways]]
    - This is an ideal in the same direction
            - [[empathy]] can be done ([[Sympathy for ideals]])

I can't introduce all of them, so I'll just pick and choose interesting topics.
    - [[broad listening]]
    - The development of technology to duplicate and distribute information has made it easier for one person to communicate ideas to a large number of people.
    - However, when a large number of people transmit information, the volume of information received by one person becomes enormous, and the person drowns in the flood of information.
    - In a society and company where people actively communicate, technology that supports listening to the opinions of many will be important.

        - Figure from "[Not subjective or objective, but from the subjectivity of one to the subjectivity of many.
    - > (Technological advances) enable "broad listening," where millions of people can hear the essence extracted from the distribution of opinions of their peers, enhancing democratic deliberation on a large scale.

- [[Groupware as a medium]].
    - In the past, the media were occupied by certain companies, such as newspapers and television stations, which controlled what was disseminated.
    - With the birth of social media, we now live in a world where anyone can transmit anything.
    - This is beneficial but also distorted by the fact that it is maintained by advertising revenue. It is designed to take more time away from the user because increasing "engagement" is profitable.
    - > [[Productivity software]] sales...are a highly profitable business model. This type of software often includes a [[social media]] component and is sold to companies to improve productivity. ...The purpose of this software is to help employees [[work together to achieve common goals]] and [[adapt to change]].
    - > New [[pro-social media]] will be nurtured naturally in this environment and then marketed in a broader social context to other organizations interested in solidarity and dynamism.
    - What Audrey Tang calls [[productivity software]] is what Cybozu has called [groupware

    - [[digital democracy]]
    - In "democracy," "indirect democracy" has been widely practiced, in which people elect "delegates" to debate on their behalf.
    - This was just an operation at a time when information processing technology was in its infancy. Better technology leads to better teamwork.
    - In the future, a wide variety of local governments will make a wide variety of attempts to "better communicate with their citizens.
    - > The key to moving democracy forward is for teens and young people to come up with really good ideas and for them to be [[understood and]] implemented by the senior people [[in a shorter time]]. Younger people, being digital natives, do not believe that upload bandwidth once every four years is enough, and latency is too high. They prefer to collaborate on a daily basis.
    - > Opening up the [[agenda-setting authority]] to the people would return the people's approval or disapproval of each agenda to the people. Public officials no longer have exclusive ownership of agendas.


- Plurality and Cybozu
    - Cybozu originally sold groupware (= productivity software) to private companies
        - →Targets are expanding to local governments and NPOs
    - Audrey Tan originally had an idea of how to better govern the government.
        - →As a result, we believe that we need technology that supports collaboration among many people and information systems that support this collaboration.
    - Plurality's goals and Cybozu's goals are in the same direction
        - →Beneficial to learn from each other's perspectives

Plurality and Cybozu
2023-12-12 I created this document to discuss what Plurality is within Cybozu, but I thought it would be beneficial to share it with people outside the company as well.

[[Plurality]] and [[Cybozu]]
- What is Plurality?
    - A concept advocated by Audrey Tang and Glen Weyl.
    - Plurality: Technology for Collaborative Diversity and Democracy.
        - [[Collaboration]]
        - [[Diversity]]
        - [[Technology for diverse individuals to work together to accomplish things]]
    - Cybozu's goal: [[Building a society brimming with teamwork]].
        - [[Teamwork]]
        - [[100 people, 100 ways]]
    - These are ideals with the same direction.
    - [[Empathy]] ([[Empathy towards ideals]])

Since I can't introduce everything, let's take a bite of interesting topics.
- [[Broad Listening]]
    - With the advancement of technology that replicates and delivers information, it has become easier for one person to convey their thoughts to a large number of people.
    - However, when a large number of people communicate information, the amount of information received by one person becomes overwhelming, leading to information overload.
    - In a society or company where people actively communicate, it is important to have technology that supports listening to a large number of opinions.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/8aed1a6ee239c672d1e504cdb48d0e9e/thumb/1000)
        - The figure is from an article I contributed to the Information Processing Society of Japan's ChatGPT special issue, titled "[[Not Subjective or Objective, but from One Subjectivity to Many Subjectivities]]."
    - > (Technological progress) enables "broad listening," where millions of people can hear the essence extracted from the distribution of their peers' opinions, thereby enhancing large-scale and democratic deliberation.

- [[Groupware as Media]]
    - In the past, media was controlled by specific companies such as newspapers and television stations, determining what to communicate.
    - With the advent of social media, a world where anyone can communicate anything has arrived.
    - This is beneficial, but there is also distortion caused by being sustained by advertising revenue. It is designed to capture more of users' time as it leads to increased engagement.
    - > Selling [[productivity improvement software]]...is a high-profit business model. This type of software often includes elements of [[social media]] and is sold to companies to improve productivity...The purpose of this software is for employees to [[work together to achieve common goals]] and [[adapt to change]].
    - > New [[pro-social media]] will naturally grow in such an environment and then be sold to other organizations interested in solidarity and dynamism in a broader social context.
    - What Audrey Tang calls [[productivity improvement software]] is what Cybozu has been calling [[groupware]].

- [[Digital Democracy]]
    - In "democracy," representatives are elected through elections to discuss on behalf of the people, known as "representative democracy."
    - This was only a practice for an era when information processing technology was immature. Better technology brings better teamwork.
    - In the future, various local governments will make various attempts to "communicate better with citizens."
    - > It is the key to advancing democracy for teenagers and young people to come up with really good ideas and shorten the time it takes for them to be [[understood and implemented]] by senior people. Young people, being digital natives, do not think that once every four years is enough for uploading bandwidth, and the latency is too high. They prefer to collaborate on a daily basis.
    - > If we open up the authority for [[agenda setting]] to the people, we can return people's support or opposition to each agenda. Public servants can no longer exclusively own the agenda.

Plurality and Cybozu
- Cybozu originally sold groupware (= productivity improvement software) for private companies.
    - → The target is expanding to local governments and NPOs.
- Audrey Tang originally thought about better governance by the government.
    - → As a result, she believes that technology to support collaboration among a large number of people and the information system that supports it are necessary.
- The goals pursued by Plurality and Cybozu are in the same direction.
    - → It is beneficial to learn from each other's perspectives.
