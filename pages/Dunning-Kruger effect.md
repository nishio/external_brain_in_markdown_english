title: "Dunning-Kruger effect"
---

Net meme that there is a cognitive bias where people with less knowledge [[overestimate]] themselves and people with more knowledge [[underestimate]] themselves.
- The actual data does not have such a clear curve.
- I think the reason this concept was so widespread was because it was so [[convincing]] to so many people.
    - The principle would be, "People who have few opportunities to verify that they understand [[have low levels of understanding but high levels of confidence]]."
    - Another expression: [[It looks easier when you can't see the pyramid's foundation.]]

- Person A tweets what appears to be a simple question, person B says, "You can't be serious about this," does some research, and says, "I see what you mean! Then person C comes in a while later and says something wrong with full of confidence.

- When learning is done in a way that tests what is learned, the phenomenon [[Not confident, but high grades.]] occurs compared to when it is not
    - In other words, those who do not test what they have learned have a steeper slope of this curve than those who do

- > Abstract
- >  People tend to hold overly favorable views of their abilities in many social and intellectual domains. The authors suggest that this overestimation occurs, in part, because people who are unskilled in these domains suffer a dual burden: Not only do these people reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices, but their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to realize it. Across 4 studies, the authors found that participants scoring in the bottom quartile on tests of humor, grammar, and logic grossly overestimated their test performance and ability. Although their test scores put them in the 12th percentile, they estimated themselves to be in the 62nd. Several analyses linked this miscalibration to deficits in metacognitive skill, or the capacity to distinguish accuracy from error. Paradoxically, improving the skills of participants, and thus increasing their metacognitive competence, helped them recognize the limitations of their abilities.

- Of the several areas of testing, this is the one that is most noticeably dented.
