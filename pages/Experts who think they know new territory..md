- 1: Mr. P is an expert in a certain domain X and takes pride in his knowledge of this domain X.
- 2: When the adjacent region Y of X is discussed
- 3: Mr. P thinks that Y is also part of X and has excessive confidence that he knows a lot about Y

There's a phenomenon like this.

Philosophers who discuss AI and understanding think they know a lot about understanding because understanding is the domain of philosophy, but they misunderstand how LLMs work, or they misinterpret features that previous versions of LLMs just happened to have as universal features for future LLMs.
- From the standpoint of a person who uses the current version on a daily basis, I'd say, "No way," and "I can disprove that in a heartbeat, see."
- Paradoxically, the fact that you're making this claim means you're not using it well.
