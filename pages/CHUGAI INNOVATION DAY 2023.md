RED SHIFT
- > Chugai positions [[RED SHIFT]]) as one of the key drivers of its growth strategy "TOP I 2030".
- > RED SHIFT: RED is a collective term for Research and Early Development. By focusing management resources on RED functions, including research, early clinical development, and the portion of pharmaceutical functions related to early development, and by expanding investment, the company aims to enhance its translational research capabilities from drug discovery to PoC acquisition, which is the source of value creation, and improve R&D output.

# Frontiers in Medicine and Healthcare Using Generated AI Technology
.
> Chat GPT and other generative AI technologies are expected to be used in the medical and healthcare fields. This session will introduce efforts to utilize generative AI technology in the diagnosis and optimization of disease diagnosis and treatment, and in streamlining the drug discovery process, and will provide insights and ideas for further innovation as well as issues that need to be resolved in terms of technology, regulations, and ethics.
## Mechanism of Generation AI and its Application to Medical and Health Care
 [Daisuke Okanohara
## Novel Medical Language Processing with Generative AI: From Drug Discovery to Clinical Practice
 [Eiji Aramaki

self-supervised learning
- 'A supervised study question where you can get as many correct answers as you want for free.'
- Nice way of explaining it. I'll copy that.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - This "cost of getting it right" isn't really understood.

[[Protein language model]]
How do we ensure correctness when it is beyond human understanding?

peripheral neuropathy
- Difficult to take with data
- The cost of having a doctor ask the question "Do you have peripheral neuropathy?" every time and data is expensive.
- From natural language

Arakawa: "The information value of small communities increases."
- Because the data on the Web has been dug up.
- Increased importance of personal experience
- →Episode Bank

[[Social Chemistry 101: Learning to Reason about Social and Moral Norms]]

Will AI take the job of communicating with patients?
- Better to think of it as a tool.
- The tools will have to change the way we work.
- The to N communication as it has always been will be streamlined by the generative AI and move to more personalized communication.

Similar to the culture of donations abroad.
- Japan has few people who share their experiences, similar to how few people donate money.

Reduction of document work
AI pre-processes routine questions.

# New Era of "Healthcare x Digital" Pioneered by Web 3.0 and Digital Twin
.
> Digital Twin is a technology that uses IoT to acquire information from the real world and reproduce the environment of real space within cyberspace, making it possible to understand and analyze the situation in real space and make predictions through simulations. On the other hand, Web 3.0, the next generation Internet technology, is also expected to serve as a foundation for independent and decentralized organizations that accelerate open innovation. How can these technologies be used to revolutionize the drug discovery process and realize personalized medicine? We will introduce cutting-edge research and initiatives and discuss the ideal vision of the future.

## Research and development for social implementation of an innovative automated cardiac disease treatment system using a digital twin of the cardiovascular system
 [[Kazunori Kamimura]].
## Construction of a Digital Twin for Disease Prevention by Integrating Multilayered Biological Information
 [Yoshinori Murakami

National Cardiovascular Center
cardiovascular disease
- Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of need for care
- It's also a large percentage of health care costs, larger than cancer.
- Prognosis for heart failure is the same as for cancer.
- But only one specialist is available for every 100 patients.
- Need to improve efficiency through IT technology → Digital Twin

The dog's digital twin allowed me to estimate the results of the infusion treatment.
- A "self-driving car" approach to heart failure treatment

There is a 12-year gap between average life expectancy and healthy life expectancy
- Cancer can reduce medical costs by 30% through prevention.
- Education budget 5.5 trillion yen

Disease prevention based on genomic cohort
- Collected with permission from company health inspections
    - Consent rate for participation, over 90%.
- Only Japan mandates interest in healthy business people.
    - Good quality data can be obtained.
Polygenic Risk Score
- High-risk groups are identified
    - Five times the risk for the unlucky 1% of people with the right genes.

## Distributed Innovation Commons Guided by [[Self-Sovereign Identity]] [Taiyo Hamada
 Mr.

Competition for funding
- Incentive redesign
- [[DeSci]]

Self-sovereign identity
- Decision to provide attributes of your own volition
- [[GDPR]]

Curation is also a social contribution, an asset, a commons
- There is no incentive design to give rewards to the people who make these.

Challenges to DAOs not being created
- Lack of recognition
- A bad case of bad publicity
- Human Resource Issues

Featuring aspects of tokens and cryptocurrencies gives a bad impression.
- It is important to look at the "decentralized" approach from a broader perspective

[[VitaDAO]]
- There are spin-out ventures.
- But not financially independent.
    - Pfizer, for example.
    - Dependent on the support of the wealthy

It is important to involve various stakeholders

What if pharmaceutical companies utilize DAO?
- Go in centrally at first and then expand to a diverse community.
    - [[Expanding the base]]

Chugai Pharmaceutical
- We are building [[an in-house DAO]] for learning.
- I'm considering it.
    - Patient DAO
    - Researcher's DAO

Can you drive without an administrator?
- Some kind of curation or community manager is needed.
- If you start small, you need someone to direct.
- It would be nice to see DAOs in a [[cooperative]] way.
- Based on what you want to do, you could consider whether you want to do it centrally or more decentrally.
    - Not all use cases can be completely decentralized just by incentive design like Bitcoin.
    - Yes, yes,[[組織形態はツール]]であってそれ自体が目的なのではないということね<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - The choice of organizational forms other than corporations and university corporations is becoming more available, and new tools are being added.
        - Expanding the base is beneficial in the context of [[blurring of organizational boundaries]] and [[crossing an organization]].

rare disease
- Patients themselves are fragmented and isolated
    - There are incentives for those [[maintaining and operating places where people can connect]].

As for financial feedback.
- Featuring virtual currency aspects is problematic due to the high volatility of prices
- A membership-like NFT would be more suitable for this purpose.
    - Example of [Yamakoshi DAO
