- Some abstract solution A can solve some concrete problem X.
- This is self-evident if you know A
- But sometimes a surprising problem Y can be solved with A
- There exists a certain problem transformation B that maps some problems to others.
        - [[maximum flow minimum cut theorem]] and
    - This maps Y, which at first glance is not included in A, to Y', which is included in A.

What else could be in the problem conversion?
- Solving a problem represented by a vector by transforming it into a complex number [[vector complex transformation]].
    - [[Exchange of value range and definition range]]
    - Consider a set of numbers as a sequence of 0/1's and use [Fennic tree
    - [[coordinate compression]] to set the value in the computable range
- DP a huge integer as a sequence of digits [[Digit DP]].
- Attribute [[Project Selection Problem]] to [least-cost current
- Consider a number series problem as a [formal power series
    - [[dual linear programming problem]]
