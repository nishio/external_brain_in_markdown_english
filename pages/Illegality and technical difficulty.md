title: "Illegality and technical difficulty"
---

Context: [[My number generation]].

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1860850359562052044) I wonder what the principle is that when the law prohibits something that is technically easy to do, people are tempted to actually do it and show that it is "easy" to do. The technical difficulty has nothing to do with whether it's legal or not, and it's technically easy to hit someone with a stick.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1860850784285692397) Do you think of violating the law as something implicitly "far from you" and get excited about the "surprise" of being "surprisingly close"?

> [nagise](https://x.com/nagise/status/1860851183461789959) If everyone is obedient to a prohibition, it is impossible to correct a wrong prohibition, so a mechanism that allows a certain number of individuals to rebel is effective, and humans have left such functionality in the process of evolution. It occurred to me that humans have left such a functionality in the evolutionary process (no evidence).

> [tomoyaman](https://x.com/tomoyaman/status/1860859345904545841) "There seem to be a lot of people in the world who mistakenly believe it can't be done easily" and subjectively observe, "It can be done easily! All the people who misunderstand that it can't be done are idiots (but I'm the only one who is superior)! I think they want to show themselves as "I'm the only one who can do it!

> [gogotea3](https://x.com/gogotea3/status/1860908612543213767) I remember a high school teacher saying something about the pleasure of breaking rules.

> [k_matsuzaki](https://x.com/k_matsuzaki/status/1860902219639562596) When countermeasures are standard or easy to implement and the cost of attack is estimated to be high, harmless attacks may be done occasionally as a persuasive tool to convince people that, you know, we don't want these bad people around. I might do it occasionally.

> [omochimetaru](https://x.com/omochimetaru/status/1860855268126740495) I think you're trying to argue that the law is so ridiculous that illegal situations can easily be established in situations that clearly have no real harm or relevance.

> [kazuho](https://x.com/kazuho/status/1860936478307815686) Unlike crimes that cause direct harm, such as assault, a crime like [[creating a virus]] does not cause immediate harm by its execution (that's why we say that the general public's trust is a [[protected legal interest]]). (That's why they say things like "the public trust is a protected legal interest").
> The latter should be compared to crossing a red light when there are no cars coming (crossing doesn't directly inconvenience anyone, but trust in the traffic light system is a ry).
This statement considers two types of conduct that the law prohibits:
- Crimes involving direct harm
    - This is a type of crime in which the act itself causes immediate harm to another person, such as assault. In this case, the reason for the prohibition is clear: the main purpose is to protect the victim.
- Crimes to Protect Trust
    - Like the crime of creating a virus, the act itself does not immediately cause concrete harm, but it has the potential to undermine the trust of society as a whole. Here, the abstract value of society's "trust" is the object of protection (protected legal interest), not the direct harm.
Red light analogy
- To illustrate this argument, the act of crossing a red light when no cars are coming is cited:
    - Crossing a red light does not directly inconvenience others at that moment.
    - However, if social confidence in obeying traffic signals is lost, there is a risk that traffic order will break down as a result.

> [hmikisato](https://x.com/hmikisato/status/1860906010023702604) I admit that this is generally not a praiseworthy act, but I would like to talk about individual cases where it is too easy and "everyone is stepping on the ban". I admit that this is not a complimentary practice in general, but in individual cases, I sometimes do it in order to visualize the "oops" when it's too easy and "everyone is stepping on the ban".

> [hkzm](https://x.com/hkzm/status/1860934935541936471) [[DeCSS]] because it worked a little better?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>This statement uses the past DeCSS case as an example to discuss when an act that is technically simple can have legal and social consequences.
- What is DeCSS?
    - DeCSS is a program to remove DVD encryption (CSS: Content Scramble System).
        - Around 1999, this program was released to the public and became a means of breaking DVD copying restrictions.
        - It has been the subject of lawsuits and regulations in terms of copyright protection and controversy concerning technology, law, and freedom of expression.
- What do you mean by "it worked a little?"
    - The impact of the DeCSS release may include the following
        - Stimulate discussion of laws and regulations
            - The justification or validity of the regulation was discussed when an action that is technically possible is prohibited.
        - Balance between freedom of expression and regulation
            - There was a position that the program itself is considered "speech," and the question was whether the technical regulations infringed on freedom of expression.
        - Technology Demonstration Effectiveness
            - The fact that it is "easy to break through" highlights flaws in the effectiveness of the regulations and the legal framework.
- Intent in this context
    - It suggests that daring to perform a prohibited but technically easy act, as in the DeCSS case, may provoke debate about the law or regulation and cause some "effect" or "change". Since this effect may be socially meaningful in the form of "improving the law" or "raising an issue," it points to the possibility that similar motivations may be at work among other actors.

> [pacuum](https://x.com/pacuum/status/1860925586333659464) I feel like it's the same root as when you don't want to hit someone with a stick, but if you find a tree branch, you want to swing it around.

> [shimariso](https://x.com/shimariso/status/1860903602732290475) By all means, I would like to demonstrate that the cost of implementation (which also includes risk) is not balanced by the cost of policing by law, so is...

> [JUN_SHR](https://x.com/JUN_SHR/status/1860871028802818373) I guess they don't even recognize that the law prohibits it, and they can't imagine "why others don't" when it's so easy.

To summarize the views expressed on this topic, the following perspectives can be identified
- Excitement for the unexpected
    - The surprise and excitement of finding out that breaking the law is "surprisingly easy" (NISHIO) is a motivating factor.
- evolutionary hypothesis
    - The possibility that the propensity to rebel against prohibition was left behind in human evolution to correct erroneous regulations (nagise).
- person who craves the limelight
    - Wants to gain a sense of superiority by showing that only he can easily do what others assume is "difficult" (tomoyaman).
- The Pleasure of Breaking the Rules
    - The psychology of thrill and pleasure in the violation of the law itself (GOGOTEA3).
- Actions to show invalidity of regulations
    - Demonstration to criticize the existence of ridiculous regulations (omochimetaru, shimariso).
- The difference between trust and harm
    - Illegal activities that do not directly cause harm should be discussed as an impact on the trust system (KAZUHO).
- Visualization of the "Ummm Ban."
    - When a substantially ambiguous regulation is generalized, the act of making it stand out (hmikisato).
- Balancing the risk and cost of an action
    - Pointing out that the risks and costs of the act are disproportionate to the policing costs of the law (shimariso).

These are multifaceted interpretations of the psychological and social background of legal violations. Each opinion assumes individual motivations and backgrounds, suggesting a complexity that cannot be explained by a single factor.
