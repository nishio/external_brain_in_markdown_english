In this discussion, the concept of "false two~" appears in a variety of contexts. Three different perspectives, "false dichotomy," "false two~," and "false dichotomy," are described to critique the oversimplification of the two alternatives or conflicts.

First, the "dichotomy" is the idea of dividing things completely into A and B. It is valid when A and B are completely mutually exclusive and cover the whole without omissions. In reality, however, such a clear division is often difficult to achieve. The "false dichotomy" points out the fallacy of following this dichotomy even though it is not established.

Second, a "false choice" is a situation in which one believes that there are only two options, A and B. A "false choice" occurs when one misses the possibility that a third or multiple choice exists. For example, this is the case where the third option, "the iron axe," is the correct answer to the classic question, "the golden axe or the silver axe?

Finally, a "dichotomy" is the idea that A and B are opposites on some axis, with an increase in one implying a decrease in the other. However, "false dichotomies" occur when it is inappropriate to think on this axis, or when one misses that there are other axes. For example, instead of the axis of "head-mounted display performance vs. weight," it is possible to overcome the axis of conflict itself by realizing that there is another solution: a design that allows weight to escape to the floor.

What this philosopher's approach reveals is an insight into the limitations of limiting things to two options or oppositional structures and the possibilities that are often overlooked by doing so. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing diverse ways of looking at things and considering new alternatives and axes.

From my perspective, this consideration is very useful in modern decision-making and debate. Often, we try to simplify complex events, and as a result, we tend to get caught up in narrow views such as the "false two~". However, by recognizing these fallacies and incorporating new perspectives, we can be more flexible and creative in problem solving.

This kind of thought exercise is beneficial for maintaining a diversity of perspectives and can be a powerful tool, especially when tackling the complex issues of our time.



## ver.1: 2018-12-09
There are several concepts in this project related to the "wrong two~."
    - [[False dichotomy]]
    - [[choosing the wrong two options]]
    - [[False dichotomy]]
        - [[Isn't there more than one axis?]]
    - [[Third character.]]
Consider what the boundaries of this concept are.

- The [[dichotomy]] is the idea that the elements of a set S can be divided into sets A and B without any confusion ([[MECE]]).
It cannot be established if there are elements that are not included in either A or B, or if there are elements that are included in both A and B.
Example: [[Can/can't is a false dichotomy]].

- [[selecting an option (from two alternatives)]] is the idea that one must choose between two [[options]] A, B.
It is not viable if there is a third option or if both options can be taken at the same time.
When you are torn between two options, you may ask yourself, "Isn't it a false assumption that I have to choose between these two? Isn't there a better third option?" It is important to realize that there is a better third option.

'Is it this gold axe you dropped? Or is it a silver axe?"
- If you assume you have to choose between a golden axe or a silver axe, then you are "choosing the wrong two."
- The correct answer was "neither, it's an iron axe."

- The quality of decision making is 7.7 times better when there are two choices versus three choices. see [[Quantity of choices and quality of decision making]].

- [[binary opposition]] is the idea that there is one axis, like a number line, with A at one end and B at the other.
It can also be expressed that there is one value X, and as that value increases, A increases and B decreases.
If you can reduce B without increasing A, it is not possible.
Example: [[The opposite of satisfaction is not dissatisfaction.]]
My use of the word may be a bit out of sync with the dichotomy in the dictionary sense.
- > 《dichotomy》In logic, two concepts are in a contradictory or oppositional relationship. Also, to dichotomize a concept as such. Inside and outside, male and female, subject and object, Western and non-Western, etc. Dichotomy. [https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/word/二項対立/](https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/word/二項対立/)
    - On the other hand, what is the general term for the "A←→B" kind of thing we are talking about here? A [[trade-off]] relationship?
    - 2022-11-26 This, in the first place, this dictionary description doesn't distinguish between "dichotomy" and "dichotomy".
        - > Binary opposition (dichotomy, binary opposition) is a term in logic. [Binary opposition - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/二項対立)
        - This dichotomy and binary opposition are different articles in the English version
        - [Dichotomy - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichotomy)
            - > A dichotomy is a partition of a whole (or a set) into two parts (subsets). In other words, this couple of parts must be
                - > jointly exhaustive: everything must belong to one part or the other, and
                - > mutually exclusive: nothing can belong simultaneously to both parts.
            - Yeah, this is the concept I'm referring to by the term "dichotomy".
        - [Binary opposition - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_opposition)
            - > A binary opposition (also binary system) is a pair of related terms or concepts that are opposite in meaning.
            - Yes, this is the concept I am referring to by the term "dichotomy".
                - Examples: up/down, left/right, on/off
            - It gets weirder and weirder as you read on.
            - The dichotomy originated in Saussure's structuralist theory, which mutually determines the meaning of the other, as in "good and evil."
                - I'm not talking about that.
            - They say things like, "Typically, one dominates the other."
                - That's an idea in some philosophies, I'm not talking about that.
- Use the word dichotomy in the above definition until you find a better word.

- About "The Wrong Two
    - The original is [[false dichotomy]], so "false dichotomy."
    - That's what I'm subdividing it into.
        - [[choosing the wrong two options]]
        - The mistake of assuming that there are only two options.
        - Which is correct, Proposal A or Proposal B?"
            - Proposal C could be the right answer.
            - It's not good to be [[lack of vision]] on two options.
        - [[False dichotomy]]
        - The mistake of assuming that a given x belongs to one of two sets A, B
        - "Is x an A or a B?"
            - If A and B are not [[MECE]], then x can be "neither A nor B" or "both A and B".
            - Even if A and B are MECE, they can be both if x is not a point of no magnitude
        - [[False dichotomy]]
        - The mistake of assuming that some x is on the A-B axis of conflict.
        - "If you had to describe x on a five-point scale from 'very A' to 'very B,' what would it be?"
        - A high performance head-mounted display is too heavy and puts a strain on the neck, while a lightweight display does not offer the same performance."
            - Performance and low load on the neck are considered on opposing axes.
            - Thinking in terms of this axis of opposition unconsciously excludes ideas that do not fit on this axis of opposition, such as "high performance, but used in bed so the weight can be released to the floor".
    - [False dichotomy - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/誤った二分法)
    - [False dilemma - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma)
    - Surprisingly, the English version makes the dilemma the headline.
