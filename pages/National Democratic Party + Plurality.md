>  came to my room. I hadn't seen Audrey Tan in about 3 months.
>
>  This time, he came to Japan on the occasion of the publication of the Japanese edition of "Plurality" (Plurality) and held symposiums at universities and other institutions.
>
>  I asked her if she honestly thought the concept of "Plurality" was difficult. I asked, and Audrey Tan honestly said it is difficult. But you can practice it, she said.
>
>  But this is, after all, the very "solution rather than confrontation" of the NDP, I explained, and I introduced the current state of broad listening in our party and the realities and problems of AI analysis. Glenn Weil was also surprised when I explained that we are actually using [[TALK TO THE CITY]] (TTTC) to analyze the data.
>
>  However, I also explained our limitations, saying that although we are now able to gather a large number of opinions, we have not yet created a mechanism for "deliberative discussion" with a large number of people, and I was also given some technology to overcome this limitation.
>
>  Above all, it was good to see that we are in agreement in our desire to use technology as a tool that can and will lead to harmony and consensus rather than national division.
>
>  I said that of all the party leaders, I probably use AI the most, and I would like to give them feedback on their various efforts, and they promised to work with me in the future.
>
>  Everyone smiled when I gave them "Happy Turn" as a souvenir. Good for them.
>
>  Thanks.

> [tamakiyuichiro](https://x.com/tamakiyuichiro/status/1923943966493598013) When Audrey Tan and Glenn Weil came over the other day, we talked about how it is possible to use technology to "deliberate" rather than "divide" the discussion when different opinions exist. The other day, when Audrey Tan and Glenn Weil were here, we talked about the possibility of technology that can lead to "deliberation" instead of "division" when there are different opinions.
>
>  Technology and social networking sites tend to divide opinions, but technology can also bridge different opinions.
>
>  I was shown some specific examples, and I thought it was an essential technique for the development of a healthy democracy.
>
>  We will continue to make attempts to do so as the NDP.
