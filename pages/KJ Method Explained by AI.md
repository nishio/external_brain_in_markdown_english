An experiment to let GPT4 explain what I know more about.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Bullet-pointed description of [[KJ method]] by [[Jiro Kawakita]].

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Jiro Kawakita's KJ method is known as a [[problem-solving]] or [[idea generation]] method. The following is a bulleted list of its features and procedures.
- Abstract: The KJ method is a group activity for the purpose of [[Organizing Information]] and analysis. By [[visualizing (data, results, etc.)]] and sharing individual ideas and information, new perspectives and solutions can be found.
    - Doubt, not limited to group activities<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - [[The KJ method is not powerful without individual work.]]
- Inventor: Developed by Japanese anthropologist Jiro Kawakita.
- Objective: To organize information and gain [[insight to solve problems]].
- Processes: 1.
    - Information Gathering: Gather information and ideas related to your theme.
    - Fill in the cards: Fill in the collected information and ideas individually on small cards or [[tags]].
    - [[grouping]]: [[grouping]] related cards. This is done in an [[intuitive]] way.
    - Labeling: Label each group with a label indicating the theme or category.
    - Placement and Organization: Places groups in their overall context and organizes them based on relevance.
    - Discussion and Analysis: Discussion based on grouped information to solve problems and generate ideas.
- Uses: Ideation of new products, root cause analysis of problems, project planning, and much more.
- Benefits
    - Can organize complex information visually.
    - Equal access to team members' opinions and perspectives.
    - Able to analyze logically while utilizing intuitive insights.
- Notes:.
    - Facilitator skills are important for effective sessions.
    - It can take time to gather and organize information.
The KJ method is used in many fields because of its flexibility and simplicity of practice.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Intuitive grouping" means grouping information and ideas based on [[intuition]] and [[sense]], without relying on [[logical analysis]] or [[prior categorization]]. This process utilizes participants' senses, [[experience]], and intuition to naturally group together [[items that seem relevant]].

The purpose of this approach in the KJ method is to encourage [[new perspectives]] and [[combining ideas]] rather than being bound by [[preconceived notions]]. Intuitive grouping is often helpful in discovering [[deep, not superficial connections]] and [[latent themes]]. This technique is particularly useful for going beyond the [[frame of mind]] to [[uncover ideas]] and to explore [[root causes of problems]].

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>How exactly is that possible?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The intuitive grouping process is made possible by the ability of the human brain to process information based on [[pattern]] and [[relevance]]. The specific elements and steps that make this process possible are detailed below.
1. exploit human cognitive characteristics
    - Pattern Recognition: Humans naturally have the ability to recognize patterns and similarities. This allows us to intuitively connect related information.
    - Use of experience and knowledge: Personal experience and existing knowledge provide the background for processing new information. Based on these, intuitive decisions and classifications are made.
- 2.[[Respect for diverse viewpoints]].
    - Adoption of [[all participants' opinions]]: In the KJ method, [[all participants' intuition]] and opinions are respected. This makes it possible to group information from [[Diverse perspectives]].
- 3.[[Constraint minimization]].
    - [Avoid pre-categorization: Grouping information freely and intuitively, without pre-categorization, facilitates the generation of creative and innovative ideas.
4. use of visual techniques
    - [Information Visualization: Using cards and sticky notes to visually represent information makes it easier for participants to grasp the intuitive relevance of information than text alone.
5. environment
    - Provide an [[open and safe space]]: Creating an environment with a [[sense of security]] where intuition can be freely expressed encourages intuitive grouping.

This intuitive grouping process is made possible by the natural cognitive characteristics of humans and the development of an environment and methods to maximize these characteristics. Through this process, we can review information from various angles and generate new ideas and solutions.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>By "no pre-set categories," we mean that we do not prepare fixed categories or [[classification criteria]] from the beginning when categorizing information and ideas, but rather form groups freely at the stage of receiving information, based on participants' intuition. This approach has several important reasons and purposes.

    - Ensure [flexibility
    - By not pre-categorizing, information can be handled flexibly and categorized based on on-the-spot intuition or [[insight]]. This helps facilitate [[unexpected relevance]] and [[New Discoveries]].
- Promotes creativity
    - By allowing participants to form groups freely, we can discover [[ideas that are usually overlooked]] and [[new connections between information]]. This encourages [[creative thinking]] and [[the development of new ideas]].
- [[Eliminate preconceived notions]].
    - Categorizing information based on fixed categories may result in associated [[preconceived notion]] or [[prejudice]]. By not pre-categorizing, information can be viewed from a more [[open]] perspective and prejudice can be avoided.
- Utilization of [collective wisdom
    - In group activities, the knowledge, experience, and intuition of each participant can be used to categorize ideas, thereby maximizing [[the wisdom of the entire group]]. By not setting categories in advance, it is expected to [[encourage individual contributions]] and [[enhance the results of the group as a whole]].
- Cultivating flexible thinking
    - This approach provides participants with the opportunity to think [[flexibly]] and [[from multiple perspectives]]. This may foster the ability to think outside the [[stereotype]] box.

Thus, "no pre-set categories" is an important principle for a more creative and comprehensive strategy for categorizing and organizing information, and for expanding the possibilities for discovering new ideas and solutions.
