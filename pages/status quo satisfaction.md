    - > [[improvement]] will not occur without the ability to recognize gaps
            - [[Gap Cognitive Ability]]
    - > Even if the action for improvement is as low-cost as "buying a HEATTECH," people who don't recognize that there is a gap there don't even try to find a solution, and as a result, they think "winter is cold."
- Continued: [[Satisfied with current situation2]].
