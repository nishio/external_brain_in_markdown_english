    - [[Restricted Communication]]
- Arrange cards 1-100 in four rows.


- What if we did "no more than N questions that can be answered in y/n" to clearly define the constraints of communication (occupational hazard)
- Repeat 2 columns of 10 sheets to compact the problem and increase the number of case samples (occupational disease)
- Is the minimum configuration per 6 cards, 2 rows of 6 cards, 1 hand?
- Limiting the time per move instead of limiting the number of questions would make the time per play definitive.
