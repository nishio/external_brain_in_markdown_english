- > And Yancey Strickler asks if the Internet is becoming this "dark forest" as well. In fact, he says, this text itself is a case in point. The text was initially broadcast on a [[private channel]] of 500 people Strickler knew and selected, which he says is the online environment where he felt safest and could be his "truest self.... Slack channels, Instagram in private mode, invitation-only forums, Snapchat, WeChat (or LINE in Japan).... All of the above places are not indexed, optimized, or gamed by search engines, which is why they allow for relaxed dialogue. He says that the culture in such places is closer to the real world than in other Internet places.

I had a faint idea that "the world where words uttered without much thought are kept in a semi-permanent log is terribly harsh on people..." in my PC communication days, but "and then indexed and searched" is nothing less than harsh, isn't it?
