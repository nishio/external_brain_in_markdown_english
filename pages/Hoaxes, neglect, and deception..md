The following is a summary of the main issues in this discussion:
1. there are different opinions on how to respond to [[false rumor (rumour)]]:
        - - One side argues that refuting the hoax will only encourage its spread.
        - - The other side argues that a counterargument is necessary because if the hoax is left unchecked, it will [[become]] a fait accompli.
2. on the effectiveness of refuting hoaxes:
        - - Even if it doesn't change the direct speaker's mind, it has an impact on the people around him or her and the younger generation.
        - - Continued rebuttal will make the hoax and the facts visible and known.
3. the significance of social networking discussions:
        - - While some have criticized it as a mere "imp earner," others say that it is an important place to disseminate information.
4. the position of the parties:
        - - Several opinions were expressed by parties concerned, including those from Fukushima Prefecture, with differing views depending on their position.
5. anti-disinformation techniques:
        - - Various methods have been suggested, including community notes, rebuttals in replies, and publication of a book.
6. long-term impact:
        - - Citing past examples (e.g., the comfort women issue), some have pointed out the dangers of leaving it unattended.

Overall, it is clear that responding to hoaxes is not simple, and there is a lively debate about the methods and effects of such responses.

>  No amount of resbah on social networking sites will change a person's principles. Don't you think it's best not to engage and no one is interested?
>
>  What you are doing is contributing to the spread of false rumors and rumors.

> [jammnext](https://x.com/jammnext/status/1819135903820140879) Excuse me for being sideways. You say that it does not change your principles, but it is a good way to judge those who have no principles or interests, and young people who are about to enter society. It is not a waste of time. By the way, I am also from Fukushima prefecture.

> [inukaitai_tokyo](https://x.com/inukaitai_tokyo/status/1819164777551482947) would be able to send out the right thing in the rip section or community notes.
>  I don't understand the point of going out of your way to pull rits and earn imps.

> [uimontyo](https://x.com/uimontyo/status/1819771081710010487) You are fundamentally wrong in your perception.

>  The fact that very influential influencers blow falsehoods is especially problematic and can be the root cause of the establishment.
>  You're the one who should ignore it, not make waves.
>  You say you are making impressions, but Mr. Hayashi, a resident of Fukushima Prefecture like yourself, has published a book based on the data he has collected through his persistent efforts to refute the claims of others.

>  "[[Rumor perpetrator]]"
>
>  The word "ROKUDENASHI" has been generalized, and it is surely having a damaging effect on those who have never said it before and have no responsibility or guilt for their actions.
>  Without impressions, the meaning of what you say is lost and the activity itself becomes meaningless.
>  Recognize that your idea is assisting a hoax-mongering rogue.
