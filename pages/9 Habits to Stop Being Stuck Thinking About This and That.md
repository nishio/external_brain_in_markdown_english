- 9 Habits to Stop Being Stuck Thinking About This and That
    - [[Hideki Wada]]

- Interesting case study on p. 73 of one "former high-level bureaucrat famous for his ability to get the job done".
    - Culture of training newcomers by making them work hard
    - rush of work
        - Work hard only on jobs that you are good at and from excellent and respected bosses.
        - I'll get to other business later.
    - A good boss will appreciate you more.
    - People who have turned in work they don't want to do, or from bosses they don't appreciate.
    - This is similar to the [[Motivation Creation Method]] "[[Choose for yourself what to do from among the things that need to be done]]".


- What I thought as I read.
        - [[Losses before and after the fact]]
        - [[Mostly fail.]]
        - [[Whether or not to rely on others]]
        - [[The less confident you are, the more you speak ill of others.]]
        - [[Negative critics]]

- You want to do this or that, but you can't seem to take action because you are tired.

- Morita therapy
    - absolute bed rest
        - Forced rest for a week.
                - [[Do "nothing."]]
