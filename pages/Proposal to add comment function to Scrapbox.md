- Bookmarklet to add comments
- Press `[/comments]` or something like that.
    - Link to the page that was opened `[/nishio/title]`.
    - Project name of the page that was opened `[nishio]`.
- is created with the title `nishio-title`.
- Editing privileges for this space are freely open to the public.
    - Users should do the bookmarklet in and join the project.
- The commented party can look at `[nishio]` and see the comments about their project side by side.

- After three months [[Social Triggers]] reminded me of this page
    - > I don't want to be a co-editor, but I sometimes feel like commenting a little bit when I read "Hashimoto Shokai" or "NISHIO Hirokazu's Scrapbox". [Twitter @rashita2](https://twitter.com/rashita2/status/1031389566161154053)
    - The above design is a proposal to create a collaborative editing project for comments, but users do not like their writing to be distributed and would prefer it to be in their own project
    - It is no different from any other page to write "what I think of the outside information", even if it is a comment, and I don't like it to be stored in another place just because it was a comment on a page of another Scrapbox project #Pocket One Principle
    - Is there a similar way to make comments in my project?
        - Wouldn't it be nice if there was a service that would crawl the pre-subscribed Scrapbox projects once a day and notify you if they contain the keywords you specify?
            - Just put in ego-search-like keywords.

- Six more months after the above, [/rashitamemo/Scrapbox for output and Scrapbox for comments](https://scrapbox.io/rashitamemo/Scrapbox for output and Scrapbox for comments) reminded me
    - In this proposal, we were talking about manually reprinting what we wanted comments on.
    - I wrote a proposal to automatically reprint it here.
