title: "(the) market (as a concept)"

The term "market" is fluffy in its definition.

    - [[academia]], who argue that "the value of research is not determined by the marketplace."
    - On the other hand, it is good to write a [[paper]] and have it quoted by others
    - That seems to me to be a situation where you are putting a product called "thesis" on the market in order to get the value of "[[reference]]".
