[Kawaguchi City, Tokyo Metropolitan Government, Sakai City--The Near Future of Municipalities Digitizing Operations by Sharing Apps - ZDNET Japan](https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35180016/)
> A trend is emerging for municipalities (and other municipalities) to introduce systems with minimal customization of applications created by the municipality.

> Even if the budget is obtained, the system will not be ready for use until the next fiscal year, so it will take time to introduce and renovate the system.
    - So [[budgetary uncertainty]] is important?

> Even if the product is manufactured in-house, it is easy to become a black box due to changes in personnel.


> The number of municipalities adopting kintone was 33 in 2019, 74 in 2020, and 138 in 2021. One of the reasons behind this is that in 2019, the use of [[comprehensive administrative network]] ([[LGWAN]]) became possible when combined with [[Ryobi Systems]]'s "[[R-cloud proxy for kintone]]". It will also be significant that Cybozu's cloud infrastructure was registered with the [[Information system Security Management and Assessment Program]] ([[ISMAP]]) in 2021. The company's cloud infrastructure has been registered with the [[Information system Security Management and Assessment Program]] (ISMAP).

[ASCII.jp: Cybozu explains "Share DX" for sharing kintone applications among local governments](https://ascii.jp/elem/000/004/076/4076466/) #Share DX
> The requirements are so niche that no packaged software exists. Even if we outsource, we are so small that we cannot afford the budget for scratch development... Under these circumstances, [[no-code]] development tools such as [[kintone]] are attracting attention from local governments. Screens can be created by drag-and-drop, data is stored in a database, and shared. Process management allows for the creation of work flows, and communication allows staff to interact with each other. Setoguchi points out, "An increasing number of municipalities are shifting analog operations to kintone, creating their own systems, and improving operations at a rapid pace.

> Governments are characterized by the fact that they "operate on a non-profit basis" and that "although they may differ in size and region, the nature of their work is similar. Therefore, copying a kintone application created by one municipality to another kintone system creates the advantage that other municipalities can implement the system with minimal customization. Mr. Setoguchi points out, "The system is a good match between the characteristics of local governments and the kintone system.
- > Kintone has a mechanism to easily create templates of apps and plugin settings and share them in Zip file format. Using the copied app templates as a reference, each municipality can create their own apps by changing or modifying the items themselves. This type of shared DX is expanding to each municipality.
    - [[Ease of change on site]]
- > For example, Kakogawa City shared a template for a web-based lottery application system for the Corona vaccine with Gifu City. Beppu City has made its template for a system to support the operation of evacuation centers available on the city's open data site. In addition, Osaka Prefecture's template for a coronavirus infection patient information management system has been shared with Hyogo and Saitama prefectures, and Kobe City's daily driving report system for official vehicles is being used by Kawaguchi, Chiryu, Amami, and other cities.
    - [[It is irrational to have separate systems.]]

> The Public Exclusive Group was created in 2020. In addition, he established the "[[Govtech kintone community]] ([[gabkin (Gabby gummy bear)]])," a community open to all municipal employees. Currently, 200 municipalities/500 municipal employees are participating in the community, which provides business know-how and templates, materials and videos, and holds events.
