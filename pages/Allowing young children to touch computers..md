[Letting young children touch computers - Biscuit this and that -](https://blog.goo.ne.jp/viscuit/e/e0cffd5e7760a4238d3bf362a0b35f1d)
Observations on how children use touch devices when they are allowed to use them
- Instead of dragging the object, place your finger across the object and try to pull it with your stomach
- If something moves that you don't want to move, try to stop it by holding it with your other hand.
- If rubbing your finger on it will give it color, I'm sure pressing your hand on it will give you a handprint.
- I think you can move multiple pieces together by rubbing them with the belly of your hand.

I see. It's hard to make "[[Intuitive UI]]".
