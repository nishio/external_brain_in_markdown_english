title: "CDNs have an incentive to reduce the diversity of people's interests."

> [takiuchi](https://twitter.com/takiuchi/status/1722895037275779402) What we need to remember is that "[[CDNs]] are more efficient and profitable in situations where popular content is concentrated and content diversity is scarce." [[takiuchi ]] The more people's interests disperse and become long-tail, the less efficient and profitable they become... CDNs have an incentive to reduce the diversity of humanity.
>  >takiuchi: I think it's only because of the poor ranking algorithm that only the top spots are hyped and the share of traffic is huge, and not the true interest of the human race is concentrated enough to match that share. Most of them [[are talking about it because it's a hot topic]], not because it's interesting.

CDNs have an incentive to reduce people's [[diversity of interest]].

- [[attention]]
