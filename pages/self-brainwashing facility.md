self-brainwashing facility
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1738291482476560865) I do self-brainwashing treatment at a self-brainwashing facility where I follow the letters with my eyes and vocalize them out loud and then use a loudspeaker to magnify them and put them in through my ears.

Another example: [[An ungraceful life is lame.]]

The hypothesis is that by picking up a song in advance that expresses a good thought, and then generating it while reading the lyrics and loudly inputting it into your whole body, you can brainwash yourself with that "good thought".
- I used to think that [karaoke is sutra
- In addition, I thought [[karaoke is sutra reading]].
- That makes it dangerous to sing a song that focuses on misery.

If you start looking for songs after you enter the karaoke room, you'll waste time, so list them ahead of time.
- People tend to look for Megumi Hayashibara, but it turns out to be Masami Okui.

[[Give a reason]]
- >  I'm smiling with a stronger image, a thought I believe in, and that, more than anything or anyone else, brings me closer to my dream.
- >  I won't lean on the goal, even if I reach it, my new dream will surely have my back.
- >  Here we go! go! keep running and nothing can stop us.
- >  give a reason for life to my future self
[[〜infinity〜∞]]
- > I've been walking so hard and so empty that a clear road map will appear in your mind.
- >  Do your best for your sake anytime
- >  I don't need to have regrets ahead of time, because ahead of time, a new path will be created, and you're the only one who can see it.
- >  To accept defeat gracefully is to win tomorrow, so let's be cool and be cool.
- >  You can have your way in everything
[[Just be conscious]]
- >  "Sound the thought, as long as you can, deep in your heart, run, don't look back, time is ticking away the prologue.
- >  It's a waste of time if you don't at least enjoy the drama of life in which you are the main character.
- >  Pray, words change form, go ahead, believe, grab this road, hold this dream in both hands, now take off your unnecessary pride.
- > You're going through the same pain over and over until you realize it's a labyrinth and there's always a way out, and you just have to listen hard enough to find it.
- > I don't need the hypocrisy of patronizing others.
- > We are living in the moment, so we should do what we like and what we enjoy!
[[don't be discouraged]]
- >  I don't want a manual future.
[[Breeze]]
- >  If I can find my tiny self, then I won't get hurt, and I won't be afraid of tomorrow.
[[Reflection]]
- > I'd rather walk like me, even if I'm clumsy, than live well.
- > Too much noise to live in the moment, too much noise to confuse the way of life.
- > I will change little by little if I can face the real answer that is inside of me.
[[raging waves]]
- > I'm not aiming for a life that will be praised by anyone.
- > It's not that I'm suddenly strong... [[It's not that I'm suddenly able to do it]] I have to build myself up from the repeated days.
- [[I won't let you get in my way.]]
- >  A life manipulated by something is not a dream or a hope.
- >  It's time to start up the engine, take off all your rusty common sense and get going.
- [[Rinbu-revolution]]
- >  Let's live gracefully and coolly.
- >  Take my revolution, let's live, reality is coming fast and furious, and I want to find my place, my existence, my value.
- >  I'll gracefully shed the self I've been to this day, and I'll be naked, like a rose dancing in freedom.
- >  Even if we are separated, I will change the world

[[Get along]]
[[KUJIKENAIKARA!]]
