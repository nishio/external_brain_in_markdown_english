March Review.
Activity Highlights
- Plurality Related
    - Progress in content organization and writing, including related commentary with Yukito Karatani and Blurb update
    - Deepened the use of AI by considering improvements to vector search and delegating the look-back work to Claude.
- Unexplored Conference 2024
    - Work to summarize the talk session on Generating AI/LLM Business Applications
    - Continued to hold study sessions (Quadratic Voting, etc.) and actively share knowledge with the community
- pPublic Opinion Map
    - After meeting with UX team, preparing for next proposal in 2 weeks
- Other
    - Gathering and verifying information on the latest tools, including testing and summarizing new features of Claude 3 Opus
    - Host multiple Murder Mystery Meetings on weekends to refresh and get new ideas.

Lessons learned and insights gained
- Handling multiple projects simultaneously
    - As we work on various topics in parallel, such as Plurality, the p public opinion map, and the summary of the unexplored conference, we are reminded of the importance of keeping a timeline of each progress.
- The Benefits of AI-Based Reflection
    - By letting the AI reconstruct the weekly journal text, new perspectives and unexpected relevance can be found. Information that was nearly buried during busy times can be rediscovered.
- Time management and pacing
    - The timing of the weekly journal tends to break down as the "last week/this week" separation becomes ambiguous. Having clear operational rules, such as switching early and setting a look-back date, will reduce the number of missed opportunities.
- Strengthening Community Relations
    - Technical ideas (e.g., Quadratic Voting utilization) are refined through discussions at study groups and events. Easy to accumulate knowledge through regular gatherings and document sharing.

Ideas to utilize for next year
- Fixation of "look-back days"
    - Set a weekly or bi-weekly schedule and have the AI summarize the updates from the previous session, read them over, and then drop them into the memo, which will be rotated on a regular basis.
- Expanding Collaboration with AI
    - Utilize multiple AI tools such as Claude to automate summarization and progress checks. Try a system that can introduce vector searches and centralize the tagging of daily memos.
- Centralized minutes of events and study groups
    - Summarize key points from workshops and meetings in Scrapbox, etc., and have AI analyze them again when looking back. It will be easier to see the connection between various themes (Plurality, Quadratic Voting, etc.).
- Breathing + Idea Generation Mechanisms
    - Regularly intersperse play, such as Murder Mystery or board games. Not only does this provide new perspectives, but it also helps prevent fatigue.

Despite the busyness of the month of March, we were able to use AI to look back and gain new ideas. Looking ahead to the following year and beyond, systematizing the look back and re-discovery of information and deepening community collaboration in a more systematic way will make concurrent projects run more smoothly.
