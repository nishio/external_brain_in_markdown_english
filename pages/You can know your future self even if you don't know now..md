If most people, including myself, "don't know", then the person who first starts taking action to "figure it out" has an advantage, so we challenge them. ...... Rather, after everyone has figured it out, there is no such thing as a "challenge" left.

>  The reason it doesn't seem so much like that is probably because a lot of things have been visualized.
