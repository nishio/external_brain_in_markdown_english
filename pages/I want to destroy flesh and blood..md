title: "I want to destroy flesh and blood."
---

I think it would be easier to get agreement if I said, "I want to destroy an anachronistic person who says, 'Handwrite your resume' or 'Do your math in handwriting,'" but if I generalize a bit and say, "I want to destroy [[a flesh-and-blood person]]," I'm sure I'll get flamed.

But isn't it essentially the same thing?

Thinking about why the flames would be [[Emotionally repulsed by what they perceive as an attack on them]], "I want to destroy [[flesh and blood]] people.

Where does that [[belief that "I am flesh and blood"]] come from?

- [[The belief that you are flesh and blood]].
    - [[I am flesh and blood.]]
    - Where did the belief that my essence is [[Protein Body]] come from? I mean.
            - [[mistaken belief]] I guess.
