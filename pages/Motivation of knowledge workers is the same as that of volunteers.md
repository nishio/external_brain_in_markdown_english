title: "Motivation of knowledge workers is the same as that of volunteers"
---

- [[What will govern tomorrow]]  p.23
> Knowledge workers are motivated by the same motivations that motivate volunteers...
>  Volunteers, precisely because they do not get paid,
- > We must get satisfaction from the work itself.
- > They must be given the opportunity to challenge themselves.
- > The mission of the organization must be known and believed to be the best it can be.
- > Must be trained for better jobs.
- > Must be able to understand outcomes

- This is what [[incentive]] and [[motivation]] mean.
The amount of compensation, paid or unpaid, appears important to those whose financial needs are not being met, but is not an [[incentive]] factor for those whose needs have been met.
    - [[Herzberg's two-factor theory]]
    - [[of quality commonplace]]

How to [[incentivize]] in such a situation is shown in the five conditions.
