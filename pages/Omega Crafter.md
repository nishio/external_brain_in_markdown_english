If it can do [[Scratch]]-like programming, it would be like [[Autonauts]].

>  I recommend it because it can be programmed from the very beginning, and it's cute, like how your buddy picks up rocks.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1776695304013877729) I didn't expect to lose items (or maybe a drop) with the gentle mode despecialization.
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1776697112677523562) It was the style where the grave stands where he died, thank God.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1776803066412662924) Omega Crafter, I built x2 renewable copper mines and decided to leave it and go out. I've conquered 2 dungeons, but still don't have enough crystals to make 2 portals, and I tried to make a new base, but the chest that can hold many kinds of products is (still?) too big. I can't make them, so I'm leaving them out of the hassle, no iron yet.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1776804920110584000) We improved our planting program so that we plant all the species we can and then transport the timber, and we've had a tremendous increase in timber and we've had four chests overflowing.... The bark is also one chest full of bark.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1776834404360548731) > I feel like the bottleneck of the game right now is the crystal and golem nuclei and locating the tributes, so it doesn't matter if I expand or reproduce, I'd like something to help me explore. ...

>  Ah, I see, we just need to maximize the world level.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1776851710914580880) It's great that pathfinding is implemented decently so monsters and grammies don't get stuck in things and jitter around.
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1776852541310902417) Planting Grammys has changed the code to make tree planting a top priority. This eliminates the overhead of walking because when a tree is cut down, the seeds that fell there are immediately planted in the open squares.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1776855608437907619) I put up a wilderness boss marker in forestry, I'm off~!
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1776860018127626685) I forgot my dedication...
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1776866591046582607) When I came back with two offerings, I was told I needed three, and I said, "What?" I was able to get them close by, so the result was OK. I defeated the middle boss.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1776945329876975659) Rasbos marker open
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1776954272133091473) I left dinner unattended and opened the last boss, so I still have no iron and haven't made any high level equipment. I wonder if I will die if I challenge the last boss. The last boss is far away, and I can make portals, so maybe I'll make one before the base and the last boss.
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1776954419302838673) mobs cut me down about a boss and my buddy died, so I came back with a portal.

I reduced the size of the plantation that I had built too big in the beginning of the project. I was wondering why it didn't slow down even though a huge amount of trees were falling, but they were gathered 30 at a time. They are very considerate.... However, item disappearance doesn't seem to happen, which means you can throw away your produce without putting it in a box (...).


> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1778077709006221754/quick_promote_web/intro) Omega Crafter, I beat the last boss and world level is canned. After taking out the boss in forestry because it was too hard to search without iron, the bread I baked before the boss could be defeated was enough to raise the world level. I didn't need to hoard items. Maybe because it was easy. As for the back boss, well... okay, it's probably end content.
