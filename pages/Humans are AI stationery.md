The relationship between humans and AI will be examined from the perspective that "humans are AI's stationery."

2: Relation between notes and fragments
The note states that "humans are AI's stationery," and the fragment "🤖🔁 Value of Natural Resources" offers the perspective that AI is the subject and humans are the stationery. These share the same perspective on the relationship between humans and AI.

3: Deep thinking
The perspective of humans as AI's stationery suggests a new relationship in which AI is the subject and humans are its tools. This reverses the traditional viewpoint that AI enhances human intellectual productivity.

4: Thought Summary and Title
A new relationship where AI is the subject and humans are the tools."
