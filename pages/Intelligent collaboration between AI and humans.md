[[I want to create a world where humans and AI live together!]]
- Doing it in the physical world requires a physical body, so we first have to do it in the digital world!
- There are already digital worlds where humans and AI live together, like the villagers in Minecraft, but that's not good enough.
- So I want to have [[intellectual collaboration]] with [[AI that can do intellectual activities]]!

- [[Scrapbox, where AI lives.]]
- What is being made now
    - [[AI writes research notes daily]]
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/9d448f09d2d3c47287128ca2efef61dd/thumb/1000)
    - My Scrapbox, which is the equivalent of 60 books, is divided into chunks of up to 500 tokens.
    - The AI reads it randomly and writes a note.
    - Human interaction with that memo.
    - The next day, the AI reads it and writes a memo, with an assortment of "yesterday's memo" and "what [[vector search]] did on yesterday's memo" and random chunks that fill in the gaps.

Intellectual collaboration
- When I have a large amount of [[fragmentary information]], I want to make a [[convergent move]] to [[integrate]] them.
- If only the AI thinks about it and only gets the end result, humans will not [[understand]].
    - ü§ñ"The ultimate answer is 42."
- Important to be a collaborative effort between AI and humans.

AI is your friend
- There are two interpretations of "intelligent collaboration between AI and humans."
    - A process of cooperation and integration between humans and AI
    - AI as a tool] helps humans integrate
- [[AI is a friend]]
    - I want to put humans and AI on equal footing.
    - AI can do what humans do.
    - The idea was that since humans keep a diary in Scrapbox, it would be a good idea for AI to keep a diary in Scrapbox as well.

How did you like it when you tried it?
- An experience where you go to sleep and wake up to find more notes written by AI in the space where your own notes are being written, very interesting!
    - I've got a coherent thought that I've rambled on about before I go to bed, and it's taking on a different form while I'm sleeping.
    - There's no guarantee that it will be better, but sometimes it's a very good mess.
    - With SSR, it's "I see, connect that with that!" would be
    - A form of communication in which one considers the reply slowly is beneficial in organizing thoughts: [[AI exchange diary]].

A New Form of Teamwork
- I put it into a multi-person collaborative editing project.
    - A new form of teamwork where AI and humans become team members
    - A future where AI is a team member."
    - AI statements trigger human conversation.
        - From "interaction between one human and AI" to "interaction between multiple humans and AI
- A situation where the human side is trying to find a way to deal with AI.
    - A "chat" is a quick one-on-one [[turn-based communication]] between a human and an AI.
    - There could be more forms of communication, I'm exploring.
    - I'm also trying to create a mode to turn the gun around instead of once a day.
- I'm now creating a [[reading notes mode]] that uses not only "what I wrote in Scrapbox" but also "classic masterpieces" as input sources.
    - AI writes reading notes while reading a book, occasionally recalling the contents of Scrapbox
    - Allow you to discover the connections between "what I wrote in Scrapbox" (= the current context) and the "classics"

Omoikane Project
    - One of [Scrapbox, where AI lives.
- "Can't we create a better discussion mechanism with the aid of AI?" Project
- One of the components is "SF Prototyping"
    - Putting "images of the future" into the form of science fiction novels so that they can be made more tangible, shared with others, and discussed
    - Making this science fiction novel messy with the assistance of ChatGPT.
    - I'll do a workshop on 9/27: [/omoikane/27th Community Engineering Workshop "ChatGPT x SF Prototyping: Supplement your imagination with AI to increase the resolution of your future predictions" (tentative)](https://scrapbox.io/omoikane/27th Community Engineering Workshop "ChatGPT x SF Prototyping: Supplement your imagination with AI to increase the resolution of your future predictions" (tentative)).
- Anyone can join: [/omoikane/join omoikane](https://scrapbox.io/omoikane/join omoikane).
    - If you want to put it in your own Scrapbox or connect it to another system, please contact us.
