- > Most people in the world want to think they are right, but there are two ways of thinking about it: "I am right because I am right" and "He is wrong because he is wrong. 〜〜The other is "he is wrong because he is wrong, and I am right because I am not wrong. In the latter case, the denied side will fight back to defend its own correctness, which may lead to a sterile mud-slinging contest for "[[correctness]]".
- > But, well, is the root of the problem in using the word "correct" in the first place to mean "correct (for everyone)"? If you use it to mean "correct (at least for me, since it is [[useful]])," then there is room to accept different opinions and say, "I see, you think so."
- Ah, this is a topic that will come up in Mr. Ozaki's interview in the next week or so > [[Usefulness and Correctness]].
- > If you say "[[right]]", I don't see how it can be interpreted as meaning "Objective Correctness". If you want to avoid quarrels, it would be better to replace "right" with "[[useful to me]]" instead of using it carelessly.
- > I think so. It is important not to say "right" inadvertently yourself, but if you lose your temper and say "no, you are right" when others say "your argument is not right," you start a quagmire, so you need to calmly say "my purpose is - and it is useful, at least for me" [[dodge the contradiction]] is necessary.
