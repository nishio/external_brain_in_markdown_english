title: "Relative to boasting"
---

In one of the writings, the description of people who [[boast]] was "posting pictures of sushi on social networking sites.
But the fact that this is something to be proud of is strange when you think about it.
People who eat sushi on a daily basis do not post pictures of sushi (except for those who post what they eat on a daily basis), so posting a picture of sushi is nothing more than a statement that "sushi is extraordinary for me".
This statement itself is about "rather negative," but when the word "boastful" is added to it, it becomes a major negative as "the act of boastfully promoting something negative.
In fact, the other characters in that write-up did not say "wow, I'm eating sushi, I love it" in response to the character's sushi post. The story was a sign that the business the character was in was headed for bankruptcy.
