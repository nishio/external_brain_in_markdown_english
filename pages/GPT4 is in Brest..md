- [[Brainstorm a wide range of information listings]] :
> No reason not to have GPT4 strongly involved in the brainstorming process for a broad list of information.
I wrote "brainstorming for [[Extensive information listing]]," which could also mean "brainstorming to ensure a [[covering]] feeling.

- [[without omission]]
