- (Japanese) Since a disciplined [[militia]] is necessary for the security of a free nation, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be violated.

- The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, part of the U.S. Bill of Rights, guarantees individuals the right to own and, if necessary, use guns. The original text reads as follows
- "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."
- The literal translation is as follows.
- "The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be violated because a well-organized militia is necessary to the security of a free state."
- This is a highly controversial clause in U.S. legal history, and its interpretation has evolved over time. Some interpretations believe that the clause emphasizes the right to a group (i.e., a militia). Other interpretations, however, see it as guaranteeing individual citizens the right to bear arms.
- In a 2008 U.S. Supreme Court decision (District of Columbia v. Heller), the Second Amendment was interpreted to guarantee individuals the right to own guns. With this ruling, U.S. law recognizes the right of individuals to own guns for self-defense.
- Nonetheless, laws and regulations related to this Second Amendment vary widely from state to state, and what is allowed and what is prohibited varies widely from region to region. In addition, the debate over how to strike a balance between [[gun control]] and the free possession of guns has become part of the political divide, which continues to be a social issue.
