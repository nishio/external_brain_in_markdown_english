title: "There are two types of mentoring."
---

> I met someone who is a [[mentor]] at [[unexplored junior]], and his intentions are clearly different from my mentor. The unexplored mentor who respects [[independence]] as much as possible and focuses on developing the potential of the company, and the Accela mentor who strongly guides the growth of the business as an absolute goal. It was an enjoyable meeting, despite the differences in direction.

When I told a mentor of an accelerator that I was worried that if I imposed too much on the adopters of the Junior Accelerator, I would deprive them of the opportunity to solve problems on their own initiative, he responded, "That's totally different from my own mentoring! and they responded, "That's not at all what my mentoring is like!
- Accelerator mentors have a goal of business growth, so "what to do" is more and more on the table.
- The other party is also an "independent adult" who has started his own business, so there is less need to worry about "compromising [[spontaneity]]".

I, on the other hand
    - [[The greatest obstacle to learning is teaching the answer.]]
- I can only offer limited resources for a limited period of time.
- Life after the adoption period is much longer than the adoption period.
- The mentee must be able to confidently say "it's my work" in terms of deliverables.
I think it's better not to say "this is the way it should be done" as much as possible because I think

I have to ask them what kind of [[mentoring]] they are looking for, and I have to make it clearer to them that I am the latter.


- [[mentoring]] includes [[Two types.]].
