What we did this week

    - They beat out other publishers by a touch.
- 3/5-6 Discussion of PluralityBook contract terms and conditions
- 3/7 Busy Sat. and Sun. prior compensatory holiday
    - We also switched our weekly journal ahead of schedule.
    - Maybe tomorrow, maybe even 3/8, I can put it in the weekly journal.
    - I'm tempted to do Plurality, but it's not good to lose my energy, so I go to a cafe and read a book.
