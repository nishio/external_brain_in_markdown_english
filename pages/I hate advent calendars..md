title: "I hate advent calendars."
---

Apparently I don't like [[Advent calendar]], so I'll write about why.
- I want to publish what I write immediately. Why delay until a specific date?
- Readers' [[cognitive resources]] are finite, so it makes no sense to do my post at a time when submissions are concentrated.
- Writing to a deadline is harder than writing without a deadline.

There's one benefit, too.
    - [[deadline]], people who cannot write without setting a deadline get the impetus to write by setting a deadline of publication date and committing to the surroundings.
- Not-so-good company blogs, where the number of articles is a KPI, are useful in getting more articles.
- It is useful as an excuse for dormant circles to keep up appearances by working together at least once a year.
- Motivate people who can't get readers on their own to misperceive that they can get readers by bundling together with several other people.
    - The quality doesn't improve just because it's gathered, it just causes [[social cut corners]].
