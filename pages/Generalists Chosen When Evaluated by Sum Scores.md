title: "Generalists Chosen When Evaluated by Sum Scores"
---

2018-04-24
- When evaluated by the [[sum of scores]] from multiple tests or multiple judges, individuals with overall better abilities are rated higher than those who excel in only one area.
- As a result, [[generalists]] are chosen over [[specialists]]. See [[Specialists and Generalists]] for more information.
- If you want to hire specialists or [[sharp talent]], you should not use such selection methods.

The contour on the right shows evaluation by the sum of scores from two tests, while the left shows evaluation by the maximum score from two tests. The evaluation of Person A, who scores 60 in both abilities, and Person B, who excels in one ability, is reversed.

    - This is an evaluation strategy when only rank evaluations are available, without absolute test scores.

Background of This Article
- 2018-04-23 [Raising Japan's Top 1% Children: Behind the Scenes of "Unexplored Junior"](https://lab-on.jp/academia/1202/) [[Unexplored Junior]]
    - [WebArchive](https://web.archive.org/web/20190414054242/https://lab-on.jp/academia/1202/)
- > ――When you hear "[[Unexplored]]", it gives the impression that the selected projects are all of high level. Could you tell us the selection criteria for the ideas submitted?
- > In the selection for [[Unexplored Junior]], each PM decides on the project by considering 'whether they want to work with this child.' After document screening, each PM conducts a 30-minute online interview with applicants of ideas that caught their attention to decide on selection. Since each PM evaluates applicants from different perspectives and criteria, it's rare for applicants to be nominated for interviews by multiple PMs.
- > ――That's surprising. I imagined that all PMs would evaluate all ideas and select applicants in order from the top using an additive method.
- Such a method should not be used to select specialists.
- Also, "[[additive method]]" does not mean simply adding multiple evaluations.
    - It means ignoring the bad parts and focusing on the good parts.
    - In the diagram on the right, when evaluated by the sum of x and y, Person A (60, 60) wins with 120 points over Person B (100, 0) with 100 points because the -100 of B is not ignored when comparing deductions from 100: A(-40, -40) and B(0, -100).
    - Therefore, using addition to combine multiple evaluations is a neutral method, neither additive nor subtractive.
    - Evaluating by max(x, y) is an additive method that ignores bad points, while evaluating by min(x, y) is a subtractive method that ignores good points.

Additional Notes
- [/masui/Sum and Average](https://scrapbox.io/masui/和と平均)
    - Taking the sum and taking the [[average]] are the same (dividing by a constant does not change the ranking).

- [[Majority Vote]] involves summing each person's 0/1 evaluation and taking the largest, which is the "sum evaluation" being questioned here.
