There are pros and cons to most things.
- This used to be expressed in a "if you can't tell me the flaws in the programming language you're using, that's proof that you don't understand it" kind of way.
    - [[I don't understand enough to say what the flaws are.]]
- I was thinking today that it might be related to "[A sucker is someone who doesn't know who is a sucker.
    - I mean, if something doesn't seem to have a bad side, then maybe you're being duped by someone "intent on making the bad side invisible."
- Well, but "[Don't find malice in being incompetent enough to be explained away.
- People [[who understand enough to not see the bad side]] will only promote the good side, and people with enough critical thinking skills to take it seriously will take it seriously and become a [[filter bubble]].
- This means, for example, that if there's one malicious scammer, and nine nonmalicious idiots take him seriously, and those who saw the nine people's transmissions and believed them because "everyone says so," they're being duped by someone who has no malicious intent.
    - Whether or not the other party has malicious intent is irrelevant in avoiding deception.
