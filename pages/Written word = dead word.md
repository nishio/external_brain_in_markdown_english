The real education for the soul resides in "[[living dialogue]]". In this passage, books are compared to "painted children" who cannot respond to questions or defend themselves, and true learning is the act of inscribing "living words" in the soul through dialogue. The following is an examination of the facts, drawing on the original sources.

        - - 276a (original: "οὐ νεκρὸν γε λόγον, ἀλλὰ ζῶντα")
- Negation of learning effects
    - The written word serves to remind those who already know, but it does not give them any further wisdom. "275d

    - Related to "[[Not a warehouse for dead text.]]" in [Scrapbox Philosophy
- The written text cannot be answered or defended, even if the reader asks a question or makes a counter-argument.
- I think this composition will change with the development of LLM.
