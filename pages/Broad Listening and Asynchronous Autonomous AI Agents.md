Broad Listening and Asynchronous Autonomous AI Agents

- [[broad listening]] will raise the ability of Homo sapiens to understand others and increase the number of dummies by one or two orders of magnitude, and

[[asynchronous autonomous AI agents]] increase Homo sapiens' productivity (with respect to certain tasks) by a factor of 2 to 10, and

It's almost irrelevant, so conversely, if you do both, they're independent, so it's a product.

Both are connected in that "conventional communication among homo sapiens is high cost.

1. how "[[effective number of dummies]]" increases with broadlining
- The gist: Clustering utterances in real time and presenting representative opinions so that "who thinks what" can be received as [[compressed expressions]].
- Consequence: The
    - The cost of updating others' models is greatly reduced because the diverse perspectives of the group can be captured without one-on-one dialogue.
    - As a result, the number of "others that an individual can deeply understand" (i.e., the effective number of dummies) can expand to 10 to 100 times the scale.
    - A climate will be created in which large-scale collaboration and consensus building can take place with the same level of "psychological load" as a small-group meeting.

2. asynchronous autonomous AI agents to jump-start [individual productivity
- Key point: Enter a purpose, and the agent autonomously searches, summarizes, and tries things out, while humans only check and modify policies.
- Consequence: The
    - The process of becoming "[[Cognitive resource bottlenecks]]" disappears quietly.
    - A realistic output density of 2 to 10 times is required for research, drafting of manuscripts, code implementation, etc.
    - Because they move at different times, "24-hour lines" are possible at the individual level, allowing projects to move forward even while workers are sleeping.

3. are they independent? --Why "multiplication" works
_
| Axis Broad Listening Asynchronous AI Agents Interaction |
| -- |
| Main target Human ↔ Human understanding Human ↔ Task execution Almost no overlap |
| Bottleneck Social cognitive costs Cognitive and work costs Both depend on "traditional communication |
| Output Quality of consensus and insight Quantity of concrete deliverables "Quality x Quantity" can be multiplied |

- The correlation is low, so when one reaches its limit, the other remains open to growth.
- Since each extends a separate section of the communication pipe, the simultaneous introduction of the two amplifies the qualitative diversity x quantitative velocity in a multiplicative manner.

4. impact on solopreneurs
1. one person's vision is as good as an organization's
    - Instantly understand the opinions of a thousand followers through broad listening and reflect them in decision-making.
2. one person can execute as well as a team
    - A group of AI agent workers work in the background, rapidly iterating from prototype to market test.
3. final form of leverage
    - [[Audience leverage]] × [[Execution leverage]] ([[Automated action]])
    - As a result, a small number of people - or "super-individuals" - can achieve the scale that traditional start-ups achieve with dozens of people.

5. points for future consideration
- Governance: Who will check the "individuals + AIs" who have enormous influence and how?
- Psychological safety: UI design to prevent recurrence of cognitive overload due to rapid expansion of the effective number of dummies.
- Incentive design: a framework for monitoring the agent's optimization goals and human value misalignment.

Traditionally, there has been a restriction that "communication is expensive, so it is difficult to scale both people and deliverables,
1. dramatic reduction in [[decision sharing costs]] (broad listening)
2. dramatic reduction of [[work execution costs]] (asynchronous AI agents)
collapses from two directions at the same time, a strategy that uses both together can expect extremely high returns.
