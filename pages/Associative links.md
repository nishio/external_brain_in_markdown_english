title: "Associative links"
---

    - [[Scrapbox Best Practices]]
    - [[mind-map]] expresses associations by connecting branches
- If you were looking at some page and wrote another page by association, let's express the information "I was looking at XX and associated with it" in the form of a link!
- You may not understand "what is a common concept" at this point, but leave a link so you can look at it later and maybe come up with something!
