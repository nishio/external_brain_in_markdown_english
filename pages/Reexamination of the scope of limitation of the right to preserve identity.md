### [[Current Issues]]
- The "[[right of]] identity preservation" in Article 20 of the current Copyright Act was established as a provision that broadly prohibits any modification "against the will" of the author, and is structured to protect the author very strongly due to the legislative process.
- Conventional precedents and common law have strictly limited the interpretation of Article 2(2)(iv) ("alterations deemed unavoidable"). As a result, even in cases where a certain degree of alteration was actually necessary, such as in adaptations, the requirements of the article alone were not sufficient, and there were many cases in which the alteration had to be permitted based on unclear reasoning.
- With the advancement of digital technology, we live in an age in which individuals can easily process and modify works, and the conflict between authors (who fear modification) and users (who want to process and edit freely) has become acute. Coordination with a view to the smooth use of copyrighted works and the development of new creations has become essential.

### [Proposed approach/measures
.
1.### Introduction of the "balance-of-interests" theory
.
    - Actively adopt a method to determine whether or not to allow modification by comprehensively comparing and weighing the interests of the author and the user.
        - Specifically, Article 20(2)(iv) ("unavoidable in light of the nature of the work and the purpose and manner of its use") is interpreted flexibly as a general provision, and conclusions are drawn by considering multiple factors such as the necessity, utility, and social practice of the modification, not merely whether there is "damage to honor or reputation".

2.### Clarification of criteria for modification
.
    - It is pointed out that the degree of creativity of the work itself, the magnitude of the impact of the act of modification, whether the modification is for private or public use, the purpose of use (education, parody, etc.), and the necessity of the practice should be organized and enumerated as factors to be considered when weighing interests, in order to increase predictability.

3.### relaxes interpretation of author's predominance
.
    - It argues that the purpose of the Copyright Act, "development of culture," should be achieved more flexibly by shifting the emphasis from the conventional author-dominant operation of "contrary to the author's will = immediate infringement if the author says NG," to one that emphasizes the coordination of the interests of both authors and users.

As described above, the main proposal of this paper is to ### reexamine the conventional strict interpretation, and to implement an interpretation operation that balances the interests of authors and users
