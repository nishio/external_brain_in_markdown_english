- > Kawakami Dam, completed in March 2023 in Iga City, Mie Prefecture, was constructed for the purpose of flood control of the Maehase River, the Kizu River, and the Yodo River, to supply water for Iga City, and to release water during drought (to maintain river functions through stable water flow). It is a gravity-type concrete dam with a height of 84 m, a crest length of 334 m, and a volume of 455,000 m³. In the construction of the Kawakami Dam, a "digital twin" was built based on CIM (Construction Information Modeling/Management), which adds construction attribute information to the 3D model, with a view to maintenance and management from the construction stage after completion. Aiming for automation of dam construction, many digital technologies such as ICT, IoT, and AI were introduced. Kawakami Dam is a next-generation dam that promotes DX (Digital Transformation) at the construction site.
