[Workplace experience by junior high school students in Shibuya-ku, Tokyo | Next Generation Development | Human Capital Management | Sustainability | GMO Internet Group Inc.](https://www.gmo.jp/csr/human-capital/next-generation/20180720/) (2018)
> GMO Internet Group accepts junior high and high school students for work experience and company visits as a way to support the development of human resources who will carry the future.

[[Interview]] This is the Digital Talent! We asked junior high school engineers working in a professional field about the things they are interested in. | Digital Human Resources Co-Creation Federation (Digiren) []](https://dle.or.jp/blog/interview_20240315/) (2024)
> What kind of thoughts and ideas do you have about working as an engineer at an IT company while attending school at ......? Also, how do you work in a professional environment? I am very curious.
>  This time we spoke with Tatsuki Abe, an engineer junior high school student, and his boss, Mr. Numata, the business manager of [[GMO Media]]'s programming education portal site "Koeteko by GMO".

> We operate a programming education portal site for elementary school students called "[[Koeteko]] by [[GMO]]" and have seen its students through many private programming classes. We also saw children with a high level of skills comparable to those of adult engineers at programming competitions and presentations.
>  In the midst of this situation, an organization sponsored by an acquaintance of ours asked us about a junior high school student who wanted to work as an engineer and was looking for a company that would accept him. We were very pleased to be able to offer an opportunity to work as engineers from a young age, and we thought there was plenty of room for consideration, so we responded.
>  However, the road to employment was difficult (laughs).
>  There is not much precedent for junior high school students working in general companies, except for newspaper delivery and child actors, so we had to coordinate quite a bit with [[the Labor Standards Inspection Office]] and the school. It took some time, but with everyone's cooperation, our first and youngest engineer was born.

[I thought it was impossible because it would be child labor, but it's possible if you coordinate with the Labor Standards Bureau and the schools.
When the law banning child labor was first enacted, the problem was that children were forced to engage in [[unskilled]] [[simple labor]], which deprived them of the opportunity to receive education and grow. However, IT engineers and other [[knowledge workers]] privately own the means of production of knowledge, so depriving them of work opportunities may be depriving them of opportunities to grow. The problem is that the form of "work" is changing.

It seems that they manage the hours on days when school is in session and the hours on days when school is not in session. Since the school is a [[N-middle school]], it is also based on the premise that there are weekdays when there is no school ([[A New Form of Education]]).
