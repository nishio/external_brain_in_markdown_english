- C problem (878), which is more difficult than the previous E problem (734).

- I didn't think it was that difficult, so after submitting the C, I started solving the D without checking the results.
- D is "clearly recognizable as TLE even at hand".
- With 2 minutes left, I looked at my browser and said, "It's obviously a TLE, but I'll submit it," and then C timed out, and I was out.
