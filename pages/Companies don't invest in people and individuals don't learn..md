<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>In this series of tweets, we analyze the reasons why Japanese companies and individuals are reluctant to invest in human resources, based on the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry's "Future Human Resources Vision" document. The main points are as follows

    - Because of [[layoff restrictions]], companies assume [[long-term employment]] and try to [[make workers multi-skilled]] through [[personnel change]]. As a result, [[expertise]] becomes low, and [[willingness to learn]] of individuals declines.
    - The [[seniority by length of service]] pay system is the predominant system, with pay increasing as one ages. To support this system, multi-skilling and personnel transfers are in place.
- The relatively low [[educational background]] of Japanese corporate executives may be a result of this structure.
- The "Vision for Future Talent" document does not directly address the issue of termination regulations, presumably because these regulations are under the jurisdiction of the [[Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare]].
- The separate jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) makes it difficult to integrate strategies and to formulate effective policies.

These observations suggest that the challenges of Japan's employment system and human resource development are complicated by the division of jurisdiction among ministries and agencies. Dismissal regulations and a seniority-based salary system may be hindering companies and individuals from investing in human resources. It could be argued that stronger inter-ministerial coordination and a review of the employment system are needed.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1544500306914181120) Ah, because of the living wage philosophy behind the Japanese salary system, they want the salary to increase as you get older, and to support this, there is a multi-skilled workforce and personnel transfers are the backstop for that.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1544605876472131584) I sniffed out the issue of firing restrictions from the Future Talent Vision document and charted it out, but it's not in the document.
