quaternion

You may have solved problems in high school that were difficult to solve in two-dimensional vector space by bringing the problem into the complex plane and using the fact that multiplication is a rotation. In the same way that a rotation in two-dimensional space can be expressed by multiplying complex numbers, a rotation in three-dimensional space can be expressed by multiplying quaternions.

Quaternions (quaternions) are a mathematical technique for representing rotations in three-dimensional space. This is similar to the idea of expressing a rotation in two-dimensional space by multiplying complex numbers.

- Quaternions are a powerful tool for representing rotations in three-dimensional space. However, their understanding and application are not emphasized much in general education. This may be because the concept of quaternions is abstract and difficult to understand intuitively. However, understanding and applying quaternions can help solve problems in 3-D space more efficiently.
- Vectors and Complex Numbers Parable]" share the common concept of expressing a rotation in two-dimensional space as a multiplication of complex numbers.
