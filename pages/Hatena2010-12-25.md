I finally cleared a single train of PokÃ©mon! Here are my notes

>||
Cases in which the player is first (lack of speed, but excluding Neko deception, Mimiri, and Mamoru)
Rush of the whitetail deer
Moggrew's first nail in the coffin.
Siki deer spoiled
Milhog's Hypnosis.

Cases in which the patient could not be defeated with a single blow (lack of attack)
dangoro
Tesside+.
Krumayu++
Zurg++.
very short roughly woven mat of fried rice leaves (esp. used as an offering to the gods)
comatana
tabunneh
OBEM
||<
As for attack, I don't think loading effort into attack will solve the problem, because in some cases almost half of it remains.
