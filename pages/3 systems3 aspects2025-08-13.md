3 systems 2025-08-13
- side of well
    - It would be interesting to move on to language independence.
        - [[Language-independent deliberations]]
    - There is a need among global companies to "allow different language speakers to participate."
        - A good transit point for [[global deliberations]].
    - It's an easy problem set up to understand that participants with different native languages are having trouble with the discussion.
    - It would be interesting as dogfooding if we could have a productive discussion about Plurality with non-Japanese speakers.
- Polis
    - Do you want to do an internal Polis?
        - Knowing where you stand" is a good user value language
        - We can build it.
        - Should Polis be anonymous?
        - The problem of low participation is not interesting.
    - clean copy
        - We can set up a Polis server in the company so that we can write about internal matters without hesitation (I experimented with this in the lab before).
        - It is not interesting to use in a lab of 10 people because it is not interesting without a large number of people, and likewise it is not interesting in a small department
        - The good thing about Idobata is that even 10 people are interesting in their own way.
        - I feel that Polis' comment "I know where I stand" suggests a user value that Idobaba is not able to provide today.
        - I have a feeling that a company-wide event to "gather anonymous votes across departments" and "understand one's position in the distribution of opinions across the company" would provide some interesting insights.
- public information AI
    - Shall we v3 the in-house instance?
        - The benefits of doing that right now are subtle.
        - Better to do it, but my time is also finite.
    - Can't we make it easy to update when the original is UPDATED?
        - If we can make that work, the system's talisman will leave our hands, and we can pivot to promoting utilization.
    - Make Iodobata extracts eligible for Polis ballot?


Three Aspects of Me
- Team Mirai Supporters
    - I would like to summarize the results of the social experiments conducted by Team Mirai and make a Note
        - There are two elements in this.
            - Talk about the whole PR thing.
                - Improved hierarchical display, more room for improvement.
                - Maybe include a pie chart?
                - Now, after [[Agglomerative Clustering]], the number of clusters is cut off at the threshold of a predetermined number of clusters to display two levels.
                    - So if you think about it, there is no need to pre-determine the number of clusters.
            - A story about one PR's comment section that grew very long.
                    - [[What happened with the "new section on Advancing the Human Rights Situation?"]]
                    - [[Polis of the discussion in Mr. Hoshi's PR]]
    - We don't need to close it to supporters, we want to make it open data so others can experiment with it.
- Digital Democracy 2030
    - Improvement of Wide Hearing AI
    - Toward a system that facilitates the addition of experimental features
- Cybozu
    - In-house application of Idobata, etc.
    - Planting the Seeds of Plurality in the Context of "Private Enterprise"
