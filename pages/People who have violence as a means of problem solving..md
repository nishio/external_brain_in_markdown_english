> [creamsoooooooda](https://x.com/creamsoooooooda/status/1917189089864089663) I see from the quote that there are quite a few comrades and surprisingly everyone is aware of it. I'm rather sorry for being a guy, so don't thank me~.

> [vuodenaika](https://x.com/vuodenaika/status/1917873620434690160) When I encountered a loud cursing man on the Ginza Line who was involved with only women, the older brother who was caught in the sling next to me gently said, "You're scared, don't worry. I know you are scared, don't worry.
>  Immediately afterwards, the older brother changed and said, "Don't be so aggressive with those who are weaker than you, hey, hey, hey! Do the same thing to me! and rushed at the annoying man!
> [vuodenaika](https://x.com/vuodenaika/status/1917874257503392133) Don't run away, orah! After a few moments of gunning it down, he dragged the guy to the next station, and the brother got off the train.
>  Thank you so much!
>  Thank you to the post owner for the opportunity to thank you, Daddy and the other men!

>  He uses his attitude based on his partner and exercises "[[intimidation]]" and "[[violence]]" by calculating that he will be popular with women. This type does not hesitate to use violence against women if they deem it "effective" and dominates them with the fear that they may be "violent".
> [Kanegae_Keiji](https://x.com/Kanegae_Keiji/status/1918244920143561129) Just as a yakuza does not use violence directly against an opponent, but hits his subordinate in the head with an ashtray in front of him and threatens him, it is the same as saying that "violence" is a means of solving problems. It shows that "violence" is a way to solve problems.
>  When you "mingle" with them, they imprint on you and enslave you, without you even realizing it, that they are afraid of you if you make them angry.
> [Kanegae_Keiji](https://x.com/Kanegae_Keiji/status/1918253481330352301) One point in this post is the "leopard change", no normal person can instantly switch between a friendly and aggressive attitude like this! [Kanegae_Keiji
>  Those who can do this can do the same thing to their "lover". They say "snapped" or whatever, but it's calculated.
