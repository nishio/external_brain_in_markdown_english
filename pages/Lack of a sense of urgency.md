title: "Lack of a sense of urgency"
---

- The phrase "[[lack of]] sense of danger" for [[unspecified large number (of people)]] means "the level of sense of danger that an unspecified number of people have is low compared to the level of danger that I consider appropriate."
- After all, people who cannot [[verbalize]] their [[vague]] sense of "crisis" as an easy-to-understand "[[threat]]" are frustrated that people do not [[empathize]] with their sense of crisis without explanation.

What should I do?
- After all, isn't it [[flood of tsunamis]] after all?

Even if the masses have a sense of crisis, don't most of them have a vague sense of crisis anyway, like "the heavens may fall" ([[absurd fear]])?

What will change and how do we need to prepare?
- You're having difficulty explaining that.
- There is a complex interconnected system with one thickened edge.
    - This change affects a wide range of areas, and its effects have new impacts.
    - It's hard to explain that in words.
    - The better your ability to emulate the system, the more you can read ahead.
    - I'm not confident that I'm making the right decision.
        - So, "it would be detrimental to teach the consequences of your judgment to someone who is incapable of making that judgment, because if it doesn't work out, they'll blame you."
                - Same as [[investment decision]].
    - The world interpretation itself transmits
        - Because the principle of information gathering to the sender makes the transmission useful.
        - Multiple perspectives lead to a better understanding of the world
        - What actions are taken based on that understanding of the world are not transmitted.
            - Because it is harmful when people imitate without thinking.
