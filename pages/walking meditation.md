    - [[meditation]] There's an assumption that you're supposed to sit with the word "meditation.
- I think this is because of the famous meditation called zazen, and I think it's being dragged down.
- But there are a few religions that incorporate walking into their meditations.
    - It is called a sutra line (kinhin). [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/経行](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/経行)
- Walking is also a rhythmic exercise of the muscles, which stimulates serotonin secretion and helps maintain a meditative state
