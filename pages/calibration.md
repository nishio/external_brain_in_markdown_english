- lexical definition
    - > When machines handle physical quantities such as weights and measures, electricity, light, and position, deviations may occur between the quantities indicated to the machine and the quantities actually handled due to manufacturing errors, individual differences among devices, effects of their own operation or external loads (e.g., position shifts due to vibration), and deterioration over time.
    - >  In order to keep this deviation within a certain range, processes such as measuring the deviation from the standard, adjusting the internal state of the device, and correcting the input/output values in a direction that cancels out the deviation are performed. Such adjustments and operations are called calibration.

- In conversations between Nishio and [[Tomoya Tachikawa]], this process came to be referred to as "calibration.
- People who see and hear the same things on a regular basis are not appropriate calibration targets because their cognition is likely to be distorted in the same direction
    - Do we need to have "friends at a distance" who are not colleagues, etc.?
- It would be easier to calibrate if a tool like a tuning fork that produces a certain frequency used for tuning a piano also existed for tuning "human cognition" and "human thought patterns," but so far, I don't think we have anything to that extent yet.
    - Programming is a dialogue with a non-human "device that constantly takes on certain thought patterns," so people who spend a lot of time programming may be less likely to distort their thinking
        - [[Listening Chat System]] could evolve into a calibration tool.

    - To replay the behavior of a system that is behaving differently from one's natural reasoning to one's inner self by interspersing layers of abstraction.
