from [/villagepump/It's not good for a technician to leave things alone even if you feel uncomfortable](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/It's not good for a technician to leave things alone even if you feel uncomfortable).
- Thinking about it, the system and UserScript that I use on a daily basis.[[uncomfortable feeling]] のある挙動や面倒な操作があっても、そのまま放置してしまう傾向がある<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I think this is a very bad trend for an [[engineer]].
            - [[Ignore noticing]] because it means you're going to do it.
        - I'd like to at least leave a note.
    - I guess it depends on how much room you usually have.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/issac/icon' alt='/villagepump/issac.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - The ability to focus on "activities that are useful to everyone but do not bring direct financial rewards.
        - I think it's natural to say, "I prioritize what I do in my job and in my life, and as a result, I leave the bugs unchecked."
            - While people live, they die
            - You're absolutely right.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/takker/icon' alt='takker.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - 気づいたうえで何を[[無視]]するか論理的に [[judgment]] できると強そう<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - The worst is that you don't notice.
            - [[It's good to notice.]]
        - Trying to deal with everything you notice is overkill.
        - Good summary<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/takker/icon' alt='takker.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/takker/icon' alt='takker.icon' height="19.5"/>.
            - We don't have time to deal with everything we notice.
            - I don't think it needs to be "[[logically]] to."
                - I think it's okay to [[Discrimination by Feeling]] at first.
                - Then, when I look back and think about it, I can verbalize, "I see, this [[selection]] comes about because I feel that I have value in
                        - [[Values are verbalized after the fact.]]
                - It's not verbalized from the beginning, so you can't make a logical selection from the beginning.
        - I'll link to it as I see fit, and if there's room when it comes up, we'll do it.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/yuyasurarin/icon' alt='/villagepump/yuyasurarin.icon' height="19.5"/>
