The term is often translated into English as "[[god]]," but this doesn't fully capture the nuances of "Kami." In Shinto, Kami are not omnipotent beings that exist outside the world, as gods are often understood in many Western religions. Instead, they are a fundamental part of nature and the world itself.

In Japanese mythology, it is said that when sky and ground began, the gods also appeared. The specific creation of sky and ground is not described. Furthermore, these early gods are not worshipped. First the concept of the sun goddess, [[Amaterasu]], was formed before these gods, and then the concepts of the male god [[Izanagi]] and the female goddess [[Izanami]] were formed to explain the birth of the sun goddess. It is likely that these concepts of early gods were created as their ancestors.

Kami can refer to a wide range of entities or spirits, including natural phenomena like mountains, rivers, trees, and rocks, as well as ancestral spirits, and even certain exceptional human beings. Anything that is considered to have a spiritual essence or to inspire a sense of awe and reverence can be referred to as Kami.

In Shinto practices, people pay respect to Kami at shrines or in their homes with offerings and prayers, seeking their blessings and protection. Kami are seen as benevolent forces that can bring benefits like good health, prosperity, and success, but they can also be placated to avert potential misfortunes.

The belief in Kami is deeply ingrained in Japanese society and influences many aspects of daily life and cultural practices, from rituals and festivals to concepts of cleanliness and respect for nature. Understanding the concept of Kami can provide insight into the ways in which spirituality is integrated into everyday life in Japan.
