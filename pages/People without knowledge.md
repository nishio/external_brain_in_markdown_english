1:
- Mr. A says a lot of things to person B who knows less than he does.
    - 'B's who lack knowledge are inferior to me.'
    - You need to study up.

2:
- However, this could simply be that A only sees what he's good at.
        - [[Observation coverage issues]]
        - [[leader of a monkey's mountain (e.g., a gazelle)]] described it as "not looking outside the mountain"
        - [[Fog of Literacy]] then thought, "Maybe you can't see it in the first place."
            - [[parochial]] is the expression "I don't know," but I'm not trying to know or I can't know.
- Any claim that A makes against B for "less knowledge" in this situation is [[boomerang]].
    - However, because of A's narrow field of view, A cannot observe it
    - B may be observable
        - but in many cases, B is not willing to "teach" A because B perceives A as an "obnoxious person".
    - Also related to [Do it right" is a mid-core philosophy.
    - After all, acting on the basis of that against someone who appears to be "less knowledgeable" from your point of view is a streak of evil.
    - If they ask, I'll tell them, otherwise I'll be non-interventionist, which is good.
