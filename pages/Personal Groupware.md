- Information in an individual's head could only be "[[recollection]]" by that individual.
- By writing in groupware instead of keeping it in my head, others can [[search (e.g. for someone using a search engine)]] (i.e. "recall")
- But there are many hurdles to "writing in a place where everyone can see you.
    - Psychological hurdles
    - For example, copyrighted material that is OK for personal use but not to be shared by the company.
- Even individuals find it useful to write things down instead of keeping them in their heads, so they can search for them.
- I think it would be better to separate "[[write out]]" from "[[Share within your company]]".

We can achieve this by creating a private space in kintone without development, but I feel something is missing with that. What is it?
→ [[Personally owned groupware]]
