title: "(crime of) inflicting injury by choice"
---

Under the current Japanese criminal law, if you injure another person's body, you are guilty of injury.
It is a crime even if there was no intent to harm (negligent homicide).
This "injure" is used in a broad sense. Injury has been found by the courts to be inflicting mental breakdown by making harassing phone calls and infecting a person with a sexually transmitted disease.

By the way, humans live by recognizing and choosing [[options]]. Undermining this recognition of options is not a crime under the current law.
One person A could originally feel that there are options X and Y, but when person B says, "Of course it should be X, Y is impossible," the perception of the options is undermined. This is also not good.

Especially when older people say such things to younger people, and the naive young people believe them. Then, when [[search]] is supposed to be conducted by the younger generation, they act according to [[the values of the older generation]], and search is not conducted.

Specific Examples of Assault on Choice
- What's the point of a woman going to college?"
- 'Get into a big, stable company, not a venture.'
- Certain financial "don't do anything risky like buying stocks, save your money."
