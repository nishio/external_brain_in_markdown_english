[[Expressing "Ambiguity" as the Next Step]]
In the context of the [[SECI Model]]:
- Keichobot helps articulate subjective ambiguities, aiding in the externalization of tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge.
- Kozaneba assists in discovering connections and structures between written fragments, facilitating the linking of explicit knowledge.
    - Personally, I believe it also helps in understanding complex texts, aiding in the internalization of explicit knowledge.

Notes on unresolved issues due to time constraints:
- Is there a relationship between "living" and "thinking" in [[Building, Living, Thinking]] and the group formation processes of [[Mind Palace]], [[Clean Space]], and the KJ Method?
- Are the tools for [[Tools for Conviviality]] related to [[Groupware]] or the [[Metaverse]]?
    - → The term [[Conviviality]] should not be interpreted merely by its translated appearance.
- In the [[SECI Spiral]] of the [[Knowledge-Creating Company]], is the depiction of [[Socialization]] as an essential component of the spiral intentional, or is it a limitation of the diagram's expressive power?
    - It's good that there are means of socialization both with and without the use of words as a method of conveying felt sense.
    - There may be no basis for them occurring alternately.
