title: "information card"
---

A piece of paper for writing information.
In Japan, it often refers to the [[Kyoto University style card]] introduced by [[Tadao Umesao]] in [[The Art of Intellectual Production]] in 1969.
Tadao Umesao calls it [[Kyoto Oversize Card]].

Kyo large cards are B6 size (182mm x 128mm)
> Small cards are just a "memo" and can't be used in place of a full-fledged notebook.
- Technology of Intellectual Production p. 50
- In other words, it's implicitly supposed to be used as a replacement for a full-fledged notebook.
    - I assume you mean "a means of [[stocking]] information."
    - This was in 1969; now in 2018, it's "information stock should be electronic and searchable."
    - Related: [[Scrapbox is a notebook]].

The Art of Intellectual Production, p.56 # Granularity of information

In addition to these information cards, Umesao uses a B8 size paper called "[[small stature]]". This one is not stocked, but used and discarded.
> When the work is done, the kozane is no longer needed. Just roll it up and throw it away. (p.205)
