title: "What are you investing your time resources in?"

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1734064301256868186/quick_promote_web/intro) The phrase "[[use one's own money]]" has a narrowing of vision to [[the resource of cash]]. If you remove that bias, it becomes "[[invest the resources you own]]". In that sense, different people own different amounts [[cash is weighted differently by different people]]. [[Time of Life]] is more valuable because everyone only has it for a few decades.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1734065042105282771) Ah, but [[cash can be stored]], so the choice is "[[store or invest]]," whereas [[time cannot be stored]], so the choice is "[[what to invest]]. What to invest in?

- What are [[Time Resources]] being [[invested]] against?

- [[Cash is weak capital]]
