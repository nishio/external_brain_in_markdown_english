title: "Definition of Harassment"
---

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare's definition is titled "Definition of [[harassment]]," but it is a separate definition of power harassment and other forms of harassment, not harassment itself.
- > Power harassment in the workplace is (1) [[Words and actions based on a superior relationship]] that takes place in the workplace, (2) that goes beyond what is necessary and reasonable in the workplace, and (3) that harms the worker's working environment, and that satisfies all three elements from (1) to (3). The term "superior relationship" refers to a relationship that satisfies all three elements from (i) to (iii) above.

Osaka Medical College defines it this way
- > Speech or actions toward others that, regardless of the person's intentions, offend, injure the dignity of, disadvantage, or threaten the other person.
