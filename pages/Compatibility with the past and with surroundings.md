[ASCII.jp: Why did the Windows path separator become an inverted slash? ｜Windows Info](http://ascii.jp/elem/000/001/763/1763591/?fbclid=IwAR1U8vrYE1VFMMoQ5Lj4gtE16EIz3G6X-g8E4ZnewLG220LZce63Bw44zgs)
- There was a command in MS-DOS 1.1 that took parameters with a slash.
    - At that time, hierarchical file systems did not yet exist, so path separators were not necessary.
- Introducing the Hierarchical File System in MS-DOS 2.0
    - Unix already existed at that time, with slashes for path separators and hyphens for parameters
    - Backslash was adopted as a path separator rather than aligned with Unix, with the goal of keeping batch files written for MS-DOS 1.1 running.
