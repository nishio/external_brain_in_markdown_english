title: "Juvenile bonus"
---

After using the term "youth bonus" for some reason, I realized the definition was unclear, so I'll have o3 generate it.

The "youth bonus"-the growth potential of "[[disposable resources]]" that only young people have.
- Definition (Micro Perspective)
    - Surplus obtained during "a phase when there are still few dependents, health and time are abundant, and future income (human capital) is expanding toward its maximum value," such as the 20s and early 30s.
    - Specifically, (1) cash flow, (2) time, (3) risk tolerance, and (4) ability to learn and absorb are all approaching their peak, providing an opportunity to build long-term wealth and skills.

Where do they come from?
- disposable income
    - Still small mortgage, education and medical expenses
    - Income - Cost of Living = Investment Margin Easily Maximized
- human capital
    - Remaining work years are long and the wage curve is steadily rising
    - Skill investments compound well / long payback period in case of failure
- Health & Fitness
    - Low disease risk and high energy
    - Wide range of action options such as late night study, side jobs, moving abroad, etc.
- Time Discount Rate
    - Greater degree of wait for the future
    - Can bear the risk of long-term investment (stocks and self-improvement)
- family structure
    - Zero to few dependents
    - Households have small fixed expenditures and are quick to make decisions

Social capital = "reusable resources generated by a loose network of trust between people.
Young age is the best time to maximize (1) contact points, (2) action radius, and (3) number of attempts to create a "[[compound interest]] network" that will work for years to come.

Specific "Social Capital Investment Portfolio"
    - [[weak ties]] (Weak Ties) Expand your pockets.
    - Mass production of one light co-creation + online continuity, including Tech meetups/OSS contributions/conference LTs, etc.
    - "Turn small tasks together" rather than exchanging business cards → Demonstration of trust remains.
- [[Reputation Capital]] = Public Output Account
    - Publish thoughts and results on blogs, X, Scrapbox, and GitHub
    - Create a situation in which "results are in the search" and reduce the cost of approaching the other side.
- Early issuance of [mentor bonds
    - Receive advice from elders and professionals in different fields and return with results (Give -> Get)
    - Mentor => Probability of becoming a future recommender/co-founder/VC referral
        - Not much here.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- [[Co-Creation Community]] = Long-Term Accumulation
    - Host a study group/start a translation project and become a "[[hub]] of the place".
    - The longer it operates, the more information and human resources accumulate on its own.

(I feel like they are really watching my activities.

Typical pitfalls
- Quantity ≒ Number of business cards principle
    - 1,000 business cards <5 people who created something together
- Closed peer clusters
    - Information and opportunities are gradually decreasing as we close in on our age group and industry.
- lack of give-back
        - When [[retro-return policy]] expires, [[credit score]] plummets
- self-branding fatigue
    - Output Objectification → Burnout → Unable to continue
    - "Smaller and smaller, then polish it." Putting it into the flow.

The social capital bonus for young adults is,
The compound interest operation of "[[Diverse venues]] × [[Small-scale co-creation]] × [[Continuous Give]]" can maximize the effect.
"[[Achievements found in searches]]" and "[[history of help]]" if they are built up in an unobtrusive manner,
Future work, study, and life options will expand exponentially.
