> [@44gi](https://twitter.com/44gi/status/1655611206030487552?s=20): #BBOX2023 Spring Shogakukan GOOD GAMES new "Zero One Birth". A two-player fisticuffs battle in which players take turns choosing which of the "commando droids," which are executed in programmatic order, to be their allies. The game features abilities that strengthen other droids and increase the number of additional allies, and it is a great feeling when you get into the game and get them on your side in the right order.

It's a lot of fun to think about, and it's also very exciting because of the movement. I need a good brain. Directed by Noriaki Watanabe of Drossel Myers. #BBOX2023 Spring
