I've heard some concerns about the term "[[Blue Ocean]]" being used in a crude way, as if it were "something new with no competition," so I thought I'd pick up on the material since I'll probably have to write or talk about it eventually.

Value Innovation is the foundation of the Blue Ocean Strategy, which simultaneously engages in [[Cost Reduction]] and [[differentiation]].
Reduce costs by reducing or eliminating features that are taken for granted in existing products, and instead increase or add features that are not yet taken for granted.

See [[Strategy Canvas]] as a prerequisite for this
