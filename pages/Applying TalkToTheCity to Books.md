title: "Applying TalkToTheCity to Books"
---

I did it once.
    - [[Visualize the contents of the Plurality book with Talk to the City]]

It was not very useful at the time, but it might be useful in combination with [[Deep Cluster Extraction]].

I think it would be a good idea to use intellectual production techniques for engines, technology to support coding, and then pro-raditibon math tags.
Those three documents are placed on the page, and you can choose individual books to delve into, or you can use a mixture of them.
The sentences that follow have a fishing-like structure. This is like a chapter, a heading, and a rundown, and in that sense it is ultimately a single sentence.
I would like to do a visualization of the hierarchy in a different, non-hierarchical way of clustering.
