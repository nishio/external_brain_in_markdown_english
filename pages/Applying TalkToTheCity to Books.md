I did it once.
    - [[Visualize the contents of the Plurality book with Talk to the City]]

It was not very useful at the time, but it might be useful in combination with [[Deep Cluster Extraction]].

I would suggest using three books: "The Engineer's Guide to Intellectual Production," "The Technology Behind Coding," and the Plurality book.
Those three documents are placed on the page, and you can choose individual books to delve into, or you can use a mixture of them.
The sentences that follow are structured in a tree-like structure. This is like a chapter, a heading, and a rundown, and in that sense it will eventually become a sentence.
I would like to do a visualization of the hierarchy in a different, non-hierarchical way of clustering.

When I wrote this, I didn't discriminate between [[networks between books and networks within books]].
