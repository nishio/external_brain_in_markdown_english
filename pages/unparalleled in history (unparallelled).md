For example, [[dragon tree (Dracaena draco)]] argues that the work and the author are mutually [[origin]] related, and that the two should not be considered as entities in a mutually auspicious relationship. ([[works of art contemplated by the gods]])

In [[From Wittgenstein to Ryuju]], [[Hiroshi Kurosaki]] states that the two are "semantically interpenetrated" as in "if there is no house, there is no roof, and if there is no roof, there is no house" and that this is the state [[of mutual auspiciousness]].
- He then concludes that [[Late Wittgenstein's]] ideas are valid. (p.84)
Ryuki himself used the analogy of "firewood and fire," and indeed it would have been nonsense (at the time) to think of a state where only fire existed without firewood. ([[Burnable goods]])
- But firewood without fire exists, and in modern times we have lighter fires, etc.
