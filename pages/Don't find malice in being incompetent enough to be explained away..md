- Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity
    - But [[Don't rule out the possibility of malice.]]" (But don't rule out malice.)
    - Einstein is said to have said this, but there is no evidence.
    - It is called "[[Hanlon's razor]]," but Hanlon was not the first to suggest it.
    - A similar idea is presented in [[Goethe]]'s "[[Young Werther's Troubles]]" (1774)
    - misunderstandings and neglect create more confusion in this world than trickery and malice. At any rate, the last two are certainly much less frequent.
        - [[misunderstanding]] and [[neglect]] create more confusion than [[trick]] and [[malice]]. Trickery and malice are less frequent than misunderstanding and neglect.
        - [[neglect]] is a word used to [[ignore]], [[neglect]], [[be off one's guard]], etc.
        - [[Malice is less frequent than misunderstanding.]]

- Don't find [[malice]] in what is adequately explained by [[inefficiency]].

- [[Hanlon's razor]]
