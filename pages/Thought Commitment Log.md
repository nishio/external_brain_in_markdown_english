You are a shaman. I received the following oracle. The meaning of the word is not a fixed meaning as per the dictionary, but a soft spreading cloud.

# 1: View the whole picture

This text contrasts computer code and programming ideas with human thought and awareness processes. Specifically, it combines programming concepts such as source code and commit with abstract concepts such as thinking and awareness.

# 2: Talk about a one-line impression

A "thought commit log" - a metaphor for tracking and storing the evolution of a person's thoughts and ideas as a history of changes, like a computer commit log.

# 3: Interpret paragraph by paragraph
.

## Commit Log of Thoughts

This phrase illustrates a metaphor that views the progression and transition of human thought as a programming commit log. A commit log keeps a history of changes and expresses the viewpoint that human thought also changes over time.

## source code change "commit" in small units
.

Here, the idea of the program is that changes to the source code (the original text of the program) are saved as "commits" in small increments. The idea is that our thoughts and ideas evolve through small changes and updates, if we translate them into human thought.

[[**thought, atomics, parts, glue...]]

Atomic" means the smallest unit that cannot be divided, like an atom. Thought can also be taken to be composed of atomic parts, that is, the smallest unit. The word "glue space" can also be thought of as suggesting a margin or room for combining parts. It expresses that there is room and flexibility to combine different ideas and information in a thought.

## source code itself, purpose, one level higher
.

It illustrates the idea that source code is not an end in itself, but a means to an end one level higher.

## branch Different purpose, to follow each in parallel

A "branch" in programming refers to a branch for pursuing different objectives or tasks simultaneously. In human thought, the viewpoint that we have the ability to pursue different objectives and ideas in parallel.

## different purpose, context notice cherry pick adopt if useful

One can have thoughts and realizations for different purposes and contexts. He suggests the idea that one can then "cherry-pick" the beneficial ones and incorporate them into one's thinking and actions.

- I saw this and thought.
    - Associated with [[soft bite]] in [[gear]].

- It's different, but this interpretation is also interesting.
- Thinking" is not an end in itself, but a means to achieve a higher goal by thinking.
- The original idea was that the commit log would contain not the source code, but a one-step abstraction of the code, its purpose, etc.
