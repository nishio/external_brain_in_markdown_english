# 1. "[[DeepSeek]]" and [[security risk]]

- Chinese generative AI "DeepSeek"
    - It is said that even so-called "out-of-production GPUs" can achieve high performance.
    - Low development cost and potential for large scale diffusion, especially to [[Africa]] and [[Global South]].
- Impact on personal information handling/control infrastructure.
    - If the server is located in China, the Chinese government may be able to access the data, which is a major concern from a security and [[cognitive warfare]] perspective.
    - A scenario in which [[control systems]] such as railroads and power plants are replaced by products of Chinese origin is a major security concern.
- Different AI policies in different countries.
    - Some regions, such as the EU, are aiming for regulation first, while the U.S. and U.K. are proceeding somewhat more gradually.
    - France is also aiming to become a hub for AI research and attracting nuclear-based [* data centers with inexpensive electricity.
- Japanese response.
        - The [[Privacy Committee]] ([[aboriginal position]]) is a [[Sanjo Committee]] (a body independent of the government) and is difficult to direct.
        - However, the government is expected to move quickly to issue guidelines, including a warning.
    - While too much unilateral tightening of domestic regulations could delay the start of foreign competition, we cannot afford to leave security risks unchecked.
    - It is important to take a policy approach that shifts the emphasis from "[[AI Safety]]" (safety) to "[[AI Security]]" ([[security guarantee (e.g. military security, network security, etc.)]]).
    - Strengthening of countermeasures through international cooperation is needed.


# 2. [[Automatic Operation]] and [[Special National Strategy Zone]]

- Automated driving is a leading example.
    - The first large-scale popularization of AI with "substance" is likely to be self-driving car (robo-taxi).
- Leading U.S. and Chinese firms.
    - In the U.S., Google ([[Waymo]]) and [[Tesla]] are leading the way, and Chinese startups are emerging.
    - AI + IoT is collecting a large amount of driving data to increase competitiveness.
- Implementation in Japan.
    - The use of national strategic special zones to test automated driving at the municipal level is accelerating.
    - Since accumulation of large-scale data is key, early social implementation is essential.
- Robot OS contention.
    - The key is a common OS that can run across fields such as humanoids and warehouse robots.
    - There is a fear that the companies holding the software layer will monopolize the profits, and open source development originating in Japan will attract attention.


# 3. Policymaking and the [[Lawmaker Community]]

- Importance of Lawmakers (politicians) having a community.
    - AI is evolving quickly, and routine bureaucratic tasks and university councils alone tend to lag behind in responding.
    - It is critically important to build a network of engineers and experts from normal times, and to have a system that can immediately grasp "what is happening now.
- [[Three-tier administrative structure]] (municipalities, prefectures, and the national government)
    - The design from the era of analog assumptions still remains.
    - With the current proliferation of ICT and AI, there is an awareness of the need to reconsider this layered structure.
- number of municipalities decreased.
    - The number of municipalities has decreased significantly due to municipal mergers.
    - Furthermore, while there is potential to simplify the administrative organization, the issue is how to ensure a sense of distance from residents and responsibility.


# 4. Japan's 5000 Businesses and AI Applications
.

- [[Administrative Business Review]]
    - An attempt to have AI read as many as 5,000 projects by the Japanese government.
    - Utilized to improve fiscal soundness by taking a cross-sectional view of projects and identifying those with low outcome ratings.
    - However, the fundamental principle of democracy that elected officials should be responsible for final decision-making and accountability will be retained.


# 5. How to deal with robots
.

- Culture of empathy for robots.
    - Japan is said to be more likely to accept robots and AI as "friends" or "lovers.
    - Many Osamu Tezuka and science fiction works also depict coexistence with humans.
- Risk of "over-regulation" due to infatuation.
    - Be careful not to create extreme regulations that give "human rights" to robots.
    - Robots and AI are only tools, and rules must be developed as needed.

# 2. Open Source Strategy and Implications for Japan
.
- U.S. major vs. China vs. meta movement.
    - There is a polarization between the camps that continue closed development, such as OpenAI and Google, and those like Meta and Chinese companies a movement to open up models and bring in the development community.
- Japanese opportunity.
    - It is tough for Japan, where huge investment is difficult, to be on the same playing field as the U.S. and China with large-scale models. However, it can differentiate itself by utilizing distillation technology for small models and open source. The policy of creating practical AI while keeping costs low offers an opportunity for Japan to once again make its presence felt.


# 4. AI support for policy and democracy and responsibility
.
- Utilizing Broad Listening
    - Methods to support policy making by aggregating and visualizing a large amount of citizen opinions with AI of SNS and questionnaires are beginning to advance. The advantage of being able to pick up the voices of the younger generation is particularly significant.
- Final decision must be made by a human being.
    - The optimal solution proposed by AI often does not involve "[[political responsibility]]" or "[[moral judgment]]". In a democratic society, it is essential to have a system in which elected officials are ultimately responsible for decision-making.
