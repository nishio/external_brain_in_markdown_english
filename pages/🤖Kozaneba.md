### Digest of Research Notes
.

Kozaneba is digital stationery that supports deeper understanding and new insights through visualization. Ideally, it should be able to move freely between temporal and contextual schemes, and a concrete example of this is how Keichobot connects pairs of question and answer keywords with edges. It is also important to detect bad conversations and offer advice on how to make them better.

### Insights from fragments
.

In "Kozaneba+Scrapbox," it is proposed to use Kozaneba to organize cards in Scrapbox. This is part of an effort to increase Scrapbox's affinity with Kozaneba. The idea is that Scrapbox is the infrastructure, and Kozaneba can be used as an overlay to it.

In "Mapping Scrapbox Rows to Kozaneba's Kozane," it is proposed to map Scrapbox rows to Kozaneba's Kozane. This is the idea that Scrapbox rows placed in close proximity correspond to Kozane placed in close proximity.

In "Organizing Scrapbox Links with Kozaneba," an attempt is reported to visualize and organize the graph of mention relationships between pages in Scrapbox with Kozaneba. However, this is the opposite of the KJ method, where there are too many links to see the whole picture, so it is discussed that assistance in cutting links is needed.

### Considerations and questions

These fragments suggest that the combination of Kozaneba and Scrapbox is effective. However, the specifics of how and why this works are not yet clear: How should the mapping between Scrapbox rows and Kozaneba's Kozane be done? And what assistance is needed in organizing Scrapbox links in Kozaneba? Further research is needed on these questions.

### Digest of research notes
.

Ideally, the temporal and contextual schemes should be able to move back and forth freely, and a concrete example of this is how to connect pairs of question and answer keywords in Keichobot with edges. It is also important to detect bad conversations and offer advice on how to make them better. In addition, through the "line" function attached to Kozaneba, the timing of the addition of stickies with their position on the time axis can be adjusted so that the transformation into a contextual scheme that involves the destruction of existing structures can be performed with confidence.

As digital stationery, Kozaneba uses cards to aid understanding and assist the Keichobot contextualization and KJ method process. It is possible to deepen understanding and gain new insights through visualization. Also, by adding a Scrapbox-like recall effect to Kozaneba, it solves the problem of adding more and more Kozane to the field, which can become heavy.

### Relation to Fragment
.

The fragments "I would like to consider explaining the functionality of making a map of Regroup from chat logs" and "Conversation log 2020-06-07-4" are related to the extraction of information from chat logs and its visualization. These have relevance to Kozaneba's functionality and could help to concretize an ideal way to move between temporal and contextual schemes.

I want to organize the context of Keichobot (with sub commentary)" and "Forcing Keichobot to organize tasks" are related to contextual organization and task management in Keichobot, and these also have relevance to Kozaneba. These fragments can be used as a reference for improving Kozaneba's functionality and adding new features.

        - Each sticky has an implicit "position on the time axis" depending on when the sticky is added to Kozaneba
            - This corresponds to the one-dimensional structure of the engraved original text and the timeline of the chat
            - It is necessary to change this to a topic-oriented contextual scheme, which implicitly involves "[[the]] destruction of existing structures

Kozaneba is a digital stationery tool that uses information cards to aid in the comprehension of compositions and books, and to support Keichobot's contextualization and KJ method processes. Questions are raised about the potential for deeper understanding and new insights through visualization, and about Kozaneba's role as a temporary tool and when it will end.

The fragments "KJ Study Group Reflection Study Group" and "Organizing in reverse chronological order" relate to the development of Kozaneba and its use as a tool to electronically support the KJ process." "Kozaneba and the Quest for 'Neri Neri'" and "Kozaneba: A Flexible Information Organizing Tool" relate to Kozaneba's flexibility and visualization of information." The "Nishio's own style gets a name" relates to how Kozaneba's developers describe their methodology." "Connecting my Scrapbox to ChatGPT" and "Connecting my Scrapbox to ChatGPT story study group" demonstrate the relevance of Kozaneba and Keichobot.

The fragments "Add a Scrapbox-like recall effect to Kozaneba" and "Adding more and more kozane to one place in Kozaneba is getting too heavy, so I want to separate them" are related to improving Kozaneba's functionality. "Drawing lines" discusses a new feature of Kozaneba and its impact on users. "Organizing the Time Line in Reverse Order" discusses the relationship between Kozaneba and the KJ method and its importance in creating stories." What is the relationship between the KJ method and Kozaneba?" and "What is the relationship between Kozaneba and Keichobot?" describes the relationship and role of each tool." Diary 2022-02-23" documents personal reflections on stacking the parts of intellectual production and using Kozaneba." Good to know where Kozaneba is going next" offers some reflections on the direction of Kozaneba's development.

Fragment "Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning" Study Group 2 considers whether Kozaneba is a tool that is both time-oriented and topic-oriented, and whether it is ideal to be able to move freely between temporal and contextual schemes. And in "Tools to Assist in Understanding Difficult Books," we consider Kozaneba's potential as a tool to assist in understanding difficult books." In "Kozaneba2022-08-19," Keichobot's question-answer keyword pairs are connected by edges to form "What is A?" "B," "What is B?" C," and "What's C?" to detect bad conversations and provide advice on how to make them better. This leads to the "line" function that the KJ method had on Kozaneba through ExploreNet, and we believe it will lead to Keichobot through ExploreNet in the same way. This may be a clue to the [[Fusion of Keichobot and Kozaneba]] that has been an issue all along.

Kozaneba is a digital stationery device that electronically supports the process of organizing your mind as you move information fragments around. It is like a bamboo scaffold that is no longer needed once the tower has been built, and the development of Kozaneba explores its potential as a tool to assist in writing compositions using information cards and in understanding difficult books. However, there are several issues that need to be addressed, including the problem of heaviness as the volume of the book increases and the problem of group disappearance under high load.

Kozaneba is also used to organize the context of Keichobot, a chatbot that listens to you and can organize its context using Kozaneba.

In addition, Kozaneba is used as an electronic aid to the KJ method process, a technique for visualizing and organizing information, which can be replicated using Kozaneba.

The development of Kozaneba has been plagued with several problems, including a lack of test code and the complexity of the flow for new users to begin using it. To solve these problems, Kozaneba is being rebuilt with robust testing.

### Deep thoughts and questions

The importance of test code is emphasized in the development of Kozaneba. However, writing test code is not always the best approach. What problems arise when there is no test code? And what advantages can be gained by writing test code?

Kozaneba is developed as a tool for visualizing and organizing information. But does visualizing information really enhance understanding? Can visualization not only help us understand information, but also elicit new insights?
