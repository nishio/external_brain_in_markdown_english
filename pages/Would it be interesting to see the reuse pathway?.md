    - Since the fragments will go into multiple projects, it will be interesting to see the phylogenetic tree as the fragments evolve within each project."
        - On my end, I'm thinking of adding permalinks to individual stickies and displaying detailed information about them.
            - I was imagining only "which maps are used" as [[More Information]].
        - Maybe it would be interesting to see how they interacted with other stickies over time.
            - Sticky note placed on the side
            - What group they put me in.
