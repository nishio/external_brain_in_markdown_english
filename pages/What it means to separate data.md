title: "What it means to separate data"
---

    - Why separate data in [[machine learning]]?
    - Specific Practices
        - 10% of the total data is separated as "data not at hand" and the model is trained on the remaining 90% of the data. The performance of the model is measured by the percentage of correct answers that are obtained with the remaining 10% of the data.

- If you do it as a manner without knowing the reason, you feel like you don't have to do it.
- Perhaps it would be better to teach them to think in terms of what they want to achieve, rather than "this is the way it should be done as a matter of etiquette.
- What we want to achieve is good performance for "data not at hand".
- I can't know if it will perform well for "data I don't have at hand" because I don't have the data at hand.
- So we take some of the data and say, "Let's pretend that this is data that we don't have on hand now and that we will have in the future.
- Since you chose to "not have it on hand," of course you couldn't possibly use it during the study.
- You can physically use it, but if you understand the premise that "this is supposed to be data that you don't have on hand," you'll know you can't use it.
