title: "How would you like to see the constraints change?"
---

It's one thing to talk about how to achieve an objective under the current [[constraints]] and another to talk about how the constraints should change.

Those whose goal is to change the constraints sometimes try to visualize the "absurdity of not achieving the objective" by taking actions that do not achieve the objective under the current constraints. This appears to be irrational behavior to those who believe that achieving the objective under the constraints is the right thing to do. This is a discrepancy between the viewpoints of those who change the constraints and those who do not.
