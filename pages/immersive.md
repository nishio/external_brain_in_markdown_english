It is very interesting and I hope you will read the original text, even if it is machine-translated, but especially the four questions it poses in considering the definition are very helpful. →.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The term "immersive" is used to refer to [[immersive]] experiences, but it seems to be overused as a marketing [[buzzword]] these days.
According to this article, to determine if an experience is truly "immersive," you need to consider the following four questions

- Where are the major actions taking place in that work?
- Is the audience in the same space as the main action?
- How does the audience become part of that world, physically or narratively?
- If the three questions above are answered in the affirmative, is there a meaningful relationship between the audience and the main action?

In other words, in a true "immersive" experience, the audience is in the same space as the main action or story, and there is no typical boundary between audience and performer. In addition, the audience's presence itself should have meaning and impact on the experience.
The author of this article argues that this audience/action relationship should be the foundation for creating an "immersive" experience and must be carefully designed from the very beginning of the project. Simply adding "immersive" elements to an existing traditional stage play will not have the same effect.
In short, the article provides a useful framework for both creators and audiences to critically examine experiences labeled "immersive" and understand if the term is meaningful rather than just [[empty marketing term]]. The questions posed in the article will help set appropriate expectations and move the [[immersive entertainment]] genre substantially forward.
