- Today's ceiling
    - Based on the experience of [PC work in the park Day1
    - I brought a [[Table cushion that can be held on the lap]] in a large [[Ortlieb 30L]] instead of my usual [[Ortlieb 24L]].
        - But if you sit on a different bench than you did last time, that's not particularly problematic.
        - As I said, it's bulky to bring this, so if you have a bench you don't need, that's better.
        - But after working on it for a while and unconsciously trying to cross my knees, I decided to use it.
        - I was worried that the last bench was going to slide off instantly, this bench is not, but it's still better to have it.
    - I brought [[MUJI Makeup Box Small]] for easy removal of XReal One.
- Today's high temperature is 28 degrees Celsius.
    - Last time it was chilly, so I brought a long-sleeved shirt.
        - Montbell's for mountaineering.
        - But I don't think it's necessary.
        - Breezy and cool, feels hot when it stops.
- I bought insect repellent.
    - If I bring the one I have at home, my wife will have a problem when she goes out.
    - Insect repellent after arriving at your destination.
        - When I spray at home, I think it's a waste of time to spray in the air because it doesn't hit my body.
        - When sprayed after arriving at the site, the sprayed items are also safe to use as they have the effect of "stopping insects from coming to that area".

12:40 Internet connection lost
- Add 1GB for 1100 yen
    - I'm consuming 150 BM or so at 13:05 when I'm using the quirky video as BGM...

Problem with XReal One screen disappearing
- Putting your hand on your forehead cures it.
- If the sun hits your forehead through the trees, it's going to be determined that you've missed Xreal.
    - Three in a row when the sun came through the trees in just the right spot, and then it stopped occurring.

    - The most frequent cause of sudden blackout outdoors is "light sensor malfunction.
    - Next, momentary current shortage and overheat protection during battery operation.
    - Try blocking the proximity sensor (fastest test)
        - Reconnect to the Mac with your finger covering the black circle (IR sensor) behind the center bridge of the glass.
        - If the screen does not disappear, it is very possible that outdoor light entered the sensor and caused a sleep judgment → blackout.
        - Cut a 5 mm square of black vinyl tape, which can be purchased at a convenience store, and affix it to the sensor to complete the provisional measures.
    - No holes, though...<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

14:07
- Battery 18%.
- (of a guest, customer, etc.) to leave
- I brought long sleeves, but didn't wear them because I didn't feel cold.
    - But I felt "warm" in the direct sunlight on the way home, so I guess I was rather cold.

- 16:48~18:27
- It gets dark surprisingly late.
- Let's go home before it gets too cold.
- Battery at 80%.
    - The only reason the battery was running down so fast in the first half was because I was playing a video.

[[Ikarizine]] is amazing.
- Mosquitoes come to me and say, "Here comes a warm creature! I can't stop!
- But they stopped at my right elbow or ear or something, I have to paint without gaps.

I walked 15,000 steps.
- sleepy
