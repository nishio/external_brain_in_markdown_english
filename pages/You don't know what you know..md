title: "You don't know what you know."
---

Some person A knows X.
- One person B acted on the assumption that "A does not know X".
- Seeing this, A got angry.

Here's what I thought when I saw this
- When B doesn't know "whether A knows X or not," should B assume that A knows or doesn't know?
- If A is someone who can say "I don't know" when he doesn't know, it's more efficient to act on the assumption that he does know and only ask him to point out when he doesn't know.
    - ↔ [[I am afraid of not knowing.]]
- And if not?
    - As I was sorting it out, I was thinking that communicating with people like that is inefficient in any way, so I think the right thing to do is to not communicate with them as much as possible.
