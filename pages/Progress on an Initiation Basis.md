title: "Progress on an Initiation Basis"

[Considering progress on a "start basis" - Hiroshi Yuki's email diary](https://diary.hyuki.net/p/20210828).
> The "start-based" approach is to judge progress based on whether or not the work has been started. It is not based on the amount of deliverables or time spent, but on whether the work has been started or not. This works surprisingly well.

>  "[[Initiating]] is the first step in progress.
>  "[[Progress is the start]].
>  "[[Praise yourself for embarking on this project]].

I see.

- Task Classification
    - A: Something that will be over soon.
    - B: Time-consuming
    - C: Something you don't know how long it will take
- When your mind is low on energy, it's harder to work on B and C, and you end up doing A all the time.
        - [[I do detailed tasks.]]
    - Especially C. It's like, "I've been putting this off for a long time, but when I started it, it took me 15 minutes, I should have started on this earlier..."
    - When the time it takes is unclear, the longer one is imagined.
- So, by saying, "Initiation is progress," [[we bring the goal closer]].
    - It lowers the psychological hurdle to starting a business.
        - [[The wheel is heaviest at the moment it starts to turn.]]
