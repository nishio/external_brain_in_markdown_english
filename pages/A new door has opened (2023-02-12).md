- [/villagepump/new-door-opened](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/new-door-opened) is interesting, but I too was unable to cut it out for fear of breaking it!
    - So I backed it up here.
    - [[New doors opened.]]

from [/villagepump/new door opened](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/new door opened).
from [[2022/10/31]]

- I don't know how to say this, but I feel like [New doors opened.
- Until now, my [[image output]] was only a [[schematic]] with black markers on a white background for explanations.
    - A monochrome world?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/issac/icon' alt='/villagepump/issac.icon' height="19.5"/>
- I had tried [[sketch]] while looking at the real thing, but then I thought, "Why not just use a photo?
- There were no images in the virtual world of my brain.
        - There was no [Non-existent world to be depicted
    - There was no visual [[Ability to imagine]] the non-existent world.
- After a while of doing "create an image with [[Drawing AI]] → judge whether it is good or bad", it was like "I put water pressure on a clogged pipe and it started to flow".
    - I don't know how to say this.
    - When you haven't recognized it before and are thinking [[What I couldn't move, I can now move...]].
        - I had a feeling similar to when I started playing sports.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/issac/icon' alt='/villagepump/issac.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - Clearly perceive the presence of previously unrecognized body movements and muscles, and try new ways to move them.
                - This is fun.
            - It could be when using a ball, shinai, stick, or other equipment.
                - that one's [[somesthesis]] is elongated through tools, such as
        - Indeed. Lately.[[draw-in]] をしてて「なるほど、これが [[Kegel muscle]] か」となった<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - There's something about muscle training that feels like recognizing the existence of muscle first.
                - be (usu. of inanimate objects)<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/はるひ/icon' alt='/villagepump/はるひ.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/issac/icon' alt='/villagepump/issac.icon' height="19.5"/>
                    - Mr. Sekihara...] told me that you have to be aware of what part of your body you are working on in order to train effectively.
                    - Mr. Sekihara=person
                    - Same with running, etc.
        - To use a [[crane game]] analogy, it is as if you had only been able to move the crane left and right, but then you realized there was a button to move it in the depth direction, and you thought, "If I press this button, it will move back and forth! It's like "I can push this button and it moves back and forth!
- I'm awfully curious what you're talking about.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/はるひ/icon' alt='/villagepump/はるひ.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/issac/icon' alt='/villagepump/issac.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I've done my best to verbalize it, but if that doesn't get the message across, then it's "just sprouting" and I think the only thing I can do is "wait until it grows up.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - XX.[[increase resolution (e.g. of a file)]] という現象のように見えるがXXが何かよくわからなかった。描画？<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - When I say "increase the resolution," I feel uncomfortable because I imagine a situation where something that was originally dimly visible is now clearly visible.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - This one is closer: [/nishio/fog of literacy](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/fog of literacy).
            - It's like something that wasn't visible at all is starting to appear dimly.
        - 「 [[move (e.g. feeling)]] 」ことに重点がありそうな予感<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/issac/icon' alt='/villagepump/issac.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - I learned that I could move areas I wasn't using.
                - Sensation of moving muscles in muscle training, sports, etc.
                - Likewise, did you know that there is an area of the mind that "imagines images of the virtual world" that we have never been aware of?
            - When I moved it, it moved more, interesting! It's like<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/issac/icon' alt='/villagepump/issac.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - This is what I expect from [[InstaChord]] (aside).
                - good prospect (e.g. marriage, business)<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - I think this is pretty close.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Maybe a new form of self-expression.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/issac/icon' alt='/villagepump/issac.icon' height="19.5"/>

- I first wrote an application that can play chords as a way to study [[musical (music) theory]].
    - After that, he learned [[electronic construction]] and made [[RakuChord]] as hardware.
    - In the process, I realized that playing the piano with both hands (if you play it in a kindergarten teacher way) doesn't seem to be a superb skill.
        - There might have been a sense of [New doors opened.
        - I figured this out recently.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - And [[InstaChord]] is having fun.
- An example of how learning electronics in the first place opened new doors.
    - [[AHA experience]] I remember that term too.
    - This one is more like a light "awareness"?
    - Since I bought a [[3D printer]], I think I've started to look at plastic products as something to be made.
        - I don't have any knowledge of [[Injection Molding]] yet, though,

- The former is "a new door (opens)" and the latter is its content, which is concerned with [[new door opened#63ad9797aff09e00000cdd6c]].
    - (I'm still curious about the latter.)
- Interpreted again, it's like a GPU in the head that started to move?
    - It was about on-board.

The boundaries are becoming clearer and clearer with all the different opinions.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- ⭕️I put water pressure on the clogged pipe and it started flowing.

- ⭕[["Notice that there is a button to move it in the depth direction]].
- ❌increase resolution.
- ⭕There seems to be an emphasis on "moving it".
- ❌like a GPU in the head?".
- I don't feel that the performance of anything existing has been improved, but rather that new features have been added.
    - Not 1 became 10, but 0 became 1.
    - Both are increasing in number, so to someone else it might be, "Isn't that an improvement in performance?" to others.
    - But as for him, he does not feel that the performance has improved. because he was not aware of it when he was 0, so there is no comparison.
- It has to do with "moving it."
    - Cannot be moved at 0.
    - I'm now at 1 so I can move it.
    - Maybe by moving it, it will increase to 10.

- There is a sense in which the skill of illustration does not grow linearly with the amount of practice, but rather in steps in the extreme, and this is something that others have often said
    - Various people express it in terms of being able to do that when they become "aware."
    - Could it be something close?


## Observe changes due to [[InstaChord]]
from [[2023/01/03]]
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Let's compare going from not being able to draw at all to being able to generate pictures with AI to going from not being able to play an instrument at all to being able to play it with InstaChord.
- Ah, I see, so there is an increase in the axis of "something to play" as well as the perception that a song is "something to listen to" (observation).
    - Level 1: The
        - Recognizes a song as "something to listen to" and does not recognize the possibility of playing it himself
        - Recognizes illustrations as "something to look at" and does not recognize the possibility that he/she produces them
        - This phase is "no"
    - Level 2: The
        - Recognize the possibility of playing a song and begin to think about which one to play
        - Realizing that I can generate illustrations, I start thinking about what to generate.
        - This phase is the "can-do" phase.
        - [["Every song you've ever heard is eligible for performance"]]"
    - Level 3: The
        - Try to play some and recognize what is easy and what is difficult.
            - You'll be able to understand things like, "Oh, I see, this song modulates twice."
        - Generate some illustrations and be able to recognize what is easy and what is difficult
        - Maybe it's not appropriate to summarize this place with an illustration and a narrative.
            - The former creates from zero, the latter reproduces what is already there with good physical manipulation.
            - They share the "moving" aspect, but not the "making" aspect.
            - The "making" in music is going to be composing.
            - Maybe when you get used to insta-chords and gain some experience in "playing a song while watching the chord progression", a physical sense of "chord progression" will be created in your brain
            - If you can do that, you can try to do the chord progression on your own as you see fit.
            - And if you play the notes in the chord at random, you can create a melody that sounds like it, and it becomes an experience of "I'm not very good at this, but I was able to generate it from scratch".
            - Is this phase equivalent to the "I put in a prompt and a picture came up" phase for the image generation AI?
            - AI image generation feels "from scratch" but in reality, just as AI learns a lot from the past, does music generation need to learn a lot from the past first?
        - InstaChord also said that there is "creating from zero".
            - > That feeling of being able to create a song as you are playing along... (With InstaChord), you can do that... Many people say that as they play with InstaChord, they gradually come to understand how a song is made. You can notice that after this chord, it often becomes this chord.
                - [[2023/01/05#63b620bee1daa500008fadf7]]
    - I think there is a split beyond level 3.
        - More variations of songs that can be played easily.
        - Practice to be able to do difficult techniques.
            - Things like "arpeggios are hard," which I didn't recognize in the first place at level 1, are verbalized.

2023-01-04
- It hasn't arrived yet, but now that I've ordered it, "What song do you think I can play?" The thought is occurring to me.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I haven't even touched it yet, so at this point, "Isn't this going to play?" is probably wrong.
    - Added on 2023-01-14
        - I thought "The Thesis of the Cruel Angel" was difficult, but it turns out that the part I thought was difficult was actually only [[3~→6]], and this one wasn't that difficult.
        - In many cases, there is a twist at the transition from the melody to the chorus, and if you limit yourself to just the chorus, the difficulty level goes down dramatically.
    - Added on 2/12/2023
        - I thought it would be difficult, but when I tried it, it wasn't that difficult."
        - These are [[Pessimistic Misconceptions]].
        - By assuming it is difficult and not trying, the opportunity to know it is not difficult is lost.
            - This one above.
                - [[I don't have anything I want to make.]]
                - >  [[First, make a hebdomad.]] ...
                - >  Before you start making it [Determine if you can make it.
                - >  So it feels like everything [["requires a certain level of skill"]].

- I drew what I'm thinking at this point.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/be41f4c1ee39a32f9f4f539eb9b9b329/thumb/1000)
- 1: I usually only move left and right.
    - I don't see the black zone, nor am I aware of its existence.
- 2: Realize that you can move up as well.
- 3: Surprisingly, it goes on and on.
    - I'm seeing more and more things I didn't even think were there.
- 4: By extension [[It gives me a feeling of, "Maybe we can do this."]]
- 5: If you work toward that realization, you will find a wall.
    - Sometimes it's "what I can't do in the first place" or "what I can't do now."
    - It creates ideas such as whether to find a way to go beyond the barriers to reach a different planet to reach a star.
    - concrete example
        - Generating "girl pictures" with drawing AI is easier than expected (3)
            - However, when he tried to do something like "let's have a balance as a motif of equality" or "let's make a peace in front of the guillotine," he found a wall that didn't work at all (5).
                - The idea of "peace in front of the guillotine" comes from (4)
                - No such idea would come to mind at stage (1).
        - Playing the chorus of a famous song on InstaChord is easier than expected (3)
            - But that's "if you have 'Video Plus' where the code flows along with the video.
            - General, information that is just lyrics with chords attached to them can be confusing because it's hard to know "when to play" (5).
                - I recognized when I started doing it that often the "timing of the play" does not match the word boundaries in the first place.
                    - Hard to spot.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - Maybe I haven't developed much of a sense of "beat" yet, I haven't heard a song with that in mind.
                    - The 3/4 and 6/8 comparison videos made me "get it" a little.
                - After writing this.[[stroke pattern]] の概念を知った<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

- I've made some progress on what I thought I didn't say well when I first posted it.
    - I meant to say 5.
    - But 2 would be interpreted as.
- relevance
        - [[afantasia]]
    - I don't know if the "door opening" caused me to be able to "imagine" because I didn't experiment before I felt the "door" was "opened" by the drawing AI.
    - Once the "imaginary" pipe was allowed to pass through, it could be passed through with conscious pressure linguistically.

- I imagined a metaphor for mountain climbing.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I keep going until I get to a high mountain in front of me, and when I get there, I see another high mountain ahead of me.

- Write how you feel now<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I used to think, "There are difficult songs and easy songs; let's find the easy ones and play them."
    - Now the definition of "difficult" has changed.
        - Because I can now convert difficult chord notation into easy chord notation in my brain in no time.
        - I've come to believe that Yuichi was right when he said, "You don't have to choose a beginner's chord chart, just ignore the sevens and sus4s.
        - On the other hand, the swap in 3~ should not be omitted and the b in 7b should not be omitted
            - I can now make this decision without any particular thought.
    - I sometimes get confused because I don't know "when to play" maybe I haven't developed much of a sense of "beat" yet I learned the concept of stroke patterns after writing this.
        - Play the upstroke."
            - When it took me so long to switch fingers, I couldn't play upstrokes because I didn't have enough time.
            - The concept of "beat" is clearer if you are always jerking around, not just jangling the chord changes.
            - The chord chart is distorted in time because the lyrics are written in Chinese characters and there are many moras in one character, and there are sections of rests with no lyrics.
                - We're naturally expected to compensate for that in our brains.
                - Lyrics and chords are not enough information.
                - When you're doing jaka-jaka, you'll know, "Oh, that's next," or "That's the pattern, 3 jaka-jaka, 1 jaka-jaka, 4 jaka-jaka.
    - The combination of "brain conversion to easy chords" and "acquisition of the concept of time signatures" has changed the way I used to be able to play only easy songs with video plus: I am now able to play songs that are easy to play and have a video plus.
        - from [[song#63c295fe5e90c0000051315f played on InstaChord]].

        - The code is simplified and the length is specified.
    - Code to ICN
        - As I repeatedly converted the ICN to play and check [[Chord progression course that anyone can understand]] and [All modulation patterns are covered. I have improved my conversion ability.
        - from  [[All modulation patterns are covered.]]

        - I am able to doubt the given key and determine the key from the code myself.
    - I can now see terrain that was not visible before InstaChord, and I can predict where I will reach and how much it will cost.
        - It has revealed my own desires.
        - The animated songs I miss are not on iflet, they are not video plus.
            - Find chord charts from other sites and make them ICN
                - I think this is about enough for me personally.
                    - We are starting to be able to determine the key and make it ICN, we can do it.
                - I can't play by ear, but I don't have a song I want to play that badly at the moment.
        - Not much desire to play complex chords well.
            - Not much interest in improving one's physical body control performance.
        - I'm interested in the structure of the music.
            - I want to know how a song I think is good is made.
            - I'm interested in [differential sound
            - That's way out of InstaChord's scope.
            - Can I do it if I'm familiar with DTM software? Do I implement it myself?
            - I'm interested in music that is not in the 12-tone scale.

- What I'm thinking now.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Skills needed to play songs that do not have "Video Plus".
        - Conversion from code to ICN
        - Skill in understanding timing from chord charts where the chords are just written in the lyrics.
    - If you know the keys to the former skill, time will do it.
        - I understand how to do it.
    - I don't know the latter skill.
    - So I was writing on a piece of graph paper or something, and I realized.
        - In many cases, a part of the words of the lyrics is inserted in the backbeat before the chord change.

                - If you play a chord at the head of this block, it will be out of alignment or out of number.
    - I felt like I took a step forward last time with "Play the Upstroke," but today I took another step forward.
