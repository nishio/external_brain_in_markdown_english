title: "Internal Moving Review"
---

- I moved within the company in May 2019 for company reasons.
- During a previous move, all of the surrounding space was numbered and mapped out.
    - This was good (K)
    - Easy to express "where it comes from" when you put something in a cardboard box
    - For example, the shelf that contained stationery and other items used frequently on a daily basis was "8-1" and so on.
        - This number was routinely kept out of sight.
        - As a result, the [[map of the brain]] was formed to the extent that I could write 8-1 here without looking at any material.
                - [[Mind Palace]] Conversion

- Document cases were introduced in some spaces.
    - This was very good (K)
        - These things:.

        - ref:  [[Paper document organizer]]
    - I just put this box against the cardboard to complete the packing.
    - It is very easy and safe to move the whole document case, while a bunch of clear files not in the document case, for example, supported by a book stand, are likely to collapse when put into a cardboard box.

- Sequential numbering on stickers to put on cardboard boxes.
    - This was good (K)
    - However, they did not record the correspondence between the number they assigned and the object to which it was affixed.
    - So when some missing numbers occur.
        - Box lost.
        - I was the one who skipped the number in the first place.
        - I forgot to put it on my checklist when I removed the sticker.
    - There was no way to ascertain which pattern, such as (P)
    - For example, the monitor arm was "lost" (and subsequently found).
    - On the other hand, there was also "I forgot to write the sticker on the chair on the list.
    - At this time, there are still three missing items.
    - T: Digitally record the correspondence between the number assigned and the object to which it is affixed
