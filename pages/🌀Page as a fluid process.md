title: "🌀Page as a fluid process"
---

The purpose of this page is to develop the concept of the "page as a fluid process.

- [[Page as a fluid process]]
- It would assume that fixed content exists on the page when the page is created.
    - Since most books are so
    - [[process]], [[flow]], [[nominalization]].
    - It is important to think deeply about the use of "nouns" and "verbs."

Page as a [[not solidified]], [[fluid process]] of content
- The inside of the page is fluid and constantly being updated and improved.
- No fixed representation of knowledge
- I'm not arguing that every page should be.
    - That world is probably [[hard to live in]].
    - But the perception that everything is fixed is also not appropriate
    - [[Fragmentation of information]] and [[Multifaceted associations]].
    - [[process of creating new meaning]].
    - [[Creating New Meaning]]
    - The process is not one-dimensional, but multidimensional

Intelligent collaboration between AI and humans
- At a time when people were the only entities that updated information, what left human hands became "[[unchangeable]]".
- At the time it was written, it became "[[dead text]]".
- AI can bring about "[[flow]]" and "[[vegetative growth]]" that continues to change without human intervention.

### Digest of Research Notes
.

Considered that the content of pages should be fluid, constantly updated and improved, related to Nishio's fragments "the process by which sentences are created" and "the process by which stories are produced," "wikis as living texts," and "circular closed pages (birth process). We concluded that the representation of knowledge and information is not fixed, but fluid and should be constantly updated and improved. The process should be multidimensional, not one-dimensional.

### Digest of fragment
.

The Difference Between "Made" and "Used" adopts the idea of agile development and emphasizes the importance of "talking with verbs." Organizing the Top Page Leading Edge" discusses what the top page of a personal project should look like. Developing a Japanese Cultural AI: Plurality for Global Conversation" cites the "Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis" and points out that different languages and cultures have different names.

### Thinks deeply

From these notes and fragments, I feel it is important to think deeply about the relationship between language and thought, especially the use of "nouns" and "verbs". I also find it interesting to learn more about the development of "Japanese cultural AI."

### Insights from fragments
.

Nishio's notes provide insight into the fragmentation and multifaceted association of information. Through concrete examples, he suggests the problems of using abstract language and the dangers of assigning abstract concepts while discarding concrete parts.

### Considerations and questions

A deeper understanding of the process of how information fragmentation and multifaceted associations create new meaning is needed. The specific form and function of the "AI Dejima," which exports data from groupware to which AI does not have full access, also needs to be investigated in more detail.

### Digest of Research Notes
.

The pages were considered as a fluid process rather than one with fixed content; Nishio's fragments "the process by which sentences are created" and "the process by which stories are produced" are related to this idea. He also submitted the hypothesis that "project pages must be re-created on a regular basis. This is based on the idea that the content of pages should not be fixed, but constantly updated and improved.

Nishio's fragment "Wiki as a living text" and "circularly closed pages (birth process)" are also related to this idea: the Wiki is in a state of "unfinished writing," which allows a process of "continuous improvement. Also, when ideas develop on a time axis, they become one-dimensional, but by closing them in a circle, new perspectives and connections become visible.

These considerations lead to the conclusion that the representation of knowledge and information should not be fixed, but fluid, constantly being updated and improved. The process should also be multidimensional, not one-dimensional. This is because knowledge and information are formed from fragmentary elements, which are combined and superimposed to create new meaning and value.

### Digest of Research Notes
.

- [[process]], [[flow]], and [[nominalization]] are discussed. Instead of assuming that fixed content exists at the time the page is created, we consider the page as a fluid process, with no fixed content.

Nishio's fragment "process by which sentences are created" and "process by which stories are produced" are related to this idea. Sentences and stories are also not fixed, but are formed by the combination of fragmentary elements, which are then superimposed after the fact.

We also submitted the hypothesis that project pages should be reworked on a regular basis. This is based on the idea that page content should not be fixed, but constantly updated and improved.

Nishio's fragment "Wiki as a living text" and "circularly closed pages (birth process)" are also related to this idea: the Wiki is in a state of "unfinished writing," which allows a process of "continuous improvement.

The fragment "The Power of Language: Telling Experiences, Painting the World We Aim For" is deeply related to the discussion in this Note. Specifically, it is relevant in that it is important to think deeply about the relationship between language and thought, especially the use of "nouns" and "verbs". Also relevant to this Note's discussion is "Intelligent Collaboration between AI and Humans," in that it shows new possibilities for AI-human collaboration and intellectual production.

### deep thinking

From these notes and fragments, we feel that a deeper understanding of the process of fragmentation and multifaceted association of information to create new meaning is needed. The potential for intelligent collaboration between AI and humans also needs to be investigated in more detail.

### Summary of notes
.

The page should be viewed as a fluid process, not one with fixed content. Its content is constantly being updated and improved, and the representation of knowledge and information is not fixed but fluid. This process is not one-dimensional but multidimensional, creating new meaning through fragmentation and multifaceted association of information. ai makes it possible to bring about an ever-changing "flow" or "vegetative growth" without human intervention.

### Relation to Fragment
.

The notebook and Nishio's research notebook fragment "[[Knowledge Weaving Program]]" are related in terms of the representation of knowledge and information being fluid rather than fixed. In addition, "Why not specify the purpose of each page of the AI notebook?" is related to the notebook's perspective that the pages should be viewed as a fluid process rather than one with fixed content.

### deep thinking

The notes offer a new perspective in which the representation of knowledge and information is fluid rather than fixed. This suggests the notion that fluid and flexible perspectives, rather than fixed ones, are needed in the handling of knowledge and information.

### summary of thoughts

Representations of knowledge and information should be fluid, not fixed.

1: Summary of notes
The goal is to develop the concept of the "page as a fluid process." Pages should not have fixed content, but should be fluid and constantly updated and improved. However, we do not claim that everything should be fluid. Fragmentation and multifaceted association of information creates new meaning; AI and humans work together to keep information changing without human intervention.

2: Relation to Fragment
The "next study group" fragment indicates that there is a preference for "short pages on a single topic." This is related to the concept of the "page as a fluid process". The fragment "How Digital Tools Impact Convergent and Divergent Thinking in Design Ideation" shows the importance of divergent and convergent thinking, which is related to the "process of creating new meaning." The "ScrapboxSQUARE#2" fragment illustrates the importance of understanding meaning in context between pages, which relates to "the fragmentation and multifaceted association of information." The "From PDF to Scrapbox" fragment illustrates the idea that the page should be a unit of meaning, which relates to the concept of the "page as a fluid process."

3: Deep thinking
The concept of the "page as a fluid process" proposes a new form of knowledge representation and sharing. Knowledge that is fluid, updated and improved, rather than fixed, allows for deeper understanding and new discoveries. However, not everything should be fluid. Fragmentation of information and the creation of new meaning through multifaceted associations facilitate the deepening and broadening of knowledge; AI and human collaborations allow for the continuous updating and improvement of knowledge.

4: Summary of thoughts
The "page as a fluid process" facilitates the deepening and broadening of knowledge and allows for continuous updating and improvement through AI and human collaboration.
