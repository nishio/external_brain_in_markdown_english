Project success depends on balance between member interest and market value
- Personalization of information has value
- Involvement in a project should match your interests and situation
    - If AI can match this, new teamwork will be created.
- Role sharing and the ability of leaders to complement themselves is important.
- A New Approach to Profit from Uncertainty
- Emphasis on perspectives from AI and other life forms as well as humans
    - Combination of Explore Net and KJ method is effective for problem solving
    - Use the KJ method and other information organization techniques
        - Converts information from a wide field of view into a form that can be processed by humans
    - The relationship between tacit knowledge and discomfort is important for applying the similarities between GTD and the KJ method to other productivity methods
    - Share tacit knowledge between humans and AI.

### Digest
Project success depends on the balance between members' interests and market value, and personalization of information is valuable. Involvement in the project should match one's own interests and situation, and if AI can match this, new teamwork will be created. The combination of Explore Net and the KJ method is effective for problem solving, and the division of roles and the leader's ability to complement themselves are important; the relationship between tacit knowledge and a sense of discomfort is important for applying the similarities between GTD and the KJ method to other productivity methods. A new approach is needed that emphasizes perspectives not only from humans, but also from AI and other life forms, and that takes advantage of uncertainty; using the KJ method and other information organization methods, information from a broad perspective can be converted into a form that can be processed by humans, and tacit knowledge can be shared between humans and AI.

### New Thinking
Regarding "Project success depends on the balance between member interest and market value," Nishio's "P1 wins because it has the first-mover advantage. But what if we could build it up to $24, picking up points along the way?" I felt that this was relevant to the fragmentation of the project. This illustrates the importance of members balancing their own interests and market value in the progression of a project. Also, the idea that each member has different interests and contexts, and it would be good to have someone who can match them well, seems to be related to Nishio's fragment "P2 will lose. is also related to the fragment "P2 is going to lose. This illustrates the idea that not only matching between members but also matching with market value is important for the success of a project.

New thought: "The success of a project depends on the balance between the interests and market value of its members. Each member has different interests and contexts, and it is good to have someone who can match them well. But it's not just about that, it's also about matching market value."
