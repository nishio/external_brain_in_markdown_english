title: "Product/User Fit"

[Let's focus on Product/User Fit, which comes before Product/Market Fit](https://review.foundx.jp/entry/product-user-fit-comes-before-product-market-fit)

> Product/User Fit-- Degree of fit between the product and the user
- > Product-User Fit: The extent to which you’ve built the right product for the right user.
    - Product-User Fit: How well did you make the right product for the right user?

- > "There was a Product/Market Fit in a small number of very early power user segments" is a more accurate way of saying "There was a Product/User Fit."
    - > The honest version of “we’ve got product-market fit on a small cohort of very early power users” is “we’ve got product-user fit.”
        - Some people would say that there was a Product-Market Fit just because it was accepted by a few power users, but it should be said that there was a Product-User Fit.
