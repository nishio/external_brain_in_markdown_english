What I found myself thinking when I saw the online discussion about the [[Gubernatorial Election 2024]].
- People who perceive the situation through the metaphor of a [[race]]-like [[lace]] with the [[goal]] being the opening of the vote.
    - It is only meaningful to be first in t1 at the finish line, and not valuable for anything else.
    - [[venture]] that aims to establish an [[engine]] of [[exponential growth]] who perceives the situation in terms of an entrepreneurial metaphor.
    - The ranking at t1 has no deeper meaning.
        - It is only beneficial to get as many votes as possible to attract [[attention]].
    - Participation in races is an efficient means of creating an engine for growth

relevance
    - [[Racing and Games]]
