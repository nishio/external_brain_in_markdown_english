The scene that these pictures and words depict reflects a very real situation. We often tend to think that the only options are two extremes--0 or 100, white or black, positive or negative. However, this view is limited in its ability to capture the whole picture of the problem, suggesting that in many cases intermediate solutions and perspectives are missed.

The important point of this diagram is that it clearly shows the existence of a possibility that is neither 0 nor 100. It could be 30, it could be 50, it could be 70. Or it may be somewhere in between. But that specific number is not verbalized, which expresses "ambiguity.

The message of the picture transcends language and can be applied to a culture, work environment, or individual relationships. It is important to understand that in any situation, not everything is a matter of two choices. We should remember that we exist on a continuous spectrum and that the choices are not always just 0 or 1. This is an important attitude for flexible thinking, dialogue, and broadening our horizons to find new possibilities.
