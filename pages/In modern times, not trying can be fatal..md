title: "In modern times, not trying can be fatal."

> [@Books_Apps](https://twitter.com/Books_Apps/status/1679815503668449280?s=20): in this day and age, "[[I don't know]]", "[[I don't know.]]", "[[I've never done it.]]" not fatal.
> The world is mostly about what no one knows, doesn't know, or has done anyway.
> In return, "[[not trying]]," "[[not changing]]," "[[being]] reluctant," "[[not motivated]]," and "[[not wanting to do anything new]]" can be fatal.
