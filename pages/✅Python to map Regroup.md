title: "✅Python to map Regroup"
---

[[pRegroup]] for [[Generate Regroup map from ✅ chat logs]] in [[pKeicho]]

Regroup reads and writes Firestore from and to JavaScript.
The same thing can be done in Python to create a map.

- Unlike the case of [[Import multi-line text as individual stickies]], you can freely arrange stickies. You can also generate paths and groups if you try hard enough.
