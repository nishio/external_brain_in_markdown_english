- > The more you ask for respect, the less you get it, because respect is dependent on the opinions of others. This is because respect depends on the evaluation of others.

- People who try to make you think more highly of yourself by saying, "I'm X," are perceiving themselves as inferior to X because they think it will make you think more highly of yourself.

Do not flaunt your position.

Do not flaunt your position.

To prevail in dignity is more disagreeable than to prevail in personal charm. To pretend to be a person is to be disliked, and envy is enough. Respect is dependent on the opinions of others, and the more we seek it, the less we get it. This is because respect depends on the evaluation of others. You cannot earn respect, but you must earn and receive it from others. A great position requires a sufficient amount of authority to make it efficient, without which it cannot be fully fulfilled. Therefore, maintain sufficient dignity to perform your duties. Do not try to enforce respect, but try to engender it. Those who insist on the dignity of their job responsibilities are showing that they do not deserve it and that it is excessive for them. If you want to be valued, you must be valued for your talents, not for your irreverence. Even kings prefer to be honored by their personal qualities rather than their status.
