title: "passive hub"
---

    - Let's summarize the story of how some people who have problems with [[communication]] are actively problematic and others are passive
- There's a total acceptance type hub that exists.
- People assume that a strong communicator will send a request to start a session himself, and that's not true.
- Some people don't initiate sessions themselves, but have open ports.
    - I don't want to get involved with people on my own, but if someone contacts me, I won't say no.
        - People like that need to be protected because they're easily fooled by the wrong people.
- I've observed active people over the years, so I've started to imitate them sometimes and send them requests to start a session, but I think I'm basically a passive person.
- One active-type person can build a network of 30 people.
- So we don't need a lot of active personnel, and we don't all need to be active.
- And active personnel don't have to keep working.
- Once a small, dense, mutually beneficial community is established through the activities of active personnel, it is maintained because the community itself creates incentives to belong.
- That is, until the so-called crushers came in.
