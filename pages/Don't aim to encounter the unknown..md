from  [[Bots to assist in reading]]
    - [[Don't aim to encounter the unknown.]]
- It reduces motivation because the effort is not reliably accomplished.
    - Really?
        - When it comes to work that is assigned to you, if you don't get results despite your efforts, you feel demotivated.
        - But from a [[flow theory]] point of view, a success rate of 1/3 is the most exciting.
