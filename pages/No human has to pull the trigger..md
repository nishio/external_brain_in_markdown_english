title: "No human has to pull the trigger."

No human has to pull the trigger.
AI's once-a-day note-with-comments communication style has the advantage of "no human triggers to pull".
- If you're too busy to write a comment, AI goes ahead on its own.
- Even if you write some comments, there is no "send" action.
    - I may come up with something after that and add more.
    - No need for human decision-making on when is "the end" or "completion".
- Not sure if it would be better without the "send" action.
    - Personally, I think it's better to have it, and can be accomplished by running scripts in the development environment when you're in front of a PC.
    - I'm on the train to get to the camp site, and I feel like triggering from my phone in these cases.
