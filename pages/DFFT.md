> DFFT (Data Free Flow with Trust) is a concept that "aims to promote the free flow of data internationally, where data that is useful for business and social issues can move freely without regard to national borders, while ensuring trust regarding [[privacy]], [[security]], and [[intellectual property rights]]. DFFT was proposed by then Prime Minister Abe at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting (Davos) held in Geneva, Switzerland in January 2019, and endorsed by the G20 Osaka Summit in June 2019. It was endorsed by the heads of state and government at the G20 Summit in June 2019 and included in the Leaders' Declaration.
