title: "reverse inheritance"
---

> Whenever I see a page in Scrapbox that does not yet exist but is referenced from multiple pages (orange text color), I am reminded of C++'s [[abstract class]]. The order is originally reversed, but the abstract class is found by tracing back from a subclass that exists first (reverse inheritance?). The abstract class is allocated from the subclass that exists first (reverse inheritance?). In short, it is [[abstraction]].

- Interesting choice of words.
- In programming, [[inheritance]] means that a lower class inherits the members of a higher class, but [[reverse inheritance]] means that a higher class is created after collecting concrete examples of a lower class.
