title: "✅The first input of a conversation is also put in the DB and listed."

from [[pKeicho]]
□The first input of a conversation is also put in the DB and listed.
- I tried to "resume the last conversation" from the browser and reloaded first, so the last conversation became an empty conversation. That's what happens - that's what happens.
- It would be nice if the first input of a conversation could also be listed and selected once it's in the DB.
- ✅IndexedDB to record last modified date and first remark
- ✅Add a dialog to list these
