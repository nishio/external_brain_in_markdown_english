KAN Society

> [ochyai](https://x.com/ochyai/status/1811216429326495784) When people say [[smooth society]], I think [[differentiable society]] or something, but apparently not.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1811220674834567624) "[[Smooth Society and Its Enemies]]" was published in 2013, the technology to combine [[differentiable]] components and optimize [[end-to- end]] optimization technology had not yet become practically feasible. Namely, the idea of "[[sigmoid]] instead of [[step function]]" will be the cornerstone of a differentiable society.

> [ochyai](https://x.com/ochyai/status/1811221194500358438) If you don't get caught up in the sigmoid, it's not a [[cyclic world]] but a KAN society.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1811222409984577691) What is "KAN society?"

> [ochyai](https://x.com/ochyai/status/1811222906573373778) It's a gag that KAN: [[Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks]] society is called "sigmoid".

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1811225360077664275) Ah, I see. Well, since [[sigmoid]] is only mentioned as an example of a [[smooth function]] that is not a [[step function]], I don't think it denies using other smooth functions like [[KAN]]. (serious pun intended).
