title: "A good social trigger is a bone stuck in the throat."
---

I was actually thinking of [[acupuncture needle]], but it didn't come across too well.

Painful, not instantly fatal, and its presence is recalled by everyday activities such as spitting

Not chronic, not too painful, but good to keep reminding you of its existence for a while and stimulate your thoughts continuously [[Social Triggers]].

A bone stuck in the throat is a subtle metaphor because it has no productive effect.
- [[acupuncture needle]] gives the effect of acupuncture continuously, so it's close in that sense, but it doesn't actually hurt, so it doesn't match the "bringing to consciousness" part.
- After all, something that hurts a little is appropriate.
