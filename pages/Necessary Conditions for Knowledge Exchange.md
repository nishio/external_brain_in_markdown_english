- Person A possesses a vast amount of knowledge.
- The total amount of knowledge that Person B has does not match that of Person A.
    - However, since their areas of knowledge differ, Person B can offer knowledge to Person A.
    - In return, Person A can provide knowledge from their area of expertise to Person B.
    - This is known as [[Knowledge Exchange]].
- Person C has more knowledge overall than Person B.
    - However, Person C's areas of knowledge overlap with Person A's.
    - Therefore, Person C cannot engage in a knowledge exchange with Person A.

- It might be appropriate to call C "[[Suboptimal Compatibility]]"
    - This thought came from reading [[Avoid Becoming a Suboptimal Version of Your Idol]]
