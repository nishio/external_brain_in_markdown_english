title: "Ask AI which stocks to buy"

[nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1638020871754493952)If you ask [[AI]], "Which [[strain (of bacteria, etc.)]] should I buy?" and there are a lot of people who buy them, the stock will go up and [[self-fulfillment of prophecy]] will occur.

> [mogmod](https://twitter.com/mogmod/status/1638023460789325825) I guess it depends on how much you charge and when you start offering inducements. The offer of when to sell is also based on the amount charged... oh...

Yikes!
