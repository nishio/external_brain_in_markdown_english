The suggestion was "peer pressure" as to why Japanese people are not happy. Please give me 10 other suggestions.

- Long working hours: too many hours at work and no time for personal or family time.
- Economic insecurity: Economic insecurity and unstable employment are burdens on the mind.
- Stressful society: high levels of stress at work and in life.
- Excessive competition: Excessive competition in education and the workplace creates pressure.
- Loneliness: Lack of social connections and loneliness are increasing.
- Family problems: Intra-family problems and relationship troubles cause stress.
- Risk of natural disasters: The risk of natural disasters such as earthquakes and typhoons is a concern.
- Health issues: health problems and illnesses are a burden on the mind.
- Anxiety about social security: There is anxiety about future social security, such as pensions and medical insurance.
- Cultural constraints: Traditions and cultural constraints limit individual freedom and choice.


I had the same explanation created for the sympathizers.
- Peer pressure: Individual freedom is restricted as they are expected to conform to the opinions and actions of those around them.
