from  [[Meaningful conversations can start with two people.]]
Positive inertia

T:
- I would estimate the value of "useful knowledge obtained by combining knowledge" higher than "knowledge that can be noticed as useful in a flash".
N:
- What does that mean?
T:
- They estimate the value of knowledge that they have already found useful to be higher than the value of knowledge that they have not yet found useful.
- In other words, they are prejudiced against value, or rather, they are egotistic about value.
N:
- Isn't that usually the case?
T:
- Is it normal?
N:
- Doesn't that mean that values are subjective?
T:
- that's right
- Even if the latest Star Wars movie is "very interesting for people who have seen the first one!" but you don't want to watch it from the first movie, right? It may be a wrong analogy, but...
- On the other hand, if you've seen the latest film, you'll go see it even if the latest film is not well-received.
- In other words, I have high expectations for Mr. Nishio's next statement, because of [[inertia]].
- It seems hard to keep up an abstract conversation without that inertia to the contrary.
- That "inertia" seems to have value as a relationship.
- Inertia allows me to throw an idea around at will. This is a value.
N:
- Inertia, in a positive way, seems like an interesting keyword.
T:
- I think the bad side is normal, but Mr. Nishio's "I don't know, but I'll do it because Mr. Tachikawa says so" is a product of complete inertia!
N:
- LOL . I'll play board games on Fridays for inertia!
T:
- That too!
N:
- I think I should just try what the young people recommend, and I may start bouldering in the next year or so.
T:
- That's different from inertia. That's [[a mindset]].
