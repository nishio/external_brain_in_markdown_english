- Weber analyzes the [[open source movement]] from the perspective of [[political science and economics]] and explores the reasons for its success in software development.
- The book is organized into eight chapters, the first half of which deals with the origins, history, and philosophy of open source, while the second half examines how the open source approach works at the micro and macro levels through specific examples.
- Analyzes how open source communities motivate participants, encourage collaboration, and deal with complexity, contrasted with traditional [[ownership]] approaches.
- For information professionals, it provides insight into the strengths and limitations of [[a cooperative model that does not rely on compensation or hierarchy]].
- Librarians involved in digital asset management will find this book helpful in understanding the issues when discussing their views with those affected by open source.

Overall, the review concludes, the book is a thoughtful study that carefully examines an important 20th century phenomenon, the open source movement, and has been well received both within and outside the computing community.
