title: "platformer"
---

- Someone says, "Platforms are strong, so let's build a platform."
- An [[abstract layer]] that is spread by a strong company using its strength is [[after the fact]] called a [[platform]].
    - I originally wrote "when a strong company uses its strength to [[enclosure]]," but I'm not sure if enclosure is a necessary condition.
    - If there are no factors restricting exit (no fences in enclosures), but something overwhelmingly useful is offered at a low price, there will be no new entrants to it, so there will be no place to move to after exiting.
    - It is like a standard long-selling product.
