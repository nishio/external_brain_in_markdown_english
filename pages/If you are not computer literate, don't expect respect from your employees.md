> Computers - If you are not literate, don't expect respect from your employees. It is routine for them. Take it for granted that your boss is computer -literate. My five year old granddaughter would not respect me if I told her that grandpa is afraid of the phone. She would not trust me.
>  As times change, we ourselves must change. We must move from a minimum level of computer literacy, which is little more than reading, writing, and multiplication, to the realm of [[information literacy]], which is [[use information to get things done]]. It is an interesting and worthwhile challenge.
>  We are in the midst of such a current. The flow is fast.
>  (1998)

> The source is from his late masterpiece "[[Next Society]]". The text itself was written in 1998, so Drucker was 88 or 89 years old.
