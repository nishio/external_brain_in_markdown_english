Consider an alternative A as superior to a clearly inferior (often zero value) alternative Z.

It is logically correct in the relationship between these two parties.
Often there are other options that are better than Z (B, C)
There is no discussion regarding which of A, B, or C is superior.
Choosing A without being aware of the existence of B and C is likely to be an incorrect decision.
