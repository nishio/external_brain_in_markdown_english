title: 'Flexible Thinking: Pursuit of "usefulness" learned from experience'
---

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Hello everyone, this is nishio.

When I was 20 years old, I looked at the code of a library and challenged myself to rewrite it in a way that I thought was more "beautiful". As it turned out, that approach resulted in poor performance and I had to abandon that library.

What I learned from this experience was the importance of pursuing not only "beauty" but also "[[usefulness]]". My thinking at the time was that the shorter and more readable the code was, the "better. However, the improvements I attempted resulted in worse performance and made me painfully aware that it was not "useful".

I also rewrote the whole thing in one fell swoop, but neglected to conduct a small experiment and make a decision based on the results, thus wasting a lot of time on work that would have been wasted as a result.

Along with self-growth, we should continue to seek what is "useful" rather than what "should" be. By improving our skills and knowledge on a daily basis, and by having the flexibility to always find the best solution, we will be able to produce better results.

I will continue to learn and apply it to my daily work. I encourage everyone to have the perspective to pursue "usefulness" through their own experiences.

If business planning is important, do business planning. Don't get caught up in code. If OOP is the place where you can show your strength, do it with all your might. That is what work means to me.

If yes, then do whatever it takes to achieve it. If it's something I have little experience with, I'll learn on the spot.

Then they say that people around them don't understand or recognize them. It's not a cognitive problem that they don't understand or acknowledge, but if they don't understand that what they are saying doesn't fit the situation and they are simply useless.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1687630537220075522) I remember when I was 20 years old, I saw a vector computation library written in a flat set of functions, and I had the experience of creating a vector class, overriding the operators and rewriting it to make it look good, and then having to throw it away because it didn't perform well. I remember that it was a good learning experience for me when I was 20 years old, when I saw a vector computation library written in flat functions and rewrote it so that it could be written in a nice looking way by creating vector classes and overriding the operators.

Relative to "usefulness" rather than "should" or "right

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1687641991713280000) Even if I were to replace it, I should have foreseen the possibility of performance problems and implemented only the major parts first to test the performance comparison. However, I wasn't thinking straight at the time, so I rewrote the entire vector computation library and replaced it with the existing one, and that's where I ran into the performance problem.
