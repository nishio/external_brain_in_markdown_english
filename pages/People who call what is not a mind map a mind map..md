title: "People who call what is not a mind map a mind map."

- The [[mind-map]] is a means, not an end."
    - Completely agree.
    - It is important to know if doing so will bring about beneficial results for you.
- So often I don't follow the rules of mind mapping."
    - I think that's a good thing, because it's an individual choice.
    - Trade-off between the cost in time it takes to follow the mind mapping rules and the value gained by following them.
        - [[Shuhari]] : If you understand the type, there is nothing wrong with breaking it
- I teach this technique under the name of mind mapping."
    - No, you can't.
    - If you're going to teach proprietary methods, don't call yourself a mind map.
    - If you say that you will teach your own original method, you will not be able to attract students, so you use the name of someone else's famous method, "mind mapping," to attract people, which is just a free ride on someone else's achievement.
    - Don't magnify misconceptions about mind maps.

I think the first rule that advocate Tony Buzan gave is very important: "Draw a [[central image]].
If you don't do that, it's just radial bullet points, so please don't call yourself a mind map.
