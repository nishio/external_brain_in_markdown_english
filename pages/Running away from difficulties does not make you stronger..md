title: "Running away from difficulties does not make you stronger."
---

Comparing the bad pattern of someone who has "[[studied]] a lot of areas" to a role-playing game

- When I entered the forest at the beginning, I met a monster, so I ran away.
- I went into another forest, another monster came out, I ran away.
- I repeated it and got to the point where I said, "I've been to a lot of different forests.
- but since he didn't kill any monsters, he didn't get any experience and remained at level 1.
- I saw a passing adventurer use some cool magic and imitated him, but I couldn't activate it properly (of course).

Just "I've been to a lot of different forests" doesn't [[XP]] tantalize me.

When I wrote this metaphor, I had in mind [[Dragon Quest]], but in [[Minecraft]] ([[Micra]]), which is familiar to young people these days, you don't become strong by defeating monsters and accumulating experience, but by acquiring strong equipment. The mental model is completely different.
- Experience in the microcosm is lost when you die and is consumed when enchanting and strengthening equipment, a kind of currency.
- Strengthening of equipment is also done by obtaining materials in the early stages, so there is little need to fight enemies, and going to new lands and obtaining new resources while avoiding enemy combat is a means of strengthening oneself

As an old man of the Dracula generation, my mental model is to "become stronger by defeating more and more monsters," but for the Mycra generation, my mental model is to "explore new places while avoiding monster battles as much as possible.
- Would it be "you have to fight monsters and accumulate experience to enchant weapons" for the Mycra generation?
    - No, because there are ways to gain experience that do not involve fighting monsters.
        - Trading, mining and refining
        - Making devices to gain experience efficiently.

Original title [[Escape from Slime]].
- He used the term slime as the weakest enemy of Dracula.
    - ["When I entered the forest at the beginning, I met a slime, so I ran away," he wrote.
- To begin with, [[slime]] is not an early enemy in Mycra.
    - Early enemies are zombies and skeletons.

It's not always [[Don't run away.]] There are enemies to run away from.
- How can we identify this?
    - [[Blaming the run is agrarian bias.]]
        - [[escape]]

[[Microcosmos-type mental model]] / [[Minecraft-like mental model]].
    - [[When there is a difficulty, we run from it.]]
- I'm doing a lot of things and it just happens to work.
    - It's like hitting the jackpot in a gacha.
- This is not learning "[[how to]] make it work."
    - All you can do is [[keep pulling the gacha]].

    - [[Mismatch between those who want to solve problems and those who want to prevent them from recurring]].
    - The side that has the long-term [[knowledge that is less likely to become obsolete]] to prevent recurrence sees value in it and is willing to help the other side acquire it.
    - But the side that does not have the knowledge feels value when the problem in front of them is solved by knowledge that becomes obsolete, and does not feel value for knowledge that does not become obsolete. and does not feel value for knowledge that is hard to become obsolete.
        - I don't want the power to solve the problem, I want a solution.
        - I want fish to eat today, not how to catch fish (related: [[Teach them to fish, not give them fish.]])
