title: "Books as Chatbots"
---

- Wouldn't it be interesting if we could turn books into [[chatbots]]?
- In other words, something like "a chatbot loaded with Jiro Kawakita's book.
- Twitter has bots that cut out statements and display them randomly.
    - We can make it in the form of "output in response to keywords.
    - Solving the problem of 100% response and annoyance with [[Chatbot acclimation]].
- Jiro Kawakita bot and Yukichi Fukuzawa bot are having a discussion, and Nietzsche bot interrupts them.
- From an implementation point of view
    - Keyword Extraction
    - Short text stock
    - Search from that stock by keyword
    - Presenting the hits
- The "character" stands by the fact that the short sentences are collected only from the works of specific individuals.
- Become a "character" rather than a characterless recommendation engine or search engine.
- It's like, "Oh, Nietzsche, you're being so cynical again."
- It's even more interesting to have a tree dialogue with Scrapbox bullet points.
- Let's prepare an icon!

- Why not have a chatbot comment once a day on the information in [[this day in the past]]?
    - [[Revived once a year to bring it to life.]]

Not just books, but other people's Scrapbox projects are broken down into rows, so it's easier to do.
- In the meantime, why don't you just create nishio-bot in your own Scrapbox project?

- [[Dialogue with Books]]
