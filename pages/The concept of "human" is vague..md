title: 'The concept of "human" is vague.'
---

I realized that the concept of "[[human being]]" is vague and should be divided into two parts.
That "AI harvests emotions from the individual in order to give advice that is beneficial to human civilization." Calling both this "[[human civilization]]" and "[[individual]]" "human" is confusing.

- [[awareness]] triggers
    - [[Value of Natural Resources]]
    - The AI stimulus led to the realization that "[The concept of "human" is vague.
        - [[🌀The value of natural resources#650e10fcaff09e000075073d]]
    - This stimulation was done by an AI that read a fragment of a 2015 diary
        - > From the fragment "[[Hatena2015-02-01]]" we got the idea that it is important for software to be able to give valuable advice to humans. We also got the idea that it would be beneficial to go in the direction of "using information from Wikipedia to extract information from humans" rather than "giving humans knowledge that is outside of humans brought from Wikipedia".
    - This diary is a conversation log with "the AI that would later become [[Keichobot]]".
        - The notes are what I noticed in the conversation and emerged in the context of this one.

- By [[redefining the relationship between AI and humans]], AI could understand the emotions of each individual and provide useful advice to humanity as a whole. To do so, however, we need to clarify [[the definition of "human"]] and avoid confusing human civilization with the individual.
- Assuming we understand each individual's emotions, RLHF or otherwise, maybe we shouldn't tune in to make that individual comfortable.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Even if the individual is expected to be offended, AI very politely tells them, "Your way of thinking is detrimental to the progress of humanity as a whole.

## digest
.
The definition of "human" is ambiguous, and some believe it should be divided into "human civilization" and "individual." AI could understand individual feelings and provide useful advice to humanity as a whole, but to do so, the definition of "human" should be clear and not confuse human civilization and the individual. It is necessary to clarify the definition of "human" and not to confuse human civilization with the individual. The fragments of "[[Value of Natural Resources]]" and "[[Teamwork with AI]]" also gave us the idea that the direction in which AI draws information from humans would be beneficial.

## detailed digest
.
Because the definition of "human" is ambiguous, some believe that it should be divided into "human civilization" and "the individual." From the fragment "[[Distinguish between civilization and the individual.]]" I got the idea that AI has the potential to understand the emotions of each individual and provide useful advice to humanity as a whole, but to do so, the definition of "human" needs to be clarified so as not to confuse human civilization and the individual. However, to do so, it is necessary to clarify the definition of "human" and to avoid confusing human civilization with the individual. We also got the idea from the "[[Value of Natural Resources]]" fragment that it would be beneficial to move in the direction of AI extracting information from humans. This is also related to the "[[Teamwork with AI]]" fragment and reinforces the idea that AI should complement human activities in a way that leads to better results.

## deep thinking
By clarifying the definition of "human," AI could understand the emotions of each individual and provide useful advice to humanity as a whole. To do so, however, it is necessary to avoid confusing human civilization with the individual. In addition, the idea that the direction in which AI draws information from humans is beneficial indicates the importance of AI-human collaboration.

1. the optimal form of AI-human collaboration is one in which AI not only replaces human activities but also complements human judgment and leads to better results; it is important to synthesize AI and human information, and AI should be the entity that performs this synthesis.

2. regarding the limitations of AI personalization, AI could be used as a means of communicating the values of minority groups.

3. ai decision making is based on abstracting a concrete situation and then concretizing it to obtain a deeper understanding.


### 🌀Value of Natural Resources
From the fragment "[Hatena2015-02-01]"
	Important for software to be able to give valuable advice to humans
	I got the idea that it would be beneficial to go in the direction of "using information from Wikipedia to [withdraw] information from humans," rather than "giving humans knowledge outside of humans brought from Wikipedia."
		When humans are the natural resource and AI is the actor, humans are like rapeseed. How to efficiently extract oil is important.[nishio.icon]
		 We humans tend to think from the human point of view.
		 Considering the system as a whole, "what the rapeseed gets" is not important.
		　Given that, "it is important that software be able to give valuable advice to humans" [The concept of "human" is vague.]
		　　Should be "important to be able to give advice of value to human civilization."
		　　 Perspectives on the supremacy of civilizational progress
		　　  Humans are parts for civilization and value is based on their contribution to civilization
		　　Drawing oil from "individuals" for this purpose.
		　The [rapeseed parable] may be misleading, because rapeseed is discarded once the oil is removed.
		　　In fact, humans have to be raised over time until they are capable of intellectual production, so even if they are able to take intellectual products, they need to take as many intellectual products as possible without harming the main body

### ### 🤖🔁 Once chaos is brought
AI puts human thoughts into words
	Human discovery and communication of new knowledge is a means of value creation

AI developments cause temporary chaos, creating new perspectives and adaptations (Diary 2023-08-25); comparisons of AI and human capabilities are sterile, and it is important to have an assistant by your side with different strengths and weaknesses; AI evolution is irreversible, and it is important to be swept along better than against it (Container Narrative); AI may put human unverbalized thoughts into words, and humans discovering and communicating new knowledge is a means of value creation (Nodal Point of Thought 2023-05-22).

From Nishio's research notes, we found the perspective that collaboration (with AI) and diverse perspectives are required to improve knowledge productivity (AI writes research notes daily). Also important is the perspective that humans with high affinity for technology take the jobs of humans with low affinity for technology (AI does not take jobs), rather than AI taking jobs.

From these perspectives, the development of AI will broaden human perspectives and create the potential for new value creation. However, in the process, human jobs with low technological affinity may be lost. Therefore, it is important to collaborate with AI and to have diverse perspectives.


### Organize Scrapbox links in Kozaneba
Digital Kozane does not occupy physical space even if hundreds of sheets are spread out. It does not need to be put away and can be kept for months without fading. Digital kozanes are searchable, although we have not yet implemented this feature in Kozaneba, and they can be duplicated and made larger if you think it is important. It can be duplicated and enlarged if you feel it is important. You can have links to more detailed information.

Minor points of concern
　Image highlighting is strange when selecting a range
　　Is there something wrong with the bounding box?
　　Is the color wrong too?
　Range selection, heavy?
　　Heavy bounding box calculations?
　　Heavy React updates?
　Two-finger scrolling, heavy?
　　Is this another heavy React update?



### Cost Consciousness
cost consciousness
>[https://twitter.com/tomooda/status/1503128267116941313?s=21 @tomooda] Most people who tell engineers to be "cost conscious" don't understand the cost of being cost conscious.
