    - Figure from [[Seven Habits]] p. 215
        - [[Time Management Matrix]]

    - [[emergency]] means "something that appears to require immediate attention."
    - An [[important]] is "something that is tied to your [[mission]], [[values]], [[priority]], and [[achievement]] of a high [[target]]."

- When time is invested in the second area (non-urgent but important), [[effectiveness]] increases and the first area (urgent and important) decreases.
- The time to do the second area can only be taken away from the third or fourth area.
    - That would mean saying "no."
- The first and third will work, but the second will not. You have to be [[proactive]] to do it.


Urgent = [[wedging oneself in]].
Measure and avoid interruptions → [[Pomodoro Technique]].

- It is also called [Eisenhower Matrix. However, there is no evidence that Eisenhower used this.
- His statements are often mentioned as the basis
    - > The most urgent decisions are seldom the most important ones.

- [[People who achieve great results focus on opportunities, not problems.]]
