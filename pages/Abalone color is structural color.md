- The color of [[abalone]] is [[structural color]].

    - When beeswax is applied to the surface of the shell and peeled off, the color transfers to the beeswax.
    - I thought the surface of the shell was [[(diffraction) grating]].
        - The rainbow colors of CDs are also diffraction gratings
- Raman
        - Nobel Prize for the discovery of [Raman scattering
    - 1934: thought shells were made up of oblique layers
        - Verified after the invention of the electron microscope.
        - Flat crystals of calcium carbonate are stacked on top of each other.
- Diffracted light is rainbow-colored
- Reflected light from multilayers has a fixed wavelength
    - The color changes because the spacing between the membranes in the optical path direction changes with the angle.
    - Purple and green are the colors due to this.
- Diffraction was observed by shining a [[Green Laser]] on a luminous shell.
