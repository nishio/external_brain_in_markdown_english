Differences between Devin and Roo Code experiences2025-03-02
from[/villagepump/2025/03/02](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/2025/03/02)
- I feel like I can verbalize the difference between the Devin and Roo Code experience, and it's not coming down my throat.
    - Some programming tasks are less difficult and some are more difficult.
    - I think if you're doing [[Roo]] and doing the less difficult part, you're "just looking at it and sometimes hitting the OK button," and your brain will shut down.
        - [[Devin]] does the less difficult part alone.
    - However, if you get to the point of difficulty
        - Roo allows humans to quickly change course and say, "No, no, no, wait a minute.
            - It's like having an instructor in the passenger seat at a driving school.
            - The brake is on the passenger seat.
        - Devin runs somewhere and hits the credit limit and waits for humans
            - It's like you're in a cab and you're asleep in the back seat and you're in a totally different place.
    - If you give Devin a task that is less difficult and that an AI can do on its own, the human [[scales out]].
        - I think it might be [[a highway of learning]] to use Roo to get a sense of how much you can do.
            - If it could have been implemented easily and without trouble, "That would have been better done with Devin than with Roo.
    - If you throw a task that has a mixture of difficult parts to Devin, only the "difficult parts" will come to humans in droves.
        - And a few mistakes have added to the difficulty.
            - Because when two bugs overlap, it becomes about 1+1=10 more difficult.
        - I've recently figured out that instead of looking at Slack and seeing the latest version of the status, it's easier to understand [[Devin's WebUI and see what he's doing in chronological order]].
