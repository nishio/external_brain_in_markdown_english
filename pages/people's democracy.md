> People's Democracy is a political system in [[socialist]] countries that reflects the [[People's Front System]], as opposed to the [[one-party system]] ([[one-party dictatorship]]) of the [[Communist Party]] in the [[Soviet Union]] and other [[multi-party systems]]. It was adopted by [[Eastern European countries]], [[People's Republic of China]], [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]], etc. after World War II.
> However, in these countries, the Communist Party is defined as the guiding party in the constitution, etc., and each political party is under the guidance of the Communist Party (satellite parties), so there is no opposition party and no change of government ([[hegemonic party system]]).
