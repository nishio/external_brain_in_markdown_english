from [[The Art of Worldly Wisdom]]
high-mindedness
cxxviii
A lofty mind.

It is one of the principal qualifications of a gentleman, because it spurs all kinds of nobility. It improves taste, enriches the mind, elevates the spirit, refines the emotions, and enhances dignity. It elevates the person in whom it is found, and sometimes even corrects the evil course of fate, which can only be enhanced by beating. It cannot be demonstrated by action, but can be fully demonstrated by will. Generosity, generosity, and all heroic qualities find their source in this.
