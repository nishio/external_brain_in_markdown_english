title: "Respect for minority opinions"
---

The meaning of "respect for [[minority opinion]]" is not clear because what is a minority opinion depends on how the clusters are cut.
- [[What is the majority depends on how the clusters are cut.]]


There is a bias to consider one's own opinion as a minority opinion and the opinions of many others as the majority opinion by lumping them together in a low-resolution manner.
- [[The resolution of other people's opinions is low.]]

- [[majority rule]] against not having one's opinion adopted.
- Related: [[Fujiko F. Fujio and Equality]].


I thought the definition of "minority opinion" in "respect for minority opinion" was unclear.
- What constitutes a minority opinion depends on where the boundaries of the cluster are drawn, so unless there is agreement on the setting of cluster boundaries, there should also be no agreement on what constitutes a minority opinion.
- Primarily, it's going to be "each person has a different opinion, so each person is a minority opinion, all should be respected".
- In that light, it seems to me that assuming that other people's opinions are the "majority" and saying that one's opinion is a minority opinion and therefore should be respected more than others' is an act contrary to Plurality.
