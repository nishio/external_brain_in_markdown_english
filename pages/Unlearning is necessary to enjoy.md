title: "Unlearning is necessary to enjoy"
---

- Interesting story about Dominion's online competition.
    - No shuffling of decks or anything, just easy.
- Never seems to be a dull moment in old age.
- But there is an exception.
    - I like the feel of the paper! I don't care what you do online!" Don't say, "I don't like the feel of paper!
    - No one wants to play with that kind of "[[pain in the ass (arse)]]".
    - Things are changing rapidly, we need to enjoy the new things, not say the old things were good.
- similar story
    - King of Games (i.e. rock-paper-scissors game)
        - These days things have changed a lot from the past.
        - We have to forget about the old strong cards and learn the current strategies.
            - [[unlearning]] is required
        - There are those who say, "The old days were more interesting."
        - People like that are shunned by people who don't know what they used to do.
- I was into Dominion too, 12 years ago, before the alchemy expansion came out.
