title: "Can't see the same thing."
---


2025-03-01
The AI service experience is of course totally different with different plans, and even with the same plan, the rollout timing is different, so we're not "seeing the same thing".
I've seen people elsewhere talking about "searches coming to ChatGPT," "it's been there for a while," and "the timing of the rollout is different for everyone."

From my point of view
- 'Of course, we've been able to search for models with search capabilities for quite some time, I can't remember if it was two years ago or not, but that was the initial extension of the tool when it became available.'
- I think you're talking about a feature that came on late last year that we're talking about here." [https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/)
    - I see, end of October, I've been using it since it came on, but it was recently rolled out to the lower tiers."
The way it looks like

Everyone sees things differently and doesn't use (or can't use) words that pinpoint specific concepts, so [[Tower of Babel]] collapses and communication stops working.

It seems that when there are A1, A2 and A3, both those who only see A1 and those who only see A2 call it "A", which causes confusion, or something like that, all over the place.

        - [[Series of pictures in which the same word refers to different things]]

Oh yeah, and the fact that ChatGPT got the ability to search for logs at the same time is also adding to the confusion.

It may be a situation where "seeing the same thing" happened only at a very brief time in human history to begin with.

- Internet search has been around for 25 years at the most.
- Television broadcasting in an era of limited channels
    - Attention dispersed by increasing number of channels
- LLM generates for each individual
    - [[immersive]]

- Notation shaking: [[same appears]].
- Funny situation to see the same thing in the first place.
    - When humans see the world in its natural state, they don't see the same things others do.
    - I only see "close" objects when they are right next to me and facing the same direction.
- Only for a very short period of time in human history after the introduction of the image reproduction technology called television, which created a situation where everyone was watching reproduced images.
- Patterns of thinking that assume the other person sees the same things you do when conversing with others
    - Before the invention of television, it was the thinking of a sick person with blurred boundaries between self and others.

- Men cannot experience a woman's point of view.
        - [[If you make it a female account, you'll get tangled up with creepy guys.]]
    - We think we see the same world, but we see it totally differently.
- To begin with, since everyone's perspective is different, it is necessary to collect [[from a 360-degree viewing angle]] [[multifaceted understanding]] of how other people see things.
