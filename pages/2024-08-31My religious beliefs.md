from  [[Sanyuttha Nikaya 6.1.1]]
2024-08-31My religious beliefs
- I've been rethinking my religious beliefs.
        - [[Buddha]] is a sympathetic practitioner
        - The [[dragon tree (Dracaena draco)]] is an interesting philosopher, treated much the same as [Wittgenstein
        - I understand the "chanting the Buddhist prayer is OK" type of religion for [[the masses]] as a business, but I dislike it a lot.
            - [[Pleasing the masses is evil.]]
