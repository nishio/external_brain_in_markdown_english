title: "Compatibility of problem-solving thinking and AI agents"
---

When I threw [[low-priority task]] to [[AI Agent]], it was surprisingly easy to get something done,
If you [[leave as is]] without [[review]], it will only increase the cost of review and will not create value, so you have to review it,
You find out that something doesn't work, and it takes all of your brain's resources to [[determine the cause]].
(I was in the middle of a review of last week's work and I created [[VoiceMate]] and tested its operation.)
