title: "risk, uncertainty, disaster and pragmatism"

> [copinemickmack](https://x.com/copinemickmack/status/1906269598585847820) Japanese people tend to treat all [[risk]] as [[uncertainty]]. That's why they don't have the idea of prioritizing risks. I think this is probably a [[pragmatism]] cultivated under the pessimistic assumption that Japan is one of the most [[disaster]] prone countries and that ruin may come at any time.

There is some question as to whether this interpretation is correct.
- I feel that the culture will become, "Even if we do our best to finish it without defects, it might be ruined by a disaster, so we'll just finish it to the extent that it works for the time being.

Then it's inefficient to allocate resources to something with low expectations. There are higher priority issues". Certainly there are quite a few serious bugs piling up in the functional side of things. It is common in Japan and the U.S. that non-functional issues tend to be put on the back burner. It is more a matter of values than good or bad.

It was decided that if it became a problem, we would deal with it then. After the release, the performance problems we were worried about did not appear. But the reason was not because the service did not hit the mark, but because a serious bug was found and the process had to be completely reworked.

> [copinemickmack](https://x.com/copinemickmack/status/1905527663336251880) The American programmer was half right. Most of the things we worry about don't happen. Exactly. I think this is didactic, in the sense that you should think of priorities in terms of expectations. But personally, I think you need to add another sentence to the second half. That is, "Problems happen where no one expects them to happen."

> [copinemickmack](https://x.com/copinemickmack/status/1905529511816364096) In Japanese, there is only one word "uncertainty", but in English, we distinguish between "risk" and "uncertainty". Risk is something whose probability is known to some extent, while uncertainty is something whose probability is not known in the first place. risk can be dealt with rationally based on expected values, while uncertainty is difficult to deal with. Both of us were at the mercy of the latter.

> [copinemickmack](https://x.com/copinemickmack/status/1905532122208829586) Americans take risk management seriously. As for uncertainty, they seem to have a kind of resignation. They seem to have a kind of resignation about uncertainty, as if they can't assume what they can't assume.

> [smile27364](https://x.com/smile27364/status/1905807338118017301)'s software shop had a policy of prioritizing bugs and fixing the highest priority ones first, and not addressing the lower priority ones.
>  I was surprised because in Japan we corrected as much as we could.
>  I was impressed by the way they reduced man-hours by negotiating with the client on which to fix, and adjusting the allocation of resources: this time, next time, and not fixing this.

> [forthten](https://x.com/forthten/status/1905627664398135729) I learned a lot. When Galbraith's Age of Uncertainty was gaining popularity, I thought they'd sell a book with the yucky title of Uncertainty, not Uncertainty, Uncertainty.

> [VietorisMayer](https://x.com/VietorisMayer/status/1905753704311263425) The quality of Japanese products in the past was probably due to their prudence and risk aversion. If the Japanese adopted a complete imitation of the Americans, they would not be able to compete with the Americans. The thinking is different. Getting rid of the neoliberal cost-cutting mindset is the step toward the next society.

>  No matter what you do, there are a lot of things that end with "It can't be helped, can it?" I think there are a lot of things that end up with "It can't be helped.
>  It would be great if we could further sublimate that into humor and laughter, but as Japanese we have no sense of that.

> [go_4_it_poll](https://x.com/go_4_it_poll/status/1905661744904569153) I understand what you mean. I think that Japanese people are very anxious about things. It is true that there is a lot of unnecessary study in Japan, but there is also an aspect of overzealousness in the U.S. If the two work well together, Japan will be able to pick out the buds of its problems. It is interesting to see the synergy that can occur when these two work well together, with Japan nipping problems in the bud first and the U.S. moving forward with the work at a great pace.

> [hannnora](https://x.com/hannnora/status/1905829453084922101) The sales of products in the U.S. and Japan are similar in some ways. The quality is better, but the cost is higher because of the hassle and waste.
>  In the U.S., the cost is lower because the products are sold as is, but if you buy them at random, they may be damaged and unusable.

> The concept of "risk assessment" (predictive evaluation of hazards), which is used as a countermeasure against occupational accidents in Japan, is to eliminate all possibilities of accidents by taking countermeasures of the appropriate strength for the size of the accident. The concept of "risk assessment" (predictive evaluation of hazards) in Japan is to eliminate all possible accidents by taking measures of the appropriate intensity.

> [OiLmaDiPworHksO](https://x.com/OiLmaDiPworHksO/status/1905669105333797258) After all the testing and regression work, we released the product and found a specification error that was miscommunicated by the PM. They fixed it, but the PM did not communicate it to the customer. Then the fix caused a failure. When I advised the PM and senior manager to be honest about it, they told me that I should report it to them.

> [aniaimugi1](https://x.com/aniaimugi1/status/1905765609029472408) No, don't start development without defining requirements and designing the amount of data to be processed.
