title: "concept prototype"
---

- I said "concept prototype" in the sense of a prototype dedicated to communicating a concept, but [[contextual prototype]] is a mistake
    - [[concept proof]] ([[PoC]]) and you got mixed up.
- Long katakana words are confusing, so Japanese aliases are added on this page.
- [[contextual prototype]]" and "[[conception]]"
- Are they the same? →No.
- Context prototypes are prototypes to find out how customers would react if you told them about the product, assuming you had one
    - In that sense, it is a kind of validation of the [[customer existence hypothesis]].
- Concept verification is a broader concept
    - This includes experimenting to see if certain features of the product are feasible.
    - The point of verification is common
