Thinking about people growth is essential for nonprofit leaders
> It is essential for leaders of [[nonprofit organizations]] to think about the [[growth]] of people. People work for nonprofit organizations because they share a vision with the organization. Volunteers who have nothing to gain will never work for a long time. You have to get a lot out of the work itself because you are not getting [[monetary rewards]].

People do [[nonprofit (noncommercial) activities]] in search of [[growth opportunities]] and [[study]].
- [[OSS Project]] is also a kind of non-profit organization.
