> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1645840753997008896) Maybe this concept of Plurality (the box that contains things related to it) is so big that even if you glance at it, you won't know what it is, so I'll try to explain it to people in a specific context. In order to explain it in a way that you can understand, you need to "clean up".
