title: "Intellectual Production and Scrapbox"
---

- I tried incremental writing in supermemo, which at the time of writing last summer I was not yet as familiar with [[Scrapbox]] as I am now.
- How did you come to love Scrapbox?
- Scrapbox itself is explained more than adequately in "[[Scrapbox Information Organization]]", and it is not the purpose of this book to introduce specific tools and techniques, but a means # means, not an end
- The introduction of "specific tools and techniques" is a means to an end: finding more universal principles by comparing them with others.
- So if I were to write about Scrapbox, I would have to talk about the advantages and disadvantages compared to something similar
- There is nothing specific to speak to its use as a CMS.
- For one-person use, the comparison would be the KJ method on paper, which I am currently doing, and incremental writing in supermemo. For use by multiple people, the comparison would be e-mail and chat as means of communication, and file sharing and wikis as methods of information sharing.
- Software that is used by multiple people to support intellectual production is, in other words, groupware. [[CSCW]]
