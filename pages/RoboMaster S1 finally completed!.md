- > Episode 6: Gimbal Installation
        - [[Phenomenon that the chassis version is not seen.]] Based on the issue, the title was changed.
- head done
    - Last time I installed the wheels, they took the shape of a car.
    - This time we will attach the gimbal on top of the car body and chassis.
    - This gimbal has a blaster to fire the camera and bullets.
- Torso editing done
- Tail done
    - This time, it was finally completed.
    - Next time we will turn on the power and do the initial setup.
    - This is surprisingly interesting.
