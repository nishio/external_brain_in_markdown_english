title: "Relativization of legitimacy"

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1742719035635294653) I feel like this "[[there are]] multiple grounds for legitimacy" is a useful perspective for those who create or transform things anew, so I'll sort it out later.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1742721573445152859) Legitimacy, after all, is not something that exists objectively, but subjectively within each individual, and in situations where there is real benefit in making it align In such a situation, it is useful to build up people's subjective view that "this is legitimate," and this may correspond to the term "[[fostering]] a sense of conviction" and so on.

One of the most useful things I learned at MOT was [[Relativization of correctness]].

- [[relativization]] of [[legitimacy]]
