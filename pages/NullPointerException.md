title: "NullPointerException"
---

For example, when there is a variable of type Person, humans tend to implicitly assume that it contains an instance of the Person class as its value
However, in Java, it was actually "an instance of the Person class, or null.
This mistake causes a NullPointerException at runtime.

To solve the problem of whether a type is a [[Nullable]] type or not, "let's distinguish between [[Nullable]] types and non-nullable types".
