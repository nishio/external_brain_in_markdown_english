title: "making something non-trivial"
---

The act of making it look like [[a general statement]] when it's really about you.

Example
- I don't like a certain action X, but instead of saying "I don't like it," I claim that it is against social justice J.
    - If you really care about [[social justice]] J, you would oppose act Y, which is equally contrary to J, but you don't.


- [[making something one's own]]
- [[personal affair]]
- [[myself]]

- [[right]]
