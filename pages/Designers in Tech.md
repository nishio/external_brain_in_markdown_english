[[Superbloom]] is a non-profit design organization that extends the "power of design" in the areas of open source and human rights/civic tech.
Its flagship program, "Designers in Tech," is a workshop series that provides a mechanism for designers to participate substantively in the often engineer-centric OSS community, and has been held continuously at international OSS conferences such as COSCUP in Taiwan since 2023.

Objectives of Designers in Tech
- Aim: Specific examples
    - Visualization of non-code contributions: Translate development issues into design briefs and guide designers to deliver "PR" worth of deliverables.
    - Hands-on contribution: Submit a design deliverable to the OSS repository without fail in the form of a one-day hackathon.
    - Facilitate ongoing commits: share Miro templates and Figma/Penpot files, and provide Slack follow-up.
