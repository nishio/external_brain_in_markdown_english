title: "It's impossible to meet the needs of those who want to talk."

- It's impossible to meet the needs of "those who want to talk" because there are likely 10 times as many people who want to talk as there are people who can listen to what you have to say.
- Broad listening methods are available to meet the needs of as many people as possible.
- Even if you go all the way to a place where that doesn't work and you can only mention it retroactively in a screed, you feel like you can't ask that because your resources are limited.
- If someone doesn't understand that resources are limited and assumes that they can take advantage of scarce resources, I think it's a good idea to communicate well that their assumption is wrong!
