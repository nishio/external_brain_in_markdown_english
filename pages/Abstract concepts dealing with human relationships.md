Abstract concepts dealing with human relationships
- Use "you" for yourself
- An [[abstract concept]] about [[human relations]], such as he, she, they, etc., just happens to be the way the person acquiring it perceives the world, not the way the world is in fact.
    - Recently, some people use the gender-neutral "they" for the singular third person because they consider the "he/she" indicator inappropriate based on the implicit process that the human gender is binary.
    - However, the Japanese equivalent of "they" is "they", which is the pluralizing ending "ra" for "he", which is not gender-neutral
