`LLM Meetup Tokyo #1`
- [event info](https://lu.ma/llm-meetup-tokyo-1)

> [takahiroanno](https://twitter.com/takahiroanno/status/1645426627780947969) I went to an LLM meetup at a place in Tokyo and it was great. It was a highbrow meetup where all participants were required to bring a demo related to LLM to participate, but about 50 people showed up. The participants were distilled down to the bare minimum, and there were a lot of LLM unemployed. It felt like the beginning of an era to me.
- > [takahiroanno](https://twitter.com/takahiroanno/status/1645427231710416898) LLM unemployed = people who unintentionally quit their job after seeing how great LLM is (including people who recently started their own business)
- > [takahiroanno](https://twitter.com/takahiroanno/status/1645432162223788032) This is the episode. They're going to do it again next month, so I'm hoping for the best.

# Participants' Tweets
.
> [@kenn](https://twitter.com/kenn/status/1645424766864728066?s=20): LLM Meetup Tokyo was so much fun! Thank you everyone!

> [@elmer_mmm](https://twitter.com/elmer_mmm/status/1645427077976567808?s=20): Here is the video of the robot running on #ChatGPT that I showed in the demo at LLM Meetup Tokyo #1! I couldn't hear the sound at the venue, so please check it out! I also put him on a "kachaka" and made him speak multiple languages!

> [@yamaguchi_man](https://twitter.com/yamaguchi_man/status/1645433012140793856): LLM Meetup Tokyo was great - I learned a lot from the various things people are trying to do in the search area!
> In our case, it's a combination of rule-based and other things that we're trying to do.

> [_mkazutaka](https://twitter.com/_mkazutaka/status/1645443396818079744) I attended LLM Meetup Tokyo! It was fun! It was great to be able to talk directly with each other about what's going on with the prompts!

> [wroorurkwao](https://twitter.com/wroorurkwao/status/1645422069457518593) At the LLM meetup, I wondered what competitive advantages remain? We talked about things like.


> [y_matsuwitter](https://twitter.com/y_matsuwitter/status/1645467743788081152) Material from today's LLM Meetup Tokyo #1. I was experimenting on Saturday and Sunday to see what would happen if I tried to create an Agent with a lightweight LLM that can run on a MacBookPro.

- > [y_matsuwitter](https://twitter.com/y_matsuwitter/status/1645469554573971456) Even though it is a small model, ReAct's Prompt is English-based, so I think it would work better if I focus on both categories and tasks and Fine-Tuning. I'd like to try Fine-Tuning on Colab with GPT-3 data next.

>  "Agent and Lightweight Model Validation"
- > [erukiti](https://twitter.com/erukiti/status/1645378192923041792) "I started a team because I want to do LLM (myself and my ML team)"
- >  Powerful and
- > [erukiti](https://twitter.com/erukiti/status/1645378327635697664) "I want to make Japan LLM as a national policy"
- >  "Large companies are surprisingly reluctant."
- > [erukiti](https://twitter.com/erukiti/status/1645379093058449408) "I'm sure many of the people who come to LLM Meetups are interested in an agent that works independently."
- >  Yes
- > [erukiti](https://twitter.com/erukiti/status/1645379633121218560) "If you combine LangChain and agent too much, it will take too long to get a response."
- > [erukiti](https://twitter.com/erukiti/status/1645380011309010945) "The main question today is, can we ReAct with LLaMA.cpp or Alpaca or something?"
- >  "Bottom line is that with the current free lightweight model, it's impossible."
- >  Vicuna 13B 4bit and RWKV also seem to be impossible
- > [erukiti](https://twitter.com/erukiti/status/1645380375835967488) Personally, I think we should generate a lot of datasets for ReAct using GPT-4 and fine-trune them. I think so.

> [masa_kazama](https://twitter.com/masa_kazama/status/1645422048238538752) I gave a LT at the LLM Meetup titled "Differentiable Search Indexes". I'm looking forward to new search methods in the generation era that are different from keyword and vector searches.

> [@AkihisaShiozaki](https://twitter.com/AkihisaShiozaki/status/1645320688746762242): Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, visited Japan to attend the LDP PT on AI evolution and implementation. Citing the active use of ChatGPT in Japan, he said, "I hope Japan will demonstrate a large presence and leadership in the world through the utilization of AI. The following seven proposals were made with expectations for Japan.

- > [@overlast](https://twitter.com/overlast/status/1645362088934789127?s=20): all seven of these proposals are proposals that would reduce the technological capability of Japan's domestic 4 years into the future. And the force of the reduction is different for each one. I would like to see something like these proposals implemented in Japan. And if OpenAI implements the proposals as a for-profit company, and the Japanese government and municipalities do not give preferential treatment to each measure, then it is simply convenient, so it seems to be OK!

> [chiral](https://twitter.com/chiral/status/1645055988331077634) Preparations for tomorrow's LLM Meetup Tokyo. We're preparing for tomorrow's LLM Meetup Tokyo. We're going to have two gorgeous (but not too expensive) sessions: Help Desk AI (EmbeddingsAPI,Weaviate,CompletionAPI, hosted by docker-compose on in-house PC) and LINE Chat Divination AI (LangChain,Flask. ngrok, hosted by colab, and connected to LINE MessagingAPI)! ngrok to connect to LINE MessagingAPI)!

> [tdualdir](https://twitter.com/tdualdir/status/1643497897269547008) I'll join you here!
>  I will demonstrate automating table data preprocessing using GPT! (Maybe on MatrixFlow in the future.)
