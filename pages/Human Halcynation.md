title: "Human Halcynation"
---

> [@yuiseki_](https://twitter.com/yuiseki_/status/1644340735867756544): I've always felt that [[large-scale language models]] just consistently output plausible things in response to input, but sometimes they output facts. Is it not also true that humans are more likely to see [[Hallucination]]?

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1644352456854487044?s=20): delusion that "AI will tell me the truth" and assume the output is the truth, or when you realize it is not the truth, "AI lied!" and being delusional as if the AI had unethical intentions seems to me to be a human harcination.

> 1: Assume that the LLM always outputs the truth
> 2: Consider that the LLM intended to lie when it outputs something that is not true.
> 3: Assume that the LLM knows later than the training data.
> What else is there to say?

>  >noricoco: I commented on this article this morning in Nikkei Think! Many reporters seem to think that "by learning misinformation, chatGPT makes mistakes", but mechanically, maybe not, but from the output state, chatGPT itself fabricates? I think there is a high possibility that the chatGPT itself is fabricating the information.
