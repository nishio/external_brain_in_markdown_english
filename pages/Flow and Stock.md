title: "Flow and Stock"
---

- [Flow and stock are the cutoffs of whether most of the information is [[one time reference]] and [[a place to drift away]], or whether it is organized, maintained, and [[repeated reference]]. The [[Synchronous and Asynchronous]] cutoff is highly correlated, but not equal.
[Facebook 2017-10-13](https://www.facebook.com/1129148772/posts/10213531908028608/)

- Where information is referenced only once and flows away.
- A place where information is repeatedly referenced and organized

    - Chat, a place for [[synchronous communication]], is a typical flow
    - But [[asynchronous]] mail also flows quite well
        - Most tools do not have [[Permalink.]] to share with others for past emails
        - No permalinks, so cannot [[indication]] "I told you in this email" for past emails
- [[Scrapbox]] is a tool that can be used synchronously, but is very much a stocking place

- Stock is [[passage of time]].
