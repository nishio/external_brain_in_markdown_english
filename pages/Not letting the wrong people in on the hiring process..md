> [fuuuuuta21](https://x.com/fuuuuuta21/status/1574360383497846785) I usually talk about human resource development/organizational development, but I think the basic premise is "don't hire the wrong people", especially the three types of people depicted in the image. I think that the three types of people depicted in the image are "people who will be evaluated if they make a mistake in judgment, but be careful".
