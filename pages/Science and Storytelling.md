title: "Science and Storytelling"
---

Some academic approaches are good [[scientific methodology]] and some are not.
Those who are in a position to seek scientific methodology are concerned about [[falsifiability]].

What is in a position to do otherwise?
There is a position that uses a weaker constraint than disprovability: "the system is [[inconsistent]].

For example, a system that defines "positive number: a non-negative number minus zero" and "negative number: a non-negative number minus zero" is consistent. [[tautology]] "X is X" is also consistent.
