I have often used the term [[KJ method]], but considering that KJ method itself is a concept to which many things are attached, that there are many people who interpret it differently from the meaning I want to convey, and that people who have not mastered KJ method cannot understand it if I explain it in words, I think it would be better to use a more open expression.
