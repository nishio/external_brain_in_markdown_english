title: "Capitalists v.s. workers"
---

The "[[capitalist]] v.s. [[laborer (labourer)]]" conflict was established when the main means of [[increased productivity]] was to use [[capital]] (money) to buy production equipment. Then computers came along and the weight of [[knowledge]] increased, but some people are still stuck in [[antagonism]]. This is an example of the difficulty of updating the [[frame of mind]].

- [[knowledge capital]]
- [[SOC]]
- [[False dichotomy]]
- [[frame of mind]]   [[Existing framework]]
- [[Framework of the past]]
