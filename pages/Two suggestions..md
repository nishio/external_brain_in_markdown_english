> If you want your proposal to pass, you need to come up with two proposals, because with one, you're more focused on criticizing it, but with two, you're more focused on comparing which one is better, so it's easier to pass your proposal.

If there's one proposal, it's "A or not A," but if there are two, it's "A, B, or nothing."
