[[GPT-4.5]] released

[[Scott Wu]] compares it to [[Sonnet3.7]].
Is GPT 4.5 stronger as an architect and Sonnet stronger in actual coding?
Well, they touched both before they were released and made the decision to include Sonnet in their product, so I guess that's what they're doing.
> [ScottWu46](https://x.com/ScottWu46/status/1895209597084017073) GPT-4.5 has been awesome to work with. On our agentic coding benchmarks it already shows massive improvements over o1 and 4o. Excited to see the models' continued trajectory on code!
>
>  One interesting data point: though GPT-4.5 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet score similarly on our overall benchmark, we find that GPT-4.5 spikes more heavily on tasks involving architecture and cross-system interactions whereas Claude 3.7 Sonnet spikes more on raw coding and code editing.

>  GPT-4.5 has operated wonderfully. Our agent coding benchmarks already show significant improvement over o1 and 4o. I look forward to seeing the continued trajectory of the model on the code!

Pass the image of "<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Achievements/icon' alt='Achievements.icon' height="19.5"/>" to ChatGPT 4.5 for cleanup.

(4.5) The following is an image of a clean illustration.
- Frames are carefully arranged.
- Facial expressions should be simple and clear (happy face, normal face, sad face)
- Boxes should be neatly rectangular and letters inside should be centered.
- Balance and equalize the placement of each frame.
- Unify line thickness
If there are no problems with this, the clean-up process will begin.

Whoa, you have a good grasp of the elements of the image (I hope).

You can't do that at all!

But I haven't caught up with my diagram output skills, but my diagram comprehension skills have improved a lot.
If I can get a tool to render the SVG, import it as an image, and compare it, I might be able to do the task properly by repeating it internally a few times until I get it right.
