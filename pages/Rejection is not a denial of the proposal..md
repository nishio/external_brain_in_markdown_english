- >  The [[rejection (of an application)]] message (comments and advice from the PM) in [[unexplored junior]] is originally a copy of what the IPA's Unexplored Project is doing, and some PMs write quite a lot of text to propose future action plans. Why do some PMs devote so much time to it? The reason why PMs devote so much time to this is because rejection is not a denial of the proposal!
- > All 127 proposals submitted have the potential to create value by continuing. We are allowed to read your proposals and think about what is great about them and predict the future, but these are just speculations. That's why we take the time to write a rejection message, because we want you all to continue as much as possible!
- > If you have many other themes you want to work on, it is of course fine to develop other ones. It is important to have the curiosity to jump on a theme that you find interesting. Thanks to your support, we are able to continue the Unexplored Junior every year, and we look forward to seeing everyone's applications again next year, the year after, and as often as possible. 🙇‍♂️
