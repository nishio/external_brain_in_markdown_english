title: "Is X enough?"
---

Interesting because I observed the statement "Is X enough?" twice in one day with different content.

When we talk about "using X to do Y," the question is, "Is X enough?" question
- We should try "do Y with X" first and observe what's missing, right?
    - If you add a lot of stuff first, you won't know what you really need, will you?
        - [[YAGNI Principles]]
- Adding a lot of things increases the cost of implementation, so shouldn't we minimize that first in creating [[the MVP]]?
