title: "Linux is utilitarian"

- > The assertion that "this would be better for practical use" has a clear use case or rationale, but if you are stuck on ideals or ideology, it becomes a matter of being able to sympathize.
- > Yes, yes. If you stick to an ideology, people who don't understand the ideology won't be able to follow you at all, but if you insist that "this one must be more convenient," you can break down the argument by saying "no, no, this one is more convenient" or by bringing up a different use case.
- > "Stubbornness of idealism" can't be disproved, but "stubbornness of [[pragmatism]]" saying "this way is more convenient," or "there are these problems with that way," will convince them.

> When discussing correctness, "X is correct" tends to mean "your claim that X is not correct". If you feel that someone else says "your argument is not correct" and you lose your temper and argue "no, I am right", you will end up in a sterile dispute.
> On the other hand, when discussing usefulness, "X is useful" tends to mean "X is useful for the purpose I envision. When disagreement arises, the question, "What purpose do you envision?" and a productive discussion to clarify the purpose begins.
