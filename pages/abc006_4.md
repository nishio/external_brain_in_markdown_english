- Thoughts.
    - There are a lot of general operations that I'd like to limit more.
    - Is there an optimal solution that moves 1 first?
        - Not necessarily.
        - If 1 is at the beginning from the beginning
        - To move a number before 1 backward
            - For example, 3,1,2 is once if you move 3, but not if you bring 1 to the top.
            - Is it OK to choose the first or last value from the one with the furthest distance?
    - Regarding "selecting the first or last value from the one with the furthest distance
        - Never move the same number twice.
        - Assuming we don't move the number of the farther distance...
        - 3,2,1,6,5,4
            - Doesn't look too bad? I need more certainty.
        - Consider [number of events (e.g. accidents, crimes, meetings, housing starts, hits on a web page)
        - The number of falls is reduced by the number of times the number at the end jumps over the number greater than the number in front of you.
        - The maximum number of overturns in a column of length N is the triangular number T(N-1)
        - hmm
    - I want to show that "move the one with the larger number of overturns among the leading or trailing values to the end" is the correct greedy algorithm.
        - After moving it, it comes down to one smaller problem.
        - Correct when N is 3.
        - The number of moves is monotonically nondecreasing with respect to the number of falls, which seems to be the case, but I can't show it.
    - Look again at the constraints
        - 300,000
        - I don't know how to calculate the number of falls.
- Official Explanation
        - [[The order of operation is irrelevant.]]
            - You can think of it as pulling it out and putting it back in [All at the same time
        - In that case, the condition that works is "monotonically increasing the remaining rows that are pulled out."
