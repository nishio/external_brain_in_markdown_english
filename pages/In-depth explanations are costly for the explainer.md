In-depth explanations are costly for the explainer
- Parallel Diary" is obviously a coined term.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Can you explain this to someone who has not had the "experience of multiple people writing journals on Scrapbox"?
    - Depends on the depth of the explanation?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I feel I can explain the situation.
    - Are you explaining the situation so shallowly that those who hear you understand?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - If we participate in the topic with that shallow understanding, will we be able to have a useful discussion?
        - If not much useful return is expected, where is the incentive for the explainer to bear the cost of explaining?
            - That's what I thought when I wrote it.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - I couldn't really think of a situation where the person being described would want to hear it.
