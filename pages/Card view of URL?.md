title: "Card view of URL?"
---

from [[pKakidashi]]
Card view of URL?
- [[Embedly]] could do it.
    - Ease of copying and pasting is compromised.
    - Should the text be put up as written?
    - I still want the image to unfold.
    - Wouldn't you be happy to see oembed expanded in the export tool?
    - Would you rather have a bookmarklet that clips the selection with the source?
