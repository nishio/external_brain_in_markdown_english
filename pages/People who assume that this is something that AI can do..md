OLD TITLE: People who assume "this is something AI can't do" without knowing what AI can do

Associated from [[If you can't do what an AI can't do, you are considered less valuable than an AI.]]
- To "be able to do what AI can't do," we first need to know "[[what]] AI can do.
- It's bad enough that they are doing "[[what AI can do]]" without knowing it and assuming that "this is something AI can't do."
