title: "Bias and Variance"
---

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/> [[bias]] ([[Bias]]) is the degree to which something is systematically deviated from its true or ideal value when it is measured or estimated. [[Variance]] ([[Variance]]) is the degree to which the results of the same measurement or estimation can vary when repeated many times.
- Bias: How far off the average
- Variance: the amount of variation in measurement or estimation results

In the darts example, the bias is "which direction the arrow is biased" and the variance is "how much it is scattered". This is used not only in statistical analysis and machine learning, but also as a general concept when evaluating something.

    - This is going to be confusing because the same term pair is used in different ways.
