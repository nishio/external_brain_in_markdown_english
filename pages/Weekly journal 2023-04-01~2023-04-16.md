- Again, nine days long.
- What did you do?
    - in order of reminder
            - [[ChatGPT for middle and high school students]]
        - [[pScrapboxAutoTrans2023-03-25]]
    - Was the 21st a holiday?
    - So you spent the rest of the business day preparing for the study session and spoke on the 24th.
            - [[Story study session about connecting my Scrapbox to ChatGPT.]]
        - So, he wrote, "In the long run, people will start searching for groupware from LLM."
        - So [[ChatGPT plugin]] was released on the same day.
            - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/日記2023-03-24/icon' alt='日記2023-03-24.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - So we decided that there was no time to rest on weekends, so we proceeded with the development.
            - You don't take time off because it's Saturday or Sunday [[work as life]] and [[you are only responsible for your own actions that you think are optimal.]]
            - If not taking a leave of absence makes you sick, you can take a paid leave of absence at that time, and if you run out of pay, you can take a leave of absence.
- The connection between input and output, a lot of people don't seem to get it.
    - Is it even difficult to explain it in a way that you can understand?
    - Maybe it will be easier to understand over time.
    - Many people seem to be interpreting it as [[altruistic behavior]], but I doubt if that interpretation is correct.
            - [Atlas, who happens to be able to afford it, is propping up the celestial sphere.
        - Throwing out cash appears to be a spirit of sacrifice because we don't share the perception that [[cash is]] weak capital.
        - Isn't it [[long term investment, not altruism]] to convert weak capital into stronger capital in the future?

- That said, you should finish reading "[[Atlas shrugs]]" because I don't think you should use it beneficially as a concept if you haven't finished reading it.
        - [[Useful as a concept]]
