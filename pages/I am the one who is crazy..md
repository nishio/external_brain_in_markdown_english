title: "I am the one who is crazy."
---

A. "Is the world crazy or am I crazy?"
B "If there's a chance I'm crazy, then I can't identify myself."
A "Yes, so I think, 'It's possible I'm crazy, but it's futile for me to think about it, so let's not.'"
B "Yes."
A. "That's the natural way to think, but there are a lot of people in the world who don't consider the possibility that they're crazy."
B "Now that's thinking the world is crazy without considering the possibility that you're crazy."

- I feel it's close to [[boomerang joke]], but I think the structure is peculiar.
