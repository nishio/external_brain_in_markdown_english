[LP, Graphs and Formulations](http://tokoharu.github.io/tokoharupage/docs/formularization.pdf) [[tokoharu]]

    - [[shortest route]] issue and LP
    - Special case of minimum cost flow
        - If there is enough capacity on the edges and the distance is a cost, the cost of one flow and the distance in the shortest path in the original graph match.
        - [[differential constraint]], colloquially [[embarrassingly bad video game where the object is to make the audience laugh]] (POJ 3169(Layout))
    - [[maximum flow]] issue and LP
        - [[maximum flow minimum cut theorem]]
        - [[maximum circulating flow]] Issue.
    - [[least-cost current]] and LP
    - Least Cost Circular Flow] problem with minimum flow constraint
    - Potential difference maximization problem under difference constraints
    - [[Project Selection Problem]]

- [[dual linear programming problem]]
