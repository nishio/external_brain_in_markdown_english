A "I think it's lame that your behavior is influenced by how others see you."
B "Yes."
A "So we can't stop this behavior X."
B "Hmmm, I'm not sure about that either... I think my behavior is being influenced by my concern about being considered 'lame' by an entity I don't understand..."

#boomerang joke
I think I saw a similar composition in a cartoon I saw on Twitter, but I didn't like it, so I couldn't find it.
Maybe it wasn't such a blatant use of the word, but more like a story where the protagonist realizes the equivalent of B's point...
