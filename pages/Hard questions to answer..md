Hard questions to answer.
I saw a case where Y does not have to be X to do Z, with the statement "Is there a Y that is X, and I want to do Z?
- If you answer, "There is no Y that is X," you are not given the means to do Z.
- If you only answer the question, "I want to Z," then you're ignoring the first half of the question and advising where the question isn't.
- Well, I just saw it, and I don't have to answer it, so I just note that it's an interesting case study.
- I wonder what people are thinking when they go to all this trouble to formulate questions that are difficult to answer.
    - I said something similar to a friend when it wasn't this case and he said, "I don't think about it," so maybe it's the same this time.
