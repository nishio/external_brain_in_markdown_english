    - The more you increase [[abstraction]], the less [[tools you can use]].
- The higher the level of abstraction, the more [[usable]] the range.

I saw my Scrapbox mentioned in [/villagepump/complex-logarithmic-function](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/complex-logarithmic-function).

relevance
    - [[Highly abstract concepts have a wide range of applications.]]
- [[Abstract concepts have a wide coupling range]].
