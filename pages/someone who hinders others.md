title: "someone who hinders others"
---

- There are certain types of projects that take longer to accomplish.
    - For example, diet
- Some people point out to those who are working on such projects, saying, "You're not getting any results at all.
- I used to think of people like that as "I've never worked on a time-consuming project myself, so they don't understand how time-consuming it is."
- My wife says there's a pattern of people who have worked on it but failed, and they're trying to make you fail.
    - I do it because I don't want to attribute my failures to myself personally.
    - I'd like to think the project failed because it was difficult.
    - When others succeed, it becomes clear that you are just incompetent.
    - Invite a dieter to a cake buffet.
