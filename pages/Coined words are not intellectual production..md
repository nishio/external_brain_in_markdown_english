title: "Coined words are not intellectual production."
---

- It is not [[intellectual production]] to do [[coined word]].
- When [[Useful Concepts]] / [[Useful Cuts]] are found as a result of intellectual production and there are no appropriate words to describe them, they are coined as [[Concept Handles]] after the fact.
- If a person who sees the coined word feels that the [[concept]] / [[section]] it refers to is [[useful]] and tries to use it himself, the coined word is used because a handle is needed to use it. Only then does the coined word become a [[shared vocabulary]] among several people.
    - As the number of people sharing the concept increases, [[social proof]] of its [[concept's]] usefulness is gradually established.
- Coined words that no one found useful are not [* shared vocabulary

memo
- No need to be [* shared vocabulary
    - If using that handle benefits my intellectual production, it's a useful coinage.
- I have often used the word "concept," but I felt it would be better to elaborate more on what kind of concepts are often useful.
    - It is not at all difficult to create a concept, for example, one can name "a number that is a square number when the decimal notation is reversed" as an "inverse square number". Not very useful.
- I thought one concrete example of one step (but not all) would be "[[section]]".
    - The "[[section]]" page was blank, so I generated it and got a good one.
