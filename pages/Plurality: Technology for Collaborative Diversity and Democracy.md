from  [[What is Plurality?]]
- Original source: [Plurality:. Technology for Collaborative Diversity and Democracy - RadicalxChange](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/plurality-technology-for-collaborative-diversity-and-democracy/#english)
    - It's hard to put it in Japanese, but it could be called "plurality: technology for [[diversity to collaborate]] and [[democracy]]".
    - The document is a proposal for a new concept of "Plurality", so I did not apply a translation.
    - The corresponding concept Singularity is translated as "Singularity", so it was aligned with it and katakana was used.
