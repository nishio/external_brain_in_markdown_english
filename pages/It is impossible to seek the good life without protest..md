title: "It is impossible to seek the good life without protest."

> [masahironishika](https://x.com/masahironishika/status/1828906597340643778) The "stop complaining about politics and society and do the best you can" teaching is really bad.
>  >kouta_hikichi: Also, the more time you have, the angrier you get. When you are about to get angry and criticize someone, think about whether you yourself are doing what you should be doing. If you have time to criticize others, just do what you have to do. x.com/kouta_hikichi/...

> [yuhto1118](https://x.com/yuhto1118/status/1829112757712826594) As I have written before, the hidden harm that this teaching brings to society is great, so I will write the words of [[Nelson Mandela]] to counter this.

> [ya_hoken26785](https://x.com/ya_hoken26785/status/1829134944997912891) Thank you. Mr. Mandela, you are wonderful. I would also note the words of [[John F. Kennedy]]. "Think not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country."

> [yuhto1118](https://x.com/yuhto1118/status/1829230923155681765) To speak out in criticism against unreason and evil. That would be what we can do for our "country".

I did a quick search and couldn't find the source.
