- Anomic suicide" by [[Emile Durkheim]] is described in detail in his book "[[Suicide Theory]]. Durkheim called "anomie" a situation in which [[social norms]] and values are weakened or uncertain. In such a state, individuals become confused, disoriented, and unable to find clear guidelines for their actions and life purpose.
- Anomic suicide is the result of such social disruption and breakdown of norms. Rapid changes caused by economic crises, wars, social changes, etc. can make it difficult for individuals to find a stable [[social role]] or [[identity]], which can lead to an increase in [[suicide]]. Durkheim viewed anomic suicide as a social phenomenon and emphasized the impact of social structure and culture, as well as individual psychological factors, on suicide rates.

> Anomie (French: anomie) is a term used to describe a state of anarchy or irregularity caused by the relaxation or collapse of social norms. The French sociologist Emile Durkheim was the first to use the term as a sociological concept.
[Anomie - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8E%E3%83%9F%E3%83%BC)

> In "[[Suicidology]]," anomie is defined as a state of disturbance of desire and value that occurs when people's desires increase without limit due to economic crisis or rapid growth, and the conflict that arises is anomie.
>  ... [[anomic suicide]] (French: [[suicide anomique]]) was defined as something that tends to occur in individuals who experience personal frustration, agitation, disillusionment, and other conflicts as a result of the over-exuberance of desire due to rapid social change, sexual liberalization, and other factors.

> The American political scientist Sebastian de Glazier, following Durkheim, distinguished between simple anomie and acute anomie, and typified anomie-based [[value conflicts]].
> In his article "[[Social Structure and Anomy]]," American sociologist [[Robert King Merton]] posited that anomie occurs when a gap exists between cultural goals and the institutional means to achieve them. This argument is called "[[tension theory]].
