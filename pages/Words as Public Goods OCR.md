Encounter with Plurality
The "Plurality" book by
Audrey Tang and Glen Weyl
The multiverse has already arrived.
You'll hear and see "奇點即將接近".

"Plurality: Technology for Collaborative
Diversity and Democracy"
格唐 Concept of "broad listening"
lotus-shaped pedestal for a gravestone
Technology... Collaborative Diversity...
Oh, it's about Technology to "build a society
brimming with teamwork" !
Technology for Collaborative Diversity... This is the technology to create a society full of teamwork!
"people can hear the distilled essence of the
distribution of opinion of their peers,
empowering democratic deliberation at scale"
Technology that allows people to understand the distribution of opinions among a large number of their peers: enabling large, democratic deliberations.
Oh, it is a technology that augment the
ability to understand the opinions of many
other people. It is augmentation of
intellectual productivity!
It's all about increasing your "ability to understand the opinions of the many," your intellectual productivity!

So I made Japanese Translation Forum
![image](https://gyazo.com/81c4ec60826b273b033eb281160cb2c0/thumb/1000)
System Overview
• Source of the book is on Github repository
• I forked that repository and
●
implemented automated
●
daily translation flow
using the GPT-3.5 API
Then, considering the need
for a space where Japanese
people could freely discuss
the contents of this book
in Japanese,
I created the forum
using Scrapbox.

Good understanding is the
foundation of good translation
. The translation is a distant goal.
The base text has not yet been finalized.
●
• Therefore, we are not limited to the content of the book.
We also translate more compact finalized peripheral
information.

How can a better

Building network of knowledge

social differences.

The process of tying two
items together is the
important thing.... he builds
a trail of his interest ... his
trails do not fade.
-Vannevar Bush (1945)

Road:
infrastructure for good understanding
By storing "trails of interest" as links, roads are created.
●
●
Then those roads help the understanding of those who
come later, just as roads assist in the movement of people
We are homesteading the world of knowledge.

Two languages
Interesting observation
. There are two languages
in the plurality repository.


When I tried using both as inputs for machine translation,
I often found that translations from Mandarin resulted
in more natural Japanese than from English.

Another Example:
In Glen's "Why I Am a Pluralist”(2022)
and Its Mandarin version: 為何 我 是 多元宇宙人
I borrowed Tang Feng's poems, and I will try to make them into a poem.
We will be the first to show you the "All things connected network" and "Wisdom connected network".
We will be able to share the real world with you.
Seeing "learning devices", we will cooperate in learning.
We will experience the "experience at home" and we will experience the people we meet.
。
You will hear and see "奇點即將近" -- please remember: "數位" will be here soon.
• When we see “internet of things”, let's make it an internet of beings.
• When we see “virtual reality”, let's make it a shared reality.
• When we see “machine learning", let's make it collaborative learning.
• When we see “user experience", let's make it about human experience.
• When we hear “the singularity is near", let us remember: the plurality is here.

"Plural languages"
helped my understanding!
●
When I first saw this poem in English,
I didn't quite understand it.
It became clearer to me after seeing the Mandarin version.
Is it the power
of the road?
Character.

In "Why I am a Pluralist"
about "Plural Thinking”
Whether one subscribes to versions of the
Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis,
according to which some thoughts are
unthinkable in some languages, or softer
accounts, clearly some languages are better
adapted to expressing certain thoughts
than are others, so these linguistic
differences matter in some ways and reflect
the conditions of the societies that host them.
Some languages are more likely to express certain ideas than others

![image](https://gyazo.com/3078a19e2d9944b822cefd53cd92db7a/thumb/1000)
Speakers of languages with a vocabulary that
describes a concept in greater detail can
handle that concept more efficiently.
Speakers of a language with a vocabulary that describes a concept in more detail can deal with that concept more efficiently

Sometimes a word in one language
have no corresponding word
in the other language Sometimes there is no corresponding word in the other language
●
Example: In a discussion on "democratic processes" at
Code for Japan, a participant expressed the opinion:
"Democratic process is a process that generates as much
₁ (Nattoku) feelings as possible among a wide range of
people.
"A democratic process is a process that creates buy-in from as many people as possible."
""
• I felt 1 (Nattoku) on the opinion.
●
But... how to translate (Nattoku) into English?

![image](https://gyazo.com/172deac36f01e0a871a16b57c07debf3/thumb/1000)
(Nattoku)
'' can be translated as
'agreement' or 'understanding' in English
Japanese

English
Agreement
Understanding

![image](https://gyazo.com/e269ba0b51ea422ed034347988528227/thumb/1000)

However, I feel that 'agreement' is more
akin to '', and 'understanding' to ''
Japanese
agreement

English
Agreement

There is a void in English.

All languages are full of voids
So we need to collaborate
There is a void in English,
but it's not a problem unique to English.
All languages are full of voids,
and when we think in only one language,
we fail to notice them.
• That's why we need to collaborate with speakers of
different languages.

Japan is hierarchy+consensus
• Japan is
extremely hierarchical,
but extremely focused on
consensus, a kind of outlier.
Many Japanese think the
culture outdated in an era of
global communication.
I agree. We need to change
our mindset and behavior.
. However, Japanese
vocabulary may help
understand the social
harmony in higher
resolution.

Attitudes toward decision making can range along a continuum from strongly top-down to strongly
consensual; attitudes toward authority can vary from extremely egalitarian to extremely hierarchical.
