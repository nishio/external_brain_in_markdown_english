🤔Import screen, should there be a button for easy editing on iPad?
    - What buttons do you need?
        - cursored front and back
        - selective shrinkage
        - deletion
        - backspace (char)
        - Cut the selection and bracket it to another line
        - Line break = line break at cursor position
        - End of line, beginning of next line
