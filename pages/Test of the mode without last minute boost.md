- Is there anything else about this "last minute boost"?

I started asking questions like this early on, citing old stories instead of last minute ones.

Long Conversation Test
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Conversate for some length of time in a mode without last minute boosting to see how it feels.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "last minute boost" is this "last minute boost"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Focus on keywords contained in a person's immediately preceding statement.

- >  Talk for some length of time in a mode with no last minute boost to see how it feels.
- Is there anything else about this "last minute boost"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I'm thinking it's necessary for a chatty experience.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Normally, it would feel natural to ask questions about what the other person has said just before the chat.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>If the computer remembers all statements equally, the longer the dialogue goes on, the more likely it is to rehash very old stories.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "statement" is that "statement"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Human input.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The human memory is so inferior to the computer that it's like, "What? What are we talking about?" and you feel like you've lost your backbone.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Those with more solid memories than humans. So I dare to design it so that the memory of the past fades away to suit humans. I've been writing this down for a while, but haven't started. I haven't started it because the last minute boost was enough for practical use.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Human beings should be able to produce intellectually without stress.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Is it the subject of intellectual production? Answering questions brings out what has not yet been verbalized.

- What would you like to see happen regarding this "human"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's good to have stationery that allows for stress-free intellectual production.

- Where do these "computers" come from?

impressions
- unexciting
- Is this because I know too much about the inner workings?
    - I'd like to have 100 people who don't know anything about it talk to one side with boosting and one side without boosting and compare the excitement.
- Conversation Features
    - For a new word, "What X is it?" and then, usually immediately after, "What else do you have?" is on.
    - The cumulative score (the value indicating the keywords to dig into) doesn't change much from one statement to the next.
