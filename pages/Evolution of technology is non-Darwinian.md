            - [[Darwinian evolution]] principle is "random -> more successes by chance."
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/412e80e57ad1c4ce0f06dd06584c9173/thumb/1000)
        - Aim for better efficiency than random by creating "[[methodology]].
    - This "methodology" is itself [[Applicable Knowledge]] and therefore a hierarchy
        - Edge of hierarchy is "random"
                - [[Random is the worst methodology]]
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/22722fdd009411a0cc39fd49246366f1/thumb/1000)
    - The role of [[economy]] is to determine success or failure

        - Test for commercial availability
        - ([[Kevin Kelly.]]) Society's [[collective free will]].
        - Items with a variety of uses
            - = something that [[couples]] with many things
            - = high [[integrity]].
            - There is a positive bias ([[openness bias]]) toward [[openness]].
