    - [coleman chairs resort chairs](https://amzn.to/4576mme)
- I bought it because I heard some talk about taking it to the park and relaxing.
    - tiresome
    - If you stay still, the mosquitoes will come.
- That's why I stopped using it.
- I used to use it on my balcony, but after 5 years of exposure to rain, it broke.

I thought about buying the same one, but figured I'd rather have a new experience, so I bought a different one at random.
- I like that it has a footrest so I can stretch my legs.
- It's got a pillow.
- It is so comfortable that I feel uncomfortable putting it on the balcony and leaving it out in the rain.
