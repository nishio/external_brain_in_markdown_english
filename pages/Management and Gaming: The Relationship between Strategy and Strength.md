Discussion on the relationship between management and games
- Nishio, Tachikawa, and the other men exchange ideas about scheduling and replaying wargames, as well as about the relationship between mahjong and management.

- Nishio: After all, isn't it beneficial to act with [[full of confidence]] in a situation where there is [[Uncertainty]]`? Also [mahjong]. Or [brah] in [poker]. Pretending to have a strong hand even if you don't have a hand in. Pretending to have a strong hand in a situation where it would be more advantageous to pretend to have a strong hand, irrespective of whether the hand is actually strong or weak. I think the ability to separate the two contributes to this.`




Nishio: Tachikawa-san kind of went silent, though.
Tachikawa: They are just silent because they talk too much.
Male Y: (laughs)
Nishio: The first thing I want to confirm is what is going on with regard to today's time schedule?
Tachikawa: Oh, almost perfect. You just somewhat put an end to the discussion, didn't you?
Nishio: Yes.
Tachikawa: So my plan is to have one last wargame and end at 9:00.
Male Y: Oh, I see.
Nishio: He said he would do it one more time at the end.
Tachikawa: Then doesn't it feel kind of good? Don't you want to try it again in this situation?
All: (laughs)
Nishio: We were talking about something that seemed to be rather business management 01:47:05 〓 but we could have been talking about how to win a wargame, and then I would like to try it again. 〓01:47:13〓Because we were even talking about the need to talk about it up to 〓01:47:13〓as a strategy.
Tachikawa: That's right. When I played with Mr. Nishida, I felt that a person who is a strong wargamer is a stronger manager than a person who is a strong mahjong player. Can someone who is a strong mahjong player be a strong manager? I am almost certain that a manager is a strong mahjong player. I am not a good mahjong player. Actually.
Man X: I'm weak at mahjong too.
Tachikawa: They are very weak.
Man X: Yes, that's right.
Tachikawa: I thought it would be better to be stronger somehow.
Male X: I don't know about that.
Nishio: It's not about getting stronger at mahjong, it's about getting stronger at management.
Tachikawa: I hope that mahjong will become stronger as a result. My objective is to become stronger in management.
Nishio: I wonder, isn't it still about acting confidently in a situation of uncertainty and circumstance? Mahjong, too.
Tachikawa: Ah.
Nishio: It's like bluffing in poker. Pretending to have a strong hand even if you don't have a hand in.
Man X: Oh, I see.
Nishio: In situations where it is more advantageous to pretend to have a strong hand, you pretend to have a strong hand regardless of whether the actual hand is strong or weak. You have to separate the two, don't you?
Tachikawa: Yes, yes, yes. Then let's do one last time.
