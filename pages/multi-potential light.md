    - A [[multi-potential light]] is someone who is interested in many things and pursues [[creation]].
    - You can rephrase it with other words like "[[pundit]]" or "[[Renaissance man]]."
    - In fact, in the [[Renaissance]] era, the ideal person was someone who was versed in a number of disciplines.
- Strengths of Multi-Potential Light
    - The first is [[Integration of ideas]].
        - It's about combining two or more disciplines and creating something new where they intersect.
            - [Innovation happens at intersections, and that's where new ideas are born.
        - Multi-potentialites with different backgrounds have easy access to many [[intersections]].
    - Second, [[Ability to learn quickly]].
        - Multi-potentialites are [[being completely absorbed in]] when they are interested in something
            - We absorb as much as we can get our hands on.
            - I'm used to being a [[beginner]].
            - Because a lot of times I was a beginner.
            - I see what you mean.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - You don't know how to [[run off]] if you haven't been doing it long enough where you're a beginner.
                    - [I am afraid of not knowing.
        - So they're not afraid to start something new or step out of their comfort zone.
                - [[comfort zone]] <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Many skills can be applied in different areas.
            - I bring skills I've acquired in the past to new areas, so I rarely have to start things from scratch.
            - It's rarely a waste of time to pursue something you're drawn to, and even if you stop, the knowledge you gain can be applied in completely different fields and in ways you never imagined.
    - The third is [adaptability
        - This is the ability to adapt to whatever situation you encounter.
        - Can change roles to meet customer needs.
        - Individuals and organizations that can easily change direction in a rapidly changing global economy will be able to meet the needs of a market in the midst of growth.
- The integration of ideas, the ability to learn quickly, and adaptability are three skills that multi-potentialites excel at and can lose if forced to [Focus.

- [[Multipotentiality]]
    - [Multipotentiality - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipotentiality)
    - > A term in education and psychology that refers to the ability or disposition of a person to excel in two or more different areas, especially if he or she is intellectually [[curiosity]] or artistically curious.
    - >  "Multipotentialite" has been proposed as a designation for someone with this characteristic.
    - > In contrast, a person whose interests are mostly within a single field is called a "[[specialist]].

        - The axis of conflict [[Specialists and generalists]] translates as [[false dichotomy]].
