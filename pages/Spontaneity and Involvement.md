title: "Spontaneity and Involvement"
---

- We often say that [[spontaneity]] is important, but that doesn't mean it's not good to take actions that are not spontaneous.
    - [[entanglement power]]
    - [[power of manipulation]] [[Tomoya Tachikawa]] [3 steps to enhance your "power of manipulation" to enrich your life | Yosuga Marriage Consulting](https://yosuga-kekkon.com/2018/12/post-698/)

A good percentage of what I do is initiated by [[being swept up in]].

I think there might be some better choice of words.
This is my [[unresolved problem]].

No spontaneity.]" If "[[triggered by the involvement of]]" occurs and you "take care of it all," it's "[[No spontaneity.]]
- If [[selection]] and some "[[say no]]", is it "Involved" = "[[Proactive Underwriting]]"?

I casually used [[independence]] and [[spontaneity]] above without making a very clear distinction, but perhaps this should be properly distinguished.
It is not a "[[spontaneous]]" case, because the trigger is generated by others, but it is a "[[proactive]]" case, because it is my decision to participate or not.
