Q: Is the result of [[broad listening]] the will of the people? (Isn't it not the will of the people?)

A: First of all, I feel that you are not observing reality correctly in the first place when you think that "[[the will of the people]]" exists.

In particular, to think that "[[the will of the people]]" exists as if it were the will of a single person is a mistake that misrepresents a group of people as if they were a single person.

from  [[Why Politics Fails]]
- When one person's opinion is considered a vector, "everyone's opinion" is a set of vectors and cannot be considered the same vector as one person's opinion because it has a distribution spread that is not a single point

    - To connect types, we need an [[aggregate function]], but since there is no single correct aggregate function, "which aggregate function to choose" is itself subject to [[social decision-making]].

I think JAPAN CHOICE did a good job in choosing the phrase "[[public opinion map]]".
- It's not a "map of public opinion," and it shouldn't be called "visualization of public opinion," it should be called "[[visualization of opinion groups]]."
- This does not mean that there is a "will of the people," but that there are people with diverse opinions.
    - A cluster is "a group of people who have similar opinions".
