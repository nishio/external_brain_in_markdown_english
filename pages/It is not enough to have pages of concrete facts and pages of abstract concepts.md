- Having a [[Concrete Facts Page]] and [[Abstract Concepts Page]] is not enough
#Scrapbox Best Practices

[/shokai/2 hop link](https://scrapbox.io/shokai/2 hop link) said
- Scrapbox can be fun if you consciously write two types of pages
    - concrete fact
    - abstract concept
        - Existing technical terms
        - Appropriate sentences that make it easy to recall the content
- Because it is easy to generate unexpected links of "concrete -> abstract -> concrete" and "abstract -> concrete -> abstract" by 2-hop links.

The occurrence of unexpected and surprising links ([[serendipity]] support) is one of the advantages of Scrapbox
- Use it as an "engine for generating new knowledge links" rather than a "warehouse of dead texts."

But the important point is not "there are pages of concrete facts and pages of abstract concepts".
I think it's [[how to give a title]], how to make a page for an abstract concept.

Common behavior patterns
- Create pages for specific book A, book B, and book C = pages of specific facts
- Tag each page as "book" = abstract concept page.
This is a poor idea in terms of "creating serendipity."
For example, when I'm looking at a page of an economics book, I'm not happy to see a suggestion for a linguistics book because it's a book.
Why is it that this pattern is not good even though "create and link concrete and abstract pages" is satisfactory?
- The title of the abstract page is a tasteless "book"
- The concept of an abstract page doesn't sound particularly interesting.
    - Are you really interested in the concept of "books"?
    - If you put the tag `books' on each book page, you will see a list of those pages on the `books' page."
        - Are you really going to look at that page in the future?
        - Too abstract of an abstract concept.
                - Pattern on the right side of [Do not classify.
        - I don't put a `book` tag on the entire book. I use the author's name as a link, so if you look at [Shigehiko Toyama page](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/%E5%A4%96%E5%B1%B1_%E6%BB%8B%E6%AF%94%E5%8F%A4), his books and references to him appear in the link
- Abstract concept page is not recognized as a "page" and is thought of as a tag, so it is an empty page

How to make the abstract concept page "good" is important, but what that "good" is has not yet been verbalized.
