title: "If you keep talking about it, your memory will be tampered with."

> [@kikumaco](https://twitter.com/kikumaco/status/1526423348376309760?s=21&t=RYCf-0hmkvqM0I7KjqgxkA): if you keep talking about your experience, [[memory]] gets falsified. When there is an audience, the danger is very great. The story is changing more and more into a story that is "received." This can't be helped. Human memory is unreliable.
> I am consistently critical of the "[[(professional) storyteller]]" approach. Because the memory of the teller changes.

Experience should be [[text format]] while it's fresh
