title: "Understanding Conviviality: Tools for Autonomy and Interdependence"
---

[[Conviviality]] is a term translated into Japanese as [[Autonomous Coexistence]], [[Shared Joy]], [[Communal Pleasure]], or [[Festivity]]. [[Ivan Illich]] chose this word to express his ideas, knowing it differs from the common English meaning (a festive atmosphere).

To understand "tools for conviviality," it's helpful to first explain the concept in terms of physical objects and then abstract it. This is concisely summarized in "Tools for Conviviality," p.39:
- > People need more than just access to goods. They need, above all, the freedom to create the things that make life possible, the freedom to shape them according to their preferences, and the freedom to use them to care for others. Prisoners in wealthy countries often have access to more goods and services than their families, but they have no say in how these goods are made or how they are used. Their punishment lies in being deprived of what I call autonomous coexistence (conviviality). They are reduced to mere consumers.
- > To clearly oppose industrial productivity, I choose the term autonomous coexistence (conviviality).

In essence, "[[mere consumers]]" are deprived of conviviality, while having the "freedom to create things" signifies a state of conviviality. Therefore, "tools for conviviality" are tools that grant the "freedom to create things."
    - For example, I once read about children who wanted to play a card game but had no one to read the cards aloud, so they wrote a program using [[Scratch]] to do it. This is an example of creating something to care for themselves. Scratch can be considered a tool for conviviality.
    - They are not trapped in the mindset of "we can't create, we only buy and consume."

Regarding "things," Illich includes "[[faith]]" and "[[education]]" as well. (This is where it becomes more abstract.)
- For instance, if schools are places that provide "mass-produced, packaged, uniform education from above," Illich believes this deprives people of conviviality, making them mere consumers of education. This is what Illich argued against in his earlier work, "[[Deschooling Society]]."
    - Conversely, the child who programmed with Scratch is in a good state of conviviality.

Translating "freedom to create things" as "autonomous coexistence" might not resonate with many people. Context needs to be supplemented.
- Illich was originally a Catholic priest but left church activities in 1969 after opposing the Pope's missionary dispatch to South America in 1961.
- If the church is a place that provides "mass-produced, packaged, uniform faith from above," this is not good. Especially since it was done with financial aid, creating dependency among local people.
- Illich opposed this and later used terms like "deschooling" and "conviviality" to articulate why it was not good.

    - In this context, "[[autonomy]]" means not relying on top-down arrows, and "[[coexistence]]" means living in connection with those around you.
    - The explanation of conviviality as "individual freedom realized within human interdependence, and as such, possessing inherent ethical value" (p.40):
        - It is individual freedom not imposed by top-down uniform faith but realized through mutual dependence and cooperation with those around you, forming its unique ethical value.
    - A convivial society is "a society that serves politically interconnected individuals, not people managed by modern technology" (p.17).
        - In other words, it's a society where science and technology are used for the people on the bottom right, not for the top-left square.

A convivial society is "a modern society where tools are responsibly limited" (p.18).
- Without limits, [[mass production]] occurs, creating the structure on the left side of the diagram.

- "Tools" here refer not to hand tools used by humans but to devices and technologies capable of mass production.
- Although not confirmed to be Illich's words, the invention of radio and television, which allowed broadcasting packaged information to large audiences, leading to the rise of mass media, follows a similar structure (2024 note).

Considering "festivity" in this context:
- This "festivity" is not a festival experienced as a "mere consumer" watching an event run by others.
- It is a [[festival]] "created by ourselves."
- The purpose of creating it is to entertain those around us (enjoying together = [[communal pleasure]]).

Aside:
- An interesting expression "convivial army" appears on p.34, referring to guerrilla soldiers.

    - After understanding "freedom to create things," I couldn't see why it relates to "festivity," so I found this document.
    - Reading this, I understood why the term "autonomous coexistence" was chosen.
    - Even after reading this, I still think expressing this concept as "festivity" is not ideal.

---Trigger
- In a [discussion](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/Computer_Graphics,_Media_Art,_Tea_Culture,_and_Zen#61bac9e3aff09e00007c4951) on [[Computer Graphics, Media Art, Tea Culture, and Zen]], there was a mention that "even if work can be done via Zoom during the COVID-19 pandemic, something feels missing, and what fills that gap is conviviality."
    - I didn't fully understand "Yanagi focused on folk crafts as a means to regain conviviality."
    - The reason I didn't understand was that I roughly recognized "conviviality" as "something like having a festival."
    - I didn't understand the flow of the conversation about "there's no need to bring conviviality into video conferences, but rather make tea at home or place or create art."
        - I thought, "A festival broadcasted via video conference where tea is made??"
    - The key concept is "not being mere consumers of mass-produced goods, but creating things to entertain oneself and one's family."
    - I also understand why they corrected from "placing art" to "creating art."
        - Simply buying and placing art feels more like industrial consumption.
    - I understand the focus on folk crafts.
        - Folk crafts are the beauty of everyday items created by unknown artisans for living.
        - It's convivial production, not mass production.

---Question
> "X must become a '[[tool for conviviality]]'"
> This X can be replaced with SNS, "metaverse," groupware, or virtual office spaces.
- [[Considering Small Talk at SIGGRAPH ASIA 2021#61bc7d1aaff09e000082faec]]
- Around this time, I began to think that the concept of conviviality might be useful in discussing the "pros and cons" of groupware and the metaverse.
    - At this time, I still recognized "conviviality" as "something like a festival."
- This connected positively.
    - > My thought that "a virtual office should not just be a world created by someone else that you simply enter and use, but something you can modify yourself" means "being placed in the position of mere consumers of something created by someone else is a deprivation of conviviality, a state where the freedom to shape things according to one's preferences is taken away."

        - > Minecraft is a tool for conviviality
        - > It provides the freedom to create what you want, the freedom to change its shape as you see fit, and the freedom to create things that help others, thanks to its multiplayer nature.
- Is Zoom a convivial tool?
    - In the sense that "users can choose their conversation partners and topics," it is a convivial tool.
    - If you only "participate in top-down assigned meetings" without creating your own conversations, you are a "mere consumer" of meetings.
        - You have a tool that can be used convivially, but you are not using it convivially.

---Past Logs
2021-12-17<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Despite having various translations, it doesn't sit well because, in Japanese, the corresponding concept isn't a compound word made of foreign kanji but rather "It's a festival, wasshoi!"
- 2022-01-06 Completely different. The author himself clearly states, "It's not used in the sense of a festive atmosphere," so looking it up in the dictionary was pointless.
    - see [[Kozaneba:Conviviality]]

[[convivial]]
> Borrowed from French convivial, from Latin convīvium (“a feast”), combined form of con- (“together”) + vīvō (“to live”).
> Having elements of a feast or of entertainment, especially when it comes to eating and drinking, with accompanying festivity
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> I looked it up in the dictionary like this, but it was clearly stated "not in that sense," so it was completely pointless.
