Nounification" is a trait that treats actions like static objects, while "obsession with the nominal form" is an assumption that adheres to the nominal form. The "post-LLM worldview" states that "what has not yet been verbalized" cannot be the object, and "the hook for fishing out what has not yet been verbalized" requires a provisional word to verbalize the unverbalized concept.

Speaking with Verbs" explains the importance of using "verbs" rather than "nouns" to describe the design of the experience and the world we are striving to create. Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis" concludes that it is important to think deeply about the relationship between language and thought, especially the use of "nouns" and "verbs.

The verb form is better than the noun form," he says, preferring to write "production facilities become services" rather than "production facilities become services. The "not the continuity of an individual thing" suggests the viewpoint that an individual thing does not continue to exist, but rather is transformed into another individual thing.

Jiro Kawakita stated that "Jiro Kawakita did not say to abstract," because the word "abstraction" itself is abstract, so it is not clear what specific action should be taken when one is told to "abstract." In Study Session 1 of "Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning," he states that "felt meaning" is involved in the "idea."

From the above information, we can conclude that it is important to think deeply about the connection between nominalization and verbalization, their importance, and how they influence thought and action.

In "Tentative Words," he states that training oneself to express one's experiences in words is the first step toward connecting words with concrete sensations and experiences. In "It is difficult to verbalize what we don't understand," he states that it is absurd to try to explain it in neat and tidy words.

### Considerations and questions

Given the relevance of the "superficial coined words" fragment, it seems important that the concepts to which the words refer be useful when creating the words. Considering the relevance of the "Judging by Actions" fragment, it would seem that not only words but also actions are important in making words. From these perspectives, what factors should be emphasized when creating a word?

In addition, given the relevance of the "post-LLM worldview" fragment, it would seem that training in expressing one's experiences in words would be important. But how should that training be conducted? And what do we think we can gain through that training?

Nominalization is the trait of treating an action as if it were a static object, while preoccupation with the nominative form is the assumption of adherence to the nominative form, which is related to nominalization.

The "post-LLM worldview" states that "what has not yet been verbalized" cannot be targeted, which is related to nominalization. The "hook for fishing what has not yet been verbalized" states that "a provisional word is needed to verbalize concepts that have not yet been verbalized.

Speaking with Verbs" explains the importance of using "verbs" rather than "nouns" to describe the design of the experience and the world it aims to create. It also discusses the difference between "make" and "use," and points out the different perspectives that each expression represents.

Sapir-Whorf's Hypothesis points out that names vary by language and culture, and concludes that it is important to think deeply about the relationship between language and thought, especially the use of "nouns" and "verbs."

He states that "verb form over noun form" is better written as "production facilities are serviced" than "production facilities are serviced." He points out that we should avoid "obsession with the nominative form" and that the nominative form tends to be more abstract.

The phrase "not the survival of an individual thing" states that, apart from the viewpoint that an individual thing persists as an individual thing, there is another viewpoint that considers that an individual thing does not persist and passes on to another individual thing. The phrase "verb, not noun" is related to this.

Jiro Kawakita stated that he does not know what specific action to take when told to "abstract" because the word "abstract" itself is abstract.

He states that he has washed up the occurrences of "monika" in the Zhuangzi, and there are not many places where "monika" is used as a nominal symbol.

In Study Session 1 of "Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning," he stated that "felt meaning" is involved in the "coming up with an idea." He stated that in the process of "coming up with an idea," there is a "thumbing of a state that has not yet been verbalized."

From the above information, we can conclude that it is important to think deeply about the connection between nominalization and verbalization, their importance, and how they influence thought and action.

In "tentative verbalization," he states that training oneself to express one's experiences in words is the first step toward connecting words with concrete sensations and experiences. He also stated that by reviewing and brushing up on the tentative verbalization over time, the words can be made more accurate and expressive.

In "It is difficult to verbalize what we don't understand," he states that it is absurd to try to explain it in neat and tidy words. It is important to write it down first, even if it is just a list of fragmentary keywords.

Nounification" is a linguistic feature that names an action, treating the process as if it were a static object. This turns movement (verb) into static matter (noun). This concept is referred to in diverse fields.

The "post-LLM worldview" states that "what has not yet been put into words" cannot be the object. This is related to the idea of nominalization. Also, in "Hooks for Fishing Out What Has Not Yet Been Linguified," he states that tentative words are needed to verbalize concepts that have not yet been verbalized.

In "Obsession with the Nominative Form," it is noted that adherence to the nominative form is an implicit assumption. This is related to the idea of nominalization.

The "subject enlargement program" shows that enlarging the subject could be useful in supporting ideas. This is related to the idea of nominalization.

In "Naming Nishio's Own Way," he states that naming a concept turns that concept into an operable object. This is related to the idea of nominalization.

In Kozaneba Shugyo, he states that externalization of thoughts is important. This is related to the idea of nominalization.

### Considerations and questions

The idea of nominalization is relevant from diverse perspectives, including targeting the unspoken, creating a provisional word for verbalization, adhering to the noun form, enlarging the subject, naming the concept, and externalizing the thought. Is it possible to explore the impact of nominalization and its efficacy more deeply from these perspectives? And how can the idea of nominalization be used to improve intellectual productivity?

Disable [nounification
from  [[NLP Handbook]]  p.225
> Within the meta-model, there is a linguistic feature called nominalization. When a sequence of actions is given a name, the name treats the [[process]] as if it were a motionless "[[used after a phone number to indicate that it is a switchboard number]]. Naming and nominalization thus transform [[movement]] ([[verb]]) into [[still matter]] ([[noun]]).

There are references from diverse fields related to this concept. We will summarize them later.
