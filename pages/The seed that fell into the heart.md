The seed that fell into the heart
## [[Seeds that fell from the heart]]
- The time it takes for a seed that has fallen into the heart to sprout and blossom. This metaphor describes the process by which a new idea or feeling grows and eventually transforms into something beautiful. Within this metaphor is the beauty of a reality that is not rushed and can only progress at the proper rate of growth.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamed-project/neko/icon' alt='/unnamed-project/neko.icon' height="19.5"/>
