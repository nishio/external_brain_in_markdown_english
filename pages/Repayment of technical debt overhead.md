> [@t_wada](https://twitter.com/t_wada/status/1407145045577244673?s=20) [[technical debt]] The key to creating a backlog for repayment and setting a fixed weekly quota is the "debt repayment quota [[lending money and taking advance interest]]" method. It works better than the "do it when available", "limit fixed weekly hours", and "negotiate each time you want to do it" methods. / "Use velocity well to systematically eliminate technical debt."
Lower negotiation costs than negotiating as soon as it becomes necessary
