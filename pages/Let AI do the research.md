title: "Let AI do the research"
---

I was using [[OpenAI Deep Research]] and felt "this is not [[research]] because it is just a collection of what someone has already written".

    - Research": In Japanese, the emphasis is often on the pursuit of academic and systematic knowledge or [[experiment]] ・in-depth inquiry through investigation.
    - "Research": In English, "research" can refer to "investigation and exploration" in a broader sense, from academic to market research and technological development, and can also be used as a verb.

I want them to do "research" in the experimental scientific sense and generate new findings.

I tried.
