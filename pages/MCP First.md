title: "MCP First"

> [takoratta](https://x.com/takoratta/status/1908706693787312523) MCP is going to be a game changer. Many services are going to die if things continue as they are now. There is no first-mover advantage, and if there is, it is how much valuable data you have. The services we have now will either die or be transformed significantly.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1908745955618455866) The development process of web apps has been shifting from PC-first to [[mobile-first]] with the advent of mobile devices, and I thought that there is a possibility of shifting to [[MCP-first]] in the future. I thought that there is a possibility of transition to "MCP first" in the future.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1908746443663564849) If you let an AI assistant write code normally, it will reproduce code based on existing code and adapted to the existing environment, so there is potential for major environmental changes. Sometimes there is a risk of new participation in the "dying side"
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1908748347672056194) I'm thinking about the relationship between API first and MCP first.

> [takoratta](https://x.com/takoratta/status/1908781683123662983) I agree. Furthermore, there is going to be another level of innovation in MCP clients.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1909616987669778733) AI says "MCP makes UI devises like web front-end lose value", but that's like saying you don't need a GUI if you can control everything with a CUI. It's like saying that if you can control everything with CUI, you don't need GUI. I think it's different because language is not the only channel of human cognition. Also, humans don't adapt to new interfaces with their feet on the ground.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1909617856633094240) Whether by physical characteristics, learning ability, or lack of will to learn, we all have different interfaces growing on us, or seemingly the same interface, or the interface may look the same but perform differently.
