>  However, we begin to tackle the challenges we see somehow, and as we work hard to solve them, we forget to ask, > "Is this really a challenge worth solving? In the process, we forget to ask, "Is this really worth solving?
>  Moreover, even if they begin to realize halfway through that "solving this problem is not worth it," they still continue with the [[unprofitable effort]] endlessly, thinking, "I have spent so much time and energy to get this far, so it will be a loss if I don't solve it to the end.
>
>  Many people who achieve great results go through mediocre questions, ask [[sensible questions]], and try to answer sensible questions.
>  Focus on identifying [[assignments that are worth solving]] and start trying to solve them to determine the value of the assignment.
>  [[cutting one's losses]] is also fast. As you continue to work on the assignment, you may find yourself saying, "Oh, maybe this assignment is of low value." If you feel that the value of the issue is questionable, you quickly cut your losses, broaden your perspective, dig deeper into the question, research, examine, and find a higher quality issue.
>  Continue to fine-tune the issue itself as you solve it. We will continue to focus on the high-value issues and less on the low-value issues.
>  In this way, we build up quality and quality results in every detail.


[[Unworthy effort]].
