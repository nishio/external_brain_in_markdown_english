title: "Questions encourage verbalization, but there are different kinds of questions."
---

- [Questions encourage verbalization.
- The term "[[question]]" is ambiguous and [[Low resolution]].

When I was being asked questions on Keichobot, I did indeed have the experience that "questions encourage verbalization".
I don't feel it is very beneficial in regards to the AI asking questions in Scrapbox.
- Often delete the list of questions

Why or what is the difference between the two experiences?

Keichobot's question is always one of
- It has the effect of narrowing the focus to it.
- Entering the flow state by trying to answer the question
- The effect is to keep thoughts from wandering off and to keep them connected to the theme.
- Requires a statement of either "answer" or "make a decision not to answer" by being in the chat UI

AI questions that live in Scrapbox
- Lots of it.
    - The question arises as to which to choose.
- Sometimes very essential and difficult questions to answer.
    - I think this is a good thing.
    - I think it would be beneficial to try to answer
    - But it could take a year to get an answer.
    - Appearance and requirements do not match as interaction is designed
    - It appears over time, gradually accumulating related things, and at some stage they are connected and the answer is found.
- Often ask stupid questions
        - [[No bad questions.]] I know I should, but why do I feel like crap?
        - [[smart-ass]] I know it's a [[smart-ass]] question.
        - 'Smart' thinking with hooked brackets
        - Questions based on empty smarts that are superficially smart and have no core are so sterile that they are atrocious.
    - Maybe it's not a good idea to order them to ask questions.
        - It's [[question for question's sake]].
        - I don't see any useful development from answering that question, so I'm not willing to devote the resources to answering it.
    - In actual use, I have found that I am more driven by "I see" or "No, that's not how I interpret it" when I see a description than when I am driven by a question.
