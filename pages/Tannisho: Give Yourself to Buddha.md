> Listen to the voice of Buddha and face your own weak and foolish nature.
>  The teachings of [[Shinran (third highest of the eight hereditary titles)]], the founder of [[Jodo Shinshu (offshoot of the Jodo sect)]], are full of paradoxes and innovations, as exemplified in the phrases "[[Shoki]] the Evil One" and "[[Become a Fool and Live]]". The teachings of [[Shinran (third highest of the eight hereditary titles)]], the founder of [[Jodo Shinshu (offshoot of the Jodo sect)]], are full of paradox and innovation. Therefore, it attracted not only the common people but also many intellectuals in modern Japan. This book explores hints for those of us living in the modern age from Shinran's words in "Tannisho" and his way of life filled with suffering and contradictions. A special chapter has been added for a "deeper understanding of Shinran's thought," beginning with his encounter with his teacher Honen.
