    - I believe that [[Philosophers]] possessing programming skills is an important means of opening new perspectives.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - [[Programming Languages are Languages]], created to describe problems in specific domains. Knowing about programming languages is beneficial for thinking about language and the description of meanings through language. This contributes to philosophy.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Your perspective is very intriguing. Indeed, programming languages, each with their own grammar, syntax, and mechanisms of abstraction, are languages designed to solve specific problems. They serve as tools for deepening understanding of the description of meanings through language and, more broadly, the structure of thought itself.
    - I have summarized your viewpoint as follows: "Programming languages are languages created to describe specific problem domains, each with its own grammar, syntax, and mechanisms of abstraction. These characteristics can serve as tools for thinking about language and the description of meanings. Therefore, learning programming languages can be a beneficial means for philosophers to deepen their understanding of language and thought."
    - This perspective opens new avenues for delving deeper into the intersection of programming and philosophy, while also respecting the fact that not all philosophers need to learn programming languages.

    - The hypothesis that the thoughts one can execute change depending on the language learned, implying that people who have not learned programming languages are incapable of certain types of thinking.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - The viewpoint you raise is related to the classic debate about the role of language in thought, namely the '[[Linguistic Relativity Hypothesis]]' or '[[Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis]]'. This hypothesis argues that human cognition is shaped by the language spoken, which greatly influences how the world is categorized and understood.
    - Applying this concept to programming languages, the idea emerges that different programming languages offer different perspectives and approaches to problem-solving, thus shaping the thoughts of programmers.
    - Considering this, your assertion can be mildly expressed as:
            - "Programming languages are a kind of language that provides specific approaches and perspectives for problem-solving. The unique perspectives and tools offered by each programming language shape the thoughts of its users, opening new possibilities for thought. Therefore, learning programming languages can be a beneficial means for expanding the scope of thought and unlocking new possibilities. Philosophers learning programming languages might gain new perspectives and approaches to philosophical problems."

    - People who use multiple programming languages experience firsthand the differences in expressive capabilities based on the language. Also, paradigm shifts in natural languages take time, but in programming languages, they happen much faster. For instance, one can experience the rise and fall of [[Object-Oriented Programming]].
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Your perspective provides a very clear and insightful view on how programming languages differ from natural languages and how they influence thought and expression.
    - Each programming language is designed based on a specific [[Paradigm]], such as procedural, object-oriented, functional, etc., and these paradigms significantly impact the expressiveness of the language and the way of thinking of its users. Your claim can thus be summarized as follows:
            - "Users of programming languages experience differences in expressive capabilities based on the language. Each language is designed based on specific paradigms like procedural, object-oriented, functional, etc., and these paradigms affect the expressiveness of the language and the way of thinking. Unlike natural language paradigm shifts, which take time, programming language paradigms evolve relatively quickly. Thus, a programmer can experience the rise and fall of paradigms like Object-Oriented Programming within their lifetime. This experience provides deep insights into the relationship between language and thought, and how the evolution of language influences thought."
    - This perspective offers extremely useful insights into how the mastery of programming languages can influence patterns and perspectives of thought.

...

- How do shifts in programming language paradigms affect a programmer's thought process and solutions?
- How do paradigm shifts in natural languages differ from those in programming languages?
- How does the expressive capability of programming languages influence thought?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - The method of modeling the world changes. Knowing multiple paradigms inevitably makes multiple ways of modeling the world visible, and one gains the ability to choose among them. The paradigm shift in programming languages happens faster than the generational change of thinking humans; it is driven by the generational change of programming language processing systems. By knowing many paradigms, thought becomes capable of expressing the world in many different ways.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - The perspective you have put forward provides deep insight into the relationship between programming language paradigms and thought, particularly how understanding and choosing paradigms influence thinking and modeling of the world.
    - Each programming language, based on specific paradigms like procedural, object-oriented, functional, etc., influences the expressiveness of the language and the way of thinking. This leads to the idea that the ability to understand and choose different paradigms expands the ways of thinking and modeling the world.
    - Here is a summary of your perspective:
            - "Programming language paradigms influence how we model the world, i.e., our methods of thinking. Understanding multiple paradigms diversifies the methods of modeling the world and cultivates the ability to choose among them. Paradigm shifts in programming languages are quicker than human generational changes, propelled by the generational changes of programming language processing systems. Thus, understanding many paradigms enables thought to express the world in a variety of ways."
    - This perspective clearly shows how learning and understanding programming languages can broaden approaches to problem-solving and ways of understanding the world.

- I see [[philosophers]] having programming skills as an important way to open new perspectives.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- [[Programming languages are languages]] designed to describe problems in a particular domain. It is useful to know about programming languages in order to think about language and the description of meaning by language. This contributes to philosophy.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Your point of view is very interesting. Indeed, programming languages are languages for solving specific problems, each with its own grammar, syntax, and abstraction mechanisms. These are tools to deepen our understanding of the language's description of meaning and, more broadly, the structuring of thought itself.
    - Your perspective is summarized as follows: "Programming languages are designed to describe specific problem domains, each with its own grammar, syntax, and abstraction mechanisms. These properties can be tools for thinking about language and the description of meaning. Therefore, we believe that learning programming languages can be a useful way for philosophers to deepen their understanding of language and thought."
    - This perspective opens new avenues for delving deeper into the intersection of programming and philosophy. It also concretely demonstrates the value of learning a programming language, while also respecting the fact that it is not necessary for all philosophers.

- Hypothesis that the thoughts that can be executed vary depending on the language one has mastered; people who have not mastered a programming language are incapable of certain types of thinking.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>
- This perspective you have raised speaks to the classic argument about the relationship between the role of language and thought, namely the "[[linguistic relativity hypothesis]]" or the "[[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]]." This hypothesis argues that human cognition is shaped by the language we speak and is heavily influenced by how that language categorizes and understands the world.
- Applying this idea in the context of programming languages leads to the notion that different programming languages offer different perspectives and approaches to problem solving, which in turn shape the thinking of the programmer.
- Taking that into account, your argument can be mildly phrased as follows
    - A programming language is a kind of language that offers a particular problem-solving approach or perspective. The unique perspectives and tools provided by each programming language can shape the thinking of those who master it and open up new thinking possibilities. Therefore, learning a programming language can be a useful means of broadening one's thinking and unlocking new thinking possibilities. Philosophers learning programming languages may have new perspectives and approaches to philosophical issues."

- Those of us who use multiple programming languages know from experience that there are differences in expressive power among languages. Also, while [[paradigm shift]] in ordinary natural languages takes time, it is much faster in programming languages. For example, one person can experience the rise and fall of [object-oriented
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>
- The perspective you describe provides a very clear and insightful view of how programming languages differ from natural languages and how programming languages affect thinking and expression.
- Each programming language is designed on the basis of a particular [[paradigm]] (e.g., procedural, object-oriented, functional, etc.), and that paradigm has a significant impact on the expressive power of the language and the way the user thinks. Taking this into account, your argument can be summarized as follows
- Users of programming languages experience differences in expressive capabilities across languages. Each language is designed according to a particular paradigm (e.g., procedural, object-oriented, functional, etc.), and that paradigm affects the expressive power of the language and the way it thinks. Also, whereas paradigm shifts in natural languages take time, programming language paradigms evolve relatively fast. Thus, it is quite possible for a single programmer to experience the rise and fall of object-oriented programming. This experience provides deep insight into the relationship between language and thinking, and how language evolution affects thinking."
- This perspective provides an extremely useful viewpoint from which to examine how the acquisition of a programming language affects patterns of thinking and perspectives.

...

- How does a change in the programming language paradigm affect the thinking and solutions of programmers?
- How does the paradigm shift in natural languages differ from the paradigm shift in programming languages?
- How does the expressive power of a programming language affect your thinking?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Methods of modeling the world will change. By knowing multiple paradigms, we inevitably come to see multiple ways of modeling the world and acquire the ability to choose between them. The paradigm shift of programming languages takes place faster than the generational shift of thinking human beings, but it is caused by the generational shift of thinking programming language processing systems. By knowing many paradigms, thinking becomes able to express the world in many ways.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>
- The perspectives you raise provide deep insights into the relationship between programming language paradigms and thinking, and in particular how our understanding and choice of paradigm affects our thinking and modeling of the world.
- Each programming language is designed according to a particular paradigm (e.g., procedural, object-oriented, functional, etc.), which affects the expressive power of the language and the way it thinks. In this way, the ability to understand and choose between different paradigms broadens how we model and understand the world, i.e., how we think.
- Below is a summary of your point of view:
    - The paradigms of a programming language influence how we model the world, that is, how we think. Understanding multiple paradigms fosters a diversity of methods for modeling the world and the ability to choose among them. Paradigm shifts in programming languages are faster than generational shifts in humans, and are driven by generational shifts in programming language processing systems. Thus, understanding many paradigms enables thinking to utilize a variety of representation methods to represent the world."
- This perspective clearly demonstrates how learning and understanding a programming language broadens our approach to problem solving and the way we understand the world.
