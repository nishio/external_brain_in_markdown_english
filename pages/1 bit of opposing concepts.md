title: "1 bit of opposing concepts"
---

- Like "A or B?" [[the exact opposite concept (idea)]].
- Only one bit of information is available.
    - [[information volume]] is low
    - Pushing [[real life events]] into an oppositional concept is a huge loss of information.
        - [[False dichotomy]]
        - [[Resolution of reality]] is low.
