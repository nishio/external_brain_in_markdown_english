title: "Minimum wage is designed to cripple parasitic industries."

> [@philomyu](https://twitter.com/philomyu/status/1686745234217058306?s=20): I wrote about this in my book a long time ago, but when I was researching the background of the establishment of [[social security]] and [[minimum wage]] systems I was amused to find that it was based on the argument that "it is not good for the country if we allow companies that are parasites of society to do unproductive work and offer only bad treatment to their workers, so let's make it possible for workers to quit with peace of mind.

    - > Mr. and Mrs. Webb and the National Minimum
        - > In her report, Beatrice Webb recommended that unemployment should be reduced through the creation of public employment agencies (similar to Hello Work in Japan today) and public works projects. He also stated the idea that the government should guarantee a "[[national minimum]]" or a "minimum healthy and cultural life" for those who cannot work.
        - > The Webbs also believed that prohibiting child labor and providing compulsory education, as well as protecting the safety and health of workers, would increase their ability and willingness to work, and ultimately their productivity as an industry. On the other hand, they called industries that lacked these considerations and were economically inefficient "[[parasitic industries]]" that would always pay their workers low wages. The Webbs argued that the key to the British economy was how to transform parasitic industries.

- > The idea is that if the government guarantees a national minimum to workers, parasitic industries will run out of workers and collapse, and only highly efficient industries that can pay above the national minimum will flourish.
- > In contemporary Japan, there are many workplaces called "[businesses that exploits its employees (e.g., unpaid overtime, etc.)" that pay low wages, do not invest in employee productivity, and sometimes even create mental illness due to a lack of safety and health protection. They are also the ones who have been told by Mr. and Mrs. Webb that they are "not investing" in the company. They, too, are what Mr. and Mrs. Webb would call a parasitic industry.
- > Against this background, the Minimum Wages Act was passed in 1909, and the National Insurance Act was passed in 1911, creating a public, compulsory health insurance and unemployment insurance system in the United Kingdom. In 1908, the Pension Scheme, a compulsory insurance scheme, was also established. However, Mr. and Mrs. Webb were opposed to the unemployment insurance system from the standpoint of "eliminating unemployment itself.
- > The United Kingdom was the first country in the world to introduce a public compulsory unemployment insurance system, while [[health insurance]] and [[pension insurance]] were introduced in Germany in the 1880s by the iron-blooded chancellor [[Bismarck]], who "preferred to learn from the experience of others rather than from his own experience. The UK followed suit with its introduction.
