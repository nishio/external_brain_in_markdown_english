- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Looks interesting.

If we can resize the image and place it on the server, it would be good because CustomImage can place it in the world.
[[CustomImages]] can specify images by URL, so using [[Gyazo]] is easy.

Height and width are fitted in multiples of 128.
- Not maintaining the aspect ratio, subtle ~.
Sometimes when you put it up, it's bigger than you thought it would be.
- I wish I could specify max-width or something.
