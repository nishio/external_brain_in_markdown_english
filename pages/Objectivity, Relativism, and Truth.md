The following is a summary of Richard Rorty's 1991 book Objectivity, Relativism, and Truth. This book is a collection of articles Rorty wrote between 1980 and 1989.

# central claim: [[Antirepresentationalism]]
The central philosophical argument Rorty presents in this book is "anti-reproductionism." He opposes the traditional view in Western philosophy that knowledge is an exact "reproduction" or "mirror" of "reality" by mind and language. Instead, he advocates the pragmatist view that knowledge is "habits of behavior learned to cope with reality. According to this view, the value of a belief or theory depends not on whether it "fits" into a sincerely independent reality, but on how effective it is in helping us cope with the world and achieve our goals.
This position aims to dissolve many traditional dualisms in philosophy, such as subject-object, mind-world, language-fact, and phenomenon-reality.

# Part I: Solidarity or Objectivity?"
In the first part of the book, Rorty applies his anti-reproductionism to understanding science, inquiry, and interpretation.
- [Solidarity and Objectivity:
    - Rorty contrasts two primary ways in which humans search for meaning. One is the quest for "[[objectivity]]," or the attempt to transcend the community to which one belongs and establish a connection with an impersonal, universal reality. The other is the quest for "solidarity," i.e., to consider oneself a member of a particular community and to be proud of it.
    - Rorty believes that the objectivity tradition (from Plato to the Enlightenment) is an attempt to seek metaphysical solace and to find universal criteria for evaluating any culture by "reason" or the "scientific method."
    - Rorty abandons the pursuit of objectivity and instead insists on embracing "[[joint]]." From the pragmatist perspective, "truth" is "what we believe is good," and the criteria by which we judge belief can only come from the beliefs and practices of our own community. He calls this position "[[ethnocentrism,]]" not in a derogatory sense, but in that we cannot escape the constraints of our own history and culture and can only depart from existing beliefs.
- [Science as Solidarity:
    - Rorty challenges the special status of science as the epitome of "objectivity." According to him, science succeeds not because it has a special way of getting in touch with "reality itself," but because it has established an outstanding communal practice model of "solidarity." The virtues of science are moral virtues: tolerance, respect for the opinions of others, and reliance on persuasion rather than force. The scientific community is a model of "[[non-coercive]] consensus" and can therefore serve as a model for other cultural domains, such as politics and the arts, but this does not mean that science is "epistemologically superior" or "more rational" than other domains.
- [[Texts and Lumps]]: Rorty seeks to bridge the traditional divide between the humanities (dealing with "[[text books]]") and the natural sciences (dealing with "[[lumps]]"). According to him, the so-called "solidity" of scientific facts does not derive from the internal nature of the mass, but from the firm agreement established within the scientific community as to what events constitute evidence. Whether interpreting a text or analyzing a mass, the essence of inquiry lies in "[[recontextualization]]," i.e., the re-description of an object in a new web of beliefs to achieve coherence.

Part II: Pragmatism, Davidson, and Truth
In the second part, philosophical issues such as language, truth, and reproduction are explored in depth, primarily with reference to the ideas of the philosopher [[Donald Davidson]].
- Opposition to "[[the]] correspondence theory of truth."
    - Rorty adopts Davidson's view and argues that the concept of "truth" has no explanatory use. To say that a belief is "true" does not explain why it leads to successful action, but is merely a tool used to show agreement with it or in certain [[Language Games]]. Rorty supports Davidson's "[[consistent theory of truth]]" that [[justification of belief]] arises only from its relation to other beliefs and not from its relation to non-belief "realities."
- [[Non-reductive Physicalism]]:
    - Rorty espouses physicalism, which holds that all events (including psychological events) can be described in physical terms. However, this is not "[[reductionism]]. A psychological event (e.g., a belief) and a physical event (e.g., a brain state) can be two different descriptions of the same event, used for different prediction and explanation purposes. The two descriptive vocabularies do not exactly translate into each other, but that does not mean that the mental world can be "reduced" to the physical world or that one description is more "true" than the other.
    - [[Creativity of Metaphor]] （Metaphor）：
    - Rorty adopts Davidson's view that metaphors have no "metaphorical meaning," only literal meaning. The value of metaphor is that it functions as a kind of "unfamiliar noise" that causes us to reconstruct our web of beliefs and triggers the creation of new language and thinking. This promotes the advancement of knowledge and culture. Metaphor is not the "expression" of new knowledge, but the "cause" of change.

Part III: The Primacy of Democracy over Philosophy
In Part III, Rorty applies his anti-reproductionist philosophical position to the political realm, particularly in defense of liberal democracy.
- [[The Priority of Democracy to Philosophy]]:
    - Following the thought of [[John Rawls]], Rorty argues that liberal democratic institutions do not require "philosophical foundations." Just as Jefferson "[[privatized]] religion," Rolls-style libertarians should "privatize" metaphysical issues such as human nature and the nature of the self and separate them from the public political realm. The legitimacy of a given liberal society's conception of justice depends not on whether it conforms to an a priori "human nature" or "moral order" but on whether it is consistent with the "deeply rooted public traditions" and "deliberated beliefs" of that society.
- [[Postmodernist Bourgeois Liberalism]]:
    - Rorty defends a position he calls "postmodern bourgeois liberalism." This position, while faithful to the institutions and practices of liberal democracy, renounces the traditional Enlightenment philosophy (such as Kantian notions of [[universal human rights]] and reason) that have sustained it. According to this view, morality is not obedience to universal reason, but [[loyalty to the community to which one belongs]] ("[[our intention]]"). The moral subject is a constantly reorganizing web of beliefs and desires without a center.
- [[Ethnocentrism and Cosmopolitanism]]:
    - Rorty believes that acknowledging that liberal ideals (such as procedural justice and human equality) are regional products peculiar to the West does not weaken the reasons we fight for them. Libertarians should embrace this "autochthonocentrism," i.e., admit that we can only depart from our own traditions. But the hallmark of "our people" - Western liberalism - is precisely its openness, its capacity for self-criticism, and its willingness to continually expand the scope of its empathy. Rorty's utopia is a "[[cosmopolitanism]]" in which different cultures and communities are formed through peaceful negotiation and mutual tolerance, like "[[a]] bazaar market surrounded by many exclusive private clubs," rather than waiting for universal humanity to be "liberated."

In summary, Objectivity, Relativism, and Truth is a systematic elaboration of Rorty's mature pragmatist philosophy. He advocates that philosophy abandon its pursuit of objectivity, foundations, and universality and instead embrace a historicist, autochthonous, and dialogical position, arguing that this philosophical position is the best way to defend and advance liberal democratic society.
