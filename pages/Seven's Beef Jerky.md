- black pepper (Piper nigrum)
    - Spicy~!
    - Eating something with a lot of black pepper is spicy until after you eat it.
    - Black pepper is unevenly applied.
    - If you eat a lot of black pepper and then a little less, the spiciness is reduced and you can feel the flavor of the meat more strongly.
