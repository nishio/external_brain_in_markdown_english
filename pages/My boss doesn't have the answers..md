> [s5ml](https://x.com/s5ml/status/1961689269480952197) Let's get rid of the idea that "my boss has the answers" or "I'll work with my boss on the answers". Your boss is ↓ in this situation, so there is no way he/she has the answer to every job. Rather, he/she wants you to bring the answer and convince yourself. That's why I leave the work to him.

- [[Answers]].
        - [[There is no right answer.]]

A picture that could be formed by replacing the boss in "Let's get rid of the idea that the boss has the answers" with [[management]] in the supporter group.
- I feel that you are that type of [[Organizational Culture]] person.
- Working with people from different cultures to achieve results is Plurality-like, so we want to make it work instead of rejecting it.
