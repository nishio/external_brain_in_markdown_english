title: "World Trigger"

My friends strongly recommend me to watch World Trigger.
I'm not in the habit of watching videos, so I thought I'd watch them in the bathtub and forgot all about it.

I told him about seeing [[Mobile Suit Gundam]] and he said, "World Trigger is a modern [[Gundam]].

- I've read up to volume 28.
- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1893501390036631777) I read the World Trigger book up to volume 28, and I really like the story from p.198, but I don't think I would understand it if I read only this part, and I thought it would be quite heavy to recommend reading volume 28 to read this part. I think it's also quite heavy to recommend reading the whole book to read this part.

I felt that it was a very good educational content, as it depicted the perspectives of those whose task it is to judge the work, and those who design the composition itself.

On the other hand, since this is entertainment content, I feel that 90% of what happens is on the interesting side and 90% of what happens in reality is mud.

In particular, the elaborate storyline and characters' actions are attracting attention because of their relevance to real-world [[organizational management]] and [[business skills]]. Below is a natural summary of the main topics seen around the world.

- The first thing that is often discussed is how [[team tactics]] and [[leadership]] are portrayed. In the organization called "Border" in the work, it is carefully depicted how individual members of the team understand their strengths and how they work to achieve the goals of the team as a whole. Many people feel that this is similar to the team management and role assignments required in the real workplace. For example, the strategy meetings in the ranks and strategies that take advantage of each member's strengths are talked about as a reference for project management and collaboration. In particular, the way Osamu Mikumo, one of the main characters, leads his team through situational judgment and ingenuity, despite his lack of outstanding abilities, is taken as a message that leadership can be built through effort and strategy, not talent.
- Second, the perspective of organizational management is also often discussed. Negotiations between border factions and the transition from the old border to the current border can be compared to the process of a company's growth and a shift in management strategy. One person pointed out that the way an organization that started with a small number of elite members and put in place a training system as it grew is like the transition from a startup to a large corporation. Others said that scenarios like the expeditionary selection process show the importance of prioritizing and managing risk in order to achieve results with limited resources. This is one of the reasons why people say it looks like a business book.
- In addition, self-development elements also came up for discussion. Some people say that the idea that "competence is a result" and the way people grow through repeated failures resonate with real-life career development and goal attainment. The fact that the game is decided by calm analysis and preparation, rather than by emotion and enthusiasm, is also said to be a learning experience for businesspeople. One person likened the closed environment test in Volume 28 to "like training to deepen self-understanding and understanding of others," and it certainly seems to be a catalyst for thinking about how individual growth affects the organization as a whole.
- Recently, especially after the release of the latest volume (volume 28), the phrase "[[a business book disguised as a science fiction battle manga]]" has been buzzing on social networking sites, and there is a trend among fans to look back on past volumes from this perspective. However, while some find this view interesting, there are also those who want to enjoy the battles purely, saying, "It's a boys' manga, so there's no need to read too much into it...," and opinions are divided on this issue.

Overall, it seems that a wide range of conversations are taking place about "World Trigger" as a work that can be enjoyed not only as entertainment, but also as a work that reveals new charms when read from a business perspective. What do you think? Please let us know if you have noticed anything after reading it from this perspective!
