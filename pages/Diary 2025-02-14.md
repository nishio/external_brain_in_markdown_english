> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1890078579876340203) As for "[[survival strategies of engineers]]", I feel that the problem is poorly set up when you narrow it down based on the existing occupational category "of engineers", and I am of the school of thought that if a useful solution without [[barriers to entry]] is discussed in a public forum, it will become the next [[red ocean]] and will no longer be useful. I am of the school of thought that if a useful solution without [[barriers to entry]] is discussed, it will become the next [[red ocean]] and will no longer be useful, so it will never be discussed in a public forum.

If you are having trouble hiring, you should do it as soon as possible. If you consider it as hiring fee, $700/month is cheap.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1890273661707514024) I was under the impression that I was comparing it to "$100,000 event sponsorship to gain attention," but it is certainly even cheaper than a recruitment fee.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1890282488557367630) I had a feeling that the discrepancy in AI's sense of the amount of money, ultimately comes down to whether it is [[salary income]] or [[business income]]. What makes the difference with the type of person who can't have a conversation at all is that the other person is a 100% salaried income type.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1890283293083594885) It tends to be attributed to vague concepts like "[[Management Perspective]]", "This is 'expenditure that contributes to earning revenue', so of course it is [[cost]]". is the difference between a culture in which "this is an expenditure that contributes to revenue generation" and a culture in which "this is not an expenditure that contributes to revenue generation" is common sense.


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1890285360003141877) [[Harassment of humans has become more severe]], the competitiveness of [[death-game-like large companies]], which mass hire new graduates with sparkling appearance who can endure harsh examination wars and make them produce results in harsh competitive conditions, is being undermined. AI agents] will enter the market as a target that can be harassed, as the competitiveness of [[large death-game-like companies]] that hire large numbers of new graduates with sparkling looks and the ability to endure harsh exam wars to produce results under harsh competitive conditions is being undermined.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1890285763063124045) Be careful, if you get excited about this situation and harass AI, after about 10~20 years, you will be judged by public opinion retroactively, "It may have been good then, but not now". Be careful.
