title: "Awareness and Rationale"
---

It is one thing to say that a source "makes me aware of a link to other information that I was not aware of" and quite another to say that the content is reliable and makes further [[search]] unnecessary.

In the latter, it is easy to know what is not good enough, but difficult to verify what is not. Rather than "rendering further exploration unnecessary," each individual subjectively determines that it is "unnecessary." Self-awareness aside.

- It makes me aware of other links to information I wasn't aware of."
    - = Show further [Room for Exploration
        - [[The more you learn, the more you don't know.]]
        - [[The more you learn, the more you realize how ignorant you are.]]

- [[awareness]] and [[basis]].
- [[foundation]]
