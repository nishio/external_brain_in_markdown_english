<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT/icon' alt='GPT.icon' height="19.5"/> "Waka" is a form of classical Japanese poetry that is characterized by a specific syllable pattern. It is a broad term that encompasses several subtypes of Japanese poetry, the most famous of which is the "tanka".

A tanka is a poem of five lines with a 5-7-5-7-7 syllable pattern. This form of poetry, including waka, has a long history, with the earliest examples dating back to the 8th century in the Man'yōshū, the oldest existing collection of Japanese poetry.

Waka has played an integral role in Japanese literature and culture. It was often used in important courtly and religious ceremonies, and many of the most famous works of pre-modern Japanese literature, like the Tale of Genji, are filled with waka poems.

Thematically, waka often reflects upon nature, the changing seasons, love, sadness, and the impermanence of life, which are fundamental aspects of the Japanese aesthetic. The compact structure of the waka requires a kind of poetic economy in which a great deal of meaning or emotion is packed into a very small space.

In the modern era, waka, and particularly tanka, have experienced a resurgence of interest. Some schools still teach the art of waka composition and it's not uncommon for Japanese people to compose waka for special occasions or just for personal enjoyment.

So in essence, waka is a window into the heart of Japanese culture, expressing the sentiments, aesthetics, and spirit of the Japanese people throughout the centuries.
