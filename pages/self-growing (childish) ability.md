> >I have said several times that engineers who grow up on their own are "raised with the ability to grow up on their own," and that behind the ability to grow up on their own are obvious (family) acts of education, such as "being given a watch that can be taken apart" or "being bought magazines, picture books, models, microcomputers, etc." in their childhood. I'm not sure.
> The concept of "the ability to grow on its own" is important. If learning is viewed as something that is taught and then stored, it cannot grow on its own, no matter how old it gets. [I wrote in "The Intellectual Production of Engineers" that it is necessary to switch to a form of learning through a cycle of "trial and error.
