One-step meta-democracy
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1739349027018420449) According to Schumpeter, the characteristic of democracy is [[competitiveness]], which is [[selection by competition and quality]] due to multiple choices. One example of an implementation of a means of making [[Multiple Choice]] competitive is [[election]]. If we create another option for this "means" and implement competition and selection by quality, we can establish a one-step meta-democracy.

The need that elections fulfill is to collect people's opinions as data and reflect them in policies. So if you create a system where people feel that their opinions are reflected in policy, competition is established. Using the Internet would be better than [[paper and box voting]].

Voting comes to be seen as an old-fashioned and imperfect system, and [[stopping voting]] becomes "[[more democratic]]".

There are organizations that are convinced that "that way of doing things is inefficient, so let's change to another way of doing things," and there are organizations that are not convinced and will not change. Competition should occur between them.

- [[social inovation legitimates governance]]

[[decoupling of democracy and voting]].
