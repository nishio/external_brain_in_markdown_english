title: "Sharing the process of making"
---

    - We need to share [[the process of making]], not [[the complete form]].
- Even if information is shared only about the finished product, it is impossible to learn how to create it.
    - [[lesson]] is the bestowal of karma
    - So [[shio]] doesn't share the "drawn diagram" in class, but rather "shows the diagram"
    - [[mob programming]], etc. as well.
