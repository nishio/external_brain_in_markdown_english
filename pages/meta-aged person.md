title: "meta-aged person"

Note that the concept of "meta-elderly" was interesting.
>  Some people are like meta-elderly people who just keep their position by slamming [[problems caused by the elderly (esp. gerontocracy, and elderly people's control over the young)]] as old people.
>  Sometimes the content of the banging itself is a legitimate assessment, but the act of blaming the person himself or the old man isn't creating anything.

The concept of "Mere Old Man" is also just called "Mere Old Man" because the typical example is often done by an old man, a concept that needs a proper term because some people are old but not old, and some are young but old. (PS: see [[waste of time]])
I guess "[[Are you creating something?]]" is the key cutoff.
Behaviors that do not produce anything or that get in the way of those who are trying to produce something are more likely to be considered "old".
