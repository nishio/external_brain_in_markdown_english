<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Gunnar Heinsohn's [[Youth Bulge]] is a book that analyzes the impact of the rapid increase in the [[youth population]] on the stability of societies and nations from a [[demographic]] perspective. In particular, it focuses on the phenomenon of the "Youth Bulge," in which young people between the ages of 15 and 24 make up an excessive portion of the population. He argues that this phenomenon will lead to joblessness, immigration, crime, insurgency, war, and other forms of [[social unrest]].

Heinsohn notes that the population of [[Muslim countries]] in particular is growing significantly, which can be a destabilizing factor in the region and the world. He points out that [[acts of terrorism]] are motivated by ambition for status and power, not poverty, and discusses the dangers of radicalizing even young people of social standing

[[young men]] who [[self-destruct]].
