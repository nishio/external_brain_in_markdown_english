Ten Principles of Economics
- How people make decisions
    - 1: People face trade-offs (conflicting relationships)
    - 2: The cost of something is the value of what you give up to get it.
            - [[opportunity cost]]
    - 3: Rational people think in marginal areas
        - What is "[[marginal]]"?
            - marginal
            - Minor modifications to the action plan
    - 4: People respond to various [incentives
- How people influence each other
    - 5: Trade makes everyone richer
    - 6: Markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity
        - Adam Smith and the Invisible Hand
    - 7: Governments can also improve outcomes brought about by markets
- How the economy works as a whole
- 8: A country's standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and services
- 9: If the government prints too much paper money, prices will rise.
- 10: Society faces a short-term tradeoff between inflation and unemployment
        - [[Phillips curve]]

economy model
    - [[Flow Circulation Diagram]]
    - Goods, services and money flows
    - [[production possibility frontier]]
    - production possibilities frontier
    - Mankiw states that the production possibility frontier bulges outward from the origin
        - This approach assumes [marginal cost increase

Why do economists disagree?
- Difference between empirical and normative claims
    - Existence of [trade-off
    - Difference between [[values]] -> [chopped burdock root (and sometimes carrot) cooked in sugar and soy sauce

- [[interdependence]] and profit from trade
    - [[opportunity cost]] and comparative advantage
    - The opportunity cost of one good is the inverse of the opportunity cost of the other good

Demand and Supply Action in the Market
    - [[demand curve]]
    - Relationship between quantity demanded of a good and its price, usually falling right
        - The quantity demanded by all buyers will be added together horizontally
        - $x = f(y) = f_1(y) + f_2(y)$
    - When income increases, demand usually increases. Such goods are called [[normal goods (i.e. goods for which demand decreases when consumer's income increases)]] (normal good).
            - [[inferior goods]] (inferior good): demand increases when income decreases. For example, the use of buses increases because people cannot afford cars.
        - [[substitute goods]] : A decrease in the price of X reduces the demand for Y.
        - Movie Ticket and Video Rental Prices
        - [[complementary good]] : When the price of X falls, the demand for Y increases.
        - Gasoline and Automobiles
    - [[supply curve]]
    - Relationship between supply of a good and its price, usually rightward
- The intersection of two curves is [[market equilibrium point]].

Three-step approach to analyze changes in equilibrium
- Identify which curve (or both) shifts
- Identify the direction of shift
- See how the shift changes [[equilibrium price]] and [equilibrium trading volume

- [[elasticity]]
- elasticity of demand
    - When it reacts significantly to changes in price, it is "elastic".
        - x/y
        - That's just a gradient.
        - The greater the slope of the curve, the more "inelastic" we call it.
    - It is easy to be resilient when there are closely substituted goods. If margarine is expensive, use butter.
- elasticity of supply
    - This elasticity (i.e., slope) only changes the change in [[total income]] (xy) when the curve shifts.
    - The line of constant total income is hyperbolic

- [[externalities]] and market inefficiencies
    - [[welfare economics]]
    - [[negative externalities]]
    - [[positive externalities]]
- Resolution of externalities by the parties
- Public Policy on Externalities

Public Goods and Shared Resources
    - [[public goods (i.e. goods or services such as parks or highways)]]
        - [[free rider]] Problem
    - [[shared resources]]
        - [[Tragedy of Common Land]]

tax

Theory of Consumer Choice
    - [[budget constraint]]
- preference
        - Expression of preferences by [indifference curve
        - A set of points that provide the same satisfaction
    - Four properties of nondiscrimination curves
        - The indiscriminate curve of information is more this
        - Non-discrimination curve declines to the right
        - Indiscriminate curves do not intersect.
        - The nondiscrimination curve bulges inward from the origin.
            - This makes the assumption of diminishing marginal utility.
    - Two extreme examples of nondiscrimination curves
            - [[wholly-supplied goods]] : 5 yen coins and 10 yen coins
            - [[wholly-supplemented goods]] : shoes for the right foot and shoes for the left foot
