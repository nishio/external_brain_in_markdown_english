Pioneer Mode is a development of "Extending the Red Link with AI

- Red link is a term used in Scrapbox to refer to a link that turns red when there is "no content at the link destination".
- The ability for AI to create pages beyond red links has initially been called "red link extension.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/543795bebbbe6729e97d03de9116349b/thumb/1000)
    - However, even an empty page will turn blue with 2-hop links if it is linked from multiple places, and in some cases, even if the content is already there, the name "red link" is not appropriate because we want the AI to develop it
- After seeing AI's suggestion of "RedLink Expander", the name "Pioneer Mode" was chosen because "it's more of a pioneering than an expansion".
    - Pioneer" also includes "settler," but since it does not mean "settle," it has become "pioneer.
    - [[Pioneering]] = [[Cutting through the forest that is not yet in the language]].

If you place a link on the "[[‚úçÔ∏èü§ñ]]" page, the AI will check it periodically and generate it automatically.
- Check once a minute and rest 10 minutes after each update.
- Previously, "[[red link extension]]" had to be commanded on a PC, but can now be completed on a smartphone.
- Right now, I'm one hop away from a dedicated page, but given the nuances of the word "pioneering," it might be interesting to follow the links and move around and write about the empty pages you find on your own.
        - [[Give a metaphorical name to a function, and that name will evolve the function.]]

### deep thinking
: [[how AI bridges the knowledge gap]].
- Pioneer mode is an important way for AI to fill knowledge gaps
- Explore uncharted areas of knowledge and generate new knowledge
- Expanding the network of knowledge with continuity

### Relation to Fragment
.
The fragment "Extension of red links by AI" is directly related to the pioneer mode of the note. While the pioneer mode refers to the ability to identify unexplored or unfinished areas and extend or generate new content, the fragment specifically refers to the act of AI pioneering or creating red links (non-existent pages).

### deep thinking
The pioneer mode and "AI-induced red-link extension" are important ways for AI to fill knowledge gaps. It plays an important role in maintaining continuity and consistency of knowledge by exploring untapped areas of knowledge and generating new knowledge.
