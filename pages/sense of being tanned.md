title: "sense of being tanned"
---

I was wondering and thinking about when people feel "[[licked]]",
- I want others to act this way toward me, [[expectation]].
- That others behave differently from their [[expectations]] in reality.
This may occur in combination with a combination of the following.

So [[the pain of not getting what one seeks]], the state of suffering by not getting what one seeks.

- [[Lickety-split and Imposter Syndrome]]
- [[An ideology not to be taken lightly]]
- [[being licked]]
