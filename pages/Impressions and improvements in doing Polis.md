Impressions and improvements in doing Polis
Summary: Impressions from using Polis include a sense of attribution of agenda postings among users and limited data retrieval points, requiring consideration of mechanisms for more effective discussions.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>

Thoughts on doing Polis.
    - [[Questioning by OpenAI]]
- Those who add an agenda by name prefer that others' attention and votes increase for that agenda.
    - There are [[users who prefer to remain anonymous]] and [users who prefer to have their opinions attributed to them
- A system to post individual agendas to SNS like yuiseki was creating would be useful.
- There is an option to create the entire service or tweak the UI layer of Polis to make it happen.
    - When using Polis, it seems essential to set up your own instance instead of Pol.is
    - With pol.is instances, you can't take the data out and use it for something else.
    - Example of "Extract and Use Data": I want to copy the data of opinions posted on individual agendas to "Conversations about individual agendas" for the "Conversations about agendas" I'm working on, but I can't do it.
