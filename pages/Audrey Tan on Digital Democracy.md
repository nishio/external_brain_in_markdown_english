- [[A case study of the debate on whether to change the time zone in Taiwan]]
[[Can agree to disagree head-on]] p. 115
- Whether to set Taiwan's time zone to GMT+9 or keep it at GMT+8
- Compromising and shifting it by 30 minutes satisfies no one.
- I listened carefully to why they wanted to change time zones.
    - I want to be "different from China, same as Japan and Korea."
    - Values we can agree on with those we want to maintain: "We want Taiwan to be a country with a unique presence."
- Calculate the cost of time zone change
    - Can we use this budget to come up with ideas for common values that will make Taiwan more unique, instead of using it to change time zones?"
    - We reached an agreement in a mutually productive direction.
    - The time zone was not changed, but those who insisted on the change were satisfied.
        - Because their values were recognized and actions were carried out based on them.
