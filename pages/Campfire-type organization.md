title: "Campfire-type organization"
---

Compare the organization to a [[campfire (usually large, and for gathering and singing, etc.)]].
- [[There are no clear boundaries to the organization]].
- There is a clear [[central]] (=campfire, [[vision]]) and [[distance]] is decided by each individual.
- If the vision is interesting, the [[circle of people]] will expand.

> [[campfire (usually large, and for gathering and singing, etc.)]], and Mr. Aono and I are dancing in the middle. Some people see us and dance with us, others can't quite get into the circle, and still others are watching the fireworks from a distance.
>  Whatever the situation, what we have to do is just to keep [[dancing in the middle]].
>  If the [[vision]] is interesting, I think the circle of dance will continue to expand. [[Interesting]], that is the point.
>  Each person has his/her own distance to the vision

    - The opposite thought of [gated community
        - [[Blurring of organizational boundaries]]
    - Most companies are gated communities to begin with.
            - [[dual community]], etc., could also be possible.

- [[It's important that the vision be interesting.]]

- [[circle of people expands]].
    - It's not as nuanced as "[[people gather]]."
    - Not everyone comes by the campfire.
    - [[attention]] is directed to the campfire.
