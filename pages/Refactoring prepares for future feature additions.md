> [@tt_clown](https://twitter.com/tt_clown/status/1595635166650961920): I'm wondering if I should include "[[refactoring]] a lot" in the update information. It's not important information for the user, but it's important because the content has changed a lot.

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1595636660456542208): Instead of shying away from this kind of thing and saying "We're not adding any features that users can see...", you can say "We're well prepared to add future features and fix bugs! We've done everything we can to make it easier to add features and fix bugs in the future! and the user says, "Wow, I can't wait to see what the future holds! I can't wait to see what the future holds! I hope the world will become a place where people can say "Wow, I'm looking forward to the future!

I remember hearing that the OS update stopped version 1 from working, and the users who had laughed at it were screaming.

I think it's obvious that support for "problems that occur with the latest OS when you continue to use an older version when a newer version is released" has a low priority, but it's surprisingly unknown to the world, so I think we should be proactive in communicating this to the public.
