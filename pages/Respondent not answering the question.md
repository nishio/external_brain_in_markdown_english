title: "Respondent not answering the question"
---

This is an example of a question-and-answer website where person A asked a question and person B answered it, but it appears to be unkind.
Complaints on the part of the questioner:
- I just wish they would clearly tell us the procedure.
- They say, "Can't you read the English error messages on the display?"
- They say things like, "Read the reference book."
- They will try to give you [[Extra Knowledge]] that is not what you asked for.

Phenomena occurring
![image](https://gyazo.com/d6ff0b76611b25f43950b6c6b8d16bfb/thumb/1000)
- The questioner only sees the issue at hand and seeks a solution to it.
    - Thinking that given a solution to the task at hand, they will reach their ideal state.
- The respondent believes that the questioner's idea is a misconception.
    - I believe that solving only the issue that the questioner is now asking about will not satisfy his/her needs.
    - Consider that there are dozens of issues lined up after the one in front of you.
    - Therefore, we think it is necessary to teach "[[Methods for obtaining solutions]]" for issues that we expect to encounter in the future.
        - Not the solution to the issue that is now being asked.
        - For example, for someone who sees an error message in English and says, "I got some kind of error.
            - They are instructed to "be able to understand error messages."
    - That's the point of view of the questioner and those who don't see "issues lining up".
        - Seems "unkind, not answering what I asked."
- Respondents often forget to share with the questioner the information that the respondent thinks the "questioner is 'misled'".
