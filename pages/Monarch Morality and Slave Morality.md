title: "Monarch Morality and Slave Morality"
---

- A philosophical concept by [[Nietzsche]] (1844-1900). It classified two types of human thinking.
First published in "[[Beyond Good and Evil]]" and developed in "[[Moral Genealogy]]".

- [[Good or bad, beneficial or harmful?]]
    - In [[Herrenmoral (master morality, as a philosophical concept of Nietzsche)]], actions are divided into "good" and "bad.
    - Good things are useful, bad things are harmful.
            - [[pragmatism]] 的
    - My [[values]] determine whether it's good or bad.
    - In [[Sklavenmoral (slave morality, as a philosophical concept of Nietzsche)]], actions are divided into "good" and "evil.
    - The implicit assumption is introduced that "the rulers are evil" and "we who are ruled are good."
    - The "majority is good" is used to justify this.
    - The governed are evil because they are less than the governed
        - The ruler has power and the ruled does not. Therefore, power is evil.
        - The ruler has money and the ruled do not. Therefore, money is evil.
        - [[equality]] is good
        - Putting monarchs on the same footing as slaves.
    - Based on voting and majority rule [[democracy]] is good because the majority is good

The early [[aristocracy]] was one in which the morality of the monarch was good for what was good for him in exchange for the responsibility of fighting on the front lines in times of war. With the modernization of the military, the nobility no longer fought on the front lines, and the justification was lost. 1789-1799 French Revolution overthrew absolute monarchy and became a republic (democracy) (well, it was replaced by Napoleon's dictatorship in 10 years).

from  [[How to deal with other people's words]]
Nietzsche pointed out [[that there are two kinds of ideas of "goodness"]].
- Herrenmoral (master morality, as a philosophical concept of Nietzsche)
    - Is it beneficial to the realization of the objectives?
    - Beneficial is good, harmful is bad.
- Sklavenmoral (slave morality, as a philosophical concept of Nietzsche)
    - Majority is good.
    - Bad because there are few monarchs or other rulers.
    - Good because they are the majority who are governed.
