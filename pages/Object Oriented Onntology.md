> In metaphysics, object-oriented ontology (OOO) is a 21st-century [[Heidegger]]-influenced school of thought that rejects the privileging of human existence over the existence of nonhuman objects.
[Object-oriented ontology - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_ontology)

> This is in contrast to what it calls the "[[anthropocentrism]]" of [[Kant]]'s Copernican Revolution, as accepted by most other current metaphysics, in which phenomenal objects are said to conform to the mind of the subject and, in turn, become products of human cognition.
