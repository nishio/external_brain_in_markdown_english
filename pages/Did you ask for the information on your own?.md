title: "Did you ask for the information on your own?"

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This series of tweets discusses Apple's organizational structure and how information is shared.
The first tweet points to Apple's inefficient organizational structure, to which some have offered different opinions.
- Opinion that he doesn't think it's inefficient based on his experience working as an engineer at Apple.
- Pointing out that the degree of top-down or information sharing is not necessarily related to efficiency.
- The view that the way to achieve results differs from organization to organization, and that is just the right way to do it.
- Argument that an individual's desire to know should not be confused with what an organization should be.

Finally, they suggest that when we feel the need to share information, we should consider whether we have asked for that information ourselves. The main point of these tweets is that there are many different ways of looking at how information is shared in an organization, and it is difficult to make a blanket judgment on whether it is good or bad.

>  When we went to find out the secret of innovation from Apple employees, we found a bad organizational structure.
>  ・Slack was introduced company-wide only recently, and each department uses its own messaging service.
>  ・There is no such thing as information transparency, blocking information outside of one's own team.
>  ・Employees also learn about new products at WWDC, no unexpected collaborations, completely top-down
>  ・Information is not centralized but scattered in many databases. Catch-up costs are too high.
>
>  They say this is happening because they are putting their lives on the line to control information on new products to prevent information leaks.
>  Management, including Tim Cook, can produce Vision Pro despite such inefficiencies.
>  Their management skills are tremendous.

You can also try to become a manager. I think if you work there, you'll start hypothesizing about innovation and the leadership it requires.
>  It's somewhat strange to think that with all the different readings, it must be top-down and collaboration is not done because of secrecy... 🤔I think you should read around here if you're really interested.

> [atsuhit0](https://twitter.com/atsuhit0/status/1785389672895815855) I've tried working in Apple's engineering department and I don't think it's an inefficient organization. I'm not saying that there isn't siloed work due to secrecy, but necessary information is shared and the process is quite automated. There is also collaboration with other departments. In fact, I have the impression that everyone is working very efficiently with fewer people than in other companies.

>  Actually, I think the fact is that it probably doesn't matter much.
>  "The desire for information to be widely shared" precedes the desire for information to be widely shared.

> [naoya_ito](https://twitter.com/naoya_ito/status/1785464415984529457) We pursue best practices like "information should be widely shared", and then we get results/not getting results based on whether we're doing that or not. Tend to tie good or bad to good or bad.
>
>  Actually, I don't think that's the case. I think it's just that the results of building up a way of doing things that produces results is right for that group --- and that's it.

> [naoya_ito](https://twitter.com/naoya_ito/status/1785465342049017979) It's not good to conflate an individual's desire to know things and to eliminate what they don't know with an expanded discussion of how an organization should be. I don't agree.

> [hrjn](https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1785545718763323658) What I like to think about when I feel that information is not being shared is whether we have talked about wanting that information even once...

>  Actually, I think it's very possible that you just don't know what information you need.
