> On the night of December 24, 1990, six people were gathered in a secluded Western-style house by invitation from an unknown sender.
>  A sumptuous dinner was served in an unoccupied pavilion, with a letter on the side.
>  As he reads the letter, he learns that before he knows it, the entrance has been sealed and the only way out is to fulfill a "certain condition" that will be announced tomorrow morning.
>  While waiting for morning with mutual suspicion, they are awakened at exactly midnight by the sound of a piano playing a cheerful Christmas song.
>  When I rushed to the hall, I found the grisly corpse of one of the participants left there, along with eerie blood writing.
