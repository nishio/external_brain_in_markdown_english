The main points are as follows
- Members earn "management credits" for their contributions, which they can use to participate in organizational decision-making.
- Issue Board", where members set issue priorities using credits. The allocation of credits is done through the [[Secondary Funding]] ([[Quadratic Funding]]) mechanism.
- Contributions are approved or disapproved by voting. The [[second round of voting]] ([[Quadratic Voting]]) is used for voting.
- Predicting the outcome at the time of voting earns credit for being on target. This provides an incentive for more members to participate in scrutinizing the content of their contributions.
- The administrator can set parameters to adjust the cost of voting and forecasting.
- This model aims to solve governance issues associated with the expansion of project scale, as seen in open source software development.
Overall, the system dynamically allocates management authority based on contribution levels and encourages broad member participation. On the other hand, the report states that there are still issues to be considered, such as operational challenges and the impact on organizational productivity.
