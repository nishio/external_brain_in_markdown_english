- It's obvious that we'll be busy until FtC, and I don't think the weekly journal will switch over until then.
    - I'm going to write it down here because I'm going to be distracted afterwards and say, "Um, what was that?"
    - Overall review of Plurality book
    - I'm willing to build a better tool based on TTTC's experience.
        - Running it on Google Colab is one step in that direction.
    - Two consultations have already been brought in by people who want to use TTTC.
    - GPT-4o mini is out now.
        - I think I'm ripe.
        - Scrapbox to English
            - Roughly fits in the context width, even with format specification, fixed translations, etc.
        - LLM+KJ method system
