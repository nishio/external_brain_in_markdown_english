title: 'The "good old boy" is a curse.'
---

Throwing the words "[[old enough]] to do X" or "too old to do Y" at others is a [[curse]] that reduces the range of behavior when one gets older, not only for that person, but also for the person who has been there.

It is not good if the behavior becomes fixed with age because it causes [[aging population combined with the elderly]] and [[dementia]].

- [[Age doesn't matter.]]
