title: 'Interesting"→What is interesting?'
---

Starting point "[[interesting]]"
- What's interesting.
- Interesting" is subjective, so it differs from person to person.
- What do I find interesting?
- Dig into your "interesting" feelings and make them higher resolution.
- Then what?
    - Will it make your life more interesting in the future?
        - A place with high [[Density of Interest]] can be identified.
        - This would be interesting to participate in, so you know what I mean.
        - You'll know the direction you need to go to increase the density of interest.
            - Contribute to finding and creating interesting places

- [[What is "interesting"?]] but I changed it because I thought it was not an appropriate title.
