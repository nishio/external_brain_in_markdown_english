title: "column and row are false dichotomies"
---

In the original physical world, a [[column]] was a "long vertical object," and naturally it was a "horizontally aligned" object (1). However, with the spread of spreadsheet software, people began to interpret "long columns" as "columns (with cells inside) lined up vertically" (2), and confusion (3) between these two interpretations arose.

- Not verified if the trigger is [spreadsheet software

    - [[Wrong 2]] Which pattern is it?
    - From my point of view, 1 in the above diagram is "neither row nor column" and 2 is "column of row".
        - Is it row or column?" is the source of confusion.
        - It's funny that you think ROW and COLUMN are opposites.
            - So [[false dichotomy]] then.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1833391016042500328) After all, it is relative whether you think of a long vertical object as having "small objects lined up vertically inside" or a long vertical object as having "horizontal objects lined up horizontally", so it doesn't explain anything. It is.
