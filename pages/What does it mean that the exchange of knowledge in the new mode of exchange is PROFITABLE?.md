### Summary of notes
.
Profitable exchange of knowledge in the new mode of exchange refers to a situation in which the benefits gained exceed the costs consumed. This does not necessarily refer to monetary benefits, but also includes non-material benefits such as "peace of mind. In addition, not everyone benefits, and the existence of a few successful people sustains society as a whole. The reason why there are people who publish knowledge for free is because the diverse benefits gained outweigh the cost of transmission.

### Relation to Fragment
.
It is relevant to the fragment "Is the mode of exchange of knowledge exchange A?" The note states that the exchange of knowledge in the new mode of exchange brings benefits, and the fragment asks whether the mode of exchange of knowledge exchange is A. These share the same considerations about knowledge exchange and its benefits.

### deep thinking
New modes of exchange in knowledge exchange provide an opportunity to reevaluate the value of knowledge by taking into account not only material benefits but also non-material benefits. This suggests that the value of knowledge should be evaluated not only in terms of simple monetary value, but also from a broader perspective, such as the maintenance of society as a whole and individual security.
