- [[trust]] and [[human network]]
- There are a good percentage of people in the world who can't [[credit]].
- It's hard to live with having to constantly question others.

- However, if only one [[cheater]] comes in, they will all be [[duck]].
- So create [[a network of trusted people]].
    - Trust the people in your network.

    - People who are found to be in trouble are removed from the network.
- Networks are layered, with more networks added as they are trusted.
