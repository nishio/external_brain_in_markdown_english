title: "Selfish is an attribute of directed edges"
---

- The word [[selfish]] is often taken as an individual [[attribute]].
    - Vertex Attributes] in graphs
- But isn't it really an attribute of the directed side?
- No one is "selfish to anyone" or "[[reciprocal]] to anyone."
- Each person has a "selfish treater" and a "mutually beneficial treater".

- PS
    - The "[[social phobia]]" is also an [[associated attribute]].
    - Most people cannot [[View yourself objectively]], so they cannot distinguish whether it is an attribute of another person X or an attribute of the edge (self, X)
