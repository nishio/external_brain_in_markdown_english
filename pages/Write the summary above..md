### abstracted digest
.

According to Nishio's research note, "Transcript of BMOT 4th Meeting," he advocates a method of writing down ideas first, organizing them, finding relationships, and summarizing them. This is also known as the "KJ method," and it is recommended that sticky notes be used to visually organize the information. The "Scrapbox Best Practices" also stresses the importance of organizing information into one place. These techniques are related to notes such as "write the summary on top" and "summarize your thoughts".

The "Tachikawa-san Communication Theory" also presents the idea of placing the highest priority on output and finding relevance by listing it. This is also related to notes such as "First write it down, then list it" and "What the test user thought about in the process of organizing".

On the other hand, "Should Scrapbox pages summarize what's important at the top?" discusses how to organize and present information. This is relevant to notes such as "[[Advice for those who want to write a book someday]]" and "[[Hatena2009-07-02]]".

### deep thinking

These notes and fragments of research notes allow us to think deeply about how to organize and present information. In particular, the method of listing information, finding relevance, and summarizing it may contribute to the efficiency of intellectual production. Also, in terms of how information is presented, placing important information at the top of the list is thought to aid reader understanding.
