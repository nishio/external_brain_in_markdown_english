Facebook's "This Day in the Past" presented a mysterious collection of keywords.

- [2018-01-26 Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/nishiohirokazu/posts/10214398995665257)
    - Whether the knowledge is [Rootless Knowledge
        - [Accumulative learning and in-depth learning
        - [[percolation]]
        - Combination between [[Space for procurable resources]] and [Space of resources to be obtained

I put it in Scrapbox and tried bracketing it.
[[Memo 20180126.]] linked by keyword "rootless"
I looked at it and found it detailed.
