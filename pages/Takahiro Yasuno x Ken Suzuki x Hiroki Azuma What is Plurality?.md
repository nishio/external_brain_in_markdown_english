- Hiroki Azuma and Ken Suzuki were speakers at the 1st Web Society Symposium held at the University of Tokyo's Yasuda Auditorium on December 7, 2009, and the moderator was Suzuki.
    - The point of contact between the two was a study group [[ised]] (Information Society Ethics & Design) held at GLOCOM, an international university, in 2004-06.

    - Session 1: "The Web and Politics - Reinventing Democracy"
        - Speakers Kenzo Fujisue / Hiroki Azuma / Daisuke Tsuda / Tetsuya Sato / Satoshi Hamano
        - Moderator: Ken Suzuki
Mr. Yasuno, who was a first-year undergraduate student at the time, went to listen and became interested in politics.


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1938185604665397476) I was going to talk about [[Digital Democracy 2030]] and I mentioned [[U.S. Presidential Election 2024 Road Trip]]. The moment I tried to talk about [[Digital Democracy 2030]], I went off on a tangent and didn't come back to it.

> [0xtkgshn](https://x.com/0xtkgshn/status/1938184730102665315) The French Revolution didn't leave a concrete example of action, but the US was able to create a constitution, so ok.
- Hannah Arendt thinks the American Revolution was better than the French Revolution.
    - The French Revolution only destroyed the ancien régime.
    - The U.S. created the Constitution.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3/icon' alt='o3.icon' height="19.5"/> [[Hannah Arendt.]], in "[[On Revolution]] (On Revolution, 1963)," speaks more highly of the American Revolution than of the French Revolution.
    - Arendt defined the essence of [[revolution]] as "the creation of [[freedom]]," and argued that in the United States it was partially realized, while in France social problems came to the fore, resulting in tyranny and violence rather than the creation of freedom.
    - She also noted the "practice of [[town meetings]] and [[councils]]" in the United States and praised grassroots political participation.

Action-only revolution and sustainable revolution
- Action → [[natality#67f34bd50000000000c6c89d]]
- The U.S. Constitution was designed from the beginning to allow for division.
- The U.S. has a thriving grassroots study group interpreting the Constitution.
- Republicans are more aggressive in discussing the Constitution.
    - If we're being true to the spirit of the Constitution, then the federal government is overstepping its bounds right now.

Education is not written into the Constitution.
- So it is the state's right to decide what kind of education to provide.
- The Federation is doing too many things, so let's dismantle it.

Plurality story
- What is [/plurality-japanese/plurality](https://scrapbox.io/plurality-japanese/plurality)?
    - Ken's commentary and other stuff is linked from here.
- Ken Suzuki hit it off with Audrey Tang and Glen Weyl because they had a lot in common with "[[Smooth Society and Its Enemies]].
- Plurality" aims to make digital democracy one of the three pillars of [[Ideology in the 21st Century]] on how to deal with technology in 2030
    - The idea that the other two are currently too strong and dangerous.
- The scope of "The Smooth Society and Its Enemies" is a little different because it's a book looking 300 years into the future.

[[Community Notes]] and [[Pol.is]].
- Taiwan has been using Pol.is for almost 10 years.
        - [[Uber discussion in Pol.is]], etc.
    - X's Community Notes inspired by Pol.is
- hazuma: I'm surprised Audrey appreciates Community Notes, isn't it working?
- kensuzuki: maybe I'm biased because there are still very few people contributing to CN in Japan
- > [0xtkgshn](https://x.com/0xtkgshn/status/1938188477776220333) The community notes data is open so we can verify that too, CfJ does that.
    - > [hal_sk](https://x.com/hal_sk/status/1938188702855139663) Community Notes did not work very well, at least not during the Hyogo gubernatorial election.
        - [X's "Community Notebook" hardly works in Hyogo gubernatorial election Countermeasures against disinformation and misinformation Research group analysis | NHK | IT/Net](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20250324/k10014758511000.html)
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3/icon' alt='o3.icon' height="19.5"/>The joint research on the Hyogo Prefecture gubernatorial election drew a great response by quantitatively demonstrating the "dysfunction" of the 165 election-related notes, only 5 of which were made available to the public.
- I think Audrey's appreciation of Community Notes is that "what could only be done with a mere 1000 people at the time of Pol.is, can now be done with a large number of people with the addition of Community Notes to X."<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I think Ken understands the formulas, but he had difficulty using them verbally without a whiteboard diagram, and someone with zero knowledge might not have understood them due to lack of context.
    - The first half is talking about Polis, and the second half is talking about Community Notes scaled to a large number of people with reduced request interactions, again [[trade-off between depth and breadth of cooperation]].
    - The mechanism of appreciating what is commonly valued by people with different opinion tendencies is common

[[Joi ito]] [[Emergent Democracy]] [[Weblog]]
    - [[grass-roots democracy]]
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3/icon' alt='o3.icon' height="19.5"/>Emergent Democracy" is an essay that Joi Ito published on his blog Joi Ito's Weblog in 2003. Ito's Weblog in 2003, which presented a vision of how the Internet's rapidly spreading [[interactive media]] such as [[Blog]] and [[RSS]] would promote "self-organization from below" and create a new form of democracy. At the time of publication, version 1.3 was posted on the blog, and a revised version was subsequently circulated up to 3.2.
What happened next.
- Weblogs became blogs, and Twitter emerged as a microblog, which at one time led to the Arab Spring and other emergencies, but then capitalist forces changed the algorithm and turned it into a platform that fueled division.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
> [hal_sk](https://x.com/hal_sk/status/1938193236633571474) "You know how many times we've seen these things."
>  Yes. Exactly.
>  But don't you think that society will change through the repetition of tackling the same problem in a slightly > different way, using the technology of the time?
>  I'm a civic tech myself, and I've had a lot of things said to me by my elders.

- In Civilization, [[integrated technocracy]], [[corporate libertarianism]], and [[digital democracy]] are the three options for future governance
- Of these, [[integrated technocracy]] and [[corporate libertarianism]] are the two wheels of the new empire.
- Is digital democracy a strategy for small countries?

Geopolitical Conditions in Taiwan
- Is that why they spread?
    - That's likely.
- Is that a condition for widespread use?
    - it does not seem possible to say so
    - It starts in small countries and spreads to large countries.

It used to be that the U.S. controlled industry and the military, created the Internet, and net democracy was coming! It was all about "Net Democracy is coming!
Now the major powers are moving toward [[techno-feudalism]], and we can't let Taiwan's lights go out to protect democracy! I feel like

        - Shortly after his inauguration, he released the Transparency & Open Gov Memorandum.
        - Three principles (transparency, participation, and collaboration) are mandated for federal agencies.
        - Adopted almost the same vocabulary as the three pillars set forth by O'Reilly

Glen was introduced to Audrey by Vitalik of Ethereum.
- The Ethereum community originally thought that the "automatic enforcement" of contracts through smart contracts would allow private contracts to be secured without the power of the state, and that this change in constraints would lead to radical changes in various social institutions. Glen, an up-and-coming economist, published Radical Market, which became very popular.
- The three of them and others later founded the NPO "[[RadicalxChange]]" (2018).
    - Glen was in Audrey, became a fan of Audrey's, and approached Audrey's side of the viewpoint.
        - [[Why I Am not a Market Radical]](2020)の話だね<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

hazuma: "In the first place, [[Marxism]] is [[accelerationism]]."

- "X" is a tribute to Emiya's "Exchange Style X.
    - The "X" in RadicalxChange is taken from "Mode of Exchange X" proposed by Yukito Karaya in "Structure of World History".
    - Mode of Exchange X" refers to a "gift-redistribution" type of exchange that is different from the market and the state, and is associated with the keywords "plurality" and "digital democracy" as suggesting "a system in which diverse others can coexist. It is associated with the keywords "plurality" and "digital democracy.
- Emaya's early reading = salvaging "plurality".
    - In "Marx at the Center of Possibility" and "Inquiry I," he criticized the popular image of Marx as a single historian of progress, and by focusing on exchange, he reinterpreted the idea that the "failure of exchange" opens up a pluralistic world.
        - It is also related to Hiroki Azuma's concept of "[[misdelivery]].
    - The quote here is from Marx's thesis (?). Master's thesis? The quote here is from [[Lucretius]] ("The atom deviates subtly in falling vertically"), which was treated in Marx's thesis (?). ("The atom subtly deviates in its vertical fall"), a motif treated in Marx's thesis (? master's thesis? doctoral dissertation?).
        - There is "[[slippage]]"
    - Audrey's favorite phrase "[[There is a chasm in everything. Through which light shines.]] 」、Plurality が目指す「違いを越えて協働するための技術」と重なるね<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- The turn to the "big story" since the 2000s and its pros and cons
    - In the 2000s, Emory scaled up to a world-historical and religious systems theory.
    - Azuma and Suzuki are
        - I like the "initial small deviations = plurality" line.
        - The grandiose "philosophy of world history" of the latter period became more monolithic/theological and less interesting.
    - He shared his assessment of the company's performance.
- He also blurted out that "recent Emaya fans only read and get excited about his later works, but they don't know about his early edges."

Correspondence with Hiroki Azuma, Philosophy of Correctability
- Ken Suzuki interprets "Philosophy of Correctability" as "Azuma's attempt to shift the [[totalitarianism]]-like [[unitary]] latent in Rousseau's "[[the general will]]" and to extract [[correctability]] (plurality) through [[Eloise]]. (plurality) through [[Héloïse]].
    - He pointed out that this is a parallel to "Emiya's reading of Marx, who rescued 'plurality' through the mode of exchange.
- Plurality = "the idea of designing a 'handle' that binds horizontal plurality as opposed to [[vertical]] [[singular]] [[accelerationism]] (singularity).

>  Once upon a time, there was an idea of a local currency called "NAM generation" by Yukito Karatani. The exchange style X proposed there has been described by Audrey Tan and others, and it has become abstract and splendid, but it is a simple idea that I can realize with my own Genron. I don't need great technology or a big story about resistance to capitalism.

- When the "anonymous system for creating any number of accounts" becomes a bad idea, jumping to the "Internet real name system" as an alternative means is too rough a resolution for the hierarchy of anonymity.
    - In practice, it is possible to use the private key in the personal number card to prove that the person is a unique individual, while not disclosing any other information.
    - I don't know if I got through to Yasuno, who also said in the second half of the Q&A session that each person chooses what to disclose...

The story of my visit to Taiwan
> [chekichekimusu1](https://x.com/chekichekimusu1/status/1938209543873564957) Taiwan, your site visit was really good.
- Related: [[Yasuno Team Taiwan Debriefing]].

> [genroncafe](https://x.com/genroncafe/status/1938209739416240204) The event has resumed! First, let's talk about Audrey Tan's personality and reputation.
>  ![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GuXndRvbEAcilB5?format=jpg&name=small#.png)

JOIN and vTaiwan
- About 10% of the population users
- It's great to create a new service and have 10% of the population use it.
- On the other hand, 90% of people don't use it, that's also true.
- JOIN's case is in Taiwanese textbooks, so more people will learn about digital democracy in the future.

Audrey is not a partisan.
- When he came to Japan, he tried to meet with both the ruling and opposition parties, not just with one particular party.
    - Liberal Democrats: [[Audrey+Glen+Colin+PMT Study Group]].
    - Constitution: [[[Audrey Tan ✖️ Junya Ogawa]] Digital Democracy to Co-Create the Future]
    - National: [[National Democratic Party + Plurality]].
- But he became a minister in the DPP government in Taiwan, so he's seen as someone from that side.
- Evaluation of pro-social media and community notes is similar to the idea of party neutrality
- Parents are journalists.
- The person in question is trying to be MEDIUM.
- What you can do because you are not an elected minister.
- Yasuno?
- When we tried to do it in Japan, we decided that a new party would be appropriate.


> [Fh9Kd11ox6SwiQM](https://x.com/Fh9Kd11ox6SwiQM/status/1938209977229037622) It's getting exciting.
>  I don't think AI will make everything work, and I don't think the speakers think it will, but the simple and passionate desire to reflect the will of the people in politics is palpable and rather brings me back to the roots of democracy.

> [hal_sk](https://x.com/hal_sk/status/1938210136197325285) I guess the fact that it was around the time of Yasuno's group's visit to Taiwan, when the media was beating Audrey up pretty hard, probably had an impact. >"When I asked them in the park, many people said they didn't like them."
>  I believe it was more popular at the time of the Corona.

> [chekichekimusu1](https://x.com/chekichekimusu1/status/1938212350567583887) Where do you draw the line between the costs of society (right to folly) and individual freedom?

Health operations with premium operations
KEN: It's a Glen-like idea.
- [[the right to execute a fool]]
- The right to do stupid things
- Cost to Society
- public health administration

Not wearing a mask costs society.
- Do you accept the freedom not to wear a mask?

Becoming able to calculate the cost to society.

1/3 of the population cannot drink alcohol.
- People who drink alcohol are paying social security contributions due to the damage to their health.
- Is it correct that drinking alcohol ups insurance premiums?
- Is it right to say don't drink alcohol?


The United States is a community health
- Different assumptions from universal coverage, more prudent in universal coverage
- If you have more than one insurance policy and you can switch between them, you can say, "If you don't like it, go to another insurance policy," so you can design a strong system.
- > [chekichekimusu1](https://x.com/chekichekimusu1/status/1938212896347197901) Only those who drink alcohol are insured www.


> [0xtkgshn](https://x.com/0xtkgshn/status/1938212627324539192) I don't think it's an infringement of rights, or that it's free in principle to do so on a private (forkable) layer. I'm wondering why you didn't mention any kind of enforceability there.
> [0xtkgshn](https://x.com/0xtkgshn/status/1938213356655284404) Mr. Suzuki mentioned it slightly. There's not a lot of discourse around here.

There is a lot of technical theory of governance.
- Less ideological.
- [[Audrey+TBS CROSS DIG]] asked, "Will technology change democracy?" to which he replied, "Democracy itself is technology."

[[Truth Social]]

- What happened after 100 years?
- prescription (medical)
- We need to get on board with mass society.

Instead of politicians becoming cats, only the loudest politicians survive.
- →[[Politicians become cats]].

President comes out and solves the problem.
- → Systematization "works the same way no matter who is there."
- The latter is not always the preferred state, it depends on the content of the "movement".

Talking as you please is the origin of philosophy.

If you have more than 10,000 people, you can't deliberate, you can only lean on your desires.

Pull media is not suitable for education.
- Education is about providing what you are not asking for.
- Online takes off quickly.

Technology connects desires.
- Cannot be used to deform or suppress
- You can't make people suppress their desires.
- Instill self-control and public spirit in people through education.

I think there is a limit to how much money can be spent on development in the capitalist game.

    - In that sense, Team Mirai becoming a national political party and building a team of engineers with party subsidies is a "system that democratically qualifies as a political party through voting and receives party subsidies from the taxpayers", which is a structure that "creates something useful for the people and receives support from the people" away from the general capitalist system. The structure of the system will be "to make something useful for the people and receive support from the people".

- You can't have a budget and not have freedom.
- Cultural support has become gentlification.
- Anarchy.
- Miscellaneous buildings are decreasing.
- Cannot scale without being clean and having impact.

Q: How do you view the Emperor System, the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, etc.?
A: Emphasis on investing in long-term growth (child care, education, science and technology, new industries, digital democracy).
- Japan-U.S. security and other issues are not covered in the manifesto - concentrating on themes directly related to achieving the vision of the party.

Q: Stance on international issues
A: Clear opposition to violations of international law (e.g., Israel's attack on Iran is NG).

Q: Response to the "thin argument" point
A: Every politician has strengths and weaknesses. There are clear arguments for priority policies (investment in the future and governance reform).
- What is an important theme?" is itself a claim.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - There are people who say that they are "not very assertive" when they are not assertive about the subjects they are interested in, but what they think about the great changes that will occur during the next 6 years of the council term due to AI is not at all clear.

Q: What to do after visualization by broad listening, I hope you can come up with a solution like "[Same-sex marriages in Taiwan are not kinship.
A: I believe there is a [two-step deliberation
- 1: To make people realize that where they are discussing A or B, "No, there is also C and D."
    - Acknowledging new options, widening the range of choices
    - Currently, we are pushing forward with the idea that this is where we are lacking.
- 2: Choice among a finite number of options
    - This is currently in the form of a majority vote, a sheikh's decision, or a QV.

Q: Populism/avoidance of populism
A: Make accountability visible by having a "responsible person" make the final decision, and maintain a structure in which the representative takes responsibility, not just the AI or the voices of the many.

Q: Administrative DX and elderly support
A: The response for those who wish to meet face-to-face will remain. The introduction of digital procedures will reduce the window load and increase the time available for those who wish to meet face-to-face. The rate of smartphone use is rising, even among the elderly.

Q: Segregation of specialty areas and broad listening
A: It is necessary to have "two wheels" to gather opinions from both the general public and experts. Expert interviews are still required as in the past.

Q: Dealing with conflicting plurics
A: Final human (team) choice/rejection in light of Team Mirai's vision. If it does not match the vision, it will not be adopted.

Q: How much personal information does broad listening take?
A: My number should be used to authenticate residency, and the regional discussion should make it clear whether the opinions of those who do not live in the area or not.
- Other attributes should be in a form where each individual decides whether to disclose them or not.

> [blu3mo](https://x.com/blu3mo/status/1938209960103686151) After all, so far we've only been able to do "AI interviews" and it's frustrating that we haven't been able to do "AI-assisted large scale deliberations"
>  I don't think technology is the bottleneck, but rather a lack of need, necessity, or purpose in the first place.
>  For what reason who should do the deliberation? Is the operator a political party?

> [hal_sk](https://x.com/hal_sk/status/1938210841339502923) I honestly think it would be difficult to do a public hearing AI thing for a story that would be discussed in parliament. The information asymmetry between the bureaucracy and the public is too great, and the discussion could easily become an air battle.
>  I think it would be better to use use use cases that are closer to home, such as policies implemented by local governments or urban development.

> [blu3mo](https://x.com/blu3mo/status/1938213018447581559) And do you think "citizen deliberation" and "collaboration across differences" are necessary?
>  I think that even if the AI chiefs just interview all citizens very much, they can achieve (1) gathering information for better decision making and (2) creating a sense of efficacy/conviction for decision making.

> [hal_sk](https://x.com/hal_sk/status/1938216062623027486) I think you should do just that, because you can feel that "my opinion was heard".
>  The next steps include "listening to others' opinions and changing one's own" and "new ideas are generated from opposing viewpoints through discussion.

> [blu3mo](https://x.com/blu3mo/status/1938217768756908162) I think one of the values of deliberation and communication is that "hearing other people's opinions changes your opinion", but the stakeholders in the field who want that... I wonder where they are...? And

> [hal_sk](https://x.com/hal_sk/status/1938219567404511681) Ah, that is the essential question. Not many stakeholders actually want to do this.
>  However, in decisions such as how to close public facilities or what to do about unprofitable bus routes, municipal officials want to lead consensus building in the community. There are local government officials who want to lead the community to a consensus on such decisions that will cause someone else to lose money.
>  Maybe some decarbonization actions involving companies.
- > [hal_sk](https://x.com/hal_sk/status/1938248463919231030) and I've written about it, but I'm still afraid to put it into critical and serious decision making. It's easier to do it for city planning and other situations where you want to draw out proactive participation and ideas from citizens, not zero-sum.
- >  Also, within CfJ, it could be used in a company! There is also talk of
- >  Let's have a meeting with the members once!

> [blu3mo](https://x.com/blu3mo/status/1938224633356161397) I believe that either "having a deliberative discussion" or "the sheikh persuading each person" can provide conviction and consensus building, and AI could scale both!
>  I don't have a very high resolution understanding, but the latter seems easier to scale with AI.

> [hal_sk](https://x.com/hal_sk/status/1938249299042975910) I know the sheikh wants to do it. Especially suited for election manifestos and such.
>  On the other hand, making it a municipal task still requires a bit more trial and error. The ball often falls between politics and practice, but if it is not made a municipal task, it is difficult to budget and unsustainable.
>  It is important to design a process that is incorporated into local government practice.
