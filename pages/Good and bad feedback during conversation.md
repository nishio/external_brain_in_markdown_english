Good and bad feedback during conversation
- What is nogqaw?
    - ng_or_good_question_and_words
    - Save the questions and keyword combinations.
        - False if the user replies NG, otherwise True
        - Used for training data on the appropriateness of question and keyword combinations
        - Data in case of false is read in subsequent sessions to avoid using the same combination.
- It would be good to judge the goodness itself from the trio.

    - This is judged from three sets, but in fact, only user comments are needed.
