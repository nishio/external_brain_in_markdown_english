> [takiuchi](https://twitter.com/takiuchi/status/1731334473311215870) In the end, any "policy that radically changes the environment" is a transfer of assets from the brain-dead elderly to the current generation.

The context is that if we finance health care for the elderly with government bonds, inflation will occur and the assets of the elderly will disappear, and whether this is correct or not note that it was interesting to conclude that any "policy that radically changes the environment" in the end is a transfer of assets from the brain-dead elderly to the working population".

>  If all health care for the elderly is financed by government bonds,
>  The elderly will be able to receive free medical care and the burden on the working-age population will be reduced.
>  If they do this, it will probably cause terrible inflation and end up wiping out all the assets of the elderly. They will end up having to pay for everything themselves.
>  As for the current generation, well, that's fine with me, because it will wipe out all the debt we have.
>  In exchange for the assets of the elderly.

>  Social security for prolonging the lives of the elderly, or later, later, later.
