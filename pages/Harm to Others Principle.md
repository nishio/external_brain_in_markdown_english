John Stuart [[mill]] on Liberty (1860)
> " That principle is, that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others." (J.S. Mill, On Liberty, 1860)
- > The principle is that the only purpose for which mankind, individually or collectively, can justifiably interfere with the freedom of action of any one is self-preservation. That is, the only purpose for which power can be justly exercised over a member of a civilized society against his will is the prevention of harm to others.
- > "The principle is this. "The principle is this: the only time man is justified in interfering with anyone's freedom of action, whether individually or collectively, is when it is for the purpose of self-defense. The only justifiable use of force against an individual in a civilized society is for the purpose of preventing harm from coming to others.
