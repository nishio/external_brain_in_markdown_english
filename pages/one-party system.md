title: "one-party system"
---

> A predominant-party system (predominant-party system, dominant-party system) is a system in which one major party remains in power under multiparty free elections in a liberal democracy by maintaining the support of a majority of voters. It is also called a one-party system. Also called a one-party dominant system. The concept was proposed by Italian political scientist Giovanni Sartori in the 1970s. It is distinguished from one-party dictatorship or [[hegemonic party system]] in non-free-election socialist (communist) countries.

- Since the formation of the [[Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP) in 1955, Japan has had a single-party system with the LDP in power for about 64 of the last 68 years (about 94%).

- The LDP's long-term government, known as the 55-year regime, collapsed once in 1993, but since 2012 it has again become a single-party system with the LDP as the dominant party.
- Although the introduction of the single-seat constituency system was intended to create a two-party system, it resulted in the creation of a single-party system (one strong and many weak) with an even stronger LDP dominance.
- Almost all of the parties that once replaced the LDP in power have disappeared, and the difference in strength and asymmetry between the LDP and other parties has made it difficult for a two-party system to take root in Japan.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The main factors that have contributed to the LDP's long-term rule and one-party dominant party system in Japan are as follows
- Influence of Cold War structure: The LDP supported liberalism and capitalism, while the Socialist Party, the leading opposition party after the war, had strong socialist and communist colors. The majority of voters did not want a socialist government and continued to support the LDP.
- Distribution of the fruits of economic growth: During the period of rapid economic growth, the LDP consolidated its support by distributing profits to various interest groups.
- Weak and divided opposition: Opposition parties were often unable to field enough candidates because they were not united in their vision of government and some were comfortable with being in opposition.
- Impact of the single-seat constituency system: The single-seat constituency system was introduced with the expectation of a two-party system, but it has resulted in an even greater advantage for the LDP, which has superior organizational and financial strength.
- LDP's know-how and other parties' inexperience: The LDP has many years of know-how in governing, while other parties are inexperienced and prone to confusion after a change of government.

Due to the above structural factors, the LDP dominance has become the norm in Japan.
