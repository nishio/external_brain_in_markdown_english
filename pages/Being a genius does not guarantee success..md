- The fact that someone is [[genius]] does not [[assure]] that what he does will be [[successful]].
- The fact that someone is a genius does not guarantee that his/her life will be [happiness
- The fact that someone is a genius does not guarantee that he or she will be [[evaluated]] by those around him or her.

- They must be different and yet have their own meanings.

Rather [[inverse correlation]], there is a theory that there is
    - [[An ordinary man killing a genius]]
    - [[Minority opinion]] is attacked by [[the majority]] [peer pressure
    - The majority side doesn't realize they're attacking.
    - I just find value in [[being the same]].
        - [[Early adopters are a minority]]
            - [[First penguins are lonely]]
    - There are situations where that choice is harmful.
            - [[Average orientation is the worst environment]]
