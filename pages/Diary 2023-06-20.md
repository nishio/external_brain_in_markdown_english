- Also, I have to prepare for a presentation by Friday and compile documents by Friday.
- Mental health tends to be compromised when [[indefinite task with no "completion" present]] is doubled
- This time, I knew that if I took on the project vaguely, I would go bankrupt, so I decided to take on two specific tasks with priorities.
    - Visualization of low priority even if tasks are to be added
    - Obviously, when it came to something better than I could do, I asked the right people to do it.
- tired feeling
    - Maybe it's just a lack of exercise and [[the broad back muscles]] are just ticking.
    - [[運動不足による疲労感]]割とよくある、 [[stretch]] などを念入りにするとスッキリするかも<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/maichan/icon' alt='/villagepump/maichan.icon' height="19.5"/>
- I took a long break and got my head straight.
    - The recognition of "two unknown tasks that do not exist at completion" is already a bug in itself, and it is not being recognized properly.
    - Project A: Friday until 8 p.m.
        - Task A1: Hard, just hard, no right answer, no completion
        - Task A2: Small, puzzle-like, challenging but I think I can do it, can't wait to try it
        - Just the juxtaposition of these two is already going to bug me about task management.
    - Project B: Friday, 12:00 p.m.
        - Less important than A, but deadlines are ahead.
        - Task B1: Experiment of unknown duration
        - Task B2: Create lecture materials based on B1
    - Task C: Bug fixes, affecting A
    - Task D: Major update, needs to be done as soon as possible after release of A
- I see
- Okay, here's what I'll do.
    - 0: Check first to see if C can be easily fixed, D won't until A is done.
        - ✅Bug not reproduced, pass this time, next action is to introduce [[Sentry]].
    - 1: A1 by dividing the time and estimate the overall time required.
    - 2: Review the plan in light of this.
    - 3: Separate time A2 and do not spend too much time
    - 4: B's are expunged from the brain.
        - Defeat Plan: No experimentation, no documentation, direct opening of the paper for commentary
- [[Tasks that are never completed will expand as time allows]], so the only way is to set a time limit.
- I think a good percentage of what is described by the term "[[busy]]" is just "failing [[task management]].
    - The reason why you think you are "busy" for "a task that can be done in a lighthearted manner" is because you are confused because you have failed in task management.
    - The state in which there are "an unmanageable amount of tasks" is caused by a failure in task management in the previous section "[[Selection of Tasks]]".
        - I fail a lot.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - The expression "busy" reflects the implicit assumption that there is a "busy situation" outside of you, but in fact something inside of you is creating that situation.
    - #TaskManagement
- The story of a man who doesn't help out with the housework, using "I'm busy with work" as an excuse.
    - If "busy" is like the above, then I don't see how putting pressure on someone who is confused and failing at task management to do household tasks is going to improve things.
        - That situation itself is a failure of team management.
        - It might be possible to see it by stopping for a moment.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - I feel like sometimes when I'm in a stuck state, doing chores helps me get organized.
            - [[一旦イスから立ち上がってみる]]の良い<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/yosider/icon' alt='/villagepump/yosider.icon' height="19.5"/>
                    - [[lack of vision]] to get out of it.
    - Can't afford to manage to clear up the mess.
        - I don't have the time or the mental capacity.
        - It's just a "project under fire for mismanagement".
        - If that's the case, then it's a "failure of even higher management" to ask that fire team to solve the problem within the team.
        - If it were a software project, a situation where a strong engineer would be brought in to put out the fire.
        - What if we put in a home that's on fire, and put in a motsuyotsuyotsuyotsuyotsuyotsuyotsu [[housekeeper]]?
            - The housekeeping side of the house doesn't seem to get flamed very often.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - Like right after the birth?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - It could be before the move or something.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - And then there's the family member with corona...<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - If you want to combat the declining birthrate, you'd better increase the number of programs that reduce the risk of childcare...
                - [[内閣ベビーシッター]]券などがありますね<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
                    - Was [[nursing leave]] a government program? I'm grateful for that, too.
                - [[病児保育]]は自治体のやつがあるな、登録してるけど使ったことない<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
                    - It's hard to ask for a regular babysitter when you have a sick child.
            - Usually my house.[[ベビーシッター]]さんを使ってるのでこのパターンですね<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - Not really a flameout, but a break from mental health.
                    - The company has a babysitter as part of the company benefits program, so it's a big deal if you don't use it.
                        - Whoa, upper management is a good management pattern.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
                            - As a result, employees are less likely to have trouble at home, increasing productivity.
                - good prospect (e.g. marriage, business)<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
                    - So, in managerial terms, you're preventing a fire by making sure there's plenty of room to maneuver?
                    - If there is a sudden problem, etc., it can be absorbed if there is enough time.
                    - If you can't afford it, the dominoes fall.
            - during this period[[きみは赤ちゃん]]という10年くらい前の出産エッセイ本を読んで、10年の変化事情に関心が出ている<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/はるひ/icon' alt='/villagepump/はるひ.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - [[「服屋に行くための服がない」みたいな話]]<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/yosider/icon' alt='/villagepump/yosider.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - Not enough room to make room.
            - If someone doesn't have clothes to go to the clothing store, should we give them clothes?
- I told my wife, "[[I don't know]] why you're trying to hide the fact that you lost your ring."
    - Wife: "If the person is an emotion type who gets angry or cries about the other person losing the ring, it is possible that the idea of [[hiding it because it is a pain in the ass]] arises. And [[emotion types]] are more likely to do that."
    - I see.
    - And then there's the situation where it's a one-of-a-kind ring, handmade by both parties, and it's a bad idea, he said.
        - Neither of us are the emotive type, so I never thought of making them homemade.
            - Is there a relationship between emotion type and handmade type?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/yosider/icon' alt='/villagepump/yosider.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - I thought it was insanely relevant.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - We see no value in handcrafting rings.
    - Sure, there have been times in the past when I've been like, I'm not going to tell you today.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Task A1 is done.
    - worn-out (as opposed to sleepy)
    - rest
- I've been thinking about doing Task A2, but I'm just not feeling up to it.
    - Maybe it's because my wife is tiaquin on TV.
    - Maybe it's because of the growth of Task A3.
- Uh, let's just take a walk for now.
