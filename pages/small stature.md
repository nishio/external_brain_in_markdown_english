Meaning of the word "kozane"
- In Chinese characters, it is written "kofuda" (small bill).
- As the letters indicate, it is a small bill
- For example, small tags are connected together and used for armor.
- > The main part of the armor is made of small strips of cowhide or iron called kosatsu, which have two or three rows of small holes drilled in them. The small plates have two or three rows of small holes drilled vertically, and the surface is coated with lacquer. The plates are stacked horizontally, and then joined together vertically in layers to form the armor. This structure helps the wearer flex and stretch his or her body. In order to reduce weight, the armor is often made mainly of small leather tags, with iron tags mixed in at key points as necessary. This is called "Kanamaze. The name "kofuda" originated from the large fuda boards that were used in the modern guzoku, and in the old days they were called fuda-ita.
