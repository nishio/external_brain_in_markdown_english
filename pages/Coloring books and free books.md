title: "Coloring books and free books"

- Some people want [[picture for coloring in (coloring)]] and others want a blank [[general-purpose notebook]].
Just as some people want "a frame that can be filled ([[framework]])" in order to think, and others want "[[freedom]] unencumbered by [[box]]".

> Not necessarily many people can draw whatever they want in a free book and train whatever they want.
> Many people want a clear drill on what needs to be done.

> It would be crazy to start studying math there, even if they give you a blank notebook and don't tell you what to do.
> That's what it's all about.

> We live in a world where if you draw freely, you get stabbed.

I think there are a lot of people who started with drill books but got sidetracked and started writing in free books (I do).
> If you start from there, and say, "Free book is fun," "Let's make a free book," and "Study with this," it may be difficult for learners to learn.

> I guess it's the same as there are people who want "a frame (framework) that can be filled" for thinking and people who want "freedom unencumbered by a frame". twitter.com/tokoroten/stat...
