title: "spontaneity and Maslow's stage theory of needs"
---

Although "[[Maslow's stage theory of needs]]" is not a particularly well-founded hypothesis, it is a useful framework.
Before hiring an employee, a company wants to know what kind of [[self-realization desire]] the employee has and whether he or she is willing to act on his or her own initiative.
On the other hand, those on the receiving end of employment interviews are placed in an anxious state of "I still haven't decided where to be hired.
Lower order needs are not being met.
Isn't it foolhardy to observe "what kind of higher-order desires we would have if they were fulfilled" in this state?
