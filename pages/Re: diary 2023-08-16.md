Although the content is extensive, the important themes can be summarized as follows
- [[Rethinking Public Administration and Governance]]
    - Limitations of the "big government/small government" dichotomy.
    - Public administration as a platform and investment in public goods through strategic downsizing.
        - The possibility of improving [[the art of governance]] itself by referring to models such as the [[Ethereum Foundation]].
- Trial [new governance system
    - A meta-level study of [[public goods projects]] and [[grant distribution]].
    - While questioning the rationale for governing the current government, we are considering our own economic zone and taxation model.
- [[Creative Process]] and [[Contextualization of Value]]
    - The process by which an artist or researcher [[gives form to "something that has not yet taken shape"]].
        - The importance of [[context]] and [[verbalizing]] and the need for [[resolution to identify]] the good ones.
    - [[human relations]] and [[evaluation mechanisms]].
    - [[tokenization of praise]], [[hunger for evaluation]], [[influence of social relationships]].

These may also have connections to the user interests of "[[unconscious data democracy]]" and "[[careful deliberation]]". The metaphor "[[AI is Bonsai]]" may also suggest the use of AI as a process of creation and management.
