I need to [[hair-cutting]] soon.
- The interval since last time is something like 12 days.
- This time [[shaved]].

- [[Proportional representation election carried forward]]

[KDP and Okano's complaint accepted by Chiba Prefectural Police over use of proportional representation marker flag (Kyodo News) - Yahoo! News](https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/e31c2e2c12700c27b1944f1d7b1350260b3a4134)
- I received my proportional representation marker at the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, but it was in a separate box for each person, and the Tokyo constituents were processed at the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Office, so I didn't meet them until the start of the speeches!
- It's an amazing mistake to write your name on a proportional representation person's flag, mistaking it for the one that the person in the electoral district is supposed to have only one.
- I was going to tweet about it, but decided not to because of the lack of merit.

- [[Amount of Team Mirai related Tweet]]

- [[intersecting group]]

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1948287797561061429) "There's no way we can win a seat in the House of Representatives," and then "We won a seat! It is understandable to feel "We were right! But if you take a [[contemptuous]] attitude toward the politicians and supporters of other parties, it will be [[reproduction of unpleasantness]]. Please read the official site again, and try to hold back.

- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1948288025307525536) In order for the vision to take root in an organization, it must be repeated so often that it becomes an earworm.

> [tanukiponkich](https://x.com/tanukiponkich/status/1946835040278917571) I'm looking at the github report of Team Mirai. I'm not sure if it's possible for me to handle this by myself since there are more than 5,000 PRs, but I can see the horsepower of the group of engineers that Mr. Yasuno has assembled to get the job done.

- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1946835040278917571) Actually, not only people whose main job is engineers, but also experts in medicine, science policy, etc. are all learning how to use GitHub and using GitHub, they're very good learners.



> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1947974982635761668) I see, because the campaign period is over and it's no longer "campaigning".
>  >[team_mirai_stu](https://x.com/team_mirai_stu/status/1947974982635761668) [[High school students and U27 adults are now also accepted]].
>
>  Election period is over.
>  "Conditions for Participation by Student Teams" have been expanded as of today!
>
>  Until now: only students over 18 years old
>  From now on: Young people aged 15-27 who have completed compulsory education
>
>  I mean...
>  High school students are welcome to participate!
>  Working people of the same age as the students are also welcome to participate!

> [team_mirai_stu](https://x.com/team_mirai_stu/status/1948048815505723420) Exactly!
>
>  Since the election period started soon after the student team was created, we had to decline participation of anyone under 18 years of age just in case they were underage so as not to hit the campaign trail of minors.
>  From now on, we will proceed in a manner that allows high school students to participate, under the policy that minors are prohibited from activities only during the election period.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1948051486900092992) I see! I think it's great to provide minors who can't campaign with the opportunity to observe the activities of someone a little older!

> [puppet_bowl](https://x.com/puppet_bowl/status/1947969417759125567) Team Mirai showed us that there are other ways to get involved in politics and elections besides "voting".
>  This result may not suddenly change your life.
>  But over the past few days, even I, a terminal supporter, have been experiencing a feeling I have never had before.
>  I feel that I may have been involved in the change of this country, even if only a little.
>  It will be an invaluable experience.

>  #TeamMirai
>  >minowanowa: Is the election over?
>  To be honest, it was noisy.
>  No matter where you win, your life won't be the same tomorrow.
>  Well, if you vote, you might be able to at least avoid the worst.
>  In fact, it could even be the shortest to the worst.
>  In the end, you have to make your own way in life.
>  Let's keep up the good work tomorrow.
- [[Voting is just the bottom line of social participation guaranteed by the state.]]
- Japan is doing a moderate method of [[voting]] by distributing it to all its citizens, while there are many other methods of influencing society, such as [[violent revolution]] and [[technological use of force]].
    - Well, minors are excluded, so it's not "all the people.
        - [[Women's suffrage]] also dates back to 1945, so it hasn't even been a century yet.
        - We are in the [[first century]] when women were given the right to vote.
