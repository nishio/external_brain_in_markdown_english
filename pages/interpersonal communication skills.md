- I'd like to understand "interpersonal communication skills" in more detail.
    - It would be nice to see [[broad listening]] as a technique to enhance [[pair group comprehension]].
- The "ability to transmit information to a group" may be "broadcasting" in the opposite direction.
    - Do not reply to person-to-person
        - [[Do not reply]] / [[Do not allow to reply]].
    - You must choose carefully who you reply to.
        - Maybe this will be limited to "online"
            - Tend to have more in common with people they talk to physically face to face.
                - Compared to random people online.
                - We have a lot in common, like people interested in attending the same events, or working for the same organizations.
    - Another expression: [[one must understand the person to whom one is replying]].
        - And [[the cost of understanding is high]], so of course [[not everyone is eligible]].

interpersonal communication skills

> [tokoroten](https://x.com/tokoroten/status/1815566188858298628) I thought that people who are in a reasonably smart position, but as soon as they start to wrestle, they fall into [[conspiracy theory]], their interpersonal communication skills (a coined word) must be low. （I thought that their ability to communicate with other people in a group must be low.

>  If you can't see it as a herd, you get the dumbest of the dumbest of the dumb, blackmail them, and when you realize it, you fall to the dark side and conspiracy theories.
>
>  We need to find the smartest guy in the group and have a discussion with him, but the dichotomous thinking of [[friend or foe]] makes it impossible to recognize [[that there are gradations in the enemy]], so we can't communicate with the right person and reach the right point of contention.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1815566188858298628) "Intergroup communication skills" good term, I can also say [[broad listening]] is a technique to enhance "[[intergroup comprehension skills]]"
