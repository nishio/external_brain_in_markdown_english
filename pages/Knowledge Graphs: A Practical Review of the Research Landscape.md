<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This article provides an overview of the research areas related to [[knowledge graphs]](KG) and attempts to present an integrated framework. The main points are as follows
- KG research is being conducted in a variety of areas, including [[natural language processing]] (NLP), [[semantic web]] (SW), machine learning, databases, and data mining.
- NLP focuses on information extraction and [[relation extraction]], SW on [[ontology design]] and [[linked data]], and machine learning on representation learning and [[probabilistic graphical models]].
- There has been no framework that explicitly shows the relationship between these fields. Therefore, the author proposes a framework that integrates the sequence of steps from domain modeling to KG construction, identification, and access.
- It is pointed out that important future research issues include clarification of the effects of noise during KG construction on later processing, application of KG to common sense reasoning, and development of KG visualization tools.
- Through cross-disciplinary research cooperation, it is expected that more large-scale and innovative research on KG will be realized.

A bird's-eye view of research on knowledge graphs
- Traditionally, research on knowledge graphs has been conducted separately in various fields such as natural language processing, semantic web, and machine learning. This article, however, explicitly organizes their relationships and places them within an integrated framework. This clarifies the relationships among the fields and the potential for leveraging each other's knowledge.

The specifics of future research issues.
- From a cross-disciplinary perspective, the report presents specific issues for the development of knowledge graph research, including clarification of the effects of noise, application to common sense reasoning, and development of visualization tools. This is an important point that suggests the need not only for in-depth study of individual fields, but also for cross-disciplinary cooperation.

With the current explosive growth of data and knowledge, knowledge graphs have become an important technology related to various fields. In this context, this article, which rethinks knowledge graph research across disciplinary boundaries, may serve as a guideline to encourage more innovative research on a larger scale.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The article points out the following inter-disciplinary relationships in knowledge graph research
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the Semantic Web (SW)
    - NLP deals primarily with [[unstructured text]], whereas SW emphasizes structured [[ontology]]. However, NLP techniques such as information extraction are essential to the construction of knowledge graphs, and the two are closely related.
- Relationship between machine learning and NLP/SW
    - Machine learning techniques such as [[representation learning]] and probabilistic graphical models have been applied to relation extraction in NLP and [[link prediction]] in SW to improve the accuracy of knowledge graphs.
- Relationship between database data mining and NLP/SW
    - Database technology is essential for efficient storage and retrieval of knowledge graphs. Data mining is also useful for knowledge discovery from graph structures. These can be combined with NLP and SW to enable more advanced knowledge graph utilization.
- Need for cross-disciplinary research cooperation
    - Based on the relationship between disciplines, the author argues that collaboration across disciplinary boundaries is essential for knowledge graph research. For example, it is expected that NLP and SW will collaborate to automate ontology construction, and that machine learning and data mining will be combined to improve the efficiency of knowledge discovery.

Thus, knowledge graph research involves a complex interplay of various fields. The key message of this article is that it is essential for the development of knowledge graph research to leverage the strengths of each field while creating synergies among the fields.
