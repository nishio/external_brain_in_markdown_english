When humans have clear [[axes of values]], they tend to prefer to focus and delve into them alone
- For example, once people recognize the value of camera resolution or communication speed, they will pursue higher resolution and higher speed.
- Often ignores whether it really leads to customer value
- [[Visual field narrowing on axis]]

As a result, what is along the "axis" is created in the world first, and what is not along the "axis" is relatively delayed.

Customers are not just along the axis.
- Often, if you actually observe it, you'll find that clients are falling into the troughs of the shaft.
- There is social value in creating something B that covers the "off axis" in these situations.
- This newly created thing B is seen as "inferior" by "[[those who are]] narrow-minded on the axis".
    - 'A, which was there long ago, is better than B, which is made now.'
    - This makes the implicit assumption that "when mapped onto axis X and compared in one dimension the A that was there in the past is better than the B that was built now."
