title: "Learning from the Young"
---

I heard that "in this industry, you have to bring [[Attitude to learn]] from young people" and I thought it was very important, so I wrote it down.

To have an attitude of learning
- First, you need [[Attitude of listening]] #Listening
- If you say a lot of things based on your own ideas without listening carefully to what the other person is saying, you prevent the other person from outputting information to you.
- If you interpret without listening to what the other person has to say, naturally "misunderstandings" will occur.
    - Human language is not clearly defined or standardized.
    - Communication always involves "misunderstandings" for which neither party is responsible.

    - [[authoritarian gradient]], there is a high cost for younger people to correct senior misconceptions.
    - Actions tend to occur to avoid fixing trivial things because they are troublesome
    - Failure to correct misunderstandings incurs significant costs in time delays
        - Misunderstandings are the source of greater misunderstandings.
        - Acting on a misunderstanding causes significant costs after the fact.
- Therefore, communication design that minimizes misunderstandings as much as possible is necessary.
