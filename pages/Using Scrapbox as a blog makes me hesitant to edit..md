title: "Using Scrapbox as a blog makes me hesitant to edit."
---

Using Scrapbox as a "blog with content in chronological order", I feel uncomfortable editing past posts.
- Because it does not match the general blogging mental model that updates bring up past posts.

About this solution

Part 1, when modifying the Scrapbox implementation
- It would be good if users who are using the blog-like usage could sort their projects by "date created" when others view their projects.
- Currently, sorting by creation date exists, but it cannot be set for each project.
    - Because the sort order information is tied to the user, not the project.
- Proposal 1: Tie sort order information to projects
- Proposal 2: Tie the user to the project crossover.
    - Each user can set in which order each project is displayed
    - It would be better to be able to set initial values for each project

- With proposal 2, I could, for example, order this project by date of update, while the initial value for new visitors to this project would be Most Linked.
    - It's useful not only for people with blog-like usage.

Part 2, if you want to do something with the current Scrapbox functionality.
- Divide the project into two parts

    - Create a project for [[Living Text]] separate from the current blog-like project.
    - Call it a "draft project" for convenience.
        - It can be public or private.
        - First, export the current blog-like project and import it into the draft project
    - New articles are written on the draft project side first.
        - Draft projects are rewritten without regard to changes in the update date and time.
    - I'll copy and paste it into a blog-like project when I'm done.
        - Prog-like projects are basically not rewritten once you put in an article.
    - Teach blog-like projects to those who want to see them in order of updated date and time.
