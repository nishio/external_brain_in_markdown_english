title: "Blind tote bag?"
---

- After creating [[tote bag]], I was thinking that since the density of information was uneven, I should cut it into a grid and arrange the images like a card... and I wondered if this could be a [[blind spot card]]. I thought it might be a [[blind spot card]].

- [[A book as a collection of characters]] not a form of "a collection of useful knowledge."
- The blind spot card was initially envisioned as "a card with a picture and its explanatory booklet.
    - It all started with [[tarot card]] in the first place.
- But we've resorted to having letters.
- Trying to make a tote bag, I was more constrained to use only pictures to express myself.
    - Some of the pictures that were there before were modified to be more communicative with just pictures.
- I was under the impression that the card would have a name attached to it.
    - That's what tarot cards are for.
- If I'm going to use a tote bag, I want it to be about a number.
    - Why? Why not just have the title written on each picture?
        - I'm just interested in "non-literal expression" rather than because this is a tote bag.
