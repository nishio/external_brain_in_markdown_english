title: "It's refuted over and over again."
---

One person A makes a claim X and is [[rebuttal]] Y by another.
Then again, A makes the claim that X, and again is refuted Y.
A thinks that X is right and Y is wrong, and he is uncomfortable with the coming of the rebuttal Y.
And yet if you insist on repeating X, it's [[Insanity of doing the same thing over and over again and hoping for a different result.]]

Whether X is right and Y is wrong, vice versa, or neither is determined from this condition alone.
- (It is often done to infer that X would be wrong because A is being raped by insanity, but there is no guarantee that this inference is correct.)
