- Talking about patents, some of the stuff I write in my scbo anyway is aimed at [[public knowledge]].
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/masui/icon' alt='/villagepump/masui.icon' height="19.5"/>I think Mr. Kurokawa said that if you write down your idea on Twitter, you can protect it even if someone else puts it out later, because you can say, "I've already put that out there.
    - I've been collecting them.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>

        - >  The person who invents something new should also record all related ideas before presenting it. Otherwise, there is a possibility that someone will misunderstand that he/she thought of a new application and there will be a dispute.

        - >  If you can't publish the related idea, you can tweet a hash of the file with the related idea. I can prove that I originally thought of that idea YO!

                - Since Japanese patent rights are based on the "first-to-file" principle, not the "first-inventor-to-file" principle, there is no point in privately recording "having invented something first".
                - > A system in which the patent right is granted to the first person who files an application for a patent. For example, if two persons have the same invention, the patent right is granted to the person who filed the application with the Patent Office first (the one with the earlier filing date), regardless of which of them invented the invention first. In contrast, granting a patent to the first inventor is called the first-to-invent principle.

                    - He said that few countries have the first-to-invent principle anymore most countries now have the first-to-file principle. Even in the United States, where the first-to-invent principle remained in place until recently...the transition took place on March 16, 2013.
