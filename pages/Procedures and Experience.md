title: "Procedures and Experience"
---

- There is a difference between [[procedure]] and [story of one's experiences
- An article that says, "This is how you can set up your system.
    - Sometimes the article is 6 years old.
        - The official website is properly updated.
        - Personal blogs written six years ago are rarely updated.
            - A medium in which blogs are likely to induce writing off in the first place.
    - A six year old article is not a problem in and of itself.
        - If "these are the steps to set it up" isn't a lie, it doesn't matter.
        - Often they're right when they're written, but often they turn out to be lies.
    - People who are allergic to English avoid English on official websites and read these articles.
        - Better to machine translate and read the official website.
- Procedures and experiences are different.
    - Experiences that say, "I was able to set up this procedure" never turn out to be lies.
