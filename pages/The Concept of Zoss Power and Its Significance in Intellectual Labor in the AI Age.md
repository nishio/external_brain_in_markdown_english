Zoss Power Summary
- Definition: the energy to execute, to step out in the face of uncertainty and carry through once one has decided to "do it" in sympathy with the objective.
- Origin: "Zosu!", a variant of "Oshinobu (male)". which is a variant of "Oshinobu (male)". The core of the culture is not a rehash of Showa-era guts, but rather a voluntary commitment.
- Recent context: Reappraised in social networking and some business circles. A "Disagree and Commit" type of action-driven slogan.
- Relationship to other skills:
        - [[metacognition]] = head to determine strategy, [[abstraction]] = head to grasp the essence, zos force = muscles to move.
    - [Strong affinity with Grit and Negative Capability.
- Positioning in the AI age: The more AI takes on "answers" and "tasks," the more humans are required to set the questions, "spike" them, and finish them. The driving force to make this a reality is the Zosu force.
- Software Engineer:
    - Code generation depends on AI. The difference is made by problem setting, overall design, and sharpness of user value.
    - Zos force supports the persistence of investigation, iterative prototyping, and implementation of unknown areas.
- Researcher:
    - AI will assist in summarizing and analyzing what is known. The value is the creation of "[[what question]]" and [[attachment to hypothesis]].
    - The fuel that maintains the immersion of failure repetition and prolonged contemplation is the Zos force.

Misuse note: This is not a justification for working long hours. It becomes valuable only when accompanied by [[objective origin]], [[spontaneity]], and [[reproducibility]].
