title: "Round ✅ scores to whole numbers"

from [[pKeicho]]
Rounding scores to whole numbers?
- Pros: easy to view, low data volume
- Cons: Increased chance of getting the same score.
- Neither advantage nor disadvantage is big, so let's try it and think about it when it doesn't work out.

- [[If neither one or the other is big enough, I'll do it.]]
