> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1688792835733291008/photo/1) [[proof of being human]] got it!
> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1688793278647562241) The back side is not shown, so the back side may be a machine
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1688794319057002496) OK, precisely because it proves that "at least the retina is human-like"!

At the same time, the distribution of advertising revenue has started on the old Twitter in Japan, and it has become a hot topic. Some people mistakenly thought that it was a monthly fee when it was a half-yearly distribution, and said something like, "I get this much? Some people said something like, "I get this much?

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1688795106936262656) In terms of whether it's more interesting for Eron Musk to spread cash or Sam Altman to spread his own issued virtual currency, you're on the interesting side!
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1688796135983624193) I see, so you get something like this every week and you can receive it if you have an ID, kind of like a weekly log-in bonus.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1688797652329332736) I'm sure some uninteresting people will come up to me and ask if I can make money when I write this, so I'll just say that I think it's a game called Sam Altman that you can get [[in-game points]] from Early Access. I don't know what kind of game is going to be released, but I signed up for Early Access because it looked like an interesting game.

# Preliminary Preparation
Put in the app and authenticate by SMS.

- Is the orb by your side?"
    - I don't have any, so I'm going to use Later.

- There were no open slots at all at this time.

# Encounter with [[Orb]], ed.
I just looked at the app and saw more reservation slots.
- Maybe they were able to get staff to attend to it or something.
- > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1688578402113212416?s=20): got an appointment, so I'll be at EDGE off at 3pm tomorrow for the Orb experience.

Here they come.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/aa7c42fa2949f435c5b875b03780eec5/thumb/1000)
- Do you have an appointment? I have an appointment at 3:00 p.m. Nishio.
    - I've taken the name out of the traditional reservation groove.
    - But there was no phase to put my name in anywhere.
    - So the staff must have thought, "I don't know if you can identify yourself.
- Confirm that you are the person who made the reservation by showing the reservation confirmation e-mail.

## Orbs are here!

    - Show the QR code of the app you have to Orb.
    - Then show eyes to Orb.

- Not much time for scanning.
- I've been verifying that what I just took is OK for a longer time than that.
- I understand, because you don't want one person to get multiple IDs on the same retina.
    - Essentially "verification that it does not match all existing retinal data"?
    - The later this process becomes, the more expensive it becomes.

- They proved to be human!

- Much shinier than the CG.

I tried to do it on the train on the way home, but it was like, wait a minute.
- Let's calm down when we get home.

In the meantime, let's receive this week's [[Universal Basic Income]].

Claimed, they're going to wait a little longer for the money to be transferred to the wallet.

See you next week for the next issue.

For this to exist as more than just in-game points, you have to be able to transfer money to another address or something.

Ah, I see. So this is where we do it.

I see, it also has a QR code payment system like [[PayPay]].
- If you can pay this way in restaurants, you can eat without trading or cashing in cryptocurrency.
- I still don't know how to give out the QR code for me to receive it.
    - If we could do that, it would make it easier to transfer money between individuals.
    - Oh, I could switch from the camera screen.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/2018f245cda50d4f2d1b34a1745de570/thumb/1000)


I was able to send and withdraw the money properly.
- This is different from in-game points!
- [[Optimism network]]
    - [https://coinpost.jp/amp/?p=459330](https://coinpost.jp/amp/?p=459330)
- If I send money to this address, will it go in?

Deposit functionality not yet implemented
- Well, I'll try it when I'm a little more ready to put money in and out.

What is [[WETH]]?
- >  What is [[Wrapped Ether]] (WETH)? WETH is an ERC-20 token on Ethereum that represents 1 Ether (ETH)
- Ah, I see, Ethereum is not [[ERC-20]], so you wrapped it up.

# Comments
.
- What I thought when I let Orb read the QR code.
    - Maybe this is the future of direct QR reading between individuals without Orb.
    - Gather data on "Mr. A and Mr. B physically met."
        - Like [[VESS Card]].
        - Once the data is collected, we can use [[SybilRank]]-like methods to increase reliability.
    - Those who scanned in Orb will be [Trust seeds
    - If I "friend-recognize" a friend who hasn't been scanned by Orb, my friend's score will go up a bit!
        - Like [[BrightID]].
        - If you get recognized as a friend by some Trust seeds, you'll get enough humanity scores to qualify for [[Universal Basic Income]] without having to scan in Orb.
        - So there's an incentive to create a social network on top of this platform.
- When I saw the UI that allows payment by reading a QR code, I understood that it is not only a "human proof platform" but also a "small payment platform".
    - [[The Rise Web3 Crowdsourcing: One Use for Ethereum]]
    - > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1688839318260121600): Okay, I could see a platform for [[establishing the moral character of human nature]] and a platform for small payments. I could see a platform for [[establishing the moral character of human nature]] and a platform for small payments, but once that's done, of course the next step is a platform for [[crowdsourcing]], right?
    - Paying you in Worldcoin for the act of scanning the QR code of a friend who hasn't yet had their retina scanned in Orb to increase the degree to which they are human, and so on.
        - There is a reason to pay because it contributes to expanding the World ID network.
