If a structure in which A and B hang independently on C is [[unidimensionalized]] in the order "ABC", it becomes ambiguous whether A hangs on B or C.
- Example "I in beautiful Japan" is ambiguous as to whether it is "beautiful Japan" or "beautiful me.

If you try to do something about it, it becomes "AC and BC, in no particular order" or something like that.

Natural language is a naturally occurring protocol between devices with cognitive abilities that do not find this a problem, so it is expensive to try to flow something rigorous
