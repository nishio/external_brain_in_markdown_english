Avoiding [[Constraints]]
- From [[Current State]] to [[Ideal State]]
    - Transitioning from the current state to the ideal state
    - Desire to move with a simple implementation
- Left
    - However, unexpected constraints may be discovered during implementation
    - These are avoided haphazardly
    - In fact, it might have been better to turn left at the first obstacle instead of right
    - Lessons learned here:
        - By advancing and hitting constraints, their existence was realized
        - Instead of avoiding them haphazardly, the shape of the constraints should have been examined
- Right
    - A pattern that occurs because the left pattern is well-known
    - There is a vague anxiety about "there might be a constraint" ahead
    - When advancing and hitting a constraint, a change of course becomes necessary
    - Fearing this, the vague anxiety is avoided with a wide detour
    - However, in reality, proceeding straight did not result in hitting a constraint
    - Lessons learned here:
        - The anxiety or interpretation of "might hit a constraint" led to a wide detour
        - This also neglects the investigation of the "shape of the constraint" as a fact
