> ðŸ”¥ Boost grants, earn rewards, and shape the round!
>  Stake GTC during GG23 to upvote your favorite grants and increase their visibility in the round. The more you stake, the higher they rankâ€”and the more rewards you can claim from the 3% rewards pool!
I don't think I've ever seen this before.

Confused about the relationship between Stake on this Project and Add to Cart
- My experience so far is that Add to Cart is the right way to go.

Hmmm, get a GTC first?

Swap functionality was built in.

Why did I come twice?
- After requesting the upper limit, the actual withdrawal request came
- Why wasn't it enough to submit a request to pull it out out of the blue?

Could they have done it?

This place hasn't changed, but the top page has changed to 77 people.

put in 0.24USD, increased by 1.11USD Later it became that this was probably done by someone else at the same time.
1GTC=0.24USD is 34.25JPY
1000JPY is 29.19 GTC
Okay, well, let's put in another 28 or so.

I'll try Add to Cart next time.

- Over here, it looks like you can do it directly at ETH without swapping.
- But I've already made it to GTC, so w
    - Oh, but your GTC balance is zero.

This time the GTC is on Ethereum Mainnet.
- Confirmed by MetaMask.
- The ARB shown here must be in [[Arbitrum One]], I think I did something like that last time.
    - Here it is: ![image](https://gyazo.com/81a16d8c1857009e17c90638c255bace/thumb/1000) / ![image](https://gyazo.com/53a84c0876b594409abcbfb7c736e1f8/thumb/1000)
- I've switched, but I'm still on Arbitrum One.
- I don't know, but this is the last function, the first one I tried seems to be newer, and GTC only knows how to do it from that one, so I'll take that one, I don't have much time left.

I didn't see it because it changed to MetaMask right away, but there was a description of the process.

GTC Utility Experiment for GG23

We see a strong opportunity to create meaningful token utility in GG23. While we havenâ€™t launched many experiments in this area before, this presents an exciting chance to explore and learn. By testing new approaches, we can develop a stronger perspective and expertise on what will be most effective.Our first experiment will be fast/lean and lean into market trends that are currently successful.
We see a powerful opportunity to create a meaningful token utility in GG23. We have not experimented much in this area before, and this is an exciting opportunity to explore and learn. By trying new approaches, we can develop a stronger perspective and expertise on what works best. Our first experiment will be fast/lean and lean on currently successful market trends.

We would like to run this experiment through GG23â€™s QF OSS Program, which will have a total of $600k matching pool. We will be requesting 3% of the round value (600k USDC) at 18k USDC to fund the staking rewards for this experiment. This request for funds will be included in the matching pool ratification ahead of the round.
This experiment will be run through GG23's QF OSS program and will have a total matching pool of $600k USDC. We are requesting 3% of the round value (600k USDC) in 18k USDC to cover the staking fee for this experiment. This funding request will be included in the ratification letter for the matching pool prior to the round.

Experiment #1 GG23: Stake for your favorite projects
Experiment #1 GG23: Bet on your favorite project

The basic concept is that anyone can stake GTC on projects in a GG round to showcase their support and draw greater volumes of crowdfunding, excitement, and matching funds.
The basic concept is that anyone can bet GTC on a project in the GG round to show their support and draw more crowdfunding, excitement and matching funds.

How it works: How it works: How it works

Round starts
- Gitcoin funds the stake rewards pool (with 18k USDC)
- Gitcoin funds stake reward pool (using 18k USDC)
- Projects apply and get approved
- Project is submitted and approved
- Projects show up on explorer
- Project appears in Explorer.
- Users stake GTC on grants to signal support. Minimum stake is 1 GTC. No maximum stake.
- Users wager GTC on grants to signal support. The minimum wager is 1 GTC. There is no maximum wager.
- For every project, we keep track who has staked how much (aka we know the % )
- For every project, track who bet how much (i.e., know the %)
- Once the round ends, QF distribution runs and we know which projects get what % of the pot
- At the end of the round, a QF distribution is run, showing which projects won what percentage of the pot

For example: For example:
- If project A gets 5% of the pot , then reward pot for staking on project is 5% of 18k (900 USDC).
- If Project A earns 5% of the pot, the reward pot for staking in the project is 5% of 18k (900 USDC).
- This 900 USDC is split between the stakers based on how much % they had staked
- This 900 USDC will be divided among the stakers based on how much % the staker has wagered
- If wallet1 accounts for 50% of the staked tokens for project A, they get 50% of 900 (450 USDC)
- If wallet1 accounts for 50% of Project A's stake tokens, it receives 50% of 900 (450 USDC)
- If wallet2 accounts for 1% of the staked tokens for project A, they get 1% of 900 (9 USDC)
- If wallet2 represents 1% of Project A's stake tokens, it receives 1% of 900 (9 USDC).

Bridge finished while I was reading, so I'll continue.

No donation to Gitcoin because it would complicate the experiment.

- Whoa, it's an unlimited use limit request.

It's done.

Hmmm... I guess this is the behavior of putting 0.24USD in the rounding error range and funding recieved in current rount increased by 0.24USD...
- The first difference was probably done by someone else at the same time.

- When I put in 1 GTC, the ESTIMATED MATCH was 0, but this time I put in about $7 and it looks like $160 will be matched.
- Is staking a predictive market-based mechanism for estimating how much funding a project is likely to receive?
    - It was something to do early on, not something to do now, near the end.

Let's Mint it!

- There's your last fractional ARB.

    - Literacy is indeed growing.

    - It's not funny at all.
    - Well, I understood it to mean that I can NFT and prove to others what I donated to this round.
        - I don't know at what point you want to prove it.
        - I mean, it's inscribed in the blockchain, so you don't have to use this method to prove it.
