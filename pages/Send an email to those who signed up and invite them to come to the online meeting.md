The following is a quote from [[Meetup with Audrey & Glen]] on the topic "How do you reach the parties (including opponents) and bring them together for a constructive conversation?" The following are quotes and brief explanations of the relevant parts of the topic.

>  (Questioner)
>  "It's important to invite both sides (pro and con) to have these constructive conversations. But how do you actually reach (call for) this?"
>  (Audrey Tang)
>  "But they've already signed the petition, right? If you get 16,000 signatures online or something, you can send an e-mail to them and they will say, 'I can join.
>  If we did it online, even more people might say, 'I want to participate.
>  And we don't have age restrictions on our platform (all you need is an SMS number to sign the petition). So, for example, a 16 year old can petition for "no plastic straws for tapioca take-out" and get a decent number of signatures.
>  In other words, 'send out an email to those who have signed up, inviting those who are willing to come to an online meeting or in-person.'

>  (Audrey Tang)
>  "In addition, [[the petition platform]] [[join.gov.tw]] allows people of any age to sign the petition, so even young people can sign if they think 'I want to change society this way,' and if we get more than 5,000 people, a place for discussion will be officially prepared. The government will then invite relevant people and experts to discuss the issue in person and online.
>  "If there is a 'for/against' vote, both camps can display their arguments and rationales side by side on the site so that the opinions that garner the most support can be seen by the government and society as a whole."


Explanation (main points)
- Signature" itself is a gateway to reach
    - On the Taiwanese petition site, once online supporters (5,000 or more) have been gathered, a formal proposal to the minister (government official) is created, with a set of discussions between the parties.
    - In other words, it is easy to gather the parties involved naturally because the call (e.g., by e-mail) is sent based on the aggregate data of "signatories.
- Online + Face-to-Face
    - Send an email to those who have signed the petition, asking if they would like to participate in a discussion forum on this date, and invite those who can participate online or come to the face-to-face meeting.
    - Flexible participation options are available, such as "I can participate online" even if I cannot be there in person.
- Various contact points including no age limit and telephone support
    - For those who have difficulty writing or moving, such as young people and the elderly, a combination of telephone and face-to-face support is used to collect opinions.
    - With the idea that "[[Broadband is a human right]]" and "a UX that makes it easy for everyone to sign up and participate," a multi-layered reach path is in place.

This mechanism allows those who have already signed the online petition to send a "discussion meeting notice" to those who have signed it, whether they are in favor or opposed, and naturally creates a place where "both parties" can come together.

relevance
- [[Tapioca straw petition]].
