> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1934182071922212916) Since the word "hacker" was mentioned, I have been reading "[[Hackers and painters]]" again. I've grown up more than when I read it in the past, so it's more interesting to read.

In response to Mr. Yasuno's introduction of Audrey as a "hacker" in the video, a suggestion was made that a supplementary explanation was necessary because some people might see "hacker = evil," and the suggestion was to replace "hacker" with "engineer," which led to a lively discussion.

> What hackers do is sometimes called "[[computer engineering]]," but this term too only encourages misunderstanding. A good [[software designer]] is not an [[engineer]] any more than an [[architect]] is not an engineer. Of course, the boundary between architecture and engineering is not clearly defined, but it certainly exists. It is between the "what" and the "how. The architect decides what to do, and the engineer figures out how to do it.
