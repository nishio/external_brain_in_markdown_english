> [martytaka777](https://x.com/martytaka777/status/1813005802606878816) Trump has nominated J.D. Vance as his vice presidential candidate. He is a senator from Ohio. He is best known for his autobiography, Hillbilly Elegy. In this book he portrays the white working class in its downfall.
>  His main argument is.
>  ・ U.S. does not have the industrial strength to support war in Ukraine, Israel, and a potential conflict with China over Taiwan.
>  ・If China invades and controls Taiwan, it will cause a "Great Depression" in the U.S. due to a shortage of semiconductors.
>  ・ Need to strengthen domestic manufacturing of military equipment and become "self-sufficient".
>  ・ U.S. should focus on containing China rather than overburdening itself in Europe
>  ・ European countries should take more responsibility for their own defense against Russia so that the U.S. can focus on the China threat.
>  Ukraine should allow Russia to cede territory and end the war.

> [YukariWatanabe](https://x.com/YukariWatanabe/status/1812988986605912227) Trump's nominee for Vice President, J.D. Vance, is the author of "Hillbilly Elegy"
>  As someone who introduced this book to Japan in its early stages and wrote the commentary for the Japanese translation, I was quite disappointed in Vance's subsequent transformation. I am not surprised that he was nominated for VP this time, but my disappointment has turned to despair.
