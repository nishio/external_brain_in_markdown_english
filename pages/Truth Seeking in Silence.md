Easy to see movement inside when the water is still.
The oracle of sleep is meant to be awake and not inputting information for a long period of time.
The Zazen of Sleep
If you see a fish, scoop it.
in a web of metaphors
If we let go of public language and make it a personal metaphor.
Bring us closer.
The preoccupation with words that must be communicated
Let go of attachment once and for all.
Because you either get the message or you don't.
Thinking before writing is deskilling and
Just write it down and then give it to the LLM to observe.
Hypothesis testing process
Premature and worrisome groundless fears
