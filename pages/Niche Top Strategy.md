title: "Niche Top Strategy"
---

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Niche Top Strategy is a business strategy that aims to be the best in a particular [[niche]] (narrow market or field). Instead of targeting a broad market, this strategy [[specializes]] in a specific customer segment or narrow product range, with the goal of becoming a leader in that area. The idea behind niche-top strategies is to make the most effective use of limited resources and establish a [[competitive edge]] with a unique value proposition.
