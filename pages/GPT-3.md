    - I said, "Suggest a name for the chatbot that asks questions and prompts thought," and it chose a name that sounded like Socrates (Socrates).

    - Let's hear it in Japanese.
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/97e9d512df9f5a0ec258e4a1ab7e0598/thumb/1000)
    - Ah, I see, you're not answering the question, you're generating the sentences that follow.
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/1e6c117a7080dc0c979bd3a785b04d8a/thumb/1000)
    - I like Curious Cat.
    - Can you name one for Japanese speakers?
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/86def19fb9b4741c4b7753460d2edddd/thumb/1000)
    - Not a great candidate, but you've properly understood the instruction "for Japanese speakers".
    - The name now is Keichobot, which comes from the word "listening."
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/4b9ce54d3010ffe72d17b8ffea0a7222/thumb/1000)
    - You say, "Let's see..."
    - But it properly reads, "I guess it's better to use the trait of listening," which is really great.
    - Randomness increases as temperature is raised, good when you want to choose from a lot of candidates.

        - I like the "find it" bot.
            - I pronounce the current "leaning-botto" like "keichobotto" myself, and maybe I subconsciously preferred being a 3-mora.
        - The name "~Lab" is not exactly what I had in mind this time, but it would be an interesting name for another version of the system that accumulates information and links it to past conversations.
            - Or "Kizuki Labs."
- Oh, hey, we're talking about writing code without explaining the other modes.
    - What about the type of task that has instruction and input?
    - I wonder if they are simply bonding.
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/6a3b8ebd081ea624c8050d8c4ea6b621/thumb/1000)
    - That's what it looks like.
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/c84e778d970de5f4b8ff7b6fa0aa8b23/thumb/1000)
    - Choose an appropriate key phrase and ask questions that dig into it.
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/336666b3aef107350c54ce28e04ad67a/thumb/1000)
    - The question is correctly made!
        - You don't have to create a solution...
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/29a55ee2170c85b9c0db012e69d774ca/thumb/1000)
        - hmm

    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/0377b17e5bae715d0f1e411ed4592b7b/thumb/1000)
    - Hmmm, I was asking well earlier... maybe it's just a coincidence...
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/5c608677bfa32b88e9d63d2e60edbb7d/thumb/1000)

    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/174b5d3e5addc9de13bdd90072e9db6f/thumb/1000)
    - Hmmm. I can't get them to understand the instruction to make a question text in Japanese. If I translate the questions separately, I end up with something like, "It's good to have a clear head," or "What do you mean by 'clear head'?" I can't achieve the purpose of picking up key phrases from the other person's statement and asking in-depth questions...
