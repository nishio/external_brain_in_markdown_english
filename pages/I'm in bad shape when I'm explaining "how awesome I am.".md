>  >sapporo_posse: I guess the game of "how many people can you convince that you won" is getting more and more popular these days.

> [shige_jage](https://x.com/shige_jage/status/1855897751047049508) These are words from Matayoshi's YouTube channel's famous "100 no.3" series of projects. There are many other words that I like, so please try to find your favorite words as well.

- I'm not going to explain myself at all, but you have to understand." is another extreme pathological condition.

Maybe they're unaware because they're already on the gaining side.
- Luckily, "I got it without explanation," so "I don't need an explanation."
