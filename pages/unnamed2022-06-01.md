        - It was pointed out to me that there is a difference between focusing on the differences and focusing on the same, but I thought as I was writing this article that sometimes we are focusing on the same.
                - [[Seeing only the ends is the same as seeing only the thick of it.]]
        - It was pointed out to me that there is a difference between focusing on the differences and focusing on the same, but I thought as I was writing this article that sometimes we are focusing on the same.
            - [[Seeing only the ends is the same as seeing only the thick of it.]]
        - I'm starting to get the feeling that this is not a symmetrical relationship.
            - Mr. Masui's "X and Y are the same" is an "invention of a new point of view" that "from this point of view, they appear to overlap.
                - Figure: [[The two images appear to overlap depending on the viewing direction]].
            - When I say "different" I don't think it's "X and Y don't overlap when you change your point of view".
                - The X is vague and spread out (= low resolution), should be observed more clearly (= increase resolution).
                - Are you changing the camera lens rather than changing the point of view? Are you adjusting the focus?

I thought about it for a while and came up with the expression[[Mr. Masui leaving and Mr. Nishio approaching]] <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/sta/sta/icon' alt='/sta/sta.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Mr. Masui is looking for a bird's eye view, or rather, a point of view, from a distance.
- Mr. Nishio moves closer to increase resolution.
