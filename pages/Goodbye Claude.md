I've decided to cancel since it ends on 1/8.

Personally, I used to use [[Claude]] for a long time for summarizing long texts such as papers, but after [[o1 Pro]] came along, I started to let [[Claude]] do the reading for me.


There are some interesting things like [[Computer Use API]], but for the time being [[Devin.ai]] can take care of that too.
