- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Tentatively drawn diagram that is consistent as a diagram but may not match the description in the text.

- (a) By the feature "myriad," many experiences are "in" one experience.
- (b) "Experience has diverse interactional relationships."

        - The answer is that the "creation of aspects" is taking place between
        - I was more aware that COMPREHENSION was a combination of "creation of aspects" and EXPLICATION.
            - Maybe that's right, just a low-resolution view.
