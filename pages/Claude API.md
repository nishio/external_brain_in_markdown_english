The following is a summary of the "Ways to Explore" chapter.
1. the first step in exploration begins with a clear awareness of the problem. This is called the "problem posing round" and is done in groups using the KJ method.
The five principles of exploration are: 1.
- From 360-degree perspectives on the theme
- along stepping stones
- Never miss a happening
- I've been thinking about something that's been bothering me.
- Take a qualitative view.
3. there are two types of exploration: internal exploration and external exploration. Internal exploration explores the knowledge in your own and your peers' minds.
4. brainstorming (BS) is an effective method of internal exploration; the four principles of BS are: no criticism, quantity seeking, free-spiritedness, and combination and development.
5. in a BS, a sense of urgency and relaxed atmosphere focused on the topic is important. The moderator should set the flow of the discussion and the recorder should take notes on the main points of what is said.
There is also a method called "Diagrammatic BS," in which BS is conducted using the KJ method diagram as a springboard.
7. the five principles of exploration and the four principles of BS have much in common; BS is a method of internal exploration included in the five principles of exploration.

Put about 30 pages in the paperback, 20,000 words, 18,000 tokens, $0.3, $45, and so on.

Simple math says it's $3 to summarize a 300-page book, and after a week, let's spend 14 summaries to become Tier 3.
