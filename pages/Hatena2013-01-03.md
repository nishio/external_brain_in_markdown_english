*1357204553*A Story of Writing with Sphinx and BitBucket #2
In my recent <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20121231/1356945165'>story about creating a book manuscript with Sphinx and BitBucket</a>, I wrote that BitBucket renders a table of contents for each page. I've prepared a demo of BitBucket's page-by-page table of contents rendering.

https://bitbucket.org/nishio/agile_author/src/master/source/1.rst

If you look at it in raw, you can see that the table of contents section is automatically generated:
