[[Conceptual map of the Plurality book]]

2025-09-22
- Permanent links to concepts and relationships
- Solves the problem of jumping between chapters sometimes not working

- Thinking about what to do with i18n
    - The problem is that the source indication is a Japanese sentence.
        - Simply translating the text won't work because it won't be the text that appears in the English version.
        - It would be better to re-extract the data using the English version of the data rather than translating it.
            - It's likely that each language version will have a different graph.
                - Is that okay with you?
                - It's becoming an idea that it's okay.
                - A graph is, after all, an interpretation, not the existence of a true graph.
                - It is important that each graph is [[connected to the evidence]], not the graph itself
        - I would like to include English articles (e.g. Vitalik's [[Plurality philosophy in an incredibly oversized nutshell]]) in the Japanese version of the network.
        - So, do you want to include the Japanese version of the article in the English version of the network?
    - Maybe as we add more content we'll want to improve the UI.
