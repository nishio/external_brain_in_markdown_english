title: "Examples of bad auto-generated pages"
---

This project used to have a page called "Tweet long order"
The hypothesis was that the longer tweets are better quality than the shorter ones because they are more polished to fit within the word limit.
Tweets between 130 and 155 characters were listed (140 characters should be the upper limit, but there are some shaky handling issues such as whether to include mentions).
One page alone had 220,000 words, heavy.
Made 3 years ago and not updated for 3 years.
The context is disconnected and not good.
I think it would have been better to group them by date.
Hashtags and
Square brackets in the source code are converted to links.
The entity reference was not restored.

If you looks something interesting but the auto-translated English is not good enough to understand it, feel free to let me know at [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en). I'm very happy to spread my thought to non-Japanese readers.
