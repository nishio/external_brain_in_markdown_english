Let us restore your radiance.

This is the prerogative of the Hoonics. Competence ages, and so does fame. The obsolescence of habit weakens admiration, and the new mediocrity often surpasses the old excellence of the best. Therefore, strive to be reborn in everything: in valor, in talent, in fortune. Show your astonishing newness, and be renewed like the sun every day. Change the scene in which you shine. Then the old scene of your triumphs may feel your loss, and the new scene may applaud the novelty of your power.
