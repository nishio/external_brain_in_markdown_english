title: "Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-learning"
---

Hado van Hasselt, Arthur Guez, David Silver
- General [[Q learning]] overestimates action value in certain situations
- How often do these things happen, do they negatively affect performance, and can they be prevented?
- [[DQN]] is strongly influenced by the overvaluation of some Atari 2600 games.
- Double Q-Learning
- Curb overvaluation and perform better.
