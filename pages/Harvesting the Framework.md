title: "Harvesting the Framework"

Japanese translation
- > To create a usable framework, do not start by building the framework, but by building the application.
- [https://bliki-ja.github.io/HarvestedFramework/](https://bliki-ja.github.io/HarvestedFramework/)

Contrast with the framework [FoundationFramework](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FoundationFramework.html), which is built as a foundation in advance.

Although it seems natural to build the framework first and then the application (since it is common practice to build the foundation first in house construction), it often does not work in practice.
First, one app is created, then another app is created based on the same code base, and after repeating this several times, the framework becomes stable and the code base can be separated.
- The framework is [[harvested]] in [[posterior]].

Translation [HarvestedFramework](http://bliki-ja.github.io/HarvestedFramework/)

I heard it described as "[[Harvesting Architecture]]."
