title: "positive free speech"

- [[Plurality Books]] p.95
> Almost all democracies emphasize, and expect others to emphasize, the protection of a fairly overlapping set of rights - the rights of speech and association - as a basic prerequisite for democracy to function. For example, Scandinavian countries have emphasized the importance of so-called "positive [[free speech]]," i.e., having a practical way for all citizens to express their views regardless of means, while others, such as the United States, have emphasized "negative free speech," i.e., government intervention to emphasizes that the expression of opinions cannot be interfered with by government intervention.
