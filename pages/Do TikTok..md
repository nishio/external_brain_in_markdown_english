I want to cut video based on transcription data, and I want to know how to know the exact timing of speech in order to cut with a high degree of accuracy.

The following is a summary of the shortest route to create a 15-second TikTok vertical video with no shooting and complete PC integration. The four steps are (1) script → (2) automatic generation of audio and video material by AI → (3) assembly by CapCut or other tools → (4) 1080 x 1920 export with automatic subtitles.

- SRT Read

Using YouTube transcriptions tends to cut off the end
- The reason for the cutoff at the end is probably because the YouTube Transctipt is attached for the purpose of seeking, so it's taking down the instructor a little earlier than it actually starts in the first place.
- It would be nice if the back took a few seconds longer by default.
- I used →whisper and it was more accurate.

Create the content you want to create
- If you don't get outside the filter bubble, it doesn't matter.
    - [[Reaching Outside the Filter Bubble]]
    - We need to look outside the filter bubble to begin with.
        - I don't know how to reach outside the filter bubble if I stay cooped up in the frame ([[downloading]]).

- [[Homogeneity]]
    - To what extent do you feel the same quality?
            - Scope of [social identity
    - What kind of homogeneity do you feel comfortable with?

I made an account and posted a video about voting for young Team Mirai in the Upper House for now, and the next time I opened the app, the video I was shown
![image](https://gyazo.com/33f099a078e991120009a091ab66d8ce/thumb/1000)
- Horizontal video is inserted vertically and the surrounding area remains black.
- I'm guessing the message is superimposed on top, subtitles at the bottom, and the message in yellow text in the thumbnail.
    - Only 22 submitted videos were found.
- Examples of how to use hook messages
    - It looks like there are two types of messages: "a hook message that looks good to put in the thumbnail" and "a message that keeps playing while the video is playing."
    - To be frank, neither of these need to be in the video.
    - There is no such concept as a thumbnail, but you put about 0.1 second in the opening frame!
