This is an important property in [[technium (Tc)]] and is related to [[Evolution of Technology]].

- [[Biological evolution]] versus technological evolution.
    - In biological evolution, [[adaptability]], "[[blind natural selection]]" works.
    - But in technology, or [[technological evolution]], human will and choice are the primary factors.
    - It consists of billions of [[decision-making]], including [[policy decisions]] and individual users' choices to use or not use certain technologies.

- This has allowed technology to evolve into something of value to individual users.
    - [[Increasing interconnectivity increases the number of adoptable options]].
        - It is important to increase [[openness]] and [[interoperability]] in order for technology to facilitate further evolution and innovation.
        - This is because it increases the options for individual users, allowing each to use the technology in the way that best suits their own needs.

The Threefold Structure of Technological Evolution
- > In technium, vectors indicating function are replaced by "intent".
- The third force at work in the evolution of organisms is adaptability.
    - This is [[blind natural selection]].
- In technium, it is different.
    - > Open to human free will and choice. This intentional realm consists of billions of decisions of political expression over inevitable inventions and how individuals use or do not use certain inventions).
- > This conscious and open design is what makes Technium the most powerful thing in the world.

- Increasing [[interoperability]] increases the number of adoptable [options
    - [[folk]]
- > Billions of decisions about how individuals use or don't use a given invention.
        - [[subjectivism]]

[[Intentional openness]].
