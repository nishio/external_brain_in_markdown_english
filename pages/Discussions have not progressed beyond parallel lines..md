- 1: There is a conflict between A and B
- 2: A different cut C is made.
        - [[dialectic development]]
- 3:
    - At this time, the "A and B [[confrontation]]" in the original cut does not disappear.
        - So, if you focus on that, it looks like "[[discussion]] is not progressing as [[parallel line]]".
        - [[Different directions.]] We're moving on.
        - We can tell if "[[We're making progress.]]" by whether [[New Ideas]] are being created that did not exist before the conflict.

- [[A series of pictures of two people saying different things]]
