Mechanisms to end the game efficiently
- [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/バックギャモン](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/バックギャモン)

In a game in which winning earns the underdog 1 point, no matter how small his probability of winning p is, the underdog does not resign because the expected value of winning points by continuing the game p exceeds the expected value of winning points when resigning 0.
Allow players to "propose doubling their winnings" here.
This proposal.
- When you get it...
    - Expected score obtained by the opponent $2(1-p)$.
    - Expected value of the score you get $2p$.
- I have to take it.
    - It's treated as a resignation.
        - Expected number of points gained by the opponent1
        - Expected score you get 0
- Since $2p - 2(1-p) = 2(2p-1) > -1 = 0 - 1$ becomes true when [$ p < 1/4
