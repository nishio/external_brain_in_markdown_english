> [chokudai](https://x.com/chokudai/status/1945093947086528737) It's not good if people keep talking about how the IT industry doesn't support Team Mirai, so I'll just state that I do (this doesn't mean I disapprove of any other political party). (This does not mean that I disapprove of other political parties.)
>  Mr. Yasuno, I think you are in the 0.1% of IT engineers with aptitude for politics, and I think you have a super high degree of perfection compared to Mr. Ieiri's [[Internet Party]], even though it is a different era.
> [chokudai](https://x.com/chokudai/status/1945095002545328598) This is not a disparagement of Mr. Iiri, but rather I think he is doing what he couldn't do back then, using new technology to improve the quality of his output. I don't think there are many engineers who can do that, so I think he's a great guy and deserves to lead the way.
>  (Though a single thrust is not enough because of the narrow scope of the minority party)

> [team_mirai_jp](https://x.com/team_mirai_jp/status/1945150485025186187) [#TeamMirai Manifesto Thematic Explanatory Edition, Welfare Edition with Ruby!

> [nanatakamatsu](https://x.com/nanatakamatsu/status/1944959659137531972) In the last Upper House election, 47.95% of the votes were uncontested, about 50%. This is like a class with 6 out of 12 students absent, where the class structure is determined by the other 6 students. While they are absent, the rules may be set to their disadvantage. Now, is this the time for you to be absent?

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1944965449487409444) Well, I was wondering if the supporter who sees a bug displaying fewer values will be disappointed. ......

> [stltcrsp](https://x.com/stltcrsp/status/1944975833854341136) The word "Russian bots" has been popping up since this morning.
>  In this regard, Takahiro Yasuno, the Komeito subchannel mentioned this two months ago.
→ [[Anti-government propaganda by Russian bots]]


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1945038214479171939) I learned that the Ruby Foundation offers a system like this, and this is one of the best examples of using the power of AI to "reduce the number of people left behind"!

> [minami_gyn](https://x.com/minami_gyn/status/1944965434869960888) In a video interview between Kamiya-san and Team Mirai Yasuno-san, Kamiya-san said, "Actually, I've always wanted to work with Yasuno-san," and when I looked at the comments section, I found that many supporters of the Councillor Party also supported Mirai-san. I found in the comments section that many supporters of the Sangen-tei also supported Mirai, and I realized that this is the kind of thing that will get non-partisan support.
>  >nishio: Originally, Team Mirai had a problem with low recognition, and once it gained recognition, it was easy to increase its favorability. Since we are not a political party yet, we were lumped together with various factions in the press coverage and surveys in the early stages, so our recognition did not grow. Now that they have the potential to win seats, they will get a lot of press exposure, so they should see further growth from here on out.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1944796159920513464) I think we need to learn from the Restoration videos, so we need to get Mr. Anno to do some acting work in the next election.
> [kuzirazio](https://x.com/kuzirazio/status/1944800425825460541) The stage experience from his student days comes in handy!
After this, the Restoration was on fire with another video. You don't need to learn from that one. w

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1944793283982700641) I created this visualization
>  >[kazuneiwasa](https://x.com/kazuneiwasa/status/1944793283982700641) Team Mirai has a "Supporter Slack" where various activities are in progress, including action board development and poster hanging.
>
>  The content of Slack is private (you can enter by registering as a supporter), but you can see the graph of the amount of comments from the public dashboard.

>  This is the secret of Team Mirai's speed..!

> [kazuneiwasa](https://x.com/kazuneiwasa/status/1944796737513931126) It's a dashboard that shows the producer's face...(wrong)
> [tanzanite_888](https://x.com/tanzanite_888/status/1944918952712528165) Maybe I'm the one increasing the chatter... lol
> [ume_keizai](https://x.com/ume_keizai/status/1944930756285141366) I have a desire to put up that image from Summer Wars..!
