title: "Shortest Hamilton Road Problem"
---

The problem of finding the shortest path through all vertices once.
It's a "path," so it doesn't go back to the starting point.

The case of returning to the starting point is called the [[Shortest Hamiltonian closed circuit problem]].
- [[TSP]] also known as.
It seems that even if they don't return to the starting point, they're perceived as if they're salesmen who never return.
