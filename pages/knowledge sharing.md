title: "knowledge sharing"
---

With [[Knowledge Sharing]], all members have the same knowledge.
If indexical knowledge is shared, "Mr. A is knowledgeable about this matter," there is no need to share the substance of the knowledge in advance, because it can be inquired when it becomes necessary.

Especially as the [[expertise]] of members becomes higher, it becomes impractical to share [[expertise]], and a knowledge-sharing organizational structure becomes necessary.
