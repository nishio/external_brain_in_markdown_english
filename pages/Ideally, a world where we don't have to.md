title: "Ideally, a world where we don't have to"

- The question of whether or not to do a certain action X is often combined with the ideal of a world in which we don't have to do X, but I'm beginning to think that it's not so much a question of whether or not to do X.
    - Lots of complications, let's break it down a bit for now.
    - It is not "I must do act X" if I can choose to do or not do a certain act X.
        - So, it's already "a world where you don't have to do act X", argument.
    - I'd change it to "Ideally, a world where doing act X doesn't give you an advantage."
        - In this case, there is a benefit to doing act X
        - "Don't take advantage of doing act X." becomes "Take something from someone who is doing act X and give it to someone who isn't doing act X."
            - This is going to depend on the type of "profit"<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/blu3mo/icon' alt='/villagepump/blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - If the benefit is relative, the above argument stands.
                    - Example: Amount of money
                - If profit is an absolute thing, the above argument does not hold.
                    - Example: Happiness
            - Sure, you implicitly assumed goods like goods and money.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - So if the goods increase without taking from the people, there is no problem?
    - The claim that "some world Y is the ideal" justifies "acting to bring about world Y" and is not directly related to whether or not one does act X.
        - Unless "not doing act X brings about world Y" is justified, "not doing act X" is not justified.
        - In general, "inactivity" doesn't really make a "world of difference".

Indeed, there is often no direct relationship between "the ideal world where we don't have to do act X" and "the choice to do or not to do act X". Let's break it down a bit.
- [[Optionality]]:
    - If you can choose to do act X, you might say that it is already a world in which you do not have to do act X. But that does not mean that the ideal world has been realized, merely that the choice exists.
- Redefining the [[ideal world]]:
    - If "the ideal is a world in which doing act X is not advantageous," then the focus is on whether or not act X is beneficial. In this case, the form of the ideal depends on the type of benefit.
- Profit Type:
    - In the case of relative gains (e.g., amount of money), it may become necessary to take something from others.
    - In the case of absolute benefits (e.g., happiness), problems are less likely to arise because they can be increased without taking them from others.
- Justification of the ideal world:
    - The claim that "some world Y is the ideal" justifies "acting to bring about world Y."
    - Not doing act X is justified only if world Y is realized by not doing act X.
- Relationship between behavior and change:
    - In general, inactivity rarely leads to change in the world. Since action often drives change, action is often necessary to achieve the ideal world.
In this light, it is clear that not doing act X is not directly tied to the realization of the ideal world.
