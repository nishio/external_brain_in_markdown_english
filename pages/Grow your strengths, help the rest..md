from [[The Art of Worldly Wisdom]]
Grow your strengths, help the rest.
xxxiv
Knowing your strengths - your outstanding talents - and nurturing them will help the rest. Everyone would excel at something if they knew their strengths. Notice in what qualities you excel and manage them. Some excel in judgment, others in valor. Many people try to gain superiority in everything, ignoring their natural aptitudes. After a time, they are too late disillusioned by what first delighted their passions.
