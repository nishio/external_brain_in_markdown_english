> [nanatakamatsu](https://x.com/nanatakamatsu/status/1944593783968104658) The largest percentage in the last Upper House election was 50.36 million who did not vote. These votes could have possibly changed the outcome. Your vote has the power to change society!

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1944609914925830221) The Japan Innovation Party (Ishin) launched “open questions” across several channels, e.g. using `FutureOfInsurancePremiums` like hashtag, gathering about 300K public submissions and analyzing them with AI.
>
>  In the first phase, the dominant topic was “self‑protection (I want to manage my own assets).” Within one month, public opinion shifted to a concrete reform demand: “lower social‑insurance premiums.”
>
>  “Ishin will keep using broad listening and AI to hear many voices and feed them into policy.” (Party leader)

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1944598572105974116) "Would you prefer that your tax money, which is granted to political parties, be used for campaigning to maintain them, or for public digital investments?" So I think it's common that some people think "it's weird to use it differently than before". Because change, for better or worse, involves the unprecedented.
>  >kazuho: If you want to develop software for IT in legislative administration, you should create an NPO for that purpose or use code for japan, and I honestly don't feel comfortable getting a political party grant and putting that money into it... I'm not going to vote for Mirai this time, but I'll donate to them if they develop software related to civic tech.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1944599571113369804) Of course donations to Code for Japan are welcome! (Not that I'm the one doing the welcoming...)
>  Donations for the Digital Democracy 2030 project are also welcome! (although the window may not be ready yet)
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1944600739558347107) On the other hand, that also means that only those who have money can support digital public goods investments. Since the beneficiaries of digital public goods include those who cannot afford it, wouldn't it be more correct to state that those people also have the opportunity to support them?

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1944612976587391364) "trying to make digitalization partisan" is an unfounded assumption, but that's where Team Mirai is not communicating the concept of a "utility party" very well. I guess that's where Team Mirai has not been able to communicate the concept of a "utility party" well. Well, I have a feeling that they won't understand until we actually try.
>  >kazuho: I don't mind how the grant money is used, since it is up to the political parties, but the promotion of digitization is not partisan, and I don't understand why the small parties are trying to do it as their own activities (or rather, don't put partisan colors on digitization). I don't understand why they are trying to do it as a unique activity of a small party (or don't put a partisan color on the digitization).
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1944613541983756703) The engineer I talked to yesterday just finished a broadlisting system for another large party that is not Team Mirai, and I just wrote an article about the Restoration case study. There are people within a 5m radius who are directly promoting "digitization is something that should be done regardless of party affiliation".

[[The only thing that matters is action.]]

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1944678753080377757) I've heard it pointed out that throwing masakari at the general public would surprise them, and I thought that was true, so I've refrained from doing so recently. I have been refraining from throwing masakari to the general public because I think it's true.

> [chikomirai](https://x.com/chikomirai/status/1944753568344666316) "When Team Mirai becomes a national political party, they say they will create an engineering team, but why not a digital agency? (translation of original Japanese)", Ms. Aoi Furukawa, a former bureaucrat at the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare
>  @AoiFurukawa
>  explains it all!

> [ShokuTabiTakara](https://x.com/ShokuTabiTakara/status/1944902225899536416) A tremendous shift in thinking
>  Also, it is great to have a former government official speaking out, as it gives a sense of effectiveness.
> [yuruyuru1641](https://x.com/yuruyuru1641/status/1945086110629065205) Furukawa, you talk too much.
> [purin_poyopuri](https://x.com/purin_poyopuri/status/1945298862307963051) I think you really understand the reality of government contracts, and I like that you are respectful of the ordering officials and contractors who are trying to work within the constraints of these contracts. I like the fact that you are proposing a new approach.
> [moonbear12345](https://x.com/moonbear12345/status/1945300867252392253) Easy to understand!
>  And, the Digital Agency is only an organization that has to follow the ruling party's instructions and orders, so it can't create a system like transparency of political funds, which is inconvenient for the ruling party.
>  It is important to be able to do things that the ruling party does not want to do because we are members of the same legislature.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1944757270786474296) Jobs not yet lost to AI: Running for office, making speeches and putting up posters
>  >uudaiy: I think this is the real DX party, Team Mirai, where the AI generates what can be entrusted to it, and the engineers do the jobs that only humans can do, such as running for office, making speeches, and putting up posters.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1944721436897370363) "To revitalize democracy in the age of AI, we need to shift from one-way broadcasting to dynamic broad listening. Innovators in Taiwan and Japan are leading the way."

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1944540401232420961) > JNN conducted internet surveys the day before yesterday and yesterday (12-13) and analyzed the situation in the middle of the day, taking into account our interviews.
>  >"Team Mirai" may win seats in Congress.
> About 40% of respondents said they have not yet decided where to vote, and the situation could change dramatically in the future.
> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1944574746471096498) I've seen firsthand the momentum of the team as I've traveled around the country, but now the polls are finally showing that "Team Mirai" has a chance of winning seats in the House of Representatives! I am very happy to hear that!
>  We would very much appreciate your support!
> [TonightRave](https://x.com/TonightRave/status/1944602064501293202) Really? That's awesome.
>  I think it would be better to give the last seat to Team Mirai than to give it to someone whose name I don't know.

> [miyasaka](https://x.com/miyasaka/status/1944436317741584871) It has been a full six years since I came to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. I also served as president of the private sector for about 6 years, which means the same length of time has passed.
>  It was a very big six years, both in terms of what we lost and what we gained.
>  In both cases, I have been blessed with friends, although I have struggled through the six years, keenly aware of the expectations and my own lack of ability.
>  As long as it is a job, hard work is not the subject of evaluation, but whether the work is meaningful to the people of Tokyo, the employees of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, and the employees of the wards and municipalities.
>  Are we doing a job that will be appreciated not only by current users, but also by people 10 to 20 years into the future? I would like to accumulate them without hesitation.
>  We want to prove that it is possible to overcome differences in origins and achieve results even when coming from the private sector to the government, and we want to create a path that makes it as easy as possible for the next person to join us.
