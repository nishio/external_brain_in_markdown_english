- Spam filtering implementation
- Addition of a favorites function
- Implementation of smartphone support

Main Results
- Utilize both terrestrial and digital distribution
- Six digital programs, six hours of live broadcast on election day
- Real-time public opinion analysis and visualization

Challenges and Learning
- Ensuring Accuracy (Importance of Fact Checking)
- Support for large-scale data processing
- Cooperation with broadcasters

Future Outlook
- Improved clustering methods
- Fact-checking automation study
- Possibility of utilizing a wider range of data sources

All participants appreciated that the project was an important step in the convergence of the broadcasting industry and technology.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>You are a professional writer. I am thinking of writing an article in English to share this Japanese case study with people around the world who are interested in digital democracy. Please draft the article in Japanese first.

Japan's terrestrial broadcasters have demonstrated a new challenge to the digitalization of democracy.
~A Breakthrough in Election Reporting x Collective Intelligence Analysis~.
Introduction.
NTV, a major commercial TV station, has implemented a groundbreaking initiative for Japan's 2024 House of Representatives election. The project combines conventional election reporting with the latest AI technology to visualize the voices of voters on social media in real time. This attempt offers new insights into the nature of democracy in the digital age.
Project Innovation
The project is notable for its attempt by traditional media to leverage the "collective intelligence" of the digital space. Specifically, election-related posts on social media X (formerly Twitter) were analyzed in real time using AI technology. The results were provided to viewers through both terrestrial broadcasting and digital distribution.
Technical Features
The core technology is a technique known as "broadcast listening. This is the opposite concept of "broadcast (one-to-many information dissemination)," in which the opinions of many people are aggregated and presented in an organized form. It is based on the open source software "talk to the city" and has been realized with unique improvements.

Implementation and Results
The project conducted the following four types of analysis

Public opinion on the election as a whole
Trends in Policy Discussion
Responses to each political party
Real-time reactions during the vote count

Particularly noteworthy was the effort on the day of the vote count. In just 25 minutes after the polls opened, 60,000 submissions were collected and analyzed, and the results of the analysis were successfully provided to viewers 85 minutes later. This demonstrated the potential for highly immediate election coverage in the digital age.
Challenges and Prospects
The project also identified several important issues:

Representativeness of opinions on digital platforms
Need for automated fact-checking
Data quality control and privacy protection

At the same time, however, these challenges are important considerations in the future development of digital democracy.
Conclusion.
This attempt deserves attention as an example of how the fusion of traditional media and digital technology opens up new possibilities for democracy. In particular, the effort to visualize voters' voices in real time will serve as a model case for future digitalization of election coverage and democracy.
