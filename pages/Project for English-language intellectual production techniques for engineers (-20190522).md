- Where the translated text is placed: [/intellitech-en](https://scrapbox.io/intellitech-en).
- Finished translating up to chapter 1.
    - 112 pages in terms of Scrapbox at this time.
        - In paper pages, 55 pages, so about twice as many.
        - The table of contents has 70 headings, so about 1.5 times

- [/intellitech-en-private](https://scrapbox.io/intellitech-en-private) with the Japanese manuscript.
- First, a rough Google translation
    - Outsourcing → Done
- Look at it and see if there are any strange translations.
    - In the meantime, I'll read it as I put it on Grammery.
        - You should delete the text on Grammery every time, sometimes suggestions you ignored are resurrected.
    - Option 1: Correct the original text
        - Write here: [Improvement for English version (~1 chapter)
            - Initially written neatly, but decided to write messily because cleanliness of this page is not an important goal of the project accomplishment
    - Option 2: Correct the English text
- Put it in [/intellitech-en](https://scrapbox.io/intellitech-en) with only English text
    - Image modification: easily done in Keynote.
        - Do not. Write a word-for-word translation. It is fine as is and can be outsourced.
    - Release them sequentially rather than after they are all done.
- Convert to e-book format with LeanPub by the end of March.
    - Even if the translation is not all done, release a machine-translated version at a low cost for now.
    - Upgrade later at no cost.
    - For those who can't wait, a machine-translated version will be released, and so on.
    - Write on the side of the book that it is a machine translation and that the real translation is being done on Scrapbox.
