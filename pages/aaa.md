1. the origins of psychological safety and Amy Edmondson's definition
    - Psychological safety" is a concept proposed by Harvard Business School Professor Amy C. Edmondson in the late 1990s.
    - Edmondson** defines psychological safety as "a work environment where people feel comfortable taking interpersonal risks by speaking up openly and voicing concerns, questions, and ideas."
    - In layman's terms, it refers to the state of being able to openly express one's thoughts and opinions to any member of the organization.
    - Edmondson's research objective was to explore the relationship between learning behaviors and performance improvement in teams. For example, in her study of medical teams, she found that the better teams made fewer mistakes, the more openly they discussed potential errors with each other and tried to find ways to improve**.
    - In other words, it was expected that a workplace with high psychological safety would foster a culture in which members learn from each other by pointing out mistakes and problems, resulting in improved performance and innovation.

2. general acceptance and changing definitions and misunderstandings in the U.S.
    - Edmondson's concept initially attracted attention in academic circles, but was catapulted into the limelight in the 2010s by Project Aristotle, an internal study conducted by the major IT company Google. Google analyzed more than 180 teams over several years and concluded that the most important factor in team effectiveness was psychological safety. When these results were reported around 2016, psychological safety became a buzzword in the U.S. business community, and many companies focused on it as the key to high-performing teams.
    - However, as its popularity grew, so did its interpretation and misuse, deviating from its original meaning. The following are examples of common misinterpretations of psychological safety that have become widespread in the United States:
        - A "get along, get along" kind of no-wind situation:
            - A case of mistaken belief that a team with high psychological safety = a "friendly team" or "lukewarm team" where members do not clash with each other and are friendly to each other.
            - In fact, it is different from a mere friendly mood or coziness. Edmondson himself states that psychological safety does **not mean** "irresponsible laissez-faire" or "just staying positive. Rather, it is important to be comfortable with [[conflicting (opposite, contrasting) opinions]] and even [[giving hard feedback]].
        - Lowering standards and being lenient with people:
            - There is also a misunderstanding of psychological safety as "relaxing standards so that failure is not punished" or "coddling people.
            - However, it has been pointed out that this is a fallacy and that psychological safety is in fact the only reason to challenge high codes of conduct and performance standards.
            - In a safe atmosphere, members can share their opinions and pursue high performance in pursuit of more audacious goals.
        - A state of "anything goes" where people are allowed to say whatever they want:
            - There are extreme cases where psychological safety is mistaken for "an absolute guarantee that individuals cannot be blamed for anything they say," and is taken as an exemption that even allows words and actions that hurt others.
            - For example, the assertion that "because of psychological safety, I should be free to express my discriminatory opinions" is a misuse of the concept.
            - Psychological safety is not a guarantee of "comfort" in the absence of any discomfort, but rather a sense of security in being able to frankly exchange opinions with each other while accepting each other's discomfort. It is not a guarantee of "comfort" that you will never be offended.

    - Thus, in the U.S., there has been a widespread misconception that psychological safety is a "comfortable workplace free of conflict and criticism. In reality, however, the more psychologically secure a workplace is, the more likely it is that there will be occasional harsh exchanges of opinions and constructive conflict. What is important is that even in these situations, members can have **confidence** that they will not be rejected or retaliated against for voicing their opinions.

3. importation into Japan and introduction into practice, and cultural misinterpretation
The term "psychological safety" has spread rapidly in Japan since the results of the Google survey. Edmondson's book, "Fearless Organization: Psychological Safety Leads to Learning, Innovation, and Growth," was translated and published in Japanese and featured in the Nikkei Shimbun and business magazines, and has become an established keyword in organizational development and human resource management. Leadership that enhances psychological safety" has been widely discussed in corporate training and lectures, and many related books have been published (e.g., Ryosuke Ishii's "How to Create Psychological Safety" and "The Best 100 Voice Calls by Leaders that Enhance Psychological Safety").
However, even in the process of spreading this concept in Japan, misinterpretations and distortions from the original meaning were observed. At first glance, the literal translation of the Japanese term "psychological safety" suggests a state of psychological security and comfort. Therefore, on the surface, it is often misunderstood to refer to a "lukewarm workplace where everyone is kind and no one is blamed for mistakes. For example, some people think that "a workplace where employees are not warned for making mistakes = high psychological safety," or shortsightedly judge that "employees having a hard time is evidence of low psychological safety. However, as mentioned earlier, this is not the essence of the concept. Psychological safety does not simply mean an optimistic or lenient work environment, but rather, it means an open atmosphere in which people feel comfortable saying things that are difficult to say. Behind the spread of this misconception in Japanese companies can be attributed to the atmosphere of respect for "wa" (harmony) and peer pressure that are unique to Japanese society. Japanese people have always been cautious about voicing their true feelings and objections, and there is a great psychological hurdle to speaking frankly in the workplace. For this reason, the concept of "psychological safety" is often taken shortsightedly as "creating a calm atmosphere where everyone can avoid getting hurt," and the original meaning of encouraging risky and frank dialogue may not be fully understood.
In addition, there is a clash with the organizational hierarchy and seniority-based culture in the Japanese workplace. While ostensibly saying, "You can say whatever you want," in reality there are many cases in which there is a deep-rooted sense of discovery and reserve toward superiors, and subordinates are reprimanded if they express their true feelings. Some managers with Showa-era values may profess that "pressure is the essence of management" and that "psychological safety that coddles subordinates is unnecessary. In such a culture, the introduction of "psychological safety" is a mere superficial pretext, and there is concern that nothing will actually change.

4. friction with the "sedentary" culture and the challenge of concept acceptance
Some pundits have also suggested that the concept of psychological safety may be incompatible with the so-called "formulaic" majority culture, and on X (formerly Twitter), kmizu said that the "original psychological safety" was never comfortable for the conventional average person, but rather could be a tough place to be uncomfortable. He said that the meaning may have been twisted in both the U.S. and Japan, because "original psychological safety" is never comfortable for the average conventional person, but can be a tough place to be with discomfort. In fact, psychological safety teams require mutual tolerance of value conflicts and even discomfort from pointing out mistakes, which can lead to more superficially stressful and "uncomfortable" situations. In traditional majority cultures, it is often considered good to avoid as much friction as possible in relationships and to maintain an unspoken harmony. As a result, the "healthy conflict" and "frank talk" required by the inherent psychological safety are seen as uncomfortable in a formulaic organizational culture. As a result, psychological safety may be **conveniently mistaken** for "comfort" in many organizations, and its essence may be distorted and accepted.
Overcoming this friction requires a proper understanding of the paradoxical property of psychological safety** "to feel safe to express one's insecurities "**. In other words, it is a cultural shift to "dare to take on the anxiety of conflicting opinions and negative feedback because it is safe. This is a courageous shift for the majority in Japan, Europe, and the U.S., who are still bound by conventional wisdom, but if this is avoided, the original benefits of psychological safety (promotion of creativity and learning) will not be achieved. Conversely, if psychological safety is viewed as part of building an organizational culture that embraces diversity, it will make it easier for minorities and people with developmental disabilities to demonstrate their abilities. In fact, experts say that psychological safety is also an essential foundation for promoting diversity and inclusion.

5. relevant academic studies, business books, and expert opinions
The research and literature on psychological safety has amassed abundantly over the past two decades. Edmondson's 1999 paper was a pioneer in this field, which has evolved into numerous empirical studies showing the relationship between team learning and performance. For example, the aforementioned Google internal study (2016) is one such example, with data showing the impact of psychological safety on team effectiveness. Edmondson himself continued his research and published his book** The Fearless Organization in 2018. In this book, he emphasizes through various company case studies that psychological safety is essential for innovation and growth, and offers concrete measures to foster it in organizations. A translated version of the book (commentary by Toshiro Murase and translation by Tomoko Notsu) was published in Japan and has been read by many executives and managers. In addition, a practical book unique to Japan has also appeared. For example, Ryosuke Ishii's "How to Create Psychological Safety" introduces methods to enhance psychological safety in the context of Japanese companies, and suggests steps to foster a culture of "ease of talking" and "mutual help" from a front-line perspective. In addition, in Research on the Development of a Japanese Version of the Psychological Safety Scale (2021)** by Yoichi Ochiai and Yuji Otsuka, the need for a scale that is adapted to Eastern culture is discussed, and a measurement method that takes into account factors that inhibit speech specific to Japanese people is proposed. This is an important academic contribution to cultural adaptation of psychological safety.
In the expert view, Edmondson and many other researchers and practitioners** emphasize that "psychological safety and high performance go hand in hand. On the other hand, some point out that "the higher the psychological safety, the better. If the tension is eliminated due to an extreme degree of familiarity, it may actually reduce productivity. What is important is to strike a balance between a sense of security and a healthy sense of tension, as Edmondson notes, "Psychological safety and accountability can go hand in hand. In other words, the ideal culture is not one that avoids high goals and tough feedback, but one that challenges them and respects each other.
Finally, it will take time and ingenuity for psychological safety to take root in Japanese society. **Some people are cautious, saying that the concept originated in Europe and the United States and that it is too early for Japan. However, in today's highly uncertain world, fostering psychological safety is inevitable if diverse human resources are to collaborate and innovate. Overcoming cultural gaps and misunderstandings and pursuing psychological safety that returns to its original meaning is a major challenge and opportunity for Japanese companies in the future.
