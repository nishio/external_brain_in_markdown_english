- [[Tanka Class for the mediocre by the geniuses]]
- Give me a service that allows me to post only 31 moras right now.

- > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1536265155679776771?s=20&t=oeipdj2buJW4rG3fw6tIUw): AirPods "Mercy is not for the good of others," the seat you gave up "is falling down."
    - > >[@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1535899909588930560): I made the mistake of dropping my AirPods case from my pocket when I got on the train for the first time in a while. I had just given up my seat to an old lady who told me I dropped it, so I was safe. I guess this is what they call "mercy is good for no one".
- > No, no, no, wait, is it bad sense to try to use "mercy is not for other people" (7,5) in its original form?
- >  "It's falling down" AirPods in the seat I gave up, I gained about 20,000 yen.

- > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1536280712382664704?s=20&t=oeipdj2buJW4rG3fw6tIUw): dumping in-game assets and deleting the innards, come to think of it, that was a prelude to "death".

    - [[DISing others who have different values is a characteristic of people who lack self-confidence.]]
- > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1536377002005254144?s=20&t=oeipdj2buJW4rG3fw6tIUw): showed a mouse cat made from cat hair "Do you prefer rounded hairballs?" https:// t.co/R21dNUxxgP
- > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1536378071703785472?s=20&t=oeipdj2buJW4rG3fw6tIUw): kitten who showed YouTube doesn't look at the front looking for rats on the back side https ://t.co/UuUX1n28pz

    - [[It's not hard to outrun those who avoid making the effort to outdo you.]]
- > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1536398640012742656?s=20&t=oeipdj2buJW4rG3fw6tIUw): which can you believe, the person who says "I can't use it" or the person who says it #tanka
        - [[X is not available.]]
- > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1536399263621861376?s=20&t=oeipdj2buJW4rG3fw6tIUw): that person who doesn't do what needs to be done is to blame for me not doing it #tanka
        - [[They didn't, so I won't.]]

- > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1536400412877926400?s=20&t=oeipdj2buJW4rG3fw6tIUw): nightfall and you haven't done what you want to do You don't do it, but you stay up even longer #tanka
- > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1536401249658368000?s=20&t=oeipdj2buJW4rG3fw6tIUw): 1.9 of Mykla is here but I haven't done the update yet! #tanka
- I don't want to get up early tomorrow morning for my first face-to-face meeting in years.
