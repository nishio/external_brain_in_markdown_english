title: "Pluralistic and complex individual absolutes"
---

> [@kasai_sinya](https://twitter.com/kasai_sinya/status/1373407109975478273): Diversity, when you get right down to it, is about respecting "pluralistic and complex individual absolutes" based on "universality as the same human being"! I think it's a good idea.
> It is not a matter of adding more categories to the "diversity list" and saying, "Well, you are free to enter any of the boxes. Please act like a member of that box.

> For example, one person can be male/homosexual/supporter of LDP/vegetarian/Buddhist/left-handed/Hanshin fan/take-no-kata group, and countless other elements ([[pluralism]]). Vegetarian/Buddhist/Left-handed/Hanshin fan/Takemono fan etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.
> Some priorities may change depending on the situation, but it is difficult for the person to arbitrarily remove or replace the element, nor is it something that others can force ([[absoluteness]]).
>  So, for example, it is wrong to take one element, homosexuality, and ignore the other elements and treat them as friends or enemies on their own.
>  Shouldn't all people be equally respected simply because they are "human" regardless of what elements they possess ([[universality]])?
