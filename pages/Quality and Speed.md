- It is a big misunderstanding that "[[(material) quality]] and [[speed]] have a [[trade-off]] relationship.
- It is the internal quality in particular [[maintainability]] ([[Ease of testing]], [[Ease of understanding]], [[Ease of Change]]) that is sacrificed in the name of "quality".
- In fact, increasing conservatism will increase speed and decreasing conservatism will decrease speed.
- Reducing speed will not improve maintainability, and longer lead times will not allow for the hypothesis testing process.
- The break-even point for investment in internal quality comes surprisingly quickly (within a month).
