> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1887736896551272804) Those who argue which is better, AI or human engineers, are not airheads. If you think about [[survival strategy]] in the future [[competitive environment]] from an actual engineer's point of view, you have to become an "engineer who can master AI", don't you?

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1887738045094633861) To use an analogy, a "machine arm" has been sold, and right now I am in the trial-and-error stage of figuring out what I can do with it and how I can do something useful with it. When I eventually learn to use it, I will be an engineer with six arms, which will triple the simple production speed and increase value production fivefold as a three-person team with zero communication costs, and so on.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1887738750618509514) at this time by 0.6x [[dumping]] selling 5x value production at a cost of 3 to increase competitiveness and [[select tasks that produce synergies]], further increase the speed of value production. At this time, the raw competition will suffer because a competitor will appear that offers 1 value for 0.6.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1887742426628170076) Oh, that's misleading, it's not only a cheap price collapse where 1 value is sold for 0.6, but also 1.6 value is offered for 1 value, In this case, the buyer will try to pay 1.5 or so for fear of losing the seller to the competition, so the surplus will be put into productivity improvement.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1887743099289604302) With the new [[reaction pathway that converts money into productivity]], I think the overhead will gradually get bigger and bigger, not linearly, and then it will come to a head, but one person's [virtual human I think the [[team size]] is going to grow to some extent.
