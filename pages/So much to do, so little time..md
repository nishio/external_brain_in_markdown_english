title: "So much to do, so little time."
---

- If there is a lot of [[what we want to do]] and [[not enough time]], we need to increase [[resolution (e.g., display, dpi)]] for "[[want to do]]".
- A: I want to go to the "[[new world]]" that comes by doing
    - In this case, if someone else will do it, so be it.
- B: I want the "things" I get from doing it.
    - In this case, if someone else will do it and sell me the "stuff", so be it!
        - The question is whether or not [[the price can be paid]] versus [[availability]] due to the limited number of items.
                - [[Limited resources]]
    - This is similar to the case where you want "[[knowledge]]" gained by doing something.
        - This is further divided into two parts when the resolution of "knowledge" is increased
            - [[knowledge that is easy to transfer]].
            - Knowledge you don't have unless you do it yourself.
                    - [[Can only be acquired through one's own ingenuity and ingenuity.]]
                    - [[experience]]
- C: I want the "[[track record]]" that comes from doing
    - This means that you want "[[Evaluation by others]]" who "are the ones who did it."
    - There is a lot of criticism about this desire.
            - [[People who want to do it but haven't.]]
    - However, [[living expenses]] to survive and [[spare funds]] to try new things often come from [[evaluation]] by others.
    - So even if his/her desire is low, he/she may have to do this out of necessity.

C, who goes on to win the reputation of "being the first to do it" on a subject that anyone could come up with, has a [[rat race]] feel to it.
    - [[red ocean]]
As for A, some may have the same [[ideal]] because the world is a [[common good]].
- On the other hand, some people do things that seem evil to them.
As for B, the possibility of joining is still important.
- Knowledge that can only be acquired through experience is highly important.
