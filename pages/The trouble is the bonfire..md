If you stay away from fire for fear of it, you may be [[temporarily safe]], but you will not receive the benefits that fire brings, such as warmth.
On the other hand, fire can be beneficial to you if you approach the campfire and learn to manage it well.
If a campfire is too strong and you feel you are in danger, it is important to keep your distance and remain calm.

- [[problem]] is [[open fire (e.g. in a kitchen)]].

relevance
- [[campfire (usually large, and for gathering and singing, etc.)]]
- [[Attacking the unfamiliar without looking at it properly.]]
