    - Before I started using Scrapbox, I sometimes read translations of books and wondered why the Japanese title was so strange when the original title was
    - There were multiple cases.
    - But that information was not recorded, it was gone.
    - When I started compiling information on books in Scrapbox, I found a book with the same "Japanese title is strange" feeling, and I remembered that I had felt this way before, so I started adding the "Japanese title is strange" tag.
    - In another matter unrelated to the book, I had the thought, "Titles are not summaries!" and I wrote about that thought on the page "Titles are not summaries".
