[[affirmation]]" and "[[dismiss]]" are related to "[[cutting]]" and "[[cut (a stencil, on a mimeograph)]]".
To listen to someone, [[listening closely]], to hook [[hook]] into what is in the other person and pull them out.
There is a [[string]] form used to "[[pull]]" at this time
To assert something is equivalent to cutting this cord and losing the means to extract it from the other party.
