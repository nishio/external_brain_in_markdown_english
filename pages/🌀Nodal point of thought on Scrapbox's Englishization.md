- [[You may read]]

To translate this Japanese Scrapbox into English.
Already realized at DeepL
I, the customer, don't feel I have customer value.
I wouldn't be too sad if the English version or the translated program disappeared.
Not the right product if it is

GPT makes you "write" instead of "translate into English".
This is a great idea.
[[An experiment in having GPT create blog posts]].
- [[Blog post generation experiment from Scrapbox]]
- [[AI Shaman]]
Useful descriptions can be refined even from fragmented descriptions.

Why haven't we introduced that?
Unlanguageized discomfort
Not all articles are "wanted" to be read in the first place.
The degree to which it is acceptable to read
There is no customer value for me, the customer, whether I can read the article in English or not.
What are the real needs?
That a very small percentage of the articles you want to read will be read.
You can use that as a base from which to "read" the surrounding articles."
If I cut out the information from the Scrapbox and scribbled it into a blog post, I would not be able to communicate it as a network of knowledge, which I find valuable.

Links that are connected on Scrapbox should be connected.
The warranty here is the most important.
If 100% is difficult, it should be guaranteed from the most important part.
So what is "important"?
That's how far we're from "articles we want you to read."
All links in the article you want us to read should be guaranteed.

DeepL translation brought it from 0 to 1.
What is it missing?
Is the "article you want us to read" translated by it really of the quality you want us to read?
In fact, it hasn't.
I hope the quality of the translations is high, though I've unconsciously turned away from them saying, "The quality of the translations is hardly perfect, but it's better than nothing."
However, due to the "translate and import (overwrite) from the Japanese version" structure, if you update the Japanese version, it will be overwritten.
- If you read the English version and find a problem with the translation, you cannot edit it on the spot.
- Or rather, there is no way to control the translation (although batch string replacement is implemented).

Not inherently suited for Scrapbox?

Specifically.
- Share the English translation of the ChatGPT article?

> An excellent person in this era is someone who can rewrite unreliable prompts into programs and improve reliability
- Maybe make things on a prompt basis and then programmatically ensure that the quality is unsatisfactory.
- 'No link is connected' is an obvious lack of quality.

# Digest
.
Discussion of Scrapbox's English language conversion from DeepL to GPT 3.5. However, the quality of the translations is problematic and customer value is not perceived. Therefore, the idea of "writing" by GPT is born, and experiments with blog article generation are conducted. However, not all of the articles are "want-to-read" articles, but many are only good enough to be read. Therefore, when they are cut out of Scrapbox and scribbled as blog articles, the network of information transmission is lost. The solution to this problem is to guarantee links.

# Relevance
It is related to the fragments "[[pContinuousTranslation2023-06-01]]" and "[[Blog text generation instead of translation]]". The former is directly related to the content of the note, as it describes the consideration of either improving Scrapbox's automated translation system or switching to a GPT-based one. The latter describes the idea of having Scrapbox generate blog-like text based on Scrapbox notes, and is related to the GPT "writing" idea described in the note.

# deep thinking
The discussion of Scrapbox's transition to English raises important issues in terms of translation quality and customer value. Regarding the quality of translation, it is noted that the decision to move from DeepL to GPT 3.5 is problematic in terms of the quality of the translation. Regarding customer value, it is also stated that there are many articles that are only good enough to read, and that there is no customer value for being able to read those articles in English. The idea of "writing" by GPT is proposed as one approach to solving these problems.

The decision was made to change the English version of Scrapbox from DeepL to GPT 3.5. However, there are problems with the quality of the translation, and we feel that the quality of the translation, especially for "articles we want you to read," is not good enough for our readers. There is also the problem that the articles cannot be edited after translation. Therefore, we proposed "writing" by GPT and experimented with generating blog articles from Scrapbox. The results showed that useful descriptions can be generated even from fragmented descriptions. However, we believe that it is important to guarantee the links that are connected on Scrapbox, because not all articles are "wanted" to be read.

### Summary of notes

A discussion on the English translation of Scrapbox. DeepL has decided to change its translation engine to GPT3.5. However, it is questionable to translate all articles into English. Many of the articles are "good enough to read" and translating them into English has no customer value. What is really needed is for the "articles that need to be read" to be read. For this purpose, the links that are connected on Scrapbox should be guaranteed. DeepL translation has brought it from 0 to 1, but its quality is not perfect, and the translated "articles you want to read" are not of a quality that will really be read. Also, if there is a problem with the result of the translation, it cannot be edited on the spot.

## Digest with Fragments
From the fragment "🔁Nodes of Thought on the Englishization of Scrapbox", the decision was made to move from DeepL to GPT 3.5 to translate Scrapbox into English, but the customer value was not felt. Opinion. Instead, "writing" by GPT has been proposed. However, not all articles are "wanted" to be read, and the degree to which they can be read is considered to have no customer value in English.

## Thought
From our discussion of the English-language version of Scrapbox, we felt that it is important to take the perspective that not every article is an article that one "wants" to read. The notion that articles that are only good enough to be read in English have no customer value provides a new perspective on how to evaluate the value of information. In addition, the fact that the true need is for some of the articles to be read, and the suggestion that the surrounding articles are "good to read" based on those articles, suggests that the value of information depends greatly on how the information is combined or how it relates to other information, and This reminded me that the value of information varies greatly depending on how it is combined and how it relates to other information.
