terminology
- [Reactive aggression: aggression that occurs as an impulsive response to an external stimulus such as provocation, insult, or injustice. Strong anger and high arousal.
- [instrumental / proactive aggression: premeditated aggression used as a means to an end (e.g., to gain money, elevate status, control). Anger is not essential.

Typical Differences
- Triggers:
    - Reactive = perceived provocation/threat (likely to involve hostility attribution bias)
    - Instrumental = expectation of reward and benefit, learned gain
- Emotion:
    - Reactive = anger/frustration↑, impulsivity↑
    - Instrumental = emotionally flat is acceptable, planning ↑
- Time Characteristics:
    - Reactive = on the spot/short-circuited
    - Instrumental = preparation and repetition are possible
- Example:
    - Reactive = hit when insulted / pushed away when pushed away
    - Instrumental = threaten to take money/ bully to ruin reputation
- Easily Relevant Factors:
    - Reactive = difficulty controlling anger, immature emotional regulation, attention bias
    - Instrumental = reward sensitivity, reduced empathy, antisocial learning

Measurement (representative)
- Two dimensions (reactive/instrumental) are evaluated separately, such as RPQ (Reactive-Proactive Aggression Questionnaire).

Direction of intervention (roughly)
- Reactive: trigger recognition, anger management, cognitive reappraisal, relearning of social cues.
- Instrumental: consistent cost presentation (punishment/loss), learning alternative reward pathways, training in norms/empathy.
The actual behavior is often mixed motives and may not be neatly categorized one way or the other.
