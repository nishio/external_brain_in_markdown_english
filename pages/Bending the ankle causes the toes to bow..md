title: "Bending the ankle causes the toes to bow."

I assumed that of course that would be the case, but he said that was a bad idea.
Bend and stretch after grabbing something with your toes to prevent warping.
If it's a "C", it doesn't bend at all, if it's an inverted "C", it touches the fingertips.

This stretch works pretty well, but I think it's working on the [[hamstring]], not the calf.

- [[stretch]]
- [[calf (of leg)]]
- [[Ankle range of motion]]
