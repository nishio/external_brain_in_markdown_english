title: "Discrepancies in the sense of scarce resources"
---

Rare resources" may be needed to achieve a certain objective. In such cases, the acquisition and utilization of those scarce resources will greatly affect the certainty of achieving the objective.

But when there is more than one project member, there can be a discrepancy in the perception of whether a given resource is a scarce resource or not.

When I heard from the "X is a scarce resource" school of thought, I thought, "It's a shame that X is a scarce resource and we don't take advantage of it," but then I thought about why that happens and realized that those who don't take advantage of it probably don't consider X to be a scarce resource.

- Mr. A's idea of the goal of the project (GA) and Mr. B's idea of an acceptable goal (GB) are different in scope.
- Assume that above line LX is the area where resource X is needed.
- At this time, for Mr. A, "X is essential for the success of the project".
- But for Mr. B, "X is not essential to the success of the project."
    - NICE TO HAVE but not MUST: [[MUST and NICE TO HAVE]].
- Upon hearing Mr. B's argument, Mr. A would think, "Even if we reach such a goal, it's not a success" or "Making such garbage doesn't mean it's finished.

If X is not essential to the success of the project for Mr. B, then it will be combined with numerous other resources.

- If X and Y, Y is more important because it increases the "probability of success for Mr. B" more.
- Z increases the "probability of success for Mr. B" more than X.
    - If you can't take both X and Z, which will you take?
    - Discard X because Z is a greater contribution to the success of the project for Mr. B.
    - For Mr. A, that is unacceptable because it eliminates the project's chance of success.
