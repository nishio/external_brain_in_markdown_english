title: "🔁Multi-headed thoughts"

The concept of "multi-head thinking" takes "thinking" to a new stage. We would like to further develop this concept.
- Multi-headed thinking develops over time and generates new perspectives and ideas
- This opens a new stage of intellectual production
- Breaking the framework of existing thinking and discovering new connections and perspectives is a hallmark of multi-head thinking.
- "[[Other people's perspectives are important]]" and "you can learn from anyone" are relevant.
    - N parallel heads with AI assistance does not make you N times more productive.
    - If you are alone, your gaze becomes the bottleneck.
        - [[metaphor for sunlight]].
    - To go beyond that, you need to "spread out" to get other people's perspectives (and get a lot of sunlight by spreading out).

My research is based on the observation that the process of thinking proceeds through "writing." However, this "single-headed thinking" has its limitations; Nishio's "multi-headed thinking" advocates a new form of thinking in which the AI reads and writes multiple pages simultaneously, enabling thinking from multiple perspectives. This enables "output of ideas by scraping instead of writing. However, creative thinking and analytical thinking at the same time should be avoided. While multi-headed thinking has the potential to diversify the thinking process and generate new perspectives, it should be applied with caution.

Nishio's "Multi-head Thinking" and "The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production" offer techniques for streamlining the thinking process. In addition, "The Technique of Transcription" states the importance of thinking while transcribing. This is relevant to my research.

The process of thinking is also defined as "thinking = combining one piece of information with another. This is consistent with the basic tenets of multi-head thinking.

In sum, while multi-headed thinking has the potential to streamline the thinking process and generate new perspectives, its application requires caution. These studies also provide important clues for understanding and improving the thinking process.

### Multi-head thinking and its effects
.

In my previous research, I observed that the process of thinking proceeds through "writing". This takes the form of a one-dimensional progression of thinking, with new ideas being built on top of old ones. However, this process has been called "single-headed thinking" and its limitations have been noted.

Nishio's research, "Multi-headed Thinking," proposes a new form of thinking that extends this single-headed thinking: multi-headed thinking. This is where AI reads and writes multiple pages at the same time, enabling thinking from multiple perspectives.

This enables "output of ideas by scraping instead of writing" and provides a new perspective on the possibility of "writing" by non-human entities.

Multi-headed thinking is also effective from the perspectives of "judgments supported by multiple perspectives" and "thinking that creates the future. This is because it makes it possible to integrate information from multiple perspectives and create new perspectives.

However, as the "don't mix hot and cold water" warning suggests, we should avoid creative and analytical thinking at the same time. This is because while multi-headed thinking allows multiple perspectives to be considered simultaneously, each perspective can interfere with one another.

In sum, while multi-headed thinking has the potential to diversify the thinking process and generate new perspectives, it should be applied with caution.

Nishio's study, "Don't Erase Your Manuscript," is relevant to my research. My research claims that writing validates one's understanding and enables critical thinking.
