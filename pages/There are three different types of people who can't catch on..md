There are three different types of people who can't catch on.
- [[Propagation of new concepts]]

Explaining something new from scratch in a way that people with no knowledge of it can understand is very costly.
- Usually they don't.
- [[It is up to the other party whether or not to pay the cost of the information transfer.]]

Whether or not you can catch it in that case depends on the state of knowledge of the recipient.
There are three different types of people who can't catch on.
- Who presume to be correct based on their trust in the author.
    - Or, more crudely, "[[fan]]."
- People withholding in neutral.
- Those who presume that it is an error because of the backlash against the author.
    - Why the backlash?
        - [[envy]]
        - People who care about hierarchy are jealous when individuals they regard as lower than themselves are held in higher esteem than they are.
