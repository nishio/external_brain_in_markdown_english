We believe that there is a risk of both a future in which the market value of human intellectual production plummets as a result of AI becoming cheaper, and a future in which I find myself in a position where I am unable to pay for AI use as a result of AI becoming more expensive. I would like to think about what individuals can do to reduce this risk. If you need more information on this process, please ask.

In considering what can be done at the individual level to reduce risk, the following perspectives are largely helpful
- Enhancement of skills and knowledge
    - Learn about AI principles and mechanisms
        - For example, exposure to the basics of programming and data science, or knowing the basic theory of AI, will make it easier to treat AI as a tool that you are comfortable using.
        - When following the latest trends, even a cursory follow-up of business use cases and research field stories will give you an antennae for "how AI is evolving" and "where it is starting to be used.
    - Improve ability to perform creative and complex tasks
        - The areas of "pattern recognition" and "work with large amounts of data," in which AI excels, are areas where human value tends to decline relatively easily.
        - On the other hand, by developing areas that are difficult to replace immediately by introducing AI alone, such as [[abstract thinking]], [[project management]], and communication with customers and [[users]], it will be easier to secure added value as humans even when AI becomes inexpensive.

- Activities and dissemination in areas where it is easy to demonstrate uniqueness
    - Building brands and communities
        - No matter how much AI-generated content is mass-produced, there will still be a demand for information with a sense of individuality and provenance, such as human "personal perspectives" and "insights based on actual experience.
        - For example, if you disseminate information with your own experiences on social networking sites, blogs, podcasts, etc., you may be able to build "unique" value that is difficult to replace by AI.

    - Know how to use and protect your intellectual property
        - If you are concerned that the flood of inexpensive AI will reduce the value of human-generated content and creative works, it is important to understand how intellectual property protection works, such as copyright and Creative Commons.
        - You can reduce the risk of a market value crash by considering how you will handle, protect, or share your work and ideas as needed.
- Provide diverse sources of income and support systems
    - Multiple carriers and income streams.
        - Even if AI becomes less expensive and the value of your own intellectual production decreases, having another source of income will help diversify your risk.
            - Specific examples:
                - Freelance and highly specialized work, as well as online courses and community management
                - Affiliate or content sales as a side business, even on a small scale, in addition to your main job
        - Know about public support and open source/community AI
            - In case your financial situation or region makes it impossible to use expensive AI, it is also a good idea to research support and subsidy programs offered by the national government, local governments, NGOs, or other organizations, or information on open-source AI tools.
            - There are many AI-related libraries available for free on GitHub and other sites that can do some surprisingly advanced things.

- Stay on top of AI industry trends and adapt early
    - Stay abreast of AI-related regulations and market pricing trends
        - To be prepared for the risk of AI suddenly becoming fee-based or expensive, or for the risk of changing terms of use, check regularly for news of developments in major AI companies and government regulatory policies.
        - It is also useful to be aware of the "risk of over-reliance on a particular AI service" and to compare alternative tools and multiple platforms.
    - Seek to develop AI tools and methods that work for you
        - For example, there are various types of AI, such as AI that excels at natural language processing, AI that excels at image processing, and AI that excels at machine translation, etc. If you use them while exploring which one matches your work and lifestyle, you can create a situation where "it is easy to find an alternative that suits you even if a high-performance AI becomes expensive.
- Participate in social discussions and institutional design, keep updating information
    - Be aware of AI ethics and digital disparity issues
        - Whether AI becomes cheaper or more expensive, its impact on individuals will depend on how society as a whole positions AI.
        - As the digital divide (disparities in access to information and IT resources) progresses, there could be scenarios in which some people are at an extreme disadvantage.
    - Disseminate opinions and information and participate in relevant communities
        - In an increasing number of cases, municipalities are soliciting opinions on digitalization projects and social implementation of AI. The exchange of information and expression of opinions at such occasions may eventually lead to actions such as "lowering usage fees.
        - It is also beneficial to continue to update your information and knowledge by actively participating in study groups and seminars organized by universities, public libraries, and NPO organizations.

summary
- Possess your own uniqueness and strengths, and successfully combine the strengths of AI with those of humans.
- Learn the basic knowledge required to become an AI "user" (programming, data science, etc.).
- Secure multiple sources of income and career paths, so that if one income drops, another pillar of income will support it.
- Prepare for the risk of rising AI implementation costs by leveraging community, institutional, and open source information.
- By keeping abreast of social debates and rulemaking, we will be involved in the direction of improving the environment for the use of AI and narrowing the gap.

Through these actions, we can prepare for both the risk of "falling value of intellectual production" if AI becomes extremely inexpensive and the risk of "not being able to pay for use" if AI becomes too expensive. If you need additional, more detailed information, please let us know specific areas (e.g., AI-related studies, open source examples, etc.).
