> [nakajo_k](https://twitter.com/nakajo_k/status/1700027126366474694) When I saw that [[mean value]] of [[savings]] of single people in their 50s is 10.48 million yen, [[median]] 530,000 yen, and 39.6% of them do not own any assets, I thought "15 years from now I think that Japan in 15 years will be a world of excitement when I see that all these single people will become old people. Seriously, let's see what will happen to [[pension]].
> [nakajo_k](https://twitter.com/nakajo_k/status/1700029089967747425) The average savings of singles in their 50s is 10.48 million yen, and the percentage of those who actually have more than 10 million yen is 22%, well, shaky. They say you need 20 million for retirement, but only 14% of singles in their 50s have this.
