Kevin Kelly's "The Singularity Is Always Near" is an essay that reframes the technological singularity (Singularity) not as a "one-time event in the distance" but as a vision that is always before our eyes. The following is a summary of the main points.

# Background: Singularity image by Vinge Kurzweil
- [[Vernor Vinge]] proposed that the improvement in computer capabilities will create an exponential loop toward infinity and plunge us into an unpredictable future, like a "black hole singularity".
- [[Ray Kurzweil]] expanded on this, showing similar acceleration in almost all areas of information technology and predicting a "Rapture-like moment" around 2040, when human intelligence will be surpassed.

# Kerry's assertion: singularity is always "close"
1.### illusion of exponential growth
.
    - If we go backward in the exponential function at any point in time, the singularity always appears to be just ahead of "now" because a "vertical asymptote" appears there. In other words, the singularity is nothing more than an illusion that the observer places after the fact.
2.### Technology phase shift is invisible
.
    - The transition to a new stage cannot be recognized until one stands "ahead" of it, and from the inside it appears only as a smooth continuous change. The acquisition of language and writing, he argues, is similarly [[not experienced as a disconnection at the onset]].

# Similarity to "[[Techno Rapture]]"
- In the Christian [[rapture]] ([[Rapture]]), believers are supposed to be suddenly raised to heaven and gain physical and mental immortality. He points out that the Singularity myth is extremely similar in that there is an expectation that humanity will be immortalized by advanced intelligence when the Singularity arrives in 2040.

# Criticism points by Kelly
1.### Immortality = no guarantee
.
    - The mind and body are not necessarily digitizable or updatable, and expectations of immortality are thinly based.
2.### Assumption of bootstrap capability
.
    - He assumes that a human (Type 3 mind) can create its own smarter intelligence, but argues that the ability to self-accelerate is untested, just as it is difficult for either Chimpanzee (Type 2) or Ant (Type 1).
3.### Mathematical singularity is an illusion
.
    - He blackmails that if you capture the exponential function at any given point in time, it is "always close" and therefore has little meaning as a prediction of the future.
4.### Invisibility issues
.
    - He points out that a true phase shift can only be recognized "in retrospect," and that a predictive major rupture is not likely to occur.

[Conclusion: Rather than looking for a singularity at a "specific moment in time," Kelly presents the viewpoint that technology is a continuous process that is constantly transforming itself from moment to moment, and that we should not be fooled by its "illusions. The singularity is not "near" but "always near," and we are in the midst of its continuous evolution - this is the core of this paper.
