Since only I edit my personal projects, I can write down what I'm working on and go to bed, and the next day it's at the top of the list in the order of updates.
I'll pin the ones I want to stop for longer, and that's what I'm pinning the tasks I'm going to talk about next Friday.

However, this is not the case with multi-person projects.

Somehow an old page was edited up at the well, and another page sank relative to the old one.
I've been keeping tabs open for things I'm working on, and as a result, the tabs have been filling up.
