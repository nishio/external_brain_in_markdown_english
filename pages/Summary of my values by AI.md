title: "Summary of my values by AI"
---

I was discussing how to manage [[tasks without deadlines]] better in [[Advanced Voice]], and I was wondering if it all comes down to "[[Purpose of Life]]" and "[[values]]"? I was getting the feeling that "You can help me identify what my purpose in life is and what my values are by asking questions." After the prompt, I said, "Read over what we've talked about so far and sort it out."

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>To summarize what we have discussed so far, you have a strong desire to improve your productivity and immerse yourself in intellectual exploration. You have also developed an interest in [[visual content]] and have continued to [[express information through illustrations]] in order to [[communicate to a large audience regardless of language]]. Through these, he hopes to attract attention from [[a small number of strong people]] and create something [[beneficial in the long term]]. A possible step forward would be to leverage their experience to date, but also to use online platforms and social networking sites to disseminate their visual message.

Keywords.
    - [[Increased Productivity]]
- [[immersing oneself]] in [[intellectual inquiry]].
    - [[Attention from a few strong people]]
- [[Long-term value]]
