title: "First, there is the assumption that Home"
---

from [/unnamedcamp/what is Camp?](https://scrapbox.io/unnamedcamp/what is Camp?)
Camp in Unnamed Camp is meant to contrast with Home.
- Home means "my home".
    - In terms of Scrapbox, a project that you are running alone.
    - Or include blogs, etc.

First, there is Home, which is one starting point.
- Basic intellectual activities take place there.
- Independent thinking/meditation

In such intellectual endeavors, we post here matters that we would like to throw out to others, ask questions about, or brag about.
- The image is that once you leave Home, you go out to Camp.

> First, there is the home, where the basic intellectual activities take place.
- Very sympathetic.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamedcamp/nishio/icon' alt='/unnamedcamp/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - [[Quiet room metaphor]]
    - On the other hand, I don't have much sympathy here.
        - > I want to pitch in, ask questions, brag.
    - Strong "I'm here to see something new at the campground" feeling.
            - >  [[A range of topics of interest is provided, and]]
        - I came to see [[reverse Jenga (game)]] was going on -> I'll try to load a few myself.
        - Reverse Jenga was bad enough that the person in front of me stacked it, making it even more difficult to stack it -> [[Reverse Jenga reloading]].
        - If you see something interesting (whether it is a reverse Jenga created by human intention or a naturally occurring wild flower), take a picture and bring it home.
    - Same thing in that they are coming to a different place than Home for a "change of scenery".
