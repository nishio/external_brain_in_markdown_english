I'm going to try to summarize a theme that I have a lot to say about, but that hasn't been easily put into words using "Fireworks to think about," which is a practical version of the KJ method.

Putting the theme in the middle and growing the net while drawing relational lines.

When I wrote it, I realized I was leaning to one side when I thought I had "a lot to talk about."
- I was about to move on to the one that was available when I saw "a lot of people care about being right" and I asked, "Why is that?" and I was like, "Why is that?
- I see, so this is how you promote multifaceted thinking around a theme.

- Oh, I'm connected.
- Next, we're going to fix this and island it 2-5 sheets at a time.
- Or take a screenshot and write it down on your iPad.

Oh shit, it's too small.
I took more screenshots and shrunk them down.

Sounds good, let's make this into a narrative tomorrow.
- The flow that was created is counterclockwise, but I think I'll go clockwise when I make the narrative, because it fits better.

About 2 hours so far.
