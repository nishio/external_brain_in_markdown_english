<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The Open Source Trilogy is probably an expression referring to the important writings by [[Eric Raymond]] on the philosophy and practice of open source software development. Raymond was an important figure from the early days of the [[open source movement]], and several of his writings have had a significant impact on the philosophy and methodology of open source software.

Eric Raymond's three most important works on open source include

- The Cathedral and the Bazaar" ([[Monastery and Bazaar]]): This work contrasts the "cathedral" model of open source software development, which is top-down and controlled, with the more free and collaborative "bazaar" model. Raymond emphasizes the efficiency and effectiveness of the "bazaar" model of development, which was adopted by Linus Torvalds in the development of the Linux kernel.

- Homesteading the Noosphere" ([[Cultivation of the Nowhere Sphere]]): This section discusses the social structure of open source projects, the prestige economy (a system of gaining prestige through contributions to projects), and motivating factors in software development.

- The Magic Cauldron" ([[magic pot]]): This work analyzes the economics of open source software, explaining why open source is economically sustainable and how businesses can benefit from open source software. and how businesses can benefit from open source software.
