> Piers Morgan, a male commentator from the UK, asks about transgender issues. He is usually inflammatory, but I agree with what he says in this video.

I heard that there is not only gender identity but also age identity:.
- I am 1,000 years old," I admit to myself, "so the young people around 100 years old at the highest who usually insist that we should respect the elderly should respect me.
- I am self-aware that my soul has been alive for a thousand years, although it entered my current body only a few decades ago at the highest!

I feel like I'm self-identifying as "the physical body of proteins and the chemical reactions on it are only a temporary cache, and the digitized and published data is my body"... What if I insist that "I will not die if my physical body stops working" as a more essential issue than gender or age?
    - [[The body is a cache.]]
    - [[Humans are temporary caches]]
