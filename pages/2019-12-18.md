- Tachikawa and Nishio discuss how people react when they are told [[good]] or appropriate advice.
- First, Mr. Tachikawa talked about his experience of getting in trouble when confronted with a good argument.
    - For example, when he told a junior student his advice to study for an exam for 12 hours every day to improve his grade, the junior student looked troubled.
- Nishio pointed out that even if those advices are correct, they will not be effective if they are not timed correctly or do not match the situation.
    - [[Advice is raw]], expressing that if you don't give it at the right time, it will rot.
- He also analyzed the reasons for not accepting the advice honestly, because the cost of the effort is perceived as large or the return is estimated to be small.
- From there, the topic evolved to the fact that people tend to make "[[Pessimistic Misconceptions]].
    - We discussed the tendency to estimate the cost of things larger than they actually are and the return smaller than they are, which may be inhibiting [[the challenge of trying new things]].
- Finally, Ms. Nishio introduced her experience of participating in the [[mystery solving event]] recommended by Mr. Tachikawa.
    - Mr. Tachikawa's information raised his [[expectations of the fun]] of solving the riddles and he decided to participate.
    - He said the actual experience was more interesting than he had imagined and the returns were significant.
- Throughout, the message was that it is important to appropriately raise expectations and start with [[small steps]] by providing information in order to correct people's misconceptions and encourage them to try new things.
