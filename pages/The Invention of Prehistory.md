>  Although Harari's "[[The Complete History of Sapience]]" and Graeber's "[[The Dawn of All Things]]" seem to have opposite claims, they are actually both in the same vein that Western thinkers have long dreamed of: "to concoct a 'prehistoric story' that would explain various questions in a convenient manner. The story is that they are books. You have a point.

Well, it is true that we can learn so much from history! I can learn so much from history! I'm a wise man!

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This article argues that theories about the [[primitive]] or [[prehistoric]] age of mankind should be treated with caution. The main arguments are as follows.
1. the writings of [[Yuval Noah Harari]] and [[David Graeber]] offer diametrically opposed theories of primitive humanity, but they all belong to the same intellectual tradition that seeks to understand humanity from its deep past.
2. interest in prehistory was born out of the repressive world of modernity [[racism]] and [[colonialism]] and is still poisoned by it. It produces violent and self-centered narratives that prevent self-reflection.
3. but some scientists, like [[Kenneth Oakley]], advocated an anti-racist and peaceful theory of origins. Others, like [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], were thinkers who preached equality and unity of all beings, including humanity.
4. interest in prehistory is problematic, but it can also be a tool to challenge the oppressive order and to imagine a new reality. Humans have the power to give new meaning to old stories.
In short, the article argues that prehistoric theory needs attention but can be useful for egalitarian purposes.

The article's criticism of the "violent and self-centered narrative" refers to the following views on prehistory
1. the view that primitive humans were instinctively violent and aggressive. For example, the theory of [[Robert Ardrey]] that human society evolved from "[[killer apes]]".
2. the view that civilization is merely a thin "gloss" over primitive "[[barbarism]]. For example, the theories of [[H. Ryder Haggard]] and [[Sigmund Freud]].
3. a colonialist view that viewed people different from modern Westerners as "primitive" and "uncivilized" and used them to justify conquest.
4. a view of the entire history of mankind as a single linear narrative leading to the birth of modern Western societies. This leads to an attitude of self-praise that we are the achievement of mankind.
5. an attitude of projecting their own concerns onto the past and using prehistory to justify modern man.
Common to these views is the portrayal of prehistory as a story of violence and conquest, which is used to justify modern superiority. The authors criticize this as self-centered and harmful.
