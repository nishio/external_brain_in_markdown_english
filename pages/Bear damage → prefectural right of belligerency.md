- [[Science Fiction Setting]]
> [alt_dirty](https://twitter.com/alt_dirty/status/1720415833598701609) Bear damage is all over the place.
>  ↓
>  Hunting clubs alone can't cover it.

>  However, possession of swords for the purpose of defending oneself against bears is illegal under the Firearms Law.
>  ↓
>  It is practically difficult to ask the SDF to do every single thing since there is so much damage all over the country.
>  ↓
>  Why not have an armed organization in the local government?
>  ↓
>  The Constitution does not prohibit a "prefecture's right of belligerency" Yay!

>  In response to the declaration of a state of emergency in the Hokkaido and Tohoku regions, Kagoshima Prefecture announced the dispatch of the Satsuma Unit to the disaster area. Due to the recent increase in brown bear appearances, hunting clubs have not been able to keep up, and each prefecture is strengthening its disaster countermeasures by establishing its own self-defense organization.

>  Atsugi and Yokosuka should be placed under the command of the Kanagawa State.
>  Of course, we should conclude the Kanna-U.S. Security Treaty and have the U.S. military stationed there as it is to play a part in the defense of the country.
>  Needless to say, Machida is an inherent territory of the Kanagawa Region and will be occupied promptly.
