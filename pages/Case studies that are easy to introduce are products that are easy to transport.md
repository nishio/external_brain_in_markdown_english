- The image of a [[movement]] person is that of a [[merchant]].
- [[Trading merchant]] / [[trader]].

But there are other ways to get involved in the [[trade]] process other than by moving yourself.
- Development of products that are convenient for merchants
    - Sugarcane is not exported directly but processed into sugar before exporting.
    - That's because it's more "[[compact]]".
        - High value per mass
        - [[High value-added]]

[[Examples that are easy to introduce]] are [[products that are easy to transport]].
- And unlike physical goods [[easy to reproduce]].
