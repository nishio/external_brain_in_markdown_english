title: "Watch it on video and then explain it in words."

Watch [[the video]] and then [[explain with words]].

- [[visual thinking]]

[[non-verbal thoughts]].
- I'm in the "of course you do, of course you do" camp, but surprisingly there are people with a different opinion.
- For me, it's [[empirically evident]] that there is [[no argument]].

- [[afantasia]] and may have something to do with it.

Maybe [[the assumption that "thinking is done in language"]] is so intense that they ignore all [[non-verbal thinking]].
- Maybe they [[re-label]] non-verbal thoughts as "not thoughts".

[Maybe [[experience of manipulating]] nonverbal entities is so poor that they are unable to manipulate and think about nonverbal entities.
- In this case, it can simply be acquired through training.

I felt like all the various cases I've seen could be summed up by "[[the manipulation of non-verbal presence]]".
    - [[go]] : Black and white stones
- [[Geometry]]:.
    - shape
- [[Ring of Wisdom]].
    - [[CAST DUET]]
    - [[musical instrument]]
    - [[InstaChord]]
            - [[Increased skill in using tools leads to a more detailed perception of the world]]
    - [[drawing]]
        - [[computer graphics]]
    - [[GUI]]
        - As an example of non-verbal thinking that produces real benefits, when designing a GUI, first watch a video of a GUI that does not yet exist operating in your brain, and then implement its behavior in code (≒ verbalization).
    - [[body]] / [[muscle]].
        - [[bouldering]]
        - First there is the "Oh no, I can't!" The non-verbal experience of "I can't do it!" comes first.
        - Then, "Three times in a row I'm trying to get that thing and I'm slipping and falling... why?" How do I proceed?" and thinking linguistically.
                - Similar to the explanation in [[Diagram of the updated model of how engineers learn]], behavior -> why different from expectations? → What should we do? Process
        - The solution, especially after seeing someone else's play as a video, is to say, "Oh, I see, there's a way to twist your hips.
            - > I see, you have a hand that twists at the waist to get closer to the wall while keeping your hand outstretched (I was watching others move).
                - from [[bouldering-2025-03-12#67d1b5fdaff09e0000469814]]
        - [[stretch]]
        - After recognizing a body part that was only vaguely recognized through exercise, "What's this one called?" Afterwards, the [[Concept Handles]] are acquired after the fact.
