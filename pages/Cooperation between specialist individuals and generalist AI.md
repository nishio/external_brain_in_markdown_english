<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>[If AI support enables the minimum level of practical use to be achieved even in non-specialized areas, wouldn't it be more efficient to have a single person [[penetrate]] rather than dividing labor?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The need for division of labor may indeed change as AI assistance allows humans to complete a minimum level of work in areas outside of their expertise, and the evolution of AI holds great promise in the acquisition of knowledge and skills, information retrieval and analysis, and even decision-making assistance. This will enable individuals to perform a wide variety of tasks more efficiently.
...
While the evolution of AI will certainly increase efficiency and productivity and enable individuals to acquire diverse skills, it will not lead to the total abolition of the division of labor. Rather, [[AI and humans working together]] could lead to new ways of working and living that maximize the strengths of each. [The division of labor will become more specialized and efficient, and will evolve through the interaction of humans and AI.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The need for division of labor may diminish as AI assistance allows humans to complete a minimum level of work outside of their expertise, but it will not disappear completely for reasons of depth of expertise, creativity, and the human element. [[AI and human cooperation could create]] new ways of working.

- Cooperation between individual humans as [[specialists]] and AI as [[generalists]]?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Yes, that's right. Individual humans as specialists provide deep expertise, experience, creativity, and human judgment, while AI as generalists contribute their ability to process a wide range of information, analyze data, and automate routine tasks. In this way, humans and AI can work together to leverage their respective strengths to produce results that are both efficient and creative.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1770311288767291707) The division of labor is necessary because of the lack of human ability, and when AI assistance allows even non-specialized areas to pass the minimum practical level, If AI assistance enables the minimum level of practicality to be achieved even in non-specialized areas, wouldn't it be more efficient to have a single human penetrate the system rather than dividing labor?

>  Technology basically makes something easier or lowers the cost, but it tends to work in the direction of closing the gap on average, making everyone more versatile as a result than their actual abilities.

> [ringo](https://twitter.com/ringo/status/1770341539761250801) I think that's a division of labor with the humans providing the AI.
> [ringo](https://twitter.com/ringo/status/1770341879348879775) IT allows for a tremendous and sophisticated division of labor, like one person helping a million people. One form of this is to provide LLM
