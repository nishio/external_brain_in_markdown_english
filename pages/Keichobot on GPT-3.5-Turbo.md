title: "Keichobot on GPT-3.5-Turbo"
---

- I realized Keichobot on ChatGPT and thought that the next step would be to experiment with GPT3 ([[Keichobot on ChatGPT]]).
- 2023-03-01 OpenAI released ChatGPT API ([[GPT-3.5-Turbo]])
- And at 1/10 the price.


v3
- [[Consulted with Keichobot on GPT-3.5-Turbo about the development policy of Keichobot on GPT-3.5-Turbo]]

v2
v2 test2
- [[I wish AI could manage tasks for me.]]
- It would be useful enough at this point!

v2 test1
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/> What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> I've changed the timing of the system prompt and would like to test it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/> Can you tell us why you changed the system prompts and what your objectives are?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Last time I did this, I forgot rather quickly about the system prompt that said "Ask a question". I had put it at the beginning, but should I put it at the end? I thought.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/> I see, it is more appropriate to put the system prompt at the end. So, you would like to run a test that reflects that change? Please let us know what specific tests you would like to run.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Just keep the conversation going like this and the questions are repeated.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/> Your request is to continue the conversation and repeat the question, but can you be more specific about what it is that you are trying to achieve? For example, what is the purpose or usage scenario?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> I am trying to create a system in which the repetition of questions encourages the verbalization of what is not yet verbalized in me.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/> The goal is to create a system to verbalize internal things and lead to action through repeated questioning, and it is hoped that through questioning, people will become aware of themselves.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Right, that's the story I put in the system prompt, you remembered. And you forgot to ask the question...
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/> Thank you very much. Let me ask you one question. What exactly would the system you are aiming for look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> If we can interact with a human at any time via a smartphone or smart speaker, and whenever a human feels like verbalizing, he or she can interact with that system to make the verbalization smoother than if he or she were to verbalize alone.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/> Thank you. Is the system you are aiming for a system where people can interact with their smartphones or smart speakers at any time in order to facilitate the verbalization of their own internal things?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> That's right.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/> Thank you. Is the system you are aiming to help you gain inner awareness and take action by making it easier for you to verbalize your inner self through your phone or smart speaker at any time?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> That's the story you put in the system prompt, maybe it wasn't appropriate to use this story about the system itself for the test. The answer is yes.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/> Understood. Thank you. I understand that the system you are aiming for is to help you gain inner awareness and take action by making it easier for you to verbalize your inner self through your smartphone or smart speaker.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Yes, you forgot to ask the question.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/> Could you ask a question? What exactly do you want to discuss?

v1
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/> What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> I made Keichobot with ChatGPT's API and I want to test it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/> What would you like to test? What are the specifics of your test?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> I want to try it just like Keichobot and make sure it works.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/> What features do you plan to test? For example, can you be specific about responding to keywords, continuity and fluency of dialogue, error handling, checking for API issues, etc.?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Will they dig into our input properly, will they continue the conversation, how fast is the response rate, etc.?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/> If you want to test using ChatGPT's API to chat in the same way as Keichobot, check the bot's response speed, ability to dig deeper into user input, and conversation continuity. Create and test the necessary test cases to evaluate them.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Question.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/> What operations would you like to perform using the API? For example, can you tell us specifically how you would like to verify a response as a chatbot, or measure the time it takes to generate a response from input information?
