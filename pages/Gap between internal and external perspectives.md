Those who push forward into the obvious red ocean.
Obvious" is subjective, so it doesn't look [[red ocean]] to that person.
People who are trying to get on [[a sinking ship]].
The person doesn't see that [it's sinking.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>You are describing a discussion of how people perceive their own situation and choices, and the gap between that perception and the perception from the outside.
    - [[Those who push forward into the obvious red ocean.]] ：
    - Red Ocean is a term used to describe a highly competitive situation in an existing market. From an outsider's perspective, that market may seem highly competitive and difficult to create new opportunities and value. However, those competing in it may believe that they can succeed with their ideas and strategies. They may believe that they can survive the competition with their unique value proposition, niche markets, and effective strategies.
- [[who tries to board a sinking ship]]:
    - This might refer to an organization, a project, or a particular undertaking that is facing a difficult situation, but people are willing to participate in it. From the outside, the choice may seem risky. However, participants or newcomers within it may feel that they have a chance to use their skills and experience to turn the situation around, or they may see the situation as valuable as an opportunity to learn and grow.
In short, people's choices and actions are based on their experiences, knowledge, values, and objectives. It is natural for people to have an internal perspective that is different from an external perspective and to act accordingly. Understanding the context of choices and actions will enable us to respect and empathize with the actions and choices of others.
