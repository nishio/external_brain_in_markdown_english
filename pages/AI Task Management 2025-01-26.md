- Tried a lot of things about task management by AI.
- the bad
    - I hate it when I ask "what shall we do today" in the morning and it takes a long time to get a reply.
        - Should I prepare it in advance while I'm sleeping?
    - I'm in the process of redesigning for a new development right now, and the effect of that is irritating me when I think about it for a while in the morning and then say, "I didn't know where the data was.
        - That's bad design.
        - Devin, Roo and ChatGPT all read and write data differently, so it's difficult to make them common.
            - Which one is the right one to use is still being figured out.
            - It worked straightforwardly and easily when I did it with Devin alone, but it's expensive and I'd like to be able to achieve it in another way if possible.
            - Whether it's Roo or ChatGPT, there's something missing as a feature.
                - You can do it if you implement Roo-like things on your own.
                    - However, there is a problem that if it is in the form of VSCode extension, it cannot be used from a smartphone.
                    - Convenient for Devin to use from Slack.
                - There's also a way to turn the whole part that handles the file system into a database.
                    - To be honest, I'm just editing a JSON file right now, so I don't have to think about the details, can I just plug one JSON per user into firestore or something?
- the right moment
    - I like to be able to tell them what the situation is (can't work on the computer, or I'm leaving in two hours) and filter it.
        - In other words, search criteria can be specified in natural language, not in conditional expressions or categories.
    - Regarding the registration of tasks, it is good that I can just mention something that comes to mind in chat rooms, etc. and it will be neatly written as a task.
    - As the task list grows, it can be compiled and tossed to o1 for analysis.
        - Might people with a bulging "someday I'll do it" list be happier if they did the same thing?
            - It may not be.
            - It might make sense for each task to be in clean data.
- It would be nice to do something like this
    - Put whatever comes to mind in your inbox as often as possible.
        - If it's a duplicate of something from the past, then the importance of the past goes up.
