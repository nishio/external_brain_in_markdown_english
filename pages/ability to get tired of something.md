I personally tend to view it negatively because of my self-perception of being a bored personality, but in some cases others interpreted it positively as "the ability to get bored.
Certainly, in general terms, when there is a "certain personality tendency" there must be both positive and negative aspects to it, and since personality does not change easily, it is better to utilize the positive aspects.

- Can the system cover it?
- Not enough MP?
        - What is [[MP depletion]]?
