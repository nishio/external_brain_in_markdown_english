title: "Auto-generated diary pages"
---

This Scrapbox diary page is generated "when I access it at the beginning of the day".
- I didn't design it that way, it's just the way [[pin-diary-X]] is implemented.

Effects that can be obtained from it
- If no diary page is created, then you have not accessed it for a day
    - That if a diary page is not created for a long period of time from one day to the next, it's probably dead.
    - A state in which, even if physically alive, intellectual and productive activity has ceased.
- If an empty diary page is created, it means that you were able to access the page but were not in a state to write a diary.
    - This could be some undisclosed busyness or something, I'm alive.

- [[If you can't move from the neck down.]]
