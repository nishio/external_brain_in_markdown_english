Washing [Vibram
from [/villagepump/2023/11/20](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/2023/11/20)
- What I couldn't do yesterday because of the headache.
    - I looked up [[how to wash Vibram]].
    - It said I could use the washing machine.
    - I went to see a laundromat and they had a washing machine dedicated to shoes.
        - was in use.
- Just came in.
    - 200 yen for 20 minutes, 100 yen for 20 minutes for drying
    - Maybe I'll just use the dryer...
- Dryer "I didn't say it would dry in 20 minutes, especially in winter."
    - I see
    - I don't know how long I should turn it for, so I set it at 20 minutes for now.
- Well, maybe they dried up.
    - I'll hang it outside just in case.
- The smell was completely gone.
