title: "I'm not sure I can do it."
---

It is easy to interpret "[[be made]]" as meaning "ability" or "skill," but when you actually have a concrete project in mind, you may ask yourself, "Can I do it? Can you do it? When you actually have a specific project, you may think, "Do I have the time to do it? No?" It often comes down to "Do I have time for it?
- Well, "[[I don't have time.]]" also means that the project loses in a time [[competition for resources]] among multiple projects that require time.
- [[It also takes time to acquire skills]].

If we abstract "I don't have time" to "[[I don't have the resources to do the project]]."
- Can you do it?" often comes down to [[trust]] and other [[SOC]] to get the resources you need.
- It's one thing to say, "Give me resources and I can do it," and another to say, "Show me you can do it and I'll give you resources," which causes [[deadlock]].
