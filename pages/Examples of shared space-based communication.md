- Examples of [Shared Space Communication

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1831707485574722008) The Nikkei Business wrote an article about #Plurality, which is a great contribution to the spread of the concept of Plurality in Japan. However, the expression "Plurality envisions governance through ... DAO, ... in other words, digital democracy" seems to deviate slightly from what usually @glenweyl said. I hope the information is accurately conveyed. @nikkeibusiness @pluralitybook
- Nikkei Business published an article on #Plurality and has contributed greatly to spreading the concept of Plurality in Japan. However, I think the expression "Plurality...envisions governance by DAOs, or digital democracy" is a bit off from what @glenweyl usually says. I hope the information is accurate. @nikkeibusiness @pluralitybook

There were three ways this communication could have gone.
- A: Message the reporter 1:1 saying that the interpretation may be different.
- B: 1:1 message to Glen saying "Nikkei says this, but I think it's misinterpreted.
- C: Do it in public

Reasons for choosing C this time
- I don't have the reporter's contact info, so A can't.
- If Glen says "yes" in B, I don't have the reporter's contact info, so the only way to get that to Nikkei would be a public posting.
    - Or Glen would need to contact Nikkei, which would consume additional time for Glen.
- If we do it in C, if Glen says "yes," that will be feedback directly to Nikkei.
