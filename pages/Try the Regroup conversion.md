Right now, there is no web UI yet, so you have to specify the ID at hand and run the script.

- Copy-paste the arrangement into an empty map
- For some reason I got an error dialog when creating a new blank map, I was able to use it as is, but I'll check later.

- It doesn't say, "Option B is better than Option A."
    - Each person's situation is different, and it is impossible to know what is the best option for that person. It is dishonest to give advice without hearing the details of the current situation.
- But it is unclear whether two is better than one, three is better than two, or four is better than three.
        - [[Number of options and quality of decision making]]
        - [[Jam Experiments]]
        - It is known that the latter is more difficult to make a decision between 6 and 24 alternatives.
- FoundX or the University of Tokyo IPC.
    - Options other than the "get a job after college" path are being supported and fattened up.

- What came up while operating the map.
- I threw up in chat once, but if I'm operating the map, should I put it in the map? This is something to consider.
