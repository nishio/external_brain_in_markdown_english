title: "Business card-like products"
---

Someone says, "Make a business-card product while you're young."
But to interpret this as "if you're not young, you don't have to make it" is wrong.

There is a [[separate community entry as a transfer to another world]] that does not carry over "business card-like products."
- Incarnations that can be carried over are [[not far enough apart]] and do not contribute to increasing [[diversity]].
- What can and cannot be carried over in otherworldly transfers
    - I'm biased because in an alternate universe story, if you don't have something to carry over, you don't have a story.
    - Well, but a lot of times [[knowledge attributed to the person]] can be carried over.
