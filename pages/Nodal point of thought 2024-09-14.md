<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The Allen Foundation, established in 1988, is an American charitable organization that supports research and programs primarily related to health and nutrition. The founder is Paul G. Allen, and the Foundation primarily provides grants for scientific research and educational programs in the areas of health improvement and nutrition. In particular, the Foundation supports projects aimed at improving dietary habits and helping to promote health among children and the elderly.
- The scope of the Foundation's activities is international, with a particularly large number of grants to universities and research institutions in the United States. It also focuses on topics such as improving food quality, nutrition education, and reducing health disparities.
- Paul G. Allen is best known as the co-founder of Microsoft, and his foundation was established as part of his personal philanthropy. His other philanthropic endeavors include the Allen Institute for Brain Science, which has made significant contributions to brain research and the medical field

[Allen Brain Atlas - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Brain_Atlas)
- The Allen Institute for Brain Science is known for its detailed research and data provision on the mouse brain. In particular, the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas is a high-resolution 3D atlas that provides detailed mapping of gene expression throughout the mouse brain and is used to elucidate the genetic characteristics of cells in each region of the brain. This data has contributed significantly to the advancement of neuroscience and is an important resource for understanding brain structure and function.
- The Allen Institute's efforts are also being used in research related to Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and neurological disorders such as autism, using mouse brain models as a basis for exploring the genetic and neurophysiological basis of these diseases. It should also be noted that the atlas is published as open data and freely available to researchers worldwide (

- [The Japan Self-Defense Forces Reserve Officers System Reserve Self-Defense Forces Officers System" | Government Public Relations Online](https://www.gov-online.go.jp/useful/article/201405/2.html)
    - > Reserve SDF officers are also called upon when a disaster occurs and rescue and relief operations are required for victims. They have been called up eight times so far, including the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, and in the Noto Peninsula Earthquake of 2024, reserve SDF officers and Quick Reaction Reserve SDF officers were called up and engaged in disaster relief activities together with active SDF officers.
        - I had no idea.

Data that cannot be made public
- For example, information on the location of people in need of assistance who are unable to walk alone at the time of an earthquake is important for rescue efforts.
- On the other hand, since it is personal information, it cannot be disclosed, and since there is a risk of criminal use, the disclosure must be to a limited number of people with verified identities.
    - So this is where it leads to the Reserve Self-Defense Force.

Specifically, users holding Optimism tokens (OP tokens) can vote for themselves or delegate their voting rights to other delegates (Delegates). This determines the allocation of funds to support project development and ecosystem growth

        - [Gov Fund Overview | Optimism Docs](https://community.optimism.io/token-house/gov-fund-overview)
    - The [[Token House]] plays a central role in voting, and its primary role includes the discussion and voting on governance proposals and the allocation of funds for the governance fund. This voting is based on the amount of OP tokens held, and a certain percentage of votes and approvals are required for a proposal to pass. For example, a governance fund proposal requires a minimum of 30% of the token supply to participate in the voting, of which at least 51% must vote in favor of the proposal

- [[DAO Treasury]]
    - The DAO Treasury, on the other hand, is a pool of funds managed within a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization), where the allocation of funds is determined by token holders voting on proposals. The unique feature of DAO Treasury is that it is fully decentralized, allowing the entire community to be involved in how funds are used. The voting system and governance model may vary from project to project, for example, Quadratic Voting. Flexible operations according to the needs of the community

Particular attention has been paid to the "sociotherapy" approach, which is a group therapy aimed at psychological healing and restoring trust in the community. The program provides an opportunity for perpetrators and victims to share the healing process and understand each other in the same space.

- A normal survey (with questions to be answered on a 3 or 5-point scale) requires people to input N natural sentences to obtain an N-dimensional vector.
- Polis is the same.
    - The difference is that (depending on the setting) people make additions to the question text itself
        - When multiple surveys are bundled together, there is a strong correlation
            - So you want to compress $N_1 + N_2$ questions into smaller $M$ dimensions.

- [[Definition of Happiness]]
I used to think about "Why can we say we need digital democracy?" and came up with the idea that "[[there is]] a need for people to define their happiness."
- from  [[Let's Talk with Cybozu Plurality Plurality Practices and Expectations]]
    - Key Issues: Importance of [[AI governance]] vs.
        - If AI becomes smarter than humans, AI should rule.
        - However, [[the definition of people's happiness needs to be done by humans]].
            - It is not up to one person to decide, but must be datamined that there are diverse forms of happiness
            - Without it, if an AI rules, it will impose someone else's predetermined form of happiness.
        - So we should go in the order of digital democracy, then integrated technocracy.
- [[Well-being Index]] is the very definition of happiness.

I like that it's multidimensional x multiregional, rather than being reduced to a one-dimensional scale.
- Which axis is more important for each person varies, and even for the same person, it depends on his/her life stage.
    - When children are born, they prefer municipalities where childcare is easier.
- People with different preferences can move to their preferred municipality if they are visualized in multiple dimensions x multiple regions.
        - [[mobile voting]]
- This is, in essence, a model in which humans have a vector of preferences v and regions have a vector of happiness u, and the inner product of these vectors is an individual happiness scalar
    - Given a vector of personal preferences, AI can answer the most appropriate region for that individual.
- The change of mindset here is rather interesting.
    - If you try to design a function that returns a scalar value of "people's happiness" as the objective function, the question becomes what do you do?
    - Consider first a "personal happiness" function that takes personal data as a parameter and returns a scalar, pending how to make it a single scalar
        - How to aggregate multiple people's "personal happiness" scalars
            - Is the sum/average of happiness better? Is the median better?
            - Minimizing the number of unhappy people is good?
                - Would you prefer [[area under the curve]]?
                - That's consistent with "sum of happiness" if the horizontal axis is people.
                - So the question becomes, can we treat all people equally as "1"?
                    - Is it okay to be 1 for a birth and 0 for a fetus born tomorrow?
        - Such a "mechanism for combining many people's scalars into a single scalar" is not necessary to consider at first, since the current society (whether it is optimal or not) has already established [[collective decision-making]] through voting and the market.
    - If we separate them, the optimization in the first half will be [[matching]], [[recommendation]], etc.
            - [[Understand complex things as they are complex.]]
- In this case, "where you live" is a choice between multiple options, but in general, you can participate in multiple online communities, and social interactions in such places also contribute to your happiness.
    - Then just which of the N online communities to join becomes a $2^N$ choice, making it difficult for a human to make a decision!
    - A future where AI "recommends" it to you, thereby reducing loneliness and increasing happiness.

- Interesting story about [[blu3mo]]'s question of what is the second principal component axis.
    - [[News from all sides]]
    - America may be a simpler conflict.
        - If so, the contribution of the first principal component should be larger
        - In other words, whether the distribution of arguments is plurality/multidimensional/smooth or unidimensional/stepwise should be quantifiable by principal component analysis
            - The idea here reminds me of an exchange I had in visualization of bio-data when I was a PhD student: "No, I'm observing this in 2 dimensions with PCA, but the contribution ratio is not much different in 8 dimensions, and looking at it in 2 dimensions is throwing away 3/4 information.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
