    - [[(1.4.4) Model / View / Controller#5c45707aaff09e00002f06cf]]
    - When programmers think about a program, they tend to focus on view and controller.
    - Because it is easy to observe.

    - The "model" is independent to the appearance of program and how user manipulate it.
    - The "model" holds information needed for the program to work.
