title: "Make the problem small."
---

Divide the problem into smaller subproblems

- Can be recurrently split if the split problem has the same structure
    - Crush it down to a small enough obvious problem.
    - quick sort
- Split problems are in different forms but can be solved independently of each other.
    - square partitioning
- There's a dependency on the split issue, but it's a DAG.
    - The minimal source when the DAG is viewed as a semi-ordered relation can be solved without dependence
    - dynamic programming
    - mathematical induction
