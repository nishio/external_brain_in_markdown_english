>  Issue ERC20 tokens "[[HACK Token]]" or [[proof of contribution NFT]] to make your [[contribution]] to civic tech and open source visible.

I'm fully aware that it's not going to be money when I receive it, and I'm not sure what it would be like if I received it.
- As a result of the experience, I felt [[happy]] to receive
    - [[gratitude]] Just like it makes me happy to be appreciated.
- This moment is not much different than a "thank you" from a DM.
- Maybe there will be another experience when it all piles up and goes.

- [[Designs that elicit contributions]]
- [[DAO and Co.]]
