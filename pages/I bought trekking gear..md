- I didn't have any equipment, so I went to Montbell and asked the staff to get me a set.
- I put it all together because I figured the next time I buy something new or something, I'd be like, "I don't know what I already have."

# shoes
- Mountain Cruiser 600 wide 25cm
    - 600 seems to be a number related to the thickness of the sole.
    - In this course, it seems that the heavier the load is, the thicker the sole should be, like 400 or 600.
        - When I googled for shoe recommendations online, it said something about high cut (high ankle card) shoes, but Montbell never had anything that wasn't high cut in the first place!

# Hat.
- I thought it was subtle whether I needed it or not, but there was a cushion in it and it was fun, so I bought it.
- I don't have enough cushion because I don't have a head of hair.

We have backpacks [[Ortlieb]], so that's what we'll use.
