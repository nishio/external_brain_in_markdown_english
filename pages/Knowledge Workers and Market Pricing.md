title: "Knowledge Workers and Market Pricing"
---

- Express the skill level of [[knowledge worker]] as an n-dimensional non-negative real number (for simplicity, you may start with one dimension).

- Distribution of skill levels of goods (= [[knowledge worker]]) in the market
    - Generally not uniformly distributed
- Distribution of skill levels required by buyers in the market
    - Generally not uniformly distributed
- Assume that the quantity of goods satisfying the required skill level is inversely proportional to the price
    - In reality, buyers compete with each other in an auction-like manner to determine the utility that the buyer can obtain from the commodity, subject to other constraints, but the model is too complex to approximate.


- For example, if there are many "jobs in the market" where "around 30 skills are enough" and "jobs requiring 90+ skills", the graph of skills and compensation should look like the graph in [A model where only the top players in the market get utility.
- Only the right end of the graph would be higher if "only the top people are hired."

- And by trying to draw a graph like this, you've implicitly assumed that the skill level is one-dimensional.
    - Actually n-dimensional, with requirement levels set in multiple dimensions
    - Then the phenomenon of "not the top on any axis, but highly regarded" can be expressed.

        - There is a [[trade-off]] relationship between skills due to the finite amount of time required to acquire them. On the graph, this is expressed in the form of [[constraint]], i.e., skill1 + skill2 is less than or equal to a certain value.

    - Aiming to maximize each skill leads to a red ocean
    - Surprisingly unfocused with respect to mixing multiple skills.
        - When the dimension is high, contrary to intuition, the mixed region is wide ([[Curse of the dimension]]).
        - When N dimensions are N, there are N regions that are top for each axis, but N(N - 1)/2 regions that are top for the combination of two axes. mixed regions are more numerous when N is 4 or more dimensions.
