- [[Dori Nishigaki]] proposed an academic discipline called "[[Fundamental Informatics]]" and developed an approach that broadly views information not as mere data but as "meaning-associated entities. Its main features are as follows.

- Emphasis on [semantic generation
    - Conventional information theory has tended to view information as "information = symbols and data," but Nishigaki's fundamental question is, "How is meaning created in this information? He believes that the subject interpreting the information and the socio-cultural context are indispensable.

- An Interdisciplinary Approach
    - The course explores how information works in humans and society, crossing not only information science but also philosophy, cognitive science, linguistics, and sociology. We also emphasize communication and physicality associated with information.

- Introduction of [[self-organization]] and [autopoiesis
    - Referring to biology and systems theory (e.g., autopoiesis theory), we attempted to elucidate the self-organizing nature of information systems and the process by which meaning emerges from them.

- Social and cultural connections
    - It discusses the mechanisms by which humans exchange information with each other, collective knowledge, and creativity in the context of the Internet society and the changing media environment. It is characterized by a broad perspective that includes not only technology but also issues of values and ethics.

In general, Nishigaki's basic informatics is an academic attempt to extend the conventional engineering and physical concept of information by deeply questioning "what information is" and "how the relationship between information, humans, and society is established.

In Nishigaki's basic informatics, information is broadly classified into "life information," "social information," and "machine information," and each is considered to be interrelated with the other. Below is a brief overview and explanation of their interrelationships.

- [[life info]].
    - Description: Information handled by an organism in the process of maintaining itself and adapting to the outside world, such as genes and neural activity.
    - Characteristics: Self-organization and autopoiesis (self-generation and maintenance of autonomous systems) are fundamentally involved. The dynamic process by which life emerges meaning through interaction with the external world is noteworthy.

- [[SOCIAL INFORMATION]].
    - Description: Information shared by human society, such as language, culture, social institutions, and communication norms.
    - Characteristics: Living human beings exchange information with each other using linguistic and cultural backgrounds for mutual understanding and transformation. It includes hierarchical and multi-layered communication from individual cognition to collective knowledge.

- [[MACHINE INFO]].
    - Description: Information processed by artificial systems such as computers and communication devices.
    - Characteristics: Represented in physically and engineering tractable forms, such as bit strings and signals. Although it is mainly symbolic processing rather than semantic, it is inseparable from meaning-making for humans.

Relationship between the three parties
- Life Information → Social Information
    - The biological basis of the human body and brain (life information) makes communication and culture (social information) possible.
- Social Information → Machine Information
    - The language and symbols created in social contexts are captured by machines and used as digital data; the development of IT technology proceeds in response to the demands of society.
- Mechanical Information → Life Information and Social Information
    - Through AI and information technology, human thought and behavior (life and social activities) are changing. Mechanical methods may lead to new information generation and behavior patterns.

Nishigaki's basic informatics sees these three layers as mutually influencing each other and supporting the process of generating, communicating, and transforming the "meaning" of information in our world.
