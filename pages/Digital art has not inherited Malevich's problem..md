from  [[Toward Relative Art & Technology]]
Digital art has not inherited Malevich's problem.
The claim that "digital art does not inherit Malevich's problem" and the viewpoint that "[[it]] can create reality" can be interpreted as follows. This can be considered an attempt to explain the nature of digital art and its uniqueness through its difference from the problem setting of Kazimir Malevich's Suprematism.

1. what is Malevich's problem?
Malevich's Suprematism, centered on **"Black Square" (1915)**, aimed to free art from the "material world" and "reproduction (imitation)" and to reach a spiritual dimension through the use of pure form and color.
It was important to him that "art not imitate reality, but express abstract and absolute sensations and spirituality.
This approach was an attempt to dismantle the traditional artistic framework and positioned "moving away from the reproduction of reality" as an artistic innovation.

2. features of digital art
Digital art uses computational technology and programming to construct new forms of "reality" that transcend physical constraints.
Through the use of digital technology, such as generative art and interactive art, we express dynamic and changing processes and phenomena themselves, rather than fixed works of art.
Distinctive points:
Dynamic Generation:.
Digital art is "generated" by algorithms and programs. This creates a dynamic, ever-changing reality as opposed to a fixed "finished product.
Audience interaction:.
Digital art with interactive elements changes with the actions and inputs of the audience, forming a new reality.
Virtual Reality Construction:.
Through virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), we create a new sense of reality that does not exist in the physical world.

3. the difference between digital art and Malevich
(1) Different attitudes toward "reality
Malevich:.
Denying physical reality, he pursues abstraction and spirituality.
He believed that art should "liberate" itself from reality rather than imitate it.
Digital Art:.
Rather than deny physical reality, focus on complementing it, extending it, or generating an entirely new reality.
To "create reality" means to provide new sensations and presence through digital technology.
(2) Differences in generative processes
Malevich:.
He pursues a universal spirituality through static works (e.g., black squares).
Digital Art:.
Dynamically "generating" new realities through dynamic, process-oriented works.
(3) Role of Technology
Malevich:.
No particular emphasis is placed on techniques or tools, relying instead on abstract concepts and manual labor.
Digital Art:.
The technology itself (algorithms, programming, sensors, etc.) is the central element of the work.

4. what does "[[creating]] reality" mean?
(1) Redefinition of reality
Digital art creates virtual spaces and interactive environments that transcend physical reality. In this way, "reality" is not limited to the physical, but is extended into the realm of subjective and dynamic experience.
(2) Co-creation with the audience
As the audience interacts with the artwork, its "reality" takes on a different form for each visitor. This is a dynamic feature not found in fixed artworks.
(3) Creation of digital presence
Virtual reality and AI generative art create "[[new realities]]" in digital space that do not physically exist. In this way, art serves to create a "new reality" rather than imitate reality itself.

5. conclusion
The assertion that "digital art has not inherited Malevich's problem" emphasizes the point that digital art does not simply seek to "free itself from reality," but rather utilizes technology to dynamically generate a new reality. In this way, digital art opens up a new realm of expression that transcends the boundaries of physical reality and abstract spirituality.
