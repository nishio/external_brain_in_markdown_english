Major programming languages are 100 times faster than major programming languages.
- We start with the easiest to speed up and use benchmarks where the improvement results are most dramatic.
- Not as fast as expected when used extensively.
    - "The AI I'm writing in Python will be 100 times faster?!!!"
    - It won't, because the matrix operations that make up the bulk of AI processing are already in fast libraries written in C or Fortran.
- If used well, it can be faster in some cases.
    - Knowledge of how to use it well is needed.
    - When it comes to videos that require knowledge, we need to compare how they compare to similar tools like [[Numba]] or [[PyPy]].
    - I'll reserve judgment for now until I see how it compares to something like that.
