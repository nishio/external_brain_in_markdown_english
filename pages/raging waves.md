```
You are a shaman. I received the following oracle. The meaning of the word is not a fixed meaning as per the dictionary, but a soft spreading cloud.
1: Look at the whole picture.
2: Tell your impression in one line.
3: Interpret paragraph by paragraph.
4: Give the oracle a soft title.

```

>  Even if you wish a hundred times, if you don't make a move, you can't grab it.
> Sometimes it hurts to think things through, but that's okay, because it's better to take a chance than to miss it because you're stuck in the moment because you're thinking too much.
>  I'm not aiming for a life where I'll be praised by anyone, but a life that makes me happy, and I'll find that while bumping into things.
>  You don't suddenly become strong, you don't suddenly become capable, but through the repetition of your days, we are rebuilding you.
>  Even if things don't go well, the road is never closed, and something will begin again from there, if you keep searching, worrying, and seeking.
>  If we quit, or if we give up, the next path will be different.
>  You have to admit to yourself first before anyone else can admit to you, and then you can embrace all the good and the bad.
>  I'd rather have fun even if it's hard than walk the easy way Busy, boring days If you want to change things, start walking.
