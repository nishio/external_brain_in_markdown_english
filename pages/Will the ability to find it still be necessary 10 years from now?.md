title: "Will the ability to find it still be necessary 10 years from now?"

- [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]]  p.20

- Is [[the power to find]] still needed 10 years from now?
- When paper books were the primary source of information, it was important to know where in the book to find what you were looking for.
    - [[search (e.g. for someone using a search engine)]] As technology has advanced, the cost of finding what you need in electronic information has dropped dramatically.
- In addition, the emergence of web services (Note 1) that allow users to post issues they want to solve and other users to post their solutions has made it possible to find solutions to specific programming issues with a fairly high probability of success when searching for them.
- Advances in technology bring [[the cost of information collection]] down. Most of the books and articles I refer to in this book have been digitized and can be searched electronically from PCs and tablet devices. New [[information gathering]] methods such as "search in English and visit question-and-answer websites" have also been created.
- In the days of paper books, the ability to [[Get the big picture]] and think, "[[It should be]] around here somewhere..." was very important, and I'm not sure that will still be the case 10 years from now.
- However, since "search" is a technique for finding "What Someone Else Has Experienced and Written", you won't find an answer for [What no one has experienced yet. As the cost of gathering information on "What Someone Else Has Experienced" becomes cheaper and cheaper, people will be able to get through it faster, and more people will work on "What no one has experienced yet.

- Note 1 As of 2018, I specifically envision Stack Overflow in English-speaking countries. So I also envision "search" as an English-language search.
