title: "Different people prefer different output formats, but it's a matter of familiarity"
---

- Many Homo sapiens prefer [[one-dimensional]] [output format
        - [[Voice interaction]] is due to the fact that it is
    - Because that's what we've always done.
    - experience
- Bulleted discussions on Scrapbox are tree-like with each line written by a different person
        - Similar to co-editing [[mind-map]].
    - There are those who think this tree-like output is possible and those who think it's a mess.
        - In the end, it's a matter of getting used to it.
    - Some people use [[schematic]] or single-panel cartoons.
    - Often it is easier to draw than to explain in words.
    - Avoid this output format if you are uncomfortable drawing.
- Formalities are constraints
    - When writing a normal sentence, the constraint of "the sentences before and after are connected" is included.
        - I'm loosening the restriction that the bullet points don't have to be connected at the time of dedent.
        - The circular page adds the restriction that the end of the page must be connected to the beginning of the page.
    - Some people are more literate with restrictions and some are more literate without.
        - Easier to read with and easier to write without.
        - The degree of "ease" of doing so depends on familiarity.
