title: "Deleuze's Theory of the Subject"

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3-mini-high/icon' alt='o3-mini-high.icon' height="19.5"/> In [[Deleuze.]]'s own work, the term so-called "[offshoot (plants; often the of grass family)" does not appear explicitly. Rather, he argues against the traditional fixed "[[individual]]" concept, arguing that the subject does not have a fixed [[identity]], but a "[[multiplicity]]" that is always generated in [[diverse relationships]] and [[networks of differences]].

For example, in "[[A Thousand Plateaux]]" (Gilles Deleuze & Félix Guattari, Mille Plateaux), the following ideas about the subject are suggested.

> « Le sujet n'est pas stable, mais une multiplicité en devenir. »
> ([[core]] is not a stable entity, but a [[multiplicity]] that is [[constantly changing and being generated]].
- [[Subject is a multiplex]]
- **This quote reflects the main idea of Deleuze and Guattari's discussion of the fluidity and multiplicity of the subject, which is expressed differently in each edition and translation.

This description is a reference to Deleuze's position that the subject is a [[process]] that is constantly being generated and transformed in multiple relationships, as opposed to the conventional, unitary image of the "individual."
- [[The subject is the process]].

Note that the term "alter ego" itself is a concept that was later used by Japanese researchers (e.g., [[Keiichiro]] Hirano) in interpreting and translating Deleuze's [[Theory of the Subject]].
