[70% of working doctors in favor of removing insurance coverage for OTC-like drugs such as cold remedies, while practitioners are reluctant to do so - Nikkei [https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUA107IK0Q5A710C2000000/?n_cid=SNSTW001&n_tw=1753809255](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUA107IK0Q5A710C2000000/?n_cid=SNSTW001&n_tw=1753809255) ]
- > The study found that 62% of physicians are in favor of excluding "OTC-like drugs," which are similar in ingredients and effects to over-the-counter drugs, from insurance coverage. Patients only have to pay 10-30% of the cost if they visit a doctor and get a prescription, but this increases the expenditure of public funds and insurance premiums. There is strong concern that hospital visits to obtain cold medicine, compresses, etc. are becoming a burden on medical costs.
