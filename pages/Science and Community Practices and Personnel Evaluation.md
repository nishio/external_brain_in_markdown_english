- [[science]] and [[community practices]] and [[personnel evaluations]].

It is "[[They put it in a jar and mix it up]]" to include in the term "science" "the practices in a given scientific community" or "the system of evaluation of researchers in an organization."

> Takase: Originally, science had [[patrons]] such as the [[Medici]] family, and scientists would send letters to them to present their work. They would say that their research would be useful for the technology that the patrons had, and so on.
>  Kano: The patron's viewpoint was to buy his own [[honor]] (Peter Dear, "Revolution of Knowledge and Experience" (Misuzu Shobo, 2012))... On the other hand, standing in a role that is not honorable is conducive to [[economy]].... The big question arises whether the value of science is really just "honor" and "[[money]]," or whether those are the only two things.
