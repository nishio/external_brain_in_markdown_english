title: "counterintuitive phenomenon"

> [@kis](https://twitter.com/kis/status/1690677429134860288): a story about losing money against your intuition if you repeat a game where you get 50% if the coin rolls over and 40% is taken if the coin rolls over.
> Even if 50% is increased, the increase at that point is 1/3 of the total, so it will be much less if 40% is taken out since 33% can be made back.
