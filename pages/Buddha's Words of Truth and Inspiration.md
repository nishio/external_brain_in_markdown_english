    - [[Hajime Nakamura]]
- Buddha's [[words of truth]] [[words of inspiration]].
- > Both the "Words of Truth" ([[Dhammapada]]), known as the Dhammapada Sutra, and the "Words of Inspiration" ([[Udhana Varga]]) are collections of Buddha's teachings, expressing in stately and concise phrases his profound reflections on humanity itself and his guidelines for life. Udhana Varga" means a collection of words that Buddha uttered in a moment of inspiration, and this is the first complete translation.

Chapter 9 "Evil" is good<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

> 133 [[Rough language will cause the person being used to talk back]]. [[angry words are painful]] and you will get your comeuppance.
    - [[strong language]]

- [[den of disease]]
- [[incorruptible mass]]

> 159 [[Do unto others as you would have them do unto you]]. He who has well adjusted himself will be able to adjust others. The self is indeed difficult to control.
- > 158 [[First set yourself right, then teach others]]...
- > 19 Even though he speaks many things that are beneficial, if he does not do them, he is negligent. Just as a cowherd counts the cows of others. He is not a practitioner.
>  51 Just as there are flowers that bloom in splendor and beauty but have no fragrance, so too there are words that are well preached but bear no fruit for those who do not practice them.
- > 100 [[It is better to hear one useful word that calms the mind than to hear a thousand useless words]].


>  21 To work hard is the state of immortality. To be slothful is the state of death...
- > 50 Don't look at what others have done and not done. Don't look at what others did and didn't do. Look only at what you did and did not do.
    - If others don't do what you think they should do, don't look at them...<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - It means don't worry about others and move on.
    - > 28 When a wise man, through diligent practice, shuns idleness, he ascends to the lofty pinnacle of wisdom and looks down on (other) sorrowful fools, without sorrow of his own. Just as a person on a mountain looks down on people on the ground.
    - > 29 Among those who are idle and lazy, one is diligent; among those who are asleep, one is awake and thoughtful, like a galloping horse that overtakes the hind horse.
    - > 31 The practicing monk, who enjoys busyness and fears dissipation, walks with all the cares of the heart, whether small or great, burning them up. Like a burning fire.
- > 112 It is better to live a day in firmness and diligence, than to live a hundred years in idleness and laziness, without energy.

> 166 Do not forsake your own service for the sake of others, no matter how important it may be to them. Know your own purpose well and devote yourself to your own service (profit).
- Nakamura translates both of the two different words as "my duty. Nadala translates the latter as "benefit.
- I'm more comfortable with "profit".
    - [[Know your purpose well and devote yourself to your interests.]]

[[One is the way to gain, one is the way to peace.]]
>  75 One is the way to gain, the other is the way to peace. The practicing monks who are disciples of Buddha know this truth and do not rejoice in glory. Strive for the state of solitude.
- One is the path that leads to [[gain]], and one is the path that leads to [peace of mind


>  73 The foolish will hope to gain [[vain respect]] that is not really deserved. ...

>  60 The night is long for those who cannot sleep, and the road of a mile* is far for those who are weary. The road of life and death is long for those who are foolish and do not know the right truth.
- The night is long for those who cannot sleep, and the road is far for those who are weary. To the foolish, life is long.
    - Some might think, "Life is long, but the suffering is long.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I associate it with "[[long is good]]."

> 49 The bees do not harm the fragrance (of the flowers), but take the juice and fly away from the flowers. When the saint goes to the village, do so.

> 160 The self is its own master.

> If you do evil, you are defiled; if you do not do evil, you are purified. What is pure and what is not pure are each one's own things. [[One cannot purify another.]]

> 167 ... Don't live lazy and fluffy...
- Sssh, I'm sorry!<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
