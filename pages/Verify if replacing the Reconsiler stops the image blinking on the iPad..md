title: "Verify if replacing the Reconsiler stops the image blinking on the iPad."
---

from [[pRegroup-done-2019]]
Verified if it is possible to replace [[Reconciler]] to prevent images from blinking on iPad.
- I'm planning to do it because I think I can, but if I can't, there's no point in doing it.
- It is expensive to modify the entire large software to be error-free, so a small one is created and checked by extracting only the necessary parts.
- →Found that it doesn't blink.
