title: "Books are already a product of abstraction"

If I come up with a good title, I'll change it.
    - [[book]] is already an [abstraction product
- Homo sapiens, with its limited cognitive abilities, took in [[concrete experience]], abstraction it internally, and then reconstructed it as output.
- If you put yourself in the shoes of a program that has a memory more plentiful and reliable than the temporary memory of Homo sapiens, you will feel like "don't do preprocessing with a poor memory, but output raw data.
    - The difference is whether you want the digital camera to compress JPEGs, or whether you want the sensed values from the image sensor to be raw, as they will later be developed by a high-performance computer.
        - [[RAW image]]: [RAW image - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAW%E7%94%BB%E5%83%8F)
    - Books written by Homo sapiens for a Homo sapiens audience are like digital cameras with floppy disks as storage.

- Discussions of the merits of Scrapbox include opinions such as "[[Media that cannot be linked to]] requires [[explaining the same thing over and over]] and the information is less dense.
    - Paper books are "unlinkable media."
    - Related: [/shokai/media that resets memory every time](https://scrapbox.io/shokai/media that resets memory every time) #Media that resets memory every time
- The format of "a few hundred pages of paper in bulk" is strongly influenced by the convenience of physical distribution.
        - [[Legacy format of books]]

On the other hand, you can't apply it without abstraction, what do you do about the problem there?
    - [[We don't let homo sapiens abstract us.]]
