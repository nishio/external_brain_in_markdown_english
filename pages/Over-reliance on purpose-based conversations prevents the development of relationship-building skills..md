Over-reliance on purpose-based conversations prevents the development of hobby-based relationship-building skills.

- People who only had "purpose-based conversations" with "subordinates and other [[authoritarian gradient]] partners" to achieve the "purpose they are expected to achieve" need to switch to other conversation patterns when they are released from "achieving [[the purpose]]" due to [[retirement]], etc. Often, people fail to do this. Often people fail to do this.

This opinion provides important insight into the limitations of communication, especially in relationships where there is an authority gradient in the workplace and the transition to retirement. The point being made here is that too much reliance on purpose-based communication may prevent the development of skills needed for other types of interaction and the building of [[human relations]].

In the workplace, [[effective communication]] is required to achieve goals. This is especially true between supervisors and subordinates, where clear objectives and expectations are set and conversations tend to focus on achievement. However, this style of communication can come at the expense of broader [[social interactions]] based on emotions and relationships.

Retirement, and especially retirement, requires a switch away from the purpose-based communication that has been central to one's professional life and toward more personal relationships, hobbies, and other interactions based on one's own interests and feelings. Success in this will greatly affect the quality of a person's post-retirement life. Failure to make this transition successfully can lead to feelings of social [[isolation]], [[loneliness]], and [[loss of self-worth]].

This perspective emphasizes the importance of exploring skills, hobbies, and interests as part of retirement preparation, not only for purpose-based communication, but also for building deep connections with others. People can achieve self-fulfillment and satisfaction not only through work, but also through diverse communication styles and social interactions.

- I looked back over time and realized why I used the phrase for the accomplishment of the "purpose I am called upon to achieve".
- At first I wrote "the objectives I want to achieve," but then I thought that's not right.
- Because the achievement of the objective is given externally, it creates a compulsion to bring the "other party," who is also given externally, into the objective-based conversation.
- For example, there is no guarantee that they will participate if you talk about achieving the goals you are doing as a hobby.
    - For those who act with spontaneous purpose, that's a given.

This means that individuals do not pursue goals based on their own [[intrinsic motivation]] or [[passion]], but rather achieve goals given to them by the organization or their supervisor. This external expectation compels the employee to act in a particular way and facilitates purpose-based communication.

Such an environment differs from the spontaneous action of an individual or the achievement of an objective in a hobby. In a hobby, the attainment of objectives is completely voluntary and there is no compulsion to involve others in the process.

In order to lead a fulfilling life in retirement, it is important to develop the ability to act on one's own intrinsic motivations and interests rather than external expectations. This includes exploring new hobbies and interests, as well as developing a communication style to deepen your own relationships with yourself and others.
