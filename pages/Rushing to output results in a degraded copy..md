title: "Rushing to output results in a degraded copy."
---

- I listened to Mr. Shiozawa's Civil Law II class and didn't really want to put together a Scrapbox about Civil Law.
    - It's interesting to rethink why I didn't want to put it together.

- Immediate output of new input will only result in [inferior copy
    - You have to [[abstraction]] within yourself.
    - We need to wait for time to [[be well-spoken]].
    - What does it mean for a word to be ripe?
        - Combining with other inputs and your own experience

    - When you listen to a lecture on [[Unfamiliar territory]] and have a large amount of information input, outputting it without time to [[chewing]] is to make a degraded copy, which is not very valuable work.
    - Of course, there is an effect of improving the retention of knowledge within individuals by trying to summarize, but this is independent of whether or not they publish what they have summarized (there are some people for whom publication is an incentive).
