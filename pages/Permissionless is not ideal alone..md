title: "Permissionless is not ideal alone."
---

    - [[permissionless]] is not the ideal state of affairs.
- Being permissionless is basically no better than being permissionful
    - So the current society is full of permission-full structures.
        - Structure of using [[SOC]] called [[trust]] for the subject
    - However, with good [[mechanism design]], better results can be achieved even without permissions
- This "with good mechanism design" is a [[requirement]], so if we [[abstraction]] there and say "permissionless is good" [[wrong abstraction]].
