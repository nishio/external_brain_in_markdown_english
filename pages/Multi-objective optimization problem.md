title: "Multi-objective optimization problem"
---

- [[optimization problem]] for which the [[objective function]] is not a single one.
The value range of the objective function can also be expressed as a vector rather than a scalar.
There is no obvious [universal sequential
- [[Pareto]] Superiority becomes [semi-sequential (e.g. equations)
- [[GA]], an approach can be used to determine the degree of adaptation using Pareto dominance relationships among solutions
