    - > He met with three high-ranking government officials, Okuma, Hirobumi Ito, and Kaoru Inoue, at the residence of Shigenobu Okuma, and was asked to publish a gazette newspaper.
    - >  "It is meaningless for a newspaper to merely make the public aware of the true intentions of the government," he thought, and decided to decline... However, when Inoue said, "The government has made up its mind to open the Diet," Fukuzawa was delighted with his wise decision and accepted to publish the newspaper.
    - >  However, Okuma Shigenobu submitted his own proposal for a British-style party cabinet system, which was considered too radical at the time, without prior consultation with Ito, and Ito became wary of Okuma's radical tendencies.... It created an atmosphere in which government officials believed the rumors of a conspiracy between Okuma, Fukuzawa, and Keio University to be true... In 1881, the political upheaval of 1881, which led to the resignation of the Okuma faction from government positions, occurred.
- 47 years old.
    - > After deepening his friendship with [[Kim Ok-yun]] and his comrade Park Young-hyo, Yukichi developed a strong interest in Korean affairs. In Yukichi's view, Japan's military was not for the benefit of Japan alone, but to protect the Oriental nations from Western aggression. To this end, he believed that Japan needed to lead the modernization and reform of Korea by eliminating Qing influence in Korea, and he became the most strident advocate of war against Qing in Japan.

    - [[Use easy-to-understand sentences.]]

> In the "Encouragement of Learning," Confucius' time was 2000 years ago in the age of barbarism, and the only way to maintain the public mind under heaven was the path of right and wrong, but those who study Confucius in later generations should take the times into consideration and make their own choices. Those who try to apply what was taught 2000 years ago to the present are criticized as people who do not understand the market price of things. He also argued that this is possible only because they refute the theories established by the ancients and question the customs of the world.
