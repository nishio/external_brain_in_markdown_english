title: "Why not specify the purpose of each page of the AI note?"
---

from  [[Diary 2023-09-01]]
Explicit [[Objective.]] on every page of the AI Notebook
I was thinking of having the AI clearly state the purpose of each page.
    - [[Project pages must be reworked periodically.]]
    - Isn't it because the project is not fixed in nature [[and changes over time]] [[flow]]?
        - I think [[Page as a fluid process]] and project pages are a good match.
