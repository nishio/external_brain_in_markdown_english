> I think it is important to listen carefully to people who are taking a [[risk]] to speak, no matter what their opinion is. Conversely, if you want the people around you to listen to you, it is [[advantageous]] to take a risk and speak up. In this day and age, that means [[showing one's face]] [[real name]].
