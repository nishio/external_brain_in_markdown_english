[[Multiplier management]] and [[count-up management]].

> [fukkyy](https://x.com/fukkyy/status/1821371235340607955) I realized yesterday the obvious fact that there is [[multiply]] management and [[count up]] management, and if you are a corporate sales company, you should do the latter. It was a good suggestion.

> [fukkyy](https://x.com/fukkyy/status/1821372488527348145) Supplement. How to raise the order rate by 1% ppt? is the management of the multiplier. How to increase the number of orders by one more? is count-up management. [The former is fine for [[business plan]], but the latter for [[daily management]]. The action to get one more order comes to mind because I can think of a specific action to take.
[[Rates and Quantities]]
[The point is that we need to change to [[thinking in terms of quantity]], because it is difficult to do this if we are still [[thinking in terms of rate]].
