Here, Brahman (sometimes translated as universe or heaven) appears and explains to Siddhartha the relationship between the universe and life.

Key Points of Explanation
- [Oneness of the Universe: This scene explains that "the universe is a great life, from which all bits of life are born, breathing life into everything in this world. This is similar to the concept of [[origin]] in Buddhist teachings, which presents the perspective that all beings are interdependent.
- [Formless life: A further explanation is that life has no form and is not bound by time or space. This reflects the Buddhist teaching of [[impermanence]] and the perspective that [[everything is]] always changing.
- [[Universal equality]]: The statement, "Whether insects, elephants, humans, or flowers, we are all originally part of the same group," illustrates the Buddhist view that all life is equal. This is also an important teaching for cultivating [[compassion]].
- Hint for Awakening: In the end, the advice to Siddhartha is given, "Think about what you have seen. Then you will be enlightened and your troubles will disappear. This is consistent with the Buddhist practice of finding truth through [[introspection]] and [[meditation]].

This scene depicts the mystical unity of the universe and life and encourages viewers to deepen their understanding of the Buddhist view of the universe and life. Through his creations, Tezuka Osamu explores these profound philosophical and religious themes and communicates them to a wide audience.
