title: "Rewards are multidimensional"

Q: Isn't it [[healthy]] to [[toil]] for [[free]]?

A:
Better to have "[[reward]] yes" than "[[zero reward]] no," but on a case-by-case basis as to what kind of reward that reward should be.
- The reward is [[pluralism]], and [[cash]] is just one axis within that.
- What is of value among these many axes ultimately comes down to the subjective [[values]] of each individual.
- [The greatest reward for a job is the next job opportunity (1/3 page) - ITmedia Business Online](https://www.itmedia.co.jp/makoto/articles/1106/08/news012.html)
    - I remembered it with the vibe of "[[the reward for success is]] the opportunity for the next success," but I couldn't find anything applicable, this article is just about as close as I could get.
