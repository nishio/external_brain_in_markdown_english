Translation.
- [/plurality-japanese/1: Introduction: "Finding Plural"](https://scrapbox.io/plurality-japanese/1: Introduction: "Finding Plural").
- [/plurality-japanese/2: Information Technology and Democracy: The Widening Divide](https://scrapbox.io/plurality-japanese/2: Information Technology and Democracy: The Widening Divide).

Well, I "read a book while taking reading notes a little more solidly" and a translation draft is produced.
