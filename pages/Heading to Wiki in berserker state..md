title: "Heading to Wiki in berserker state."
---

from  [[Throw the ball back.]]
Go to [[Wiki]] in [[Berserker]] state.

PS
- If you face your personal wiki in that state, you'll get a lot of pages.
- The brain [[spins]] and [[derailment]] at high speed
- Wiki has that [[tolerance for derailment]].
- Trying to organize and write on one page makes it less coherent.
- You can make a small page with [[flying associations]] as you come up with them, and then connect them.
- If you write it all on one page in a coherent manner, you can cut it up.
