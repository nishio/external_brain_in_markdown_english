The cable for charging my iPhone was not in my PC bag, nor in the cable compartment, and I thought I had forgotten it, but it was in another handbag.

You say, "You tell me to put everything in one place, but why not have a special place for the things I use most often?" Before you start talking back, you should first think of putting things in one place as a training exercise to get into the habit of putting things back where you used them. After you are able to do that, it's just a matter of sorting them into "frequently used X" and "other X". The most frequently used ones are the ones that are trained the most frequently. Making exceptions for the most frequently used ones is a huge waste of training opportunities.
