title: 'Reading" in an era with LLM'

Reading" in an era where [[LLM]].
- It is common in the world to say "read" only to [[look through]] in a one-dimensional way
- I've been trying to get [[emulator]] for a very limited number of authors by doing more time-consuming readings.
    - Unclear what an emulator is
    - I think one aspect is [[the Knowledge Network]].
    - Networks that can be traced as needed, not in the order in which they are written in the books.
- This is something we don't do that often.
    - [["more time-consuming reading"]] is expensive.

The presence of Scrapbox has allowed part of this process to proceed in a public state.
- profitable sign
- You are not alone in the process.
- People who already have a knowledge network can give me feedback on what they associate with my articles.
- one's size (as opposed to one's size in general)
    - Often short and difficult to do.
        - Because it's cost-effective.
        - In this case, the fragments are too small to be suitable for Scrapbox
            - It's in the form of [[Kozaneba Reading]].

There are signs of further progress when combined with LLMs.
- The judgment of "I think there is a connection" or "There is a connection here" used to be made by the brain of a living person.
- When I think, "This fragment seems useful," I can do a vector search on that fragment, and I think I can make better "[[Discovering Relationships]]" than I have done so far.
- It would be beneficial to have the LLM ask questions about what you wrote.
