Visualizing Solidarity

> [minowanowa](https://x.com/minowanowa/status/1806668330893258884) I'm kind of sad. I support Renho, but she's ignoring me. I wonder what solidarity and diversity those people have.

> [lovinson03](https://x.com/lovinson03/status/1806985610940633547) What are you talking about?

> [renho_sha](https://x.com/renho_sha/status/1806841829989716472) I am honestly happy.
>  I will never ignore it.
>  Thank you so much for your support.
>
>  I will be the governor who shines the light on everyone.

> [tabbata](https://x.com/tabbata/status/1806851980557742424) Only Mr. Minowa is cheating!

> [renho_sha](https://x.com/renho_sha/status/1807038743356043332) Tabata-san.
>
>  Sorry for the delay.
>  I was very happy to see Tabata-san's Tweet of support for me.
>
>  To live up to great expectations, I want to work with results in this election!


> [tabbata](https://x.com/tabbata/status/1807040871361294535) Thank you Renho! In order to support the child-rearing generation, I would very much like to request that the vested rights of the elderly who live in uselessly spacious metropolitan housing in the city center be revoked and evicted, and that they be redistributed to the younger child-rearing generation! Metropolitan housing is the property of the people of Tokyo! Please make the most effective use of it!

>  More fun for the Governor's race...

> [tabbata](https://x.com/tabbata/status/1806908781911273796) Renho-san! If your level of intelligence is such that you seriously believe that the trees in Jingu Gaien will affect climate change, I wanted to withdraw my support for Renho-san!
>  >[renho_sha](https://x.com/renho_sha/status/1806908781911273796) My new suggestion.
>  The voice of the people of Tokyo will be heard in the "Metropolitan referendum.
>
>  Jingu Gaien Development.
>  At a time when climate change is the world's biggest challenge, do you want to proceed with the development of Tokyo, a city where trees grown over 100 years are cut down and open squares are turned into buildings? And.
>
>  If I am elected governor, I will propose an ordinance with that "will of the people".

> [miya_3_chillout](https://x.com/miya_3_chillout/status/1807062660611231857) Tabata-san is really good at sending out SNS messages.
>  Post with a goal in mind, working backwards and in sequence, involving both support and criticism.
>  And criticism is better in X. It is a good study.

> [tabbata](https://x.com/tabbata/status/1807178581426249803) I'm just making a serious policy suggestion!
>  >Chem_sales_eng: I'm going to stab you in the back with a supportive face. x.com/tabbata/status...

Too interesting.
I see a visualization of "what solidarity is."
