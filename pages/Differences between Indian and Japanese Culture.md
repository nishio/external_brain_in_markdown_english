rough conclusion
- Indian side: The culture is to observe "harmony" and to settle the situation without saying "no." Even if the result is not true, there is little sense of "malicious lying. Even if the results are not true, there is little sense of "malicious lying.
- Japanese side: Extremely averse to "uncertainty" and emphasizes "consistency between promises and facts. Any discrepancy is easily taken as "[[betrayal of trust]]=[[lie]].
- Roots of conflict:
    - (1) [[Resistance to uncertainty]] (UAI) Difference
    - (2) Difference in the way of "[[Face maintenance]]".
    - (iii) The difference between how much you value [[verbal assurance]].

1. read and understand with background theory

- [[Hofstede]] Uncertainty avoidance
    - India: 40 (low to medium) "more resourceful than detailed rules" ([India [https://incredible-india-cayla.weebly.com/hofstedes-cultural-dimensions.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com](https://incredible-india-cayla.weebly.com/hofstedes-cultural-dimensions.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com) ])
    - Japan: 92 (one of the highest in the world) "Crush the risks first" ([Penn State Sites](https://sites.psu.edu/global/2018/10/28/uncertainty-avoidance-and-the-japanese/))
- Face to be preserved.
    - India: Interpersonal harmony
        - No" is rude → avoid with distant/positive expressions ([commisceo-global.com](https://www.commisceo-global.com/blog/why-do-indians-nod-their-head-when-speaking))
    - Japan: Ability to fulfill commitments
        - Business numbers and deadlines are strictly adhered to, despite differences inside and outside the company.
- communication style
    - India: high context + hierarchical consciousness
        - Indirect speech that is often used to help the boss or the other party ([Global Business Culture](https://www.globalbusinessculture.com/cultural-awareness/radical-candor-in-india/)).
    - Japan: High context, but prefers explicit confirmation in numbers, specifications, and deadlines

How will the misalignment be created?
1. "Yes" does not always mean "I understand.
    - In India, positive reactions tend to be given first, with a hint of "I'll consider it/probably okay".
    - The Japanese side would interpret this as a commitment.
2. the goalposts move
    - Even if conditions change during the process, a "first explore the possibilities" attitude is natural on the Indian side.
    - On the other hand, the Japanese side is apt to feel "betrayal" if they change the specifications in the middle of the process once they have been decided.
3. discrepancy between intent and evaluation axis
    - Indian side: "I was just trying to please them."
    - Japan: "If it is not true, it is false. We cannot trust them."

2. psychological and ethical differences
- Axis of Moral Judgment
    - Recent experiments have shown that even in collectivist cultures, there is a strong tendency to evaluate the "goodness or badness" of a lie in terms of "outcome" (relationship maintenance and harmony) rather than "motive.
    - Japan places a stronger emphasis on "integrity and fulfillment of promises," so even if the motive is good, if the result is misinformation, it is likely to be treated as a lie.
- Low Trust vs. High Trust Environment
    - In the World Values Survey, Japan has higher general interpersonal trust and is a contract-based society.
    - India is multilingual and multireligious, and has a strong culture of "build relationships first, then work out the details.
    - The way to create trust itself is different.

3. prescriptions in practice
_
| Situation What we would like to request from the Indian side What would be easier for the Japanese side to do |
| -- |
| Definition of requirements: Clearly state the timing of "finalization" and overwrite any changes during the process in the minutes each time. Always confirm in writing or via chat. |
| Deadline management Prompt reporting the moment the risk of delays is seen Set a leeway buffer and review progress in small segments. |
| Consensus building Re-explain important points to each other in workshop format "Check for understanding" in question format (open questions rather than closed questions) |
| Build rapport Build trust through small talk and informal chats Add "in-your-face" comments, respecting the other person's position and reporting line to the supervisor |

4. beware of stereotyping
- National characteristics are averages, not individual characteristics. It varies widely by local education, industry, and metropolitan/rural area.
- It is important to be aware that Japan also has a culture of using "[[hōbutsu]]" in [[one's real intention and one's hidden motives]] to soften the dialogue ([Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honne_and_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honne_and_) tatemae?utm_source=chatgpt.com]).

summary
- The point of conflict is between the Indian side's "convenience to ease the situation" and the Japanese side's "strict adherence to the facts and responsibility to fulfill them.
- Many frictions can be reduced by understanding each other's uncertainty tolerance and differences in how to protect the face, and by increasing documentation and additional checks.
- At the end of the day, it is easier to build a constructive relationship if it is viewed as a structural cultural gap, not judged by "malice or no malice".

context
> [mustafaalyabani](https://x.com/mustafaalyabani/status/1916409317286170686) It really seems to be true that Indians "don't consider a lie a lie". They don't have any malice in it, and they don't understand why Japanese people are angry at them in a fundamental way.
>  >trstrstrstrstrsn: There are a certain number of people who don't seem to think that lies are lies, so when communicating with people other than those you have come to trust (in the Japanese sense) over the years, you have to assume all risks and not believe anything until you see it with your own eyes. That's what the Indian expat beside me at the chai shop yesterday said. x.com/irukaotoko/sta...

> [mustafaalyabani](https://x.com/mustafaalyabani/status/1916464135644262563) Since they do not necessarily have the intent to lie or the malice to deceive, our criticisms are unreasonable attacks, and fact-checking is often misunderstood as a rough search. The situation is often misunderstood as an unreasonable attack, and the fact-checking is a search for rough edges, etc. It would be best if we could avoid unnecessary friction and frustration by not getting involved with them, but not everyone can enjoy the India-free life.

> [mustafaalyabani](https://x.com/mustafaalyabani/status/1916465607052234910) If you are in an organization where the majority of the people are from a place where things do not go as planned, you can just assimilate yourself into the irresponsible structure, but on the other hand, if you are in a head office that does not understand the local situation, you may be asked, "Why can't we do this easily? On the other hand, if the head office does not understand the local situation, the expatriate will be asked by the head office, "Why can't you do such a simple thing/why is it taking so long? On the other hand, I feel sorry for the expatriates who are asked by the head office, which does not understand the local situation, "Why can't you do such a simple thing?
>  >trstrstrstrstrsn: there are so many "lies without malice" when you are involved with India, I guess you could also say "reading too much into it"!

> [mustafaalyabani](https://x.com/mustafaalyabani/status/1916492726650257507) Dear Japanese people,
>  If you are going to deal with the peoples of countries where things don't go as planned, you have to let go of your developed country naivete. It is naive to think that what they say is true or will happen. It is naive to expect accurate and comprehensive answers to your questions. It is naive to expect that things will go as planned without persistent progress.
>  >pondebekkio: I feel this is a trait that all non-Japanese have. My Turkish and Chinese acquaintances also live their lives in such a way that they talk about their desires as if they were reality, and if they are wrong, they just make a fool of themselves. I can't imitate them, but I envy them a little because they seem so carefree. But that kind of atmosphere is impossible for serious Japanese people. x.com/mustafaalyaban...

> [Ren10i10i](https://x.com/Ren10i10i/status/1916700796290502862) A former Indian colleague of mine told me that it is considered good manners to answer if you are asked something even if you don't know it. I heard that it is considered unkind and bad to refuse because you don't know something, so for example, if you are asked for directions even if you don't know the place, it is considered kinder and better to just point and tell you. It was a feeling I could not understand for a moment.

> [tokoroten](https://x.com/tokoroten/status/1919444800262086892) Ah, I see, so "low [[tolerance for anxiety]]" is the flip side of "[[promise-oriented culture]]".
>  >tokoroten: If you build an organization with people with low tolerance for insecurity, [[official announcement by the shogunate (or a daimyo, etc.) that the government will step down from its post to the Emperor]].
>  So, there are about 60% of people who have a low tolerance for anxiety in their experience, so if you get people together to form an organization in the usual way, you will need a big headquarters.
>  So we have to pay up-to-date attention to recruitment and organization.
