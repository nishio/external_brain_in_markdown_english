    - I came up with the question, "Give me three implicit assumptions that can be read from the [[singularity]] diagram.

- First, from the fact that the cleverness axis is represented by a single line, we can read the assumption that "cleverness can be expressed as a one-dimensional quantity. Next, from the fact that human cleverness is represented by a horizontal line, we can read the assumption that "human cleverness does not change over time. From the fact that human intelligence is expressed as a line without thickness, we can read that "the intelligence of all humans is the same.
- Other possible explanations include "machines are currently inferior to humans" and "improvements in machine performance will accelerate over time.
