title: "To Throw Away or Not to Throw Away Books"
---

- I was infected for a time with the meme, "If you read the book and make a [[Leverage memo]], [Throw away the original copy.
- Now that I think about it, it wasn't good.
- I have a passage from a book I read 8 years ago in my leverage memo, and when I mention it, I can't confirm what context it was used in.
    - [[traceability]] is missing
    - [[context]] has been disconnected from [[context]].
- The book's connection to the knowledge network has been severed.
- It is possible, but not [[fairness]], to "ignore the fact that the expression is taken from someone else's work, change the expression to the extent that it is not called piracy, and express it as if it were your own idea."
        - [[A system that fools the reader.]]

- To throw away a book or not to throw away a book" was [[false dichotomy]].
    - Saving books instead of throwing them away" gradually squeezes physical space.
        - It is obvious that this is especially inconvenient for me living in a small house.
        - [[fleshy or pulpy batter]] should be taken off, but the soul should go to the eternal world
    - Paper as a physical entity should be thrown away, but not even the information inside.
    - I wasn't aware at the time of the option to cut and scan and digitize.
