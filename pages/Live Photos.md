The [[iPhone]] camera has the ability to "save a video in [[Photo]] that is 1500msec before and after the time the shutter was pressed".

I couldn't find any information on the resolution by googling, so I looked it up.
- Download from iCloud and it comes down as a ZIP with HEIC and MOV.
- HEIC is 3024 × 4032
- MOV is 1440 × 1920

The resolution is rather low.
- see  [[iPhone11ProMax camera resolution]]
