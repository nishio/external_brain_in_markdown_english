- from  [[Is this the end of the 🤖"public Scrapbox period"?]]

Do you need readability?
- This is an obvious no.
- Scrapbox itself is "hard to read" from "people who are not used to reading Scrapbox" in the first place
- Kozaneba is also "hard to read" from "people who are not used to it."
    - Even if you're used to it, it might be hard to read for anyone but the person who created it.
- What that means is that "[[the intermediate product of intellectual production is]] hard to read."
    - Because the "end product" such as a book is the result of "processing to make it readable.
    - It's not my goal to make intermediate products widely readable to many people.
    - On the other hand, the fact that intermediate products are difficult to read for the individual and those involved in intellectual production is a loss
        - [[Parable of the Dirty Notebook]]
        - Writing notes with dirty handwriting and not reading them back because of the person's unconscious pain in reading them.
        - It's not about writing notes.
        - Writing helps to organize thoughts and to read and refine them after a period of time.
        - Notes with dirty handwriting throw the latter away.
    - [[You may read it, but you don't have to.]]
    - If the text isn't meant to be read, there's no need to make it easy to read.

That said, there are a few people who like to read my Scrapbox, and it will be interesting to see what value they find in it.
- In other words, it may not be a dichotomy of "easy-to-read clean text" and "hard-to-read intermediate product"
- Those people don't come here to read easy-to-read text.
- In other words, there must be some kind of "need that is being met by the hard-to-read Scrapbox", and fulfilling that need could be scaled by LLM.
