- [Slide](https://www.slideshare.net/nishio/03-1-kj) <  [[03 1 Structuring Fragmentary Information _ Preliminary and Actual KJ Method Flow]]  <  [[Designing ways to learn]]
- I couldn't find just the right picture, lined up on the edge, open in the middle.
    - This photo shows approximately 100 sticky notes arranged in a row for better listing.
    - The slides are illustrated with a time series of photos.

context
- P150 [[(5.2.1) Lists side by side for better listing]], there should be a chart showing the amount of information that would be available if the lists were arranged exactly as shown.
- In P152, [[(Column) Size of the label]], it says
    - > This size of fusen, when placed side by side on an A4 sheet of paper, can hold 25 sheets.
- On p. 172 [[(5.3) Tuning for working people]] it says
    - > As a countermeasure, I put them on A4 paper. At the first stage of spreading them out and looking at them, I paste them on A4 paper in a tight line. If I am using 50mm x 38mm labels, I can put 25 labels on an A4 sheet of paper. If there are 100 labels, then 4 sheets of A4 paper will be filled with labels. Let's call this a list paper.
    - This is a story about "putting it on paper for easy storage so it doesn't have to occupy a desk or whiteboard for a long period of time.
    - Easily create a listable state of 100 stickies by putting 25 on each of 4 A4 sheets of paper, and easy to put them away.
- Original idea
    - > If I use 50mm x 38mm sticky notes, I can line up 56 sticky notes on an A3 sheet of paper.

    - A3 or A4 is fine, but now A4
        - Early on, they actually used A3 paper, but A3 was too cumbersome, so they stopped.
            - Cumbersome to have to fold once for storage
            - Problem of sticking too close to the crease and getting caught when folding.
        - I tried [[KJ method with folders]] as an earlier step, which was not so good.
- Where to put it.
    - P.150 was the inspiration, but it is disputed whether it should be in this location

draft

    - 56 sheets of A3 paper
