title: "Notice the small constants."
---

When there is a small constant in a problem, that small constant is often necessary for the problem to be solvable

Example
- Two types of coins [[abc099_c]].
- Tri-color ball
- Select one from each of the four sets [[half-full enumeration]].

relevance
    - [[Small constraint problem]]
    - Constants are not always constraints.
