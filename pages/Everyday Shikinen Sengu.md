(Context: [[vibe coding]]'s story about <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/blu3mo/icon' alt='/villagepump/blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>'s success in prototyping a new system with [[vibe coding]])
If a system can be implemented in this short time, the system will[[modular]] にしつつ頻繁に[[スクラップアンドビルド]]を繰り返すようなやり方の方がうまくいくことが多そう<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/blu3mo/icon' alt='/villagepump/blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - [[Everyday Shikinen Sengu]]
    - I've got a great power word here.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Yeah, I guess that means that once you get the abstract "[[knowledge]]", you can discard the concrete "[[source code]]".
        - Exactly <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/blu3mo/icon' alt='blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/blu3mo/icon' alt='blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>.
        - Paradigm Shift.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - Free yourself from the weight of writing code.
        - The dream of a world where all you have to do is knead abstractions is about to arrive.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/sta/icon' alt='/villagepump/sta.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - [[kneading in abstract form only]] じゃなくて「AIの支援で[[速やかに具体を生成して、そこから新しい知見を得て、具体は捨てる]]」だと思う<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - +1<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/blu3mo/icon' alt='/villagepump/blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - "Putting the generated concrete into the real world to gain new insights."[[experiment]] の作業が本質になってきそう<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/blu3mo/icon' alt='/villagepump/blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>
                    - The value (or fun) is going to be in being able to do experiments that other people can't do.
            - I was looking down from the abstract (the heavens) to the concrete (the earth), and I imagined dropping it on the earth, letting it do all the work, observing the results, kneading the abstract, and dropping it again.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/sta/icon' alt='/villagepump/sta.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - But realistically, I guess I have to come and go from the ground myself to some extent.
                - Even with cloud and IaC, you have to set the detailed parameters yourself.
            - I'm starting to think I've written something similar as an unexplored junior review memo.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - Proposals that are kneaded in the abstract alone are usually rejected.
                        - [[Type-specific advice for contest applicants]]
                        - It comes first as Pattern 1.
                        - The type that just says abstract things and doesn't lead to anything concrete at all.
                    - I also remember Mr. Ochiai saying something like, "You should have already done that."<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/sta/icon' alt='/villagepump/sta.icon' height="19.5"/>
                            - [[People who have never wanted to make it and have never made it.]]
                - The requirements for "inventions" handled by patents also require a specific way of making them.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/sta/icon' alt='/villagepump/sta.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - In kneading abstractions, it seems that "the knowledge/experience/attachment/value system/ring world that only the person has" can only dwell from the concrete.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/blu3mo/icon' alt='/villagepump/blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - I believe that the "knowledge/experience/attachment/values/world of the ring" that only the person has is "interesting.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/blu3mo/icon' alt='/villagepump/blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>


[[消すことが大事]]<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- If you have old code in the repository because you feel like it's a waste, the AI will read it and get confused.
- I complained to AI when it was accidentally deleted before, and they went back to the Git log, found the deleted commit, and restored it.
- So if it's in Git, you can delete it without mercy, and if you're worried, just make a note of the commits you've deleted.
- I think there's a lot of confusion right now about both AIPM and the approach of having Devin do the research, and that's the problem.
    - Delete or create a new repository and move only what you need.

[[天上]]↔[[泥臭い]]、 [[smell of earth]] <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- In an age when linguistic thinking has been made more efficient by AI
    - Processes with language as input and language as output become thicker.
        - If that was the bottleneck, the bottleneck is likely to move elsewhere
            - Related: [[When one bottleneck is eliminated, another bottleneck arises.]]
        - One of the places to move to is "[[the process of]] making what is not yet a language into a language."
- In situations where [[observing non-verbal things is a source of value]], there is a big [[yield difference]] between [[observing up close]] and [[observing at a distance]].

    - Quantity is also important
        - N=multiple observations and then abstraction.
        - Abstracting from N=1 observations (compromised)
        - N=0 abstraction (just a delusion that is not grounded in concrete reality)
        - Related: [[Decisions supported by multiple perspectives]].
    - It may no longer be important that the "sample is accurate and unbiased"<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/blu3mo/icon' alt='blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - There seems to be a difference between "aiming for" and "waiting to be secured."<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I'll have to continue to work on my footwork to observe up close.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/sta/icon' alt='/villagepump/sta.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I thought I didn't need it anymore, but today's exchange reminded me that that's not going to work.
