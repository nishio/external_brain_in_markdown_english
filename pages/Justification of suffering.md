title: "Justification of suffering"
---

- You can get [[pain]] in your life.
    - Specifically, images such as seeing losses incurred due to one's own stupidity.
- Not that this kind of suffering is not an aspect of human development.
- Sufferers do not want to believe that their suffering was futile, so they tend to make excessive sense of it
        - [[justification]] ,  [[self-justification]]
- The idea that others should suffer similarly as a result of finding meaning
    - This idea is harmful.

    - [[Buddhism]] in terms of
        - [[all the pain in the world]]: Life is full of pain.
        - [[The Four Noble Truths (of Buddhism)]]
        - [Tendering Suffering: Understanding that all things are suffering.
        - [[Shugi]]: Understand that it is your own desires that create the suffering.
        - [Understanding "If you eliminate greed, you will eliminate all suffering".
            - [[truth of the way to the cessation of suffering]]: [[right view]], understanding that greed can be destroyed by [[noble eightfold path]] beginning with right thought.

In the third part of the Lotus Sutra, the parable of the parables, we read
> If you are a man of small wisdom and deep love and greed, for this reason I have taught you to give up suffering.
> If sentient beings do not know the source of suffering, they will be deeply affected by the cause of suffering and will not be able to renounce it for a while.
>  If greed is destroyed, there is no room for dependence.
