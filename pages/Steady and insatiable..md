- [[untiringly]] and [[fickle]]

        - Outdoors Achievements, such as winning a contest or releasing a piece of software, will no longer change as a fact.
            - But the value people perceive for it is basically decreasing.
        - Achievements that are not outside are not exposed to the wind and snow, so they overestimate their value.
            - [[The old man's "I've done it before" is worthless.]]
