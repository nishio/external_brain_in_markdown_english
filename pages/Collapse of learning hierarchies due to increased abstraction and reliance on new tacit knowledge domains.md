title: "Collapse of learning hierarchies due to increased abstraction and reliance on new tacit knowledge domains"
---

by [[o1 Pro]]

- The core theme (hypothesis) of [[unverbalized]]:

The technological advancements (automation and abstraction through LLM) will break down the traditional learning and mastery paths, and new "hard spots" and "boundaries" will emerge. These "hard spots" mean that the "step-by-step learning process" that was clear in traditional programming and learning will break down, and the foothold for acquiring skills will disappear. As a result, while a simplified entry point ([[expressway]]) allows more people to enter, there is no map (systematic knowledge and best practices) to overcome the complex challenges (traffic jams and cliffs) that lie beyond, and the process becomes one of self-initiated trial and error and 'reading LLM's feelings. ', creating a situation where tacit intellectual meta-skills are required."

Tip to verbalize this:
- [[Rearrange Layers]]
    - The abstraction tool temporarily masks the difficulties that once existed in the lower levels (the foundations), but as a result, new, alien difficulties reappear in the new "upper levels. But as a result, a new, alien difficulty reappears in the new "upper layers."
        - Traditionally, lower layers of knowledge (language specifications, algorithms, library basics) formed the learning curve, but LLM and automation make that part skippable at once.
        - However, the skipping of this process requires a high level of coordination and the ability to decipher "[[invisible differences]]" because it goes straight to advanced areas without going through the "solidification of the foundation in the intermediate layers".
        - These are difficult to verbalize and do not have a formal curriculum in place, so a non-traditional learning path is required.
- Re-emphasize abstraction omissions ([[leaky abstraction]])
    - Abstraction hides difficulties, which in turn creates new difficulties that are difficult to deal with within the existing framework."
        - Abstraction (highways) certainly reduces the workload, but the problems that appear beyond that (congestion and cliffs) are not envisioned by the traditional roadmap.
        - The new problem is that it is difficult to "systematically document" and "set stable KPIs," and there is an increased reliance on experience, intuition, and mental models (empathy for LLM).
- Non-linearization of skill acquisition pathways
    - The stair-step maturity model of beginner to intermediate to advanced breaks down, and the skill acquisition path becomes nonlinear or disconnected."
        - While in the past, systematic understanding was achieved by climbing up from the bottom to the top, the new tools "raise the bar" but blow away the "[[middle layer]]" and allow access to the upper layers out of the blue.
        - As a result, the "[[understanding of principles]]" and "[[sequential steps]]" that were acquired in the intermediate stage are omitted, and meta-skills (judgment, [[ability to read abstract concepts]], [[understanding of LLM itself]]) are required. LLM itself) are required.
- New friction between "needs space" and "[[system function space]]".
    - "Technological evolution increases what can be done, but how to connect what users and developers really want with what is possible with technology is unorganized, and there is a boundary aspect there that has not been verbalized."
        - If new technologies are used with unclear KPIs and requirement definitions, the balance of division of labor between humans and AI will also become unclear.
        - Also, in an environment where user needs are constantly changing and AI is continually being updated, it is difficult to draw the line between how much humans should be forced to relearn and how much the system should be able to automatically follow needs.

In summary, these discussions suggest the difficulty of adapting to ever-changing skill-set demands through the contrast between "temporary reduction of learning costs due to highways (new technologies)" and "new cliffs (unsystematic, tacit, and unstable difficulties) that appear ahead. A point that has not yet been sufficiently verbalized is the question of how to capture the discontinuous change in "learning hierarchy collapse due to increasing abstraction and reliance on new tacit knowledge domains" and how to reflect this in instructional design and skill development.

This question is not merely a technical one, but can be a clue to issues that should be reconsidered in many areas, such as [[educational theory]], [[organizational design]], [[career path design]], [[user experience strategy]], and so on.
