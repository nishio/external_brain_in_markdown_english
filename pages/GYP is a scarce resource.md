[[GYP]] is a scarce resource
- So there is only so much that GYP alone can do.
- Need to communicate with [[non-GYP]].
- Q: Will a real GYP "pick up all the balls, including communicating with the messy non-GYPs?"
- A: Basically Yes, but I didn't think the "pick up all the balls" metaphor was appropriate.
    - GYP's concern is results and anything that improves results.
        - And that includes "communicating with the annoying non-GYP".
    - However, [[one's time resources are finite]], so process with priority.
        - If it's not a priority, we'll go through it.
        - When you have a "resource hogger" who "repeatedly claims low-priority things as if they were important," disempower him or her.
            - [[Incompetent hard worker]] must be gunned down."
            - In the modern world, of course, you can't shoot someone, so you make them uncomfortable and ask them to leave, or create a common belief that you don't need to take their claims seriously, or ask them to focus on harmless tasks, etc.
    - →Depends on what kind of communication with what kind of person specifically, and whether or not to pick it up, and how to pick it up.
        - [[Pick up, don't pick up, hit back]]
