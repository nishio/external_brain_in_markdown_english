title: "Lickety-split and Imposter Syndrome"
---

- Maybe [[sense of being tanned]] is just the flip side of [[imposter syndrome]].
- Others' evaluations of you are different from your expectations
- Feeling angry because your expectations are lower than you expected is a "feeling of being licked."
- Higher than one's expectations and distress is the "Imposter Syndrome."
