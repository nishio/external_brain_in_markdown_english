Kunihiko Ikuhara], the director of "Revolutionary Girl Utena," was asked by Okui to incorporate words that express the world of the work, such as "[[undress, become naked]]" and "[[change the world]]," into Okui's high school girl style....

It was a coincidence that the lyrics matched the anime that was broadcast, and I was rather surprised, he later revealed in an interview.
