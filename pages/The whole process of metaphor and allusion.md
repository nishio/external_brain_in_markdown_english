        - Q: Isn't it funny that CIRCUMLOCUTION is not a Symbolization of felt meaning, but you normally POINT F2?
            - A: I painted the wrong picture.
                - I wrote it in a symmetrical form, but it is not a symmetrical relationship because it is to modify the felt meaning that the previous symbol points to.
                - I drew "fix" as "refine by and" so it looked symmetrical.
