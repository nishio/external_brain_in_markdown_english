- [I personally feel that it is normal, but it is surprising that some people seem to find it surprising.
I thought about why, but I think it is because people like me, who had been creating programs and other things as a hobby before I started working, naturally experience the behavior of "deciding what I want to create most based on what I can create.
On the other hand, in corporate organizations, etc., we tend to be biased toward the [[coaxialization]] thinking pattern of "choosing a means by working backward from an objective," probably because we are often asked to explain why we choose that means.
