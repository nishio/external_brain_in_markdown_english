<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>You are a researcher with a good command of English and Japanese. The English word "[[empirical]]" is translated as "empirical" or "empirical" in Japanese. But I feel it has a different meaning. Please explain the difference in nuance between "[[empirical]]" and "[[empirical]]" in Japanese.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The Japanese words "empirical" and "empirical" are often used as translations for the English word "empirical," but each has subtle differences in nuance.

- Empirical: This term refers to proof or verification based on data or facts. The empirical approach means testing a theory or hypothesis with actual data and examples, and is often used in scientific research and analysis. The empirical method emphasizes concreteness and objectivity because of its emphasis on concrete evidence obtained through observation and experimentation.

- Empirical: The term empirical refers to knowledge and methods based on personal experience and observation. It focuses on information obtained from individual experience and observation and often relies on personal perceptions and sensations. In an experiential approach, subjectivity may be more strongly expressed, and the emphasis is on understanding and interpretation based on individual experience.

In short, "empirical" refers to a more objective, data-driven approach, while "empirical" refers to a more subjective, personal experience-based approach. While there is often overlap between the two, these nuanced differences exist.
