40Hz stimulation
> [paya_paya_kun](https://x.com/paya_paya_kun/status/1804770002647842993) I heard that "40Hz gamma wave sound" is good as background music for work if you have various images in your head and have trouble concentrating. I tried it. It worked great for me and doubled my concentration and work efficiency. I recommend this work background music for people who can't sit still in a chair.
