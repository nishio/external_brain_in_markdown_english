>  In order to store [[knowledge capital]] and [[social-relationship capital]] in the company, it necessarily have to be [[membership-based employment]] rather than [[job-based]]. Isnâ€™t it?

>  NISHIO Hirokazu
>  Membership-based employment is closely associated with the [[lifetime employment]], which once common practice of in Japan. It is an employment system that provides incentives for being a member of a company community throughout one's lifetime.

>  Nemanja
>  It sounds a lot like cooperatives since they are also [[membership based]], such as the ones in [[Basque]] Country. In my country, [[ex Yugoslavia]], we had something similar as well. It used to be called "[[organisation of joint labour]]". The good bit about it is that workers also participated in directing.

>  Interesting. I'll google them.

>  This might be of help: [Mondragon Corporation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation) I am not sure about the details how it works in terms of corporations, but all other types of cooperatives in [[Spain]] require you to become a member with some type of participation in terms of capital or membership.

>  In the case of Yugoslavia, the "lifetime membership/employment" was linked more with the fact that legally it was difficult to lay workers off, and that typically workers would never lay off workers (given that the decision-making in the company was shared among employees/collective members).

>  I didn't know much about the [[Mondragon Cooperative Corporation]], but when I looked into it, I found it to be very interesting. Thank you for telling me about it!
