- [[A series of pictures of two people saying different things]]

context
decentralization (of power)
Collective power non-collective power is a false dichotomy
It is one thing for a system to be decentralized; it is another to have a system built on top of that infrastructure that is decentralized.
If something that is made up of multiple layers is viewed as a single lump without identifying the layers, arguments against it can differ.

I was about to write it down, and then I thought this specific example was chewed up by the fact that the definition of "collectivity" is vague in the first place.
- The confusion comes from calling the different layers of relationships by the same name.
- The layers of whether the servers are centralized or distributed, whether the information is centralized like real estate registration or distributed like ownership of personal property.
- The layers of whether power is concentrated in the hands of certain players or broadly distributed among many.
- There is an oppositional structure of "concentration and dispersion" similar to these different layers
- It's not good to conflate those different layers of conflict.
- The ownership of movable property is decentralized, but even on that infrastructure, monopolization of wealth happens, irrelevant story.
    - If those with resources can more easily obtain them, resources will be consolidated
    - If power depends on the amount of resources (often Yes), then those with more resources have more power
