Redistribution of human resources:.
- The remaining 10% = work that requires creative and advanced thinking
- Improving this efficiency is progress if the task is sustainable and important.
- Complementary to, rather than replacing, traditional work methods

Human hands are added for final quality assurance.
- Improved efficiency = improved quality

Symbiosis with Technology:.
- Remaining 10% = Improvement of human-technology interface

- [[Low resolution]] of "Task T."
- I'm on "Task T" [They put it in a jar and mix it up.
- Even if 90% of it disappears, the remaining 10% has value.
