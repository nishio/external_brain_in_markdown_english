- Summary: The
    - The use of language directly or indirectly affects people's thoughts and feelings.
    - For example, "[[why?]]" is used as a means of expressing anger, which is influenced by society's [[norm of "don't get angry"]].
    - Many people have difficulty verbalizing their feelings and thoughts accurately and find it challenging to find appropriate means to express their anger and frustration.

', do you want to hear why you haven't done your homework? Or, 'Do your homework! You idiot! ' do you want to tell them, 'Do your homework! I asked the participants and they were shocked. Many people who [[indirect speech]] are unaware that it is indirect speech.

> [mentane](https://twitter.com/mentane/status/1163328438008107009) People who are unaware that they are using indirect speech are also using indirect speech in their thinking. As a result, they are unable to clearly grasp their thoughts and feelings. It can be said that this is a defective state of internal verbalization and mentalization. To avoid this, it is better to use as literal and direct language as possible in the head.

> [mentane](https://twitter.com/mentane/status/1163328857362931712) In our minds, we use language in the direct, literal sense, and then when we engage and communicate with others, we use appropriate indirect language as needed. Using them helps to create smooth and healthy relationships.

> [mentane](https://twitter.com/mentane/status/1163329915392892928) After all, the way we use words directly affects our thoughts and feelings. People who use inflected language are usually also inflected inwardly, which is difficult.

> [mentane](https://twitter.com/mentane/status/1163340013603418112) "Why do you do ~!" as an expression of dissatisfaction or anger at the other person's behavior. is widely used as a way of expressing dissatisfaction with the other person's behavior and anger. By using "Why do you do it?", one can simultaneously convey the front that "I am not angry" and the true intention that "you should feel my anger".

> [mentane](https://twitter.com/mentane/status/1163340619554541568) If you use "why" to unintentionally express anger and frustration, you not only maintain the appearance of "I who am not angry" to others, but also to yourself. I can protect my self-image as "I am a good person who is not angry.
- [[Self-image of "I'm not angry."]]
    - [[Self-image]]

> [mentane](https://twitter.com/mentane/status/1163341531501043713) In order to maintain my self-image as the "calm and well-meaning me who doesn't get angry", I cannot be aware of my true intentions behind asking "why?" I cannot be aware of my true intentions behind asking "why". This is why it is so difficult to realize that "why" is an indirect statement. The unconscious is very wise, and in this way it protects itself from being hurt.

> [mentane](https://twitter.com/mentane/status/1163344184855547904) There are some people who want to talk about their dislike for a certain subject by putting it on a name, such as "toxic parents," "fucking males," or "bitches," and get angry as if on fire when it is pointed out that they should refrain from doing so. There are some people who are very angry when it is pointed out to them that they should refrain from doing so.

> [mentane](https://twitter.com/mentane/status/1163344259300220929) They have been bound up to that point by the norm that they "must not be angry," repressing their discomfort with anger and frustration, and having a hard time connecting the object of their anger with their feelings. They have spent their days in pain, unable to connect the object of their anger with their feelings. Living in this way, they have not developed the ability to verbalize and grasp their feelings and thoughts.

> [mentane](https://twitter.com/mentane/status/1163344270910054405) One day it finally dawns on them that the feeling is anger or frustration with an object. It is an eye opening experience for them. But they are still immature in their ability to verbalize their feelings and thoughts, and if they are not careful, they soon lose track of their feelings.

> [mentane](https://twitter.com/mentane/status/1163344276459151360) The light from the outside world that they finally find in the darkness of the cave is the connection between the object of their discomfort, such as parents or the opposite sex, and the attempt to cling to themselves in a desperate attempt not to lose it, as if they will soon lose it again. The attempt to hold on to the connection between the object and their discomfort, which seems to be lost again soon, is the [[pejorative terms]] such as "toxic parents", "bitch", "bitchy males", etc.

> [mentane](https://twitter.com/mentane/status/1163345036643196929) In that light, their clinging to such epithets may be a process of growth, a self-help effort they can make in their own way, a desperate struggle. It is a self-help effort and a desperate struggle that they can make in their own way. So I can't blame them too much. I hope they will eventually move on to the next stage and spend their days more happily.

In many cases, these concepts and words serve the function of identifying the target of the mysterious and uncomfortable feelings that each person has been harboring in his or her mind, and make him or her feel a little more at ease.

> [mentane](https://twitter.com/mentane/status/1163347370878238721) They over-connect all negative feelings in their inner mind to one identified object. But it's a little more stable and easier on the mind than not finding the object. Only when they know what to be angry at and feel that it is socially acceptable behavior to be angry there, can they feel safe and angry.

> [mentane](https://twitter.com/mentane/status/1163347374887936001) The target of such anger can be the cause of all kinds of evil, not to mention the actual problematic acts committed by the person in question. When both parties engage in it, it becomes a mud-slinging match. It's not easy.

>  ・The other person is living the other person's life regardless of your anger.
>  ・When anger is expressed, it needs to be in the right form, at the right time, and for the right reason to have that anger.
>  Behind anger lies frustration and desire, and the best way to fulfill that desire is not always through the expression of anger.

> [mentane](https://twitter.com/mentane/status/1164021891591368704) After seeing the responses after a series of tweets, I realized that pretty much everyone doesn't know that "why" and "why not" are used as accusations and promotions of action. I am seriously surprised. On the other hand, there are some people who believe "If I say 'why', it must mean 'do it'! There are quite a few people who believe and do not doubt it. This is certainly the only way to start a war.

> [mentane](https://twitter.com/mentane/status/1164483862904180736) The biggest discovery in this series of tweets was that the moment the word "homework" is mentioned, the sentence containing that word is "How do we get kids to do their homework? ?" The most important thing I discovered in this series of tweets was that the moment the word "homework" is mentioned, there is a certain percentage of people who have no doubt that the text containing the word is written for the purpose of "how to get kids to do homework? Everyone has a strong attachment to the word "homework.

> [mentane](https://twitter.com/mentane/status/1164484371618811904) I never mentioned "how to talk to your kids to get them to do their homework" in a series of tweets, and I'm not that interested in that. It was very interesting to see how many times you said that, but didn't seem to get it.

> [mentane](https://twitter.com/mentane/status/1164746337436389377) Miscellaneous thoughts on the "Why Festival", there is a series of tweets by me for a while as a reply to the following link.
>  >Asailuck: Seriously, when talking about the frame of cognition that is the premise for discussion, rather than discussion of individual issues, it is impossible to "just discuss without denying the other person's personality" since that person's frame of cognition is inseparable from the person's personality that has been formed up to that point. I think it is impossible to "just discuss without denying the other person's personality.
