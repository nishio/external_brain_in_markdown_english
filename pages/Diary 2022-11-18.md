> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1593591706464976896?s=20&t=uzVBrOArUFm8pLsr3NlKqw): I'm skeptical of the "Twitter is going down" talk, but that said... I've created an account on fedibird because I think that if a trusted [[early adopter]] around me moves, I'm more likely to see something interesting if I follow them anyway.

Hmmm, since we're at it, let's go with the most early adopter setting.

from [/villagepump/what happens when Twitter disappears and flies away?](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/what happens when Twitter disappears and flies away?)
- I feel like "Really?" when I hear rumors that "Twitter is going down because the infrastructure engineers quit", but since I recognize that Twitter is just a social networking service that I started using more than ten years ago, I don't think it would bother me if it went down.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - When I entered college, it was the era of ICQ, MSN Messenger, Yahoo Messenger, and then came the mixi era. Before the services themselves died out, the places where I and the people around me were active changed and I moved there.
    - So either the Twitter service will physically go down, or interesting people will start doing interesting things elsewhere and my mindshare will move there, I don't know which, but I don't see any problem.

- Interesting that you can say "thanks" to the janitor.

This morning.
> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1593412557167300610?s=20&t=e8FobbZJ-bprMTxHvN7AQg): just as you can't speak a foreign language you can't hear, you can't read You cannot program in a programming language.
> It is the same with painting; what cannot be "read" cannot be expressed. However, since everyone can "see", they think they are able to do so.

> I finally realized that this is what [[(a) look]] is all about.

> "Gaze" and "[[Cognitive Resolution]]" are close concepts.
>  >[[ROUGH SKETCH]] training is supposed to train you to see things correctly, to let go of the belief that you are able to see things.
>  That's a similar concept to the Buddhist "[[right view]]" when you put it that way.

> I learned so much from this video.

> Based on someone's drawing, he mistakenly believed that if he trained himself to take a color with an eyedropper and apply it, he would acquire the skill of "coloring in". But that was like someone who had not learned C trying to learn to program by looking at compiled machine language.
> In order to cultivate the ability to see, it is important to take the time to "see" the object, and since people cannot simply say, "Look carefully," we have them perform "tasks that cannot be done without looking," which results in the realization of "looking carefully. This is the same as [[copying of a sutra]] in programming learning. But it's not enough.
> No matter how "closely we look" at the final artifact, it is difficult to understand the process by which it came to be. Compared to the rustic objects of the past (like a cudgel), it is even more difficult now because the work has been digitized and it is more difficult to leave "traces of the working process" in the end product.
> The similarities between layers in coloring and functions in programming. Beginners don't understand why it is chopped so finely. It is troublesome to separate them. They try to do it in one layer. Advanced users recognize layers/functions as parts of a single level of abstraction. They do it because it is easier to reduce the cognitive load than to do it without separating the layers/functions.
> Shadows have shadow layers and are designed as components that function through layer compositing effects such as burn-in. When we look at an image after layer composition, we only know that the color is in that position, and we do not know what process was used to derive that color. It looks as if the color was selected by hand, but in fact, it was obtained by calculation.
> The color adjustment in this case is not done by a human selecting a specific color from a palette, but by adjusting a parameter called layer transparency.
>  In CSS, absolute position is not specified by a human, but by adjusting flex parameters.
> Once you learn about the "generative process," you will be able to imagine "a little" of that generative process when you see the final product.
>  This is just like how a 100 yen store feels like a museum when you know the process of designing and outputting 3D shapes using a 3D printer.
>  I don't know anything about mold injection molding, but I guess it will look more glorious when I do!
> I can't cook, but if I could, I would probably enjoy deciphering what was used in the dishes I ate at restaurants and trying to recreate them myself. This is the same composition.
> Is there a difficulty in training the eye on the side of the consumer and must it stand on the side of the producer? (Hypothesis)

- [[When will you change the front page of the KJ Act?]]
> I've been thinking about a question from the other day about when to change the KJ method nameplate, and I think it might be related to this. But I have some errands to run today, so just a note for now.
>  The creator's point of view, change it to make it easier to do, functions are made because it's easier to make them.
> "When do you create a function, and when do you change the name of the function?
>  In order to recognize this, we first need to be able to recognize that the process we are undertaking "is going well" or "is not going well".
>  Fix it when you feel it's not running well.
