title: "You can write your introduction in Scrapbox."

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1395784052628549635) I'm very glad I changed my self introduction from "post in the chat self introduction channel" to "create my own page in Scrapbox and write there". The amount of self-introductions has increased several fold, I can update as many times as I want, and people with the same interests can add line comments. It's hard to comment on past ones when the self-introductions are flowing in the chat.
