I had recently been calling a concept I was curious about "[[nomad]]," but the boundaries were a bit off. The proper name for the concept I was looking for is "[[People on the move]]".
- A synonym for "[[People who settle down]]."
- People on the move are not necessarily [[nomadism]]. [[A caravan (of merchants)]] is another option.
    - Not necessarily moving on the ground. A [[trader]] who [[trades]] on a boat is also a person who moves.
            - [[(7.2.5) Trade commercial strategies for knowledge across organizational boundaries]]
        - [[Movement extends the range of observation]]
        - The [[Observation range]] of those who settle is narrow.
- The person who moves to a new location [[connects]] and [[networking]] the "person who settles down" who would be [[isolation]] as it is.


- [[movement]] and [[settlement]]

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1639251123222745089) @0xtkgshn The "people on the move" story from 2 years ago and the nomadic story I've been thinking about lately are connected!
> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1639251273777049600) This is that one, right, like how to know [[Life Choices]]?
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1639255655969341440) Yes. People who move have a wider range of observation and know [[options]], while people who settle have a narrower view. This and the story of "[[Knowledge Traders]]" who create value by [[Carry knowledge]] obtained in this way, and the recent idea of "[[nomad]]" being abstracted to "[[People on the move]]" and including "[[a caravan (of merchants)]]" are connected. I was connected to the fact that

This is the reason why I think that movement as a concept is so valuable! This is thanks to @hassyadai, who asked me "What is [[Cognitive and Choice Disparities]]? This is thanks to the question "What is [[Cognitive and Choice Disparities]]?
    - [[It can be seen only by moving]]

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1639256422197383168) Because from the point of view of a permanent resident, [[visitor]] looks like "[[weird guy]]"!
    - [[visitor from afar]]

That was @[[DeCartography]]'s challenge. Simply put, identify identities in the Ethereum ecosystem and make decisions about "which public goods to support?" and collaborate with @[[Gitcoin]] to make decisions about
> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1639268164692328450) Cartography is Greek for the art of map writing, isn't it?

>  Since the action history on Ethereum is on-chain and [[Permissionless]], Gitcoin's [[Quadratic Funding]] voting power adjustment based on it.
