the three kleshas that poison the heart of man (desire, ill will and ignorance)
> The theory of the Trinity or [[trimurti (Lepidium sativum)]] (Sanskrit: त्रिमूर्तिःtrimūrti, meaning "three forms") is that Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are identical, that these deities are equal in power relations, and that they are merely three aspects of a single divine being manifesting from a single divine being with different functions. The theory of [[Hinduism]] is that these deities are identical, equal in power relations, and are merely three different aspects of a single divine being manifesting from a single divine being. In other words, the three pillars [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva.]] are the three functions of [[creation]], [[maintenance]], and [[destruction]] of the universe deified in the form of a trio. Generally speaking, Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva are responsible for creation, maintenance, and destruction/[[playback]], respectively, but variations exist among different sects.
