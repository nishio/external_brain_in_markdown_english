title: "Factory Construction games and Industrial games"
---

> A game like [[Minecraft]] where you can freely create beautiful buildings with the appearance of a factory as your imagination dictates, and while you're at it, things are produced automatically" is a factory construction game, while "a game like [[Factorio]] where you can keep expanding your factory to 100 SPM, 1000 SPM, or 10,000 SPM as long as your computer's performance allows you, and challenge the limits of your production capacity. Industrial games are games where "you can keep expanding your factory infinitely as long as your computer's performance allows, whether it is 100 SPM, 1,000 SPM, or 10,000 SPM like [[Factorio]]. The two are different in the way they are enjoyed and the functions required will be different.
