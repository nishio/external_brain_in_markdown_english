title: "I'll do two, one pomo at a time."
---

I said, "Which do you think I should do first, the manuscript due on Thursday or the presentation material due on Friday morning at 10:00 a.m.?"
Wife: "I think you should do both one [[pomodoro]] at a time to gather information to help you decide which one to do."

- I'm wasting my time thinking about which one to choose.
    - [[settle down]]
    - Trying to sit in two chairs.
    - Need to make one, but haven't decided which chair.
    - Then we each have to sit and watch.

henceforth
- Once I had done one pomodoro of the manuscript, I was able to estimate that I would finish it with one or two pomodoro left, so I got motivated and just finished it.
- In retrospect, the phenomenon of "the scale of the task is not estimated
    - [[Work Excitement]]

Wife: "If the purpose is to estimate, I personally feel that doing two pomodoros each would lose less than an hour, which is too big. 15 minutes or so would be better."
- If you feel it's too big and don't want to start, make it smaller.
- Maybe we could make it a pomodoro where we do two 10-minute sessions each.
- It's also possible to think of "estimating" as a separate thing, since it's harmful if it generates the assumption that "we have to work in units of one pomodoro."
