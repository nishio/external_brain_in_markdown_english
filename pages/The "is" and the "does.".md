## On the contrast between [["is"]] and ["does"
.

In analyzing Japanese thought and political culture, Masao Maruyama presented a contrast between two linguistic and thinking styles, "### [[is]]" and "[* [do
". This is not just a difference in grammar, but reflects a difference in the thinking styles and values of Japanese society.



# 1. "is" type of thinking
.
The "is" type of thinking is a style that [* assumes objective facts and entities and builds them up logically.

## Features
- Logical and objective
- → Systematic discussion with emphasis on factual correctness and consistency.

- based on a fixed concept.
- → Things are definitively organized as "A is B".
- E.g., "Japan is a modern nation" and "Democracy is the division of power."

- High affinity with Western rationalism.
- → Commonly used in science, law, philosophy, etc.

- Benefits
- Easy to have clear definitions and standards
- Consistent theory building is possible
- Objectivity, easy to criticize and verify

## Disadvantages
- Difficulty in flexibly perceiving diverse real-life situations
- Easily viewed as absolutes and slow to respond to change



# 2. "Do" type thinking
.
The "do" type of thinking is a style that [* emphasizes proactive action and practice and makes decisions based on the situation.

## Features
- Practical and Situational.
- → Things can be thought of as centered around the act of "doing ____".
- Examples: "make democracy," "modernize," "make war."

- fluid and flexible.
- → Tend to change their thinking and behavior depending on the situation.

- High affinity for Japanese-like cultural and political climate.
- → Easily consistent with the tendency to "read the air" and "adapt to the mood of the place".

- Benefits
- Easily adaptable to change
- Flexibility to respond to real-world situations
- Good for consensus building within a community.

## Disadvantages
- Consistency and principles tend to be weak.
- Difficult to construct a systematic theory
- Easily drift into subjective and emotional judgments



# 3. Significance of the contrast between "is" and "does"
.
Masao Maruyama pointed out that Japanese politics and thought are characterized by a strong tendency toward the "do" rather than the "is" type.

## Example in Japanese political culture
.
- "be democratic" vs. "do democracy".
- → If "it is a democracy," it assumes universal rules and institutions and emphasizes adherence to them.
- → If you "do democracy," the emphasis is on actual operation and people's consensus building, and the rules themselves can vary.

- "is war" vs. "waging war".
- → If "it is war," then the definition and legal concept of the state of war is called into question.
- → If "waging war," the emphasis is on actual combat actions and strategic decisions.

## Relation to the social structure of Japan
.
- Japanese politics tends to focus more on actual operation and compromise ("do") than on the legitimacy of principles and institutions ("is").
- Companies and organizations also have a strong culture of "making decisions based on the situation" rather than on explicit rules.
- Even in academia and thought, there is a tendency to favor arguments based on actual experiences and situations over theoretical coherence.



# 4. Application to modern times
.
This contrast between "is" and "does" is also relevant to current social issues and decision-making.

## Issues in Contemporary Japan
.
- Lack of "is" type → Lack of principles.
- → Weak awareness of establishing and adhering to clear principles and systems.
- → e.g., ambiguity in interpretation of the Constitution, formality of laws

- "do" type excess → ad hoc response.
- → Give priority to the atmosphere and relationship rather than principles.
- → e.g., "I can't do it because there is no precedent" or "I will follow because everyone else is doing it."

[[**Related to Digital Democracy]].
- Reinforcing "is" type thinking allows for transparent, data-driven discussions.
- By leveraging the strengths of the "do" model, a flexible and participatory democratic system can be established.
- AI-based decision support could be a new approach that integrates "is" type analysis and "does" type practice.



# 5. Summary
.
:
|  | Type that is Type that does |
| -- | -- |
| Thinking Style Logical, Objective [[Practical]], [[Situational]]. |
| Approach Systematic theory building Emphasis on action and practice |
| Benefits [[clearly defined]], [[consistency]], [[Verifiability]], [[flexibility]], [[adaptability]], [[ability to get things done]] |
| Disadvantages [[rigid]], difficult to respond to change [[inconsistent]], [[ad hoc]]. |

Masao Maruyama's point is not merely a difference in language, but is deeply relevant to the nature of decision-making in Japanese society. How to strike a balance between "is" and "does" has become an important issue in today's society and politics.
