title: "The law of increasing marginal cost does not fit the reality."

    - [[law of increasing marginal cost]] : When you make a lot, the production cost goes up.
    - This is the opposite of [economies of scale
    - Even as a practical matter, [[marginal cost]] goes down with mass production.
    - So I looked it up and found some discussion about it.
    - The upward-sloping [[supply curve]] focuses only on the mass-production part of the U-shaped [[average cost curve]] shown below.

            - The average cost curve is the slope of the line connecting each point of the total cost curve to the origin.

    - As for new manufacturing from 0 to 1, the supply curve is falling right

    - If the supply curve exceeds the demand curve, the supplier "is in the red" and the demander "is too expensive".
    - If this is reversed, the supplier "is in the black" and the demander "wants it!" and the demander says, "I want it!
