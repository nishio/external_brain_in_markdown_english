title: "I want all my works to be CC-0"
---

I used to want to [[CC-BYing with Death]] my works.

When I saw Audrey Tang making her works CC-0, I started to consider the option of CC-0. I thought "[[CC-0 with death]]" was a good idea, since it is unlikely that he would exercise his rights based on CC-BY after his death.

Since Audrey has been CC-0 since she was alive and does not seem to have any problems with it, I began to think that the "[[with death]]" condition was also unnecessary. Then I added "[[If you don't want to die, die now.]]" and "[[You may not have the ability to regret it when you die.]]" and realized that it would be easier to do that action as if you were dead while you were alive than to implement a mechanism to do the action after death. I realized that it is easier to do the action as if you were dead while you were alive than to implement a mechanism to do the action after death.

Today is January 1, 2024, and since it is a close date, I am declaring my work on this Scrapbox CC-0 as of today.

However, users need to understand that CC-0 does not mean "everything is free".
- About "Citation
    - Under Japanese copyright law, the rights of copyright holders are restricted when making quotations.
            - [[Anything published can be cited.]]
    - Therefore, there are some articles on this Scrapbox that cite the works of others X.
    - Even if the article is CC-0, using only the "X's copyrighted work" portion of the article could infringe X's copyright.

I would like to make "all my works" CC-0, but at the moment I cannot make books CC-0 due to a contract with the publisher, so I am restricting it to "my works on this Scrapbox". We would like to expand the scope of CC-0 in the future, but it is possible that new non-CC-0 works may be created depending on the situation.
