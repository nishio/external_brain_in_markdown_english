title: "Clarke's three laws"
---

- [[science fiction writer]] [[Arthur C. Clarke]] defined the following three laws.
    - If [[Eminent and elderly scientist]] says it is possible, then the claim is almost certainly wrong. And if they say it is impossible, then their assertion is first of all wrong.
    - When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.
    - The only way to measure [[The Limits of Possibility]] is to challenge them until they transcend those limits just a little bit.
    - The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.
    - [[Well-developed science and technology is indistinguishable from magic.]] 。
    - Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
