| Item Overview |
| -- |
| Political party requirements: (1) 5 or more Diet members, or (2) 1 or more Diet member plus 2% or more of the votes cast in the most recent lower house or upper house regular election. |
| Calculation framework of the amount The total amount of 31.53 billion yen (in 2025) is divided proportionally by "50% for the number of councilors" + "50% for the number of votes". |
| Percentage of number of councilors (50%) 1 out of 713 seats = approx. 22 million yen/year |
| Vote share (50%) If just above the 2% line, the weighted after-weighted share will be around 0.4-0.6% → approx. 50-70 million yen/year |
| Approximate annual total: 70-90 million yen |
| Six-year total (upper house term): 400-500 million yen or less (variable if the number of votes received increases or decreases due to lower house elections along the way) |

TABLE:Actual examples show the range of "1 seat + 2-3% of the vote".

It is a type of [[participatory budgeting]] in that the citizens vote to decide how much of the budget to distribute to which teams.
- The hurdles are high where political parties are formed.
- The more easily they are made, the closer we are to participatory budgeting.
