title: "Put only good things in vaguely defined words."
---

The phenomenon of saying "this is X" to good thing A and "this is not X" to bad thing B, for an ambiguously defined word X

It's giving another name to your "good and bad" [[pretending to be objective]].

Specific examples of X
- democracy
    - democratization
- deconstruction (as in the term coined by Jacques Derrida)
- object-oriented
    - I used to put it on everything in a good way, and now that the fad is over, I'm in a phase where I'm criticized for putting it on too much of everything.
- complex system
- entrepreneurial spirit

- [[buzzword]] I guess it's almost the same as
- Buzzword X becomes "good stuff, trendy now, everyone is mentioning it".
    - Anything that's good and can be mangled into X elements is called X.
    - Ignore the bad, X-ish stuff.
