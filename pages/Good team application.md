title: "Good team application"

I was going to write about it when I got it all together, but there's no sign of it coming together, so I'll just take stock since it's the end of the year.

- No good feelings towards [[Team Application]] in the first place, as seen in fragments in [Originality first before co-creation

On the other hand, "no good feelings" could be "simply because I'm not used to it."

So we should not put them all together and keep them away, but observe them carefully and find the good ones.

A common "bad example" is somewhat more people.
- To avoid this, "ask individual members directly what each member is responsible for" and evaluate projects with unclear people downward.

However, it was argued that this was not enough.
    - The same composition as in [[Aging Organization]] can occur.

discussion
    - Does [[Drive Force]] need to be clear?
    - Differences between long-term and short-term projects
    - In a project of six months or so, there's no time for multiple people to work out their visions, you're better off going all out under one policy.
    - [[division of labor]] cannot go according to the theory on the table, so we need a good division of labor with overlap.
    - Ideally, the team leader should be able to work on the project alone, assuming all other team members are hospitalized
- How to identify [[alignment]] within a team
    - For example, ask different members about their vision and actions based on it.
    - When there is no common vision, it is extremely difficult to explain one's actions consistent with a vision different from one's own that others have spoken on the spot
