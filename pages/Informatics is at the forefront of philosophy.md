- [[informatics]] is at the forefront of [philosophy

> While in the past, arguments in philosophy were made at the level of concepts, efforts began to be made to make arguments more precise by [[analytic philosophy]] that developed in the United States, and today, with the powerful tool for argumentation, the computer, [[philosophical arguments can be empirically refinement]], which will have a profound impact on philosophy in the future. If this modest book can serve as a starting point for that, then there is nothing to say about it.

- Strong language like "it's the front line" or "we don't need it anymore" can spark a sterile debate.
- I believe that a philosopher who does not utilize computers in this day and age is like a theologian who did not try to look through a telescope in Galileo's time.
        - [[People who don't look at the moon through a telescope.]]
    - I think [[Augmenting Human Intelligence with Computers]] is the path that civilization will take in the future, and I don't mind if some people don't think that way, but I don't pay much attention to them.
