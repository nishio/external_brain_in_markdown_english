Unable to load the context of the project into a living brain.

The problem that projects like the Englishization of Scrapbox, which have been in action for a very long time and the requirements have been changing rapidly, have become too complex to be loaded from an external brain to a live brain.
- I don't even think about loading it into a living brain anymore, I think LLM should read it.

The things you wrote about that you were going to do, but forgot to do without doing them, are the things you don't have to do.
- The theory that this is a good idea is strong, but the problem is that we are not 100% confident that we really don't have to do it
- In fact, "an article I wrote five years ago that didn't develop at that time" can develop into "you wrote something interesting! and it sometimes develops into something new.
- If that happens in thinking and writing, shouldn't we naturally expect it to happen in software development as well?
