[B - Name of the particulars](https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc019/tasks/arc019_2)
- The problem is to count up the number of patterns where one character is rewritten and not [[palindrome]].
- Check first if it matches the corresponding character.
    - For odd-numbered non-centers
        - If there's one discrepancy, and that's the letter that's out of alignment, when it's rewritten and it's the same letter, it becomes a palindrome.
        - No other pattern is palindromic.
    - For odd-numbered centers
        - If there is zero displacement, no matter what you do, it's a palindrome.
        - If it's non-zero, it's not a palindrome no matter what you do.
- count up without making a mistake
    - I make a lot of mistakes, so it's important to have a system that makes it easy to run tests.
    - Examples of Mistakes
        - Displacement of one subscript access `S[-i]` â†’ `S[-1-i]`.
        - The == and ! == mistakes
        - I reversed then and else.
        - I was mixing up %2 and &1 and making it &2.
    - How could I have made so many mistakes?
python

```
def solve(S):
    ret = 0
    N = len(S)
    if N == 1:
        return 0
    xs = [S[i] != S[-1-i] for i in range(N // 2)]
    sums = sum(xs)
    for x in xs:
        if x:
            if sums == 1:
                ret += 24 * 2
            else:
                ret += 25 * 2
        else:
            ret += 25 * 2
    if N & 1:
        if sums != 0:
            ret += 25
    return ret
```
