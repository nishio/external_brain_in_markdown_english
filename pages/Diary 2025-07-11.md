I think that a story about me Tweeting and getting 100,000 impressions is a topic that has some need, so it might be a good idea to make a TikTok video about it.
- In this case, it may be better to create the material itself rather than to make it from existing materials.
    - Pictures, slides
    - Voice, [[voice changer]].

- [[Scoop up the floating leaves and move them out of the way.]]

- Did I write about [[stretch]]?
- I got a new female instructor last week.
- They're stretching the front of my thighs.
    - I heard that [[pelvis]] should be put up, so I gave it a try.
    - Until now, I've been trying to open my legs without much care for my pelvis.
    - So far, the right [[gluteus medius]] and left [[adductor muscle]] have been hurdles.
    - but after trying to erect the pelvis, it became apparent that the left gluteus medius was preventing the pelvis from erecting.
- Last week my upper body was fine, but this week [[trapezius muscle]] is busted, what's going on? that's what I'm talking about.
    - 'What happened to, uh, sitting in a conference room for a long time at a training camp on Saturday and Sunday?
        - Side note: Sportspeople and non-sportspeople have different images of what the word "[[training camp]]" means.
    - By confronting my body every week, I realize that my physical condition fluctuates unexpectedly.
        - The feeling of increased cognitive resolution of one's body.


- [[Lab Presentation 7/16]]
- I completely forgot about WW.

- [[Elections are a zero-sum game for a limited time.]]
- They're competing for a limited number of votes.
- Well, there is one option to encourage those who haven't voted to vote.

- [[Annotate functionality in Polimoney]]

- [[public information AI]]
- Mystery case where report generation is complete, but when opened, it is 500.
- I've recreated it with the same data, so it's like some kind of secret data.
- 500 is a mystery to me, it's not like it's an error on the front end.
- I fixed it by removing the category field.

I took a bath and [[hair-cutting]].

Did I mention that [[LUUP]] was useful?

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1943371391543447935) What is the contradiction? For example, if you run a bus in front of the station, most people will say "It's more convenient! but some people say, "No, I don't want to take the bus! But there are people who say, "No, I don't want to take the bus! There is no need to obligate them to take the bus. Those who don't want to take the bus can continue to walk. Similarly, those who don't want to use their own number can continue to fill out the application form as before.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1943552617877254469) By the way, my number is already over 90% penetration even among people in their 60s and 70s, so it's not like the elderly are being left behind. Most citizens can make the transition without problems.

> [sagishi0](https://x.com/sagishi0/status/1943559847259287978) If the original twin is arguing that they want to bus people who couldn't get on the bus, but leave out those who can't get on the bus for yet another reason, then it's clear that they are at odds in terms of policy philosophy. It is.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1943642642434367949) Please do not confuse "those who want to ride the bus but cannot" with "those who do not want to ride the bus". It is one thing to support the former and another to force the latter.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1943579233483137196) "In addition to the current method A, we will introduce method B, which is more convenient and less expensive to operate. We need to repeat this message repeatedly because there are some people who interpret it as "We are going to introduce method B which is more convenient and less expensive to operate in addition to the current method A. This is a recap of the trend that happened in Taiwan during COVID.

> [hayamiz](https://x.com/hayamiz/status/1943605911425069123) I personally support Team Mirai, but I have the impression that Nishio's recent tweets are throwing masakari at the general public and are a negative campaign against a political party. I am concerned about this.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1943606684796035452) What, which part? Can you elaborate?
> [hayamiz](https://x.com/hayamiz/status/1943608840810824137) It's very scary when someone who isn't used to debating suddenly asks, "What's the contradiction?" I'd be very scared if someone who is not used to discussing suddenly asked me, "What's contradictory? Even if the person you are quoting is used to it, it's not only the person you are quoting who is looking at the tweet.
> [hayamiz](https://x.com/hayamiz/status/1943609574201725363) Battling logical right and wrong is effective in a very limited community with special training, but to appeal something to people who have not received such training, However, if you want to appeal to people who are not trained in this way, you must first speak to them not only logically but also emotionally, or they will close their minds to you with "these people are scary.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1943611403333451857) I see! Thank you!

> [ayasuda_jp](https://x.com/ayasuda_jp/status/1943555188469735854) I don't like my number and not understanding it as much as people who need help ......
- If you don't like my number, you can still fill out the form and apply for it, or you can link your number to your public money receiving account so that you can receive money without applying for it.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1943613687786320004) I remember the old Perler slang motto, so I'll go write some code.

- [[If the left is making a good argument, what the right should be doing is making an equally good argument, not fighting]]

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1943398534503632978) This kind of thing makes me feel that people who say "[[risk of a dead ballot]]" are only making the most of their votes by voting where they think they will win and thinking that their votes were not wasted. I feel that those who say "[[risk of a dead ballot]]" are not making the most of their votes. Voting for Yasuno-san in the Tokyo gubernatorial election was an investment with a very high global change effect per vote. I think it will be even higher this time.
>  >innovest_29: I voted for Mr. Anno in last year's gubernatorial election. I honestly didn't think he would win, but if he got a certain amount of votes, it would give him media exposure and lead to the next step.
>  And how did it go? They actually used it as a stepping stone, made a case in a year, targeted the Upper House, and even came up with a plan to change the future with one seat, and I'm crying because I'm so happy. x.com/takahiroanno/s...
> [torotiti](https://x.com/torotiti/status/1943445092678930442) It's so exciting to think that the vote for Governor is connected to this place!





> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1943386340055470185) I think people don't get the concept of open source if they think, "If we push the most powerful tools we've developed onto people without knowing their IT skills onsite, they will become useless. But I'm talking about "we'll release what we've developed and make it available to anyone without charging any price", so it's up to each local government to decide whether they want to use it or not.
>  >kagumiyabi: When I look at Team Mirai's policy, I think "go into the government field and work once and see.
>  Without knowing the IT skills of the field, it's obvious that pushing the most powerful tools we've developed will render them useless.
>  They seem to see the glamour of development, but I don't think they see the sobriety of maintenance. Quite dangerous. x.com/kabukabubaby/s..
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1943387108049129495) Normally, the developers are charged a fee for software development, but they are going to make it all public and offer it for free. Normally, this would mean that developers would not be able to make a living, but if they win one seat in the Diet and become a political party, 10 engineers will be able to "make a living without making sales! That's the policy.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1943387667313406334) I think it's a novel and really smart idea, but I guess it's too novel to be understood without chewing it up and explaining it. It probably sounds insane or unrealistic at first glance.
>  Since they claim that they only write in their manifestos what they are responsible for realizing, what they write is feasible.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1943394908674625834) Normally, you have to pay to have a system made, so there is a compulsion to use it, but with open source, it's free, so it's a matter of whether you want to use it or not. The "Hearing Aid AI" released in March is already being used by several local governments, so it's the same thing.

> [a89012766](https://x.com/a89012766/status/1943457969460646283) really around the corner
>  Open source is used by some government -> Everyone starts to have a sense of how useful it is -> It spreads.
>  and it's been said that
>  It's hard to convey the question that it can be done without a political party, nor that it can be done because no profit is generated (no concept of bidding, no speed)...
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1943582010527871324) I see what you mean with this comment. I think we also need to tell them that when political parties use party grants, there is no need to bid for projects, so there is no need to decide on specifications in advance, and they can quickly experiment and make improvements!
>  It's a path that allows public systems to be implemented at the speed of a venture.

> [SkyAlive2025](https://x.com/SkyAlive2025/status/1943445928595329117) I feel that there is a division in the Japanese IT industry that is rooted in certain technological changes and it is showing here. In order to understand each other and resolve this, I think we urgently need people with a high resolution to technology on the political side.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1943495732125933899) I really agree. I think that unless we have more politicians who understand technology well and can explain its impact on politics to politicians, we will be drowning in an environment where technological change is likely to affect our society.

> [kagumiyabi](https://x.com/kagumiyabi/status/1943438381939122598) 90% of the people in the field are at the "oops sos?" level like that.
>  "This person can program!" someone who can use Excel functions. level.
>  For example, if the formula for calculating taxes is wrong and you incur damages, you can be compensated if the software was outsourced. If it is self-developed, you have to take responsibility.
>  That's why we outsource.
- don't need to understand open source, and since those people are general users, it doesn't matter whether they "pay another company to make it for them and use it" or "use something that is free and open to the public". It's the people in the information-system role who have to figure out which one to use.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1943498287480287404) If the system is common to all local governments, the know-how of each local government will be easier to use in other local governments. Local governments lacking manpower and money will also be able to use the know-how and products made by other local governments, which will be easier compared to the situation where "we have to do everything ourselves from scratch.

> [NakayosiHitori](https://x.com/NakayosiHitori/status/1943543074279276760) I am just passing by. Open source, I learned a lot.
>  I believe that by deploying the same system model nationwide, it will be easier to collect data and manage statistics.
>  I think that some systems can be used by local governments, unless new devices are used or something, but is this perception incorrect?
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1943582226098327762) That's right!
> [NakayosiHitori](https://x.com/NakayosiHitori/status/1943582634770338276) Thanks for your response!
>  If it is realistically possible to use the system and the decision to use it is left to each municipality, it seems to me that there would be many advantages for the municipalities, since they would simply have one more option!
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1943582873140801549)! It's important for people to understand that "more choices."

> [toorigakali](https://x.com/toorigakali/status/1943485246286057903) I am concerned about whether or not the maintenance of the system will be covered by the party subsidy, and whether or not it will take a lot of manpower to run the system. I wonder if it will be possible.
>  I'm not sure.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1943494664775954908) Since the detailed specifications of the program are made public through open source, maintenance, etc. can be performed by people other than the "organization that created it," and the cost will be lower than if it were monopolized by a single company. I think the cost will be lower than in a situation where one company has a monopoly. Security measures can also be speedy because it is possible to apply the same measures taken by other local governments throughout the country.
> [toorigakali](https://x.com/toorigakali/status/1943498115220206028) Thank you!
>  Then I wonder how much security can be strengthened.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1943502528877871443) Yes, I agree. Strengthening the security aspect is a very important issue. Currently, there are frequent cases in municipalities with limited budgets where "outsourced systems are installed and then left with major security holes due to lack of maintenance contracts," so I think open source will lead to improvements.
