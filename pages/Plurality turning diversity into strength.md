---

2024-04-03
The world we live in is full of diversity. When people from different backgrounds work together, that diversity can be a powerful force. [Plurality," written by [[Audrey Tang]] and [[Glen Weyl]] and produced in collaboration with the community, is a book that embodies the value of diversity and collaboration. The book conveys the message that people from different backgrounds can come together to share knowledge and understanding to build a more prosperous society.

# New Methods of Knowledge Propagation and Understanding Construction
.
The Japanese version of the Plurality project is more than a translation effort; it is a testing ground for new methods of knowledge transfer and understanding construction. The project is led by Yasukazu Nishio, author of "[[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]]" and a pioneer in promoting the visualization and sharing of thoughts.

# active reading
.
In this project, the "[[active reading]]" method advocated by [[Toshiyuki Masui]], a well-known UI research professor, is practiced. Participants read books using Scrapbox and deepen their understanding by actively interacting with the text. Nishio is attempting to extend active reading and move away from traditional unidirectional knowledge transfer to interactive, two-way learning. This approach encourages readers to participate as active knowledge seekers rather than passive recipients of information.

# magic of cooperation
Mr. [[Kosei Yamagata]], a well-known translator of Piketty's "Capital in the 21st Century" and ESR's "Kyan to Bazaar," participated in this project. Mr. Yamagata's extensive experience and knowledge add a new dimension to the project. The true value of the project, however, lies not in simply translating a single book. It is the coming together of diverse personalities and knowledge that creates a new form of cooperation. Shared knowledge deepens each participant's "understanding within" and creates a "joint understanding" as a group. This process is not limited to translation, but also leads to the growth of the participants themselves.

# welcome participants
.
The Plurality project welcomes new participants. Your perspectives and knowledge may enrich the project. In the process of cooperation, you will also gain new knowledge. Through cooperation that transcends language boundaries, you can be a part of transforming the world's diversity into strength.
