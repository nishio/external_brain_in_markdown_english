Each employee is worth approximately 4.5 million yen. He is a mirror of a manager.

>  In addition, in a company like Cybozu, where the employee stock ownership plan is 100% subsidized, it is not uncommon for employees to have company stock assets worth hundreds of millions of yen at the time of retirement.

> [buffett_code](https://twitter.com/buffett_code/status/1660121843393765376) If a businessman wants to build assets, he should join a company that actively distributes SO or has a slightly higher subsidized stock ownership plan.
>  But that is by no means a company with a good annual income.
>
>  Even if your annual income is tens of millions of yen, taxes will take up to half of it, and if you have the extraordinary ability to get such a job in the first place, you will have no trouble.

I understand the temptation to think, "My company is not necessarily going to grow, and there must be better stocks than my company," but the advantage of gains at the moment of purchase through subsidies is too strong an advantage.

>  100% Cybozu subsidy means that you can actually buy Cybozu shares at half price.

> [buffett_code](https://twitter.com/buffett_code/status/1660167164886929409) When I talk about this kind of thing, people say, "How can you put all your eggs in one basket?" and I don't deny that you can do whatever you want. I don't deny it, and you can do whatever you want, but I think the essence of the matter is not that you can't diversify your risk, but that you are clinging to a company that is not growing and working for it.

>  If you don't have enough assets to diversify and protect, it doesn't make sense.
