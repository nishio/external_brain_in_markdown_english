title: "Scaffolding Network"

    - I thought about it after [[Experiment with importing wiki into Scrapbox]].
        - [[keyword extraction]], not
        - Not [[Link Suggestions]].
    - Automatically create a temporary network as "[[scaffold]]",
        - Humans should be able to move over it at high speed.
        - Related: [[Fast movement within the knowledge network]].

- [[pScaffoldNetwork]]
    - A prototype was created.

- Impressions after using it
    - Finding 3 relevant pages out of 300 pages is difficult without links, it can be
    - Generating "Questions
        - 'What kind of sentence relates to this part of this sentence?'
    - The link fails from time to time.
        - This also strongly generates the question
            - 'What? These strings of letters are keywords? What on earth did they have in common?"
        - There are some things we don't have in common after reading this.
        - But it's the driving force behind the organizing.
            - Two of the three are more appropriate to change the position of the dividing line.


:

```
Notation shake
	[Drucker, Japan]
	[Drucker, until the end, Japan].
	[Drucker, now Japan].
```

This is not an appropriate keyword, but it does successfully link Drucker to three things that have been written about Japan
