Interesting explanation of the Buddhist transformation process.
    - In [[Sthanipata]], awakening was immediate and not time-consuming
    - However, during the time of the Parthian school of Buddhism, it was necessary to practice for a long period of time, called "three abstinence kalpas".
- In primitive Buddhist times, "Buddha" appears in the plural
    - It wasn't about Gautama personally, it was "the awakened ones."
    - Setsuji Aribu deified into a single transcendent being, "He is not a human being, he is a Buddha".
        - coined the term "bodhisattva" and limited what it refers to to the Buddha
- Belief in stupas and sacred places occurred during the period of the Parthian school of Buddhism.
    - At that time, India was the first to trade with the Roman Empire, exporting pepper.
- In the midst of all this, Mahayana Buddhism happens.
    - It's very Lutheran.
