interesting
- I hadn't thought of this idea.
- The custom of adding [[iconic notation]] to human speech is also used in books.
    - It's a quote from a book, but it looks like a virtual person speaking.
        - I once created a Twitter bot that would reply to Twitter with excerpts from books, but it would be interesting if the Scrapbox bot replied with book quotes in iconography.
- The Problem of Too Large Links] occurs when many pages grow out of a single book and are linked using the current Scrapbox, but on the other hand, I want to be able to "follow" them from individual pages.
    - The solution with the current specs... as I was writing this, I thought [[Scrapbox link specs are wrong...]]...
