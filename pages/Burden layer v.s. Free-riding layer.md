title: "Burden layer v.s. Free-riding layer"

New angle of [[burden layer]] v.s. [free-riding layer
- Note that it is interesting to discover [[an axis of conflict that differs from the existing dichotomy]].
        - [binary opposition

Mr. Tamaki must have pandered to that segment of the population. It succeeded as an election hairpin, but it will be very difficult to implement.
>  >realwavebaba: I think PM Tamaki will be more popular than PM Ishiba. The Ishimaru phenomenon may be supported by a segment of the population that realizes that "handing out handouts means taking from us". x.com/ikedanob/statu...

> [realwavebaba](https://x.com/realwavebaba/status/1851924264238334065) In reality, the correct policy goal is to replace the invisible tax [[cost of social security]] with a [[consumption tax]] and have the [[free rider]] class [[bear]] a certain amount of the [[burden]]. The correct policy goal would be to reduce taxes on the [[working]] class by making the [[free rider]] class pay a certain [[burden]], but there is no doubt that there will be considerable friction. It is no longer right vs. left, but better to divide on the axis of burdened vs. free rider.

Usually it's hard to win elections under [[majority rule]] because it's the minority that bears the burden, but the situation has changed because of the widespread interpretation among the working-age population that they're being overburdened by the elderly.
- (Whether that interpretation is correct or not is not determined here.)
