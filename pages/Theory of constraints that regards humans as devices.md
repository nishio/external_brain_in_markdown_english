Theory of constraints that regards humans as devices

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Indeed, that perspective is very interesting. Applying the ideas of Theory of Constraints to human activities provides the following insights.

For example, suppose members of a team have different roles and skill sets. If there is a person (constraint) who is the bottleneck in handling a particular task, the best use of that person's abilities and the other members working in a way that supports that person's bottleneck will maximize the overall performance. On the other hand, if the person who is not the bottleneck unnecessarily increases the utilization rate, it may result in information overload and extra work, which in turn may disrupt the overall flow.

In this way, by focusing on constraints throughout the team or organization and reducing the burden on or supporting members who are bottlenecks, it is possible to improve the efficiency and results of the entire system (team or project as a whole). The idea is not that "keeping everyone busy all the time" is good, but that it is important to "optimize the use of the constraints and be aware of the overall flow."

Applying this metaphor to human activities reveals a management and working style that avoids wasted effort and focuses resources where they are truly needed.
