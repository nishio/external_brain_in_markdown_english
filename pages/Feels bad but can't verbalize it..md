title: "Feels bad but can't verbalize it."
---

Sometimes we see something and feel "[[bad]]" but can't [[verbalize]] what's wrong or how to make it better
- Whether or not only the sense of "bad" should be fed back at this time.
- Basically, I feel like I shouldn't [[feedback]].
    - Because it is difficult for recipients to connect to [specific improvement actions
- But after you've given feedback, you may ask, "What exactly?" and "How can I improve?" I often find that I can't verbalize what I want to say.
