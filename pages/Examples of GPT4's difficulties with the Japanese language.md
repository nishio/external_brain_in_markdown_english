Examples include physical skills such as how to ride a bike or swim, or the ability to "read the air" of a culture.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Our apologies. I made an error. The term "taxic type knowledge" is incorrect. The correct term was referring to the concept of "taxit knowledge", not "taxis-type knowledge" or "tax knowledge".
Tacit knowledge" refers to knowledge that is not explicitly verbalized and is tacit.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Yes, you're right. "Tacit knowing" or "tacit knowledge" is the correct term I was referring to.

It's like someone unfamiliar with Japanese trying to explain something in Japanese and making a mistake.
