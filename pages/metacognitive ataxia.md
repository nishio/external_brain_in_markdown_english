title: "metacognitive ataxia"
---

I was interested in some sort of bad mental state X that people fall into. But I couldn't think of a good word to describe it.
- For a long time, the term "[problems caused by the elderly (esp. gerontocracy, and elderly people's control over the young)" was used.
    - Related: [[One symptom of aging]] [[countermeasures against aging]].

However, I began to think that this is not an appropriate expression because "it can occur regardless of age.
- I coined the term [[smelly person]] as an improvement.
- This is a vivid metaphor, and it helped me visualize the situation.
- On the other hand, it's too vivid and looks like "mere abuse".
    - The expression "in a state of mind X" would be described as "smelly."

consider further
- The essence of the problem is that you can no longer recognize that your cognition is in a strange state (= smells stinky).
- In other words, [[metacognition]] is out of whack.
- Hence the term "metacognitive ataxia."
