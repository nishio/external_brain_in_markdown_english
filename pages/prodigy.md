title: "prodigy"
---

[https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/神童](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/神童)
> Originally, those who are called child prodigies mean that their athletic ability, academic performance, etc. are superior to those of their age at this point in time, not necessarily that the abilities they possess are particularly outstanding. In short, it may not mean that they have superior abilities, but rather that they are just maturing faster than their peers. It is thought that the term was coined because so-called mere [[early ripening]] people are often called prodigies in their youth.
>  In many cases, an ability that is marvelous and amazing when exhibited by a child is a common and ordinary ability in an adult. For example, if a 3-4 year old child paints a realistic oil painting, he or she is a child prodigy, but if he or she grows up with only that ability, no one will pay attention.
