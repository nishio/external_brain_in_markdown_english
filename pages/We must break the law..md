>  "In Japan, you are not allowed to break [[the law]]."
>  "In the U.S., individuals who break the law are fined or imprisoned, but corporate [[Compliance]] is different. There are people in Western society who believe that if the penalty is less than the cost of compliance, then it is not OK to break the law, but rather the CEO owes [[fiduciary duty]] to break the law."
>  The idea is that if the development of technology has simply not kept pace with changes in the law, and CEOs are convinced that there are only positive benefits for the company, its users, and society, then they are allowed to ignore current laws and put them into practice. This seems to be especially true in [[Silicon Valley]].
