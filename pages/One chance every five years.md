title: "One chance every five years"
---

There are opportunities that come along only once every 5-10 years or so.

The frequency that a given opportunity is once every five years cannot be estimated without five years of observation.
- So [[Individuals with short observation periods]] have a bias to underestimate [[the value of the opportunity]].

On the other hand, the frequency of opportunities varies from person to person
- What is a once-in-five-years opportunity for one person A is a once-in-six-months opportunity for another person B.
    - Due to the person's own actions
        - Individuals with many "[[Opportunity Taking Behavior]]".
    - Depends on the environment
        - In some cases, the surroundings are giving it to the person without the person being aware of it.
        - Cases where parents are aware that they are giving
            - [[Experience Disparity]].
            - [[Experience investment]] is made by parents who see the value in making things "[I've done it.
                - Depends on the parents' [[financial resources]].
            - Some parents give their children computers, some don't.
                - Some families do not have Internet access at home.
                - Some parents buy their children VR equipment that costs tens of thousands of dollars.
                - These days, giving access to AI is another source of disparity.
        - [[Opportunity information]] is given by parents and teachers.
                - [[How do you know what your life choices are?]]

Of all the occasions in my life over the past 25 years where I have been approached casually, like in a chat room, and turned it down not so much because of a strong rejection, but because I was "kind of unsure or not into it," I can easily think of four or five that have never been similarly approached again in the past 25 years.
- What would have happened if I had accepted the opportunity is unknown.
- But from subsequent experience.
    - This type of limited opportunity turns into a [[track record]] of "[[I've done it.]]" if you take it on and produce passable results.
        - It doesn't have to be my idea of a perfect line.
                - [[Harmful perfectionism]]
        - The [[track record]] becomes [[Repeatable tools]] for subsequent game play.
        - [The concept of "products instead of business cards
        - It's significant that it's one, not zero.
        - Three related pieces will rapidly expand the range of applications.
                - [[Make three kinds of works.]]
        - At first I wrote "Achievements change to [[Rare resources]]," but I changed the wording because they can be used as many times as you want after they are acquired.
            - Opportunities to acquire achievements are just rare.

I first wrote "[[opportunity]]" as "[[opportunity]]", but I corrected it because I felt there was a subtle difference in nuance.
