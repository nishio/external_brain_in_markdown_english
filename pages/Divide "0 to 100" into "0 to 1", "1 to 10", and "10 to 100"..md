title: 'Divide "0 to 100" into "0 to 1", "1 to 10", and "10 to 100".'

> Personally, I feel comfortable with the separation of "[[0→100]]" into "[[0→1]]", "[[1→10]]", and "[[10→100]]".
>  "0 → 1", I'll give it a try for now.
>  Enjoy "1 to 10
>  "10 to 100" Look it up and do it right.

> [kawahiii](https://twitter.com/kawahiii/status/1700751126650581253) I think what is important is different in "0→1", "1→10" and "10→100" of "0→100". I'm talking about that.

>  ------

>  ① "0 → 1" of "0 → 100
>
>  If there are 100 steps in doing something, almost all of us just think "I want to do it," but we don't go from 0 to 1, so I think we are in the top few percent just by starting.
>
>  So, I think the important thing in 0 → 1 is to "just play with it".
>
>  I'll do push-ups for now. I'll go to the city swimming pool for now. I'm going to try playing online chess for now. I'll try listening to an English app for now.
>
>  Of course, you can't learn to swim without getting in the pool.

>  ② "1 to 10" of "0 to 100
>
>  Then, 1 to 10 is the stage where you enjoy trying things out by hand. If you focus on efficiency, you will get bored and quit. Or you try to set an unreasonable schedule. It happens often, doesn't it? It happens to me too.
>
>  "Doing well" is a 10 -> 100 phase...1 -> 10 you have to enjoy anyway. You get swamped. It's too much of a bug to try to do it efficiently without getting swamped.
>
>  So, I think the important thing in 1→10 is to "do a lot of points that you can enjoy.
>
>  They do not practice passing or lifting, but only play games. They ignore basic form training and just swim breaststroke. They don't restrict their diet and do nothing but bench press.
>
>  If you enjoy the results, if you get swamped, then you will start thinking "I want to get better" on your own, big or small, and I think it is not too late.
>
>  If you try various things and don't enjoy them, just quit. You weren't suited for it.
>
>  ------

>  ③ "10 to 100" of "0 to 100
>
>  I've done it. 10 to 100 is the "do it well" stage. I think it's good to start here and ask people and research "How can I do it better? There are many efficient ways to do things in the world. There are methods that are specific to a field.
>
>  So, I think the important thing in 10 to 100 is to "research and practice properly".
>
>  No matter how physically gifted a person is, he cannot become a member of Japan's national soccer team without specialized training. You cannot play in Koshien; a wise man a thousand years ago could not get a passing score on the University of Tokyo exam.
>
>  To "do well" you must have the ability to learn and put it to use.
>
>  ------
>
>  Each phase has different things that are important; you can't get better by doing nothing but research if you haven't started 0→1. You can't get better by not getting into the pool. On the other hand, if you are in the phase of 10 to 100, you will not improve if you just play aimlessly, saying, "It's important to just give it a try for now. Even if you are just "having fun," your progress will be slow.
>
>  Sometimes you tell a child who doesn't know how to have fun yet, "You should do it this way," and he or she says, "I don't want to do it anymore.
>
>  In this way, I personally often use "0→100" as I feel more comfortable by dividing it into "0→1", "1→10", and "10→100".
>
>  「0→1」
>  I'll give it a try anyway.
>
>  「1→10」
>  Enjoy
>
>  「10→100」
>  I'll look into it and do it right.

>  In summary, it looks like this.

>  So.
>  What is important in "0→1", "1→10", and "10→100" is different from "0→100", isn't it? I mean...
