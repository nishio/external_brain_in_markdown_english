Summary of 2020 Activities
- There should be an explanation of how to use it for people who don't know the previous context so that they can use it as soon as others want to use it.
    - â†’I used [[Tools to organize your head]].
- About last year's development
    - Fundamental data structure changes
        - I want to support software-assisted resolution of a situation where there is too much information to collect.
        - To do this, it must be possible to move multiple stickies together smoothly
        - The data structure used in the previous version could not do it, so we made a radical data structure change.
    - 1 line 1 sticky note import
        - Adding stickies one by one is hard work.
        - Added the ability to import text as one line and one sticky.
        - Simply pasting a long sentence does not make it a "good sticky note".
        - Need assistance in dividing long sentences into appropriate sizes as sticky notes in the future.
