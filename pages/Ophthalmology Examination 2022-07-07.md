[[Ophthalmological Examination]]
Taking a day off to go to the ophthalmologist for a routine checkup for [[glaucoma]].
- It's been three months.
- He said the progress is so slow that the next one should be in six months.
- And while I was at it, I got a prescription for glasses.
- I made [[glasses with power]] for the first time.
