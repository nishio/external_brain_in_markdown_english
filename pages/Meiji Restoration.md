<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt-4/icon' alt='gpt-4.icon' height="19.5"/>The Meiji Restoration was a period of rapid modernization in Japan from the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate to the Meiji Era, when Japan became more competitive internationally by actively incorporating technology and knowledge from foreign countries. The following is an episode that can be applied to today's age of advanced AI: "The exchange between [[Kaishu Katsu]] and [[Yukichi Fukuzawa]]".
- Kaishu Katsu and Yukichi Fukuzawa were both great Japanese figures active from the end of the Edo period to the Meiji Restoration, and had a major impact on Japan's efforts to modernize. Kaishu Katsu was instrumental in strengthening Japan's naval power and contributed to the modernization of the country. Yukichi Fukuzawa, on the other hand, was an Enlightenment thinker, famous for his preaching of the importance of adopting Western knowledge.
- Despite their different positions and areas of expertise, they formed a friendship and influenced each other because of their common goal to modernize Japan. Their interactions demonstrate how experts from different fields working together to incorporate new technologies and knowledge can contribute to the development of a nation.
- Modern advanced AI technologies can also learn from this episode. More innovative AI technologies can be created when experts from different fields cooperate and combine different knowledge and technologies. Another lesson that can be learned from the Meiji Restoration period to the present day is that incorporating technology and knowledge from other countries is important for competitiveness.
