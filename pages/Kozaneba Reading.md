title: "Kozaneba Reading"

I noticed that Dr. Masui calls reading while editing texts on Scrapbox [[Scrapbox Reading]], and I realized that what I call "experimenting with deconstructing and rearranging difficult texts on Kozaneba to decipher their structure" is Kozaneba Reading.

Example
    - [[Kozaneba: The Formation of Chinese Hua Yan through the Fusion of the Hua Yan Sutra and Zhuangzi]]
