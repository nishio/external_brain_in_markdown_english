- The result of thinking about how to express the idea for the explanation in the study session of "Study Session 3 on "Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning"" (2022) was produced. Creation of Meaning] (2022).
- In the process of preparing the materials for the "Concept Map Study Group," I reflected on the explanations given in the study group on the process of experience and the creation of meaning, and since the notation invented in the process of these explanations has been used for a long time since then, I thought that this method of expression should have a name.


- As I was drawing [[Felt Sense and Symbol Diagrams]], I began to think that drawing the boundaries with dark solid black lines did not feel right, since [[felt sense]] ([[meaning]]) has no clear boundaries.
    - [[word created by retaining the first syllable (or two) of a word]]

Easy to express overlap
- The very earliest expression is this
        - [[Story intersections become atoms.]]
    - [[non-numerical]]
- Later, [[Dark Thin Circle Diagram]] was invented as a convenient representation of [blurred circle
- Based on this, the concept of [[non-numerical]] is simply expressed in [[Schematic diagram of innumerable features]].
    - This was found to look the same as [[unparalleled in history (unparallelled)]] after the fact
