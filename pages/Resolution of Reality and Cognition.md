title: "Resolution of Reality and Cognition"

from  [[Resolution of reality]]
- [Resolution of reality and Cognitive Resolution

Terms that may be related, but not used in any particular way.

The "real X" could be misinterpreted as being paired with the "imaginary X."

    - [[reality]] of (the world outside of yourself, not in your mind).
- [[recognition]] (in the sense of how it is recognized).
- (in the sense that there are cases where it's finely discriminated and cases where it's roughly discriminated) [[resolution (e.g. display, dpi)]].

Once again, I'm thinking "[[Resolution of perception of things]]" or something like that.
