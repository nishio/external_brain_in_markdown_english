- They say, "It's so good, we really want people who are doing advanced intellectual production to use it."

- I was using [[RHODIA]] as a notepad thing, or I felt there was a difference.
- There's a sense of implicit expectation in a paper notepad that it will survive for a reasonably long period of time without disappearing.
    - For example, if my wife asks me to buy A, B and C, I write it on a paper notepad.
        - (If you don't have a notepad, write it in a message to your wife in iMessage on your iPhone, for example.)
        - This expects it to "not disappear until the shopping task is completed."
        - If you remember it in your brain, it can disappear, you are avoiding it.
    - On the other hand, would I write shopping notes on this boogie board? I thought.
        - I knew you wouldn't write.
        - Because while you're walking to the store, you might think of something and want to write it down.
        - If you have shopping notes written on a boogie board and expect them to stay there until the task is completed, you can't write down what comes to mind right away.
    - So this device, by virtue of having only one display surface, is extending short-term memory closest to the brain.
    - Side note: What if I wrote shopping notes on a boogie board and took pictures with my phone?
        - If you have a smart phone, I have a feeling you'd write it down on your phone.
        - Situations where shopping tasks are communicated verbally and written down, and you don't need the linguistic cost of doing it in writing because you already have the language of what you need to write down.
            - You can press the voice text input button and write with your voice.
        - Diagrams can fall during a walk.

- Why do we write notes?
    - Observe your own behavior, what tools you use to write at what time.

2024/3/31
- The memo should be atomic, because it all disappears with the touch of a button.
- It doesn't have to be atomic at the moment it's written out, but it should promptly become atomic.
- I mean, if there's a mix of different things that need to be erased at different times, then they should be moved to the right place.
