title: "Draft: IT Changes Cause Changes in the Rules of Work"
---

Draft written in January
- see  [[2019 Musashino City Endowed Lecture "IT and Rules Now and in the Future"]]

- Musashino City Endowed Courses] "[[IT and Rules Now and in the Future]]" to be offered at [[Seikei University]] in the second semester of 2019.
- Coordinator [[Kazuhiro Shiozawa]].
- The target audience is mainly students of the [[law school]], all four grades of the four faculties (Faculty of Economics, Faculty of Letters, Faculty of Science and Technology), plus 150 Musashino citizens.
- A gentle introduction to contemporary topics in the area of expertise and its near future
    - I think it would be good to talk about how advances in information technology are changing the rules for how work is done, etc.

- Generational range of audience seems to be wide
    - Different associations with the term information sharing
        - Post paper on a physical bulletin board
        - Contact them in turn through the telephone network.
        - circulate a circular notice (e.g. to the public)
        - Posting on electronic bulletin boards
        - Send Email
        - Batch reporting on mailing lists
        - Send a message to one person in chat
        - In some cases, today's college students have a generation of class chat rooms on line in high school.
    - I guess we should check the history first and create a common understanding.

Flexible working style
    - [[individual support]]
    - Attitude toward the individual
        - The opposite approach to [[mass production]] industrial products
- Payroll Tables
    - Technology that does not face each individual, but bundles people together by job class or other characteristics to handle them efficiently.
- Cost of individualized service
    - Absorbed by information processing technology
        - [[Cybozu HR system#5bb4465aaff09e00007dd9c4]].
    - Communication on groupware instead of physical interviews

hierarchical organization
- Organizational structure suitable for controlling a large number of people in a situation where information distribution is a bottleneck
        - [[command and control]]
    - An organization is composed of people who issue orders and people who follow those orders.
- It separates the "thinkers" from the "doers."
    - Those who act are the first to detect changes in reality.
    - If reality doesn't change, it doesn't matter if the thinkers are separated.
        - If not, the inability to think based on the changes you perceive will be fatal.
- Responsibility to ask questions, responsibility to insist on what you want to do
    - > As the program for working mothers was being expanded and expanded, a sales man complained to Aono, "Why do you support only mothers so much? What did Aono say? He said, "Well, tell me what you want me to do.

Environmental Changes
- The reason we set "rules" and make people follow them is because there are benefits to be gained by doing so.
    - Law is not ethics or religion.
    - If the situation doesn't meet, if the current rules are disadvantageous, they will be amended.
    - The rules of the country, the laws, also have means of amendment.
    - The same goes for internal rules; rules that are detrimental to working efficiently should be revised.

- [[partial access right]]
