title: "Equality and kindness are two different things."
---

Treating people with [[equality]] and [[Kindness to others]] are two different things.
For example, suppose there is a person A who believes that "human beings are like dust in the eyes of the universe." If another person B is dying in front of A, A does not try to save him because he does not feel it is worthwhile to save him.
