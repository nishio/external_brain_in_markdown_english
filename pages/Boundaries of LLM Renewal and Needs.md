title: "Boundaries of LLM Renewal and Needs"

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1784227485124853932/quick_promote_web/intro) When [[LLM]] [[LLM]] [[evolves]] more and more, the decision to "keep using the old version for fear of [[ compatibility]] and other changes without much thought", you will be forced to make a decision between "make the latest version and some features will break" and "keep using the old version for fear of breaking it", but if you learn from history, the latter is just a postponement of the cost, and eventually you will be forced to raise the Eventually, you will have to raise the price.

I tried to write a follow-up to this, but I can't verbalize it well.

[[Test cases before refactoring]]
[[mechanically verifiable KPI]].
[[clear needs]].

Not even close.

Some tasks are easy or difficult to set mechanically verifiable KPIs, or difficult tasks need to be divided

When we go to realize an understandable need, we encounter the difficulty of setting this KPI.
Cases where [[humans as changing parts]] are woven into the system
otherwise the case
In the former, it expects [[human learning ability]], so it cannot be used for [[people who do not learn]].

4 is different, from the perspective of those designing systems that incorporate AI, the term boundary plane refers to two different things, one is the division of tasks between humans and AI, and where the lines need to be drawn in the design, and the other is the boundary plane in the needs space, which seems to have no language

- Boundaries in human-AI task sharing:.
    - In designing an AI system, determine which tasks will be carried out by the AI and which will be carried out by humans
- Boundary surfaces in need space:.
    - The point of contact between the services and functions that the system should provide and the actual needs of the user.

Hmmm, no.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Look at the discussion below, guess what they're trying to say, and give me a clue to verbalize what they can't verbalize.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The following key points can be gleaned from this discussion
1. In designing an AI system, it is important to set appropriate boundary surfaces for the division of tasks between humans and AI. Clarifying which tasks are to be performed by AI and which are to be performed by humans will increase the efficiency, effectiveness, and user acceptance of the system.
2. another important boundary plane is between the user's need space and the functionality provided by the system. If this boundary plane is unclear, a gap between the value of the system and user expectations may arise.
3. the boundary aspects of the needs space are particularly difficult to verbalize and are often ignored, but are essential for improving UX. Efforts should be made to better understand user needs through market research and feedback.
4. it is effective to divide tasks for which KPI setting is difficult into smaller, more manageable parts. In processes with significant human involvement, it is often difficult to set specific numerical targets.
5. incorporating human learning ability and adaptability into the system design and providing continuous training and feedback mechanisms will help improve the efficiency of human-mediated processes.

Behind their words may be an awareness of the need to optimize systems that utilize rapidly evolving AI, not only from a technical design perspective, but also from a multifaceted perspective, including how humans and AI should collaborate, matching user needs, and developing human resources.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1784278400875794674) Prompt is indeed a new programming language, but it is a machine language for a "new calculator called LLM" and is model dependent. If a user is satisfied with the level of writing in a natural language and it works well on any LLM, that's fine. If the user is satisfied with that level of performance, then it is fine, but if the user is not satisfied with that level of performance, then it is not a problem. From there, it becomes a cliff due to model dependence.
- [[prompt is machine language]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1784279187660193838) At this point, writing in a more abstract language and creating optimized prompts for the target LLM becomes a thing to do. This is the same thing that gave rise to [[C]], which can be compiled against a wide variety of calculators.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1784280648112587035) I see. In other words, "areas where the market has been too small for anyone to enter" where there is no competition will be supplied by natural language programming, and areas that have been covered by software will be shifted to more abstract and high-level languages by becoming [[red ocean]] in the degree of prompting. The result is a shift to higher-level languages with a higher level of abstraction by becoming a [red ocean

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1784282015212478949) Human description of prompts in natural language is equivalent to machine language. You may think it is impossible for ordinary people to use machine language, but at present, ordinary people are in the state of realizing "controlling the behavior of machines by pushing physical buttons" in the virtual reality of GUI, which is even before machine language.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1784282520680624415) So only a few people get to write prompts, and many others push a button that executes a prompt that is already written. There will only be more new programmers of the kind that write prompts, just like when LL was created and more programmers said I don't know C but I can do LL.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1784282832657174878) This is not "what I was trying to verbalize", but it's a related topic, so I just spit out what came to mind
