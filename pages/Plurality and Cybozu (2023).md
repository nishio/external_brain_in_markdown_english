title: "Plurality and Cybozu (2023)"
---

2023-12-12 I created this document to talk about what Plurality is within Cybozu, but I felt it would be useful for people outside the company, so I published it.

[[Plurality]] and [[Cybozu]].
- What is Plurality?
    - A concept proposed by [[Audrey Tang]] and [[Glen Weyl]].
    - [[Plurality: Technology for Collaborative Diversity and Democracy]]
            - [[collaboration]]
            - [[diversity]]
        - [[Technology to help diverse people work together to get things done]].
    - Cybozu's objective: [[Creating a society full of teamwork]]
            - [[teamwork]]
            - [[100 men, 100 ways]]
    - This is an ideal in the same direction
            - [[empathy]] can be done ([[Sympathy for ideals]])

I can't introduce all of them, so I'll just pick and choose interesting topics.
    - [[broad listening]]
    - The development of technology to duplicate and distribute information has made it easier for one person to communicate ideas to a large number of people.
    - However, when a large number of people transmit information, the volume of information received by one person becomes enormous, and the person drowns in the flood of information.
    - In a society and company where people actively communicate, technology that supports listening to the opinions of many will be important.

        - Figure from "[Not subjective or objective, but from the subjectivity of one to the subjectivity of many.
    - > (Technological advances) enable "broad listening," where millions of people can hear the essence extracted from the distribution of opinions of their peers, enhancing democratic deliberation on a large scale.

- [[Groupware as a medium]].
    - In the past, the media were occupied by certain companies, such as newspapers and television stations, which controlled what was disseminated.
    - With the birth of social media, we now live in a world where anyone can transmit anything.
    - This is beneficial but also distorted by the fact that it is maintained by advertising revenue. It is designed to take more time away from the user because increasing "engagement" is profitable.
    - > [[Productivity software]] sales...are a highly profitable business model. This type of software often includes a [[social media]] component and is sold to companies to improve productivity. ...The purpose of this software is to help employees [[work together to achieve common goals]] and [[adapt to change]].
    - > New [[pro-social media]] will be nurtured naturally in this environment and then marketed in a broader social context to other organizations interested in solidarity and dynamism.
    - What Audrey Tang calls [[productivity software]] is what Cybozu has called [groupware

    - [[digital democracy]]
    - In "democracy," "indirect democracy" has been widely practiced, in which people elect "delegates" to debate on their behalf.
    - This was just an operation at a time when information processing technology was in its infancy. Better technology leads to better teamwork.
    - In the future, a wide variety of local governments will make a wide variety of attempts to "better communicate with their citizens.
    - > The key to moving democracy forward is for teens and young people to come up with really good ideas and for them to be [[understood and]] implemented by the senior people [[in a shorter time]]. Younger people, being digital natives, do not believe that upload bandwidth once every four years is enough, and latency is too high. They prefer to collaborate on a daily basis.
    - > Opening up the [[agenda-setting authority]] to the people would return the people's approval or disapproval of each agenda to the people. Public officials no longer have exclusive ownership of agendas.
