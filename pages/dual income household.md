title: "dual income household"
---

I haven't scrutinized either interpretation of the data to see which one is correct, both are based on the data, but it's interesting to see the disagreement, so I made a note of it anyway.

> [wildriverpeace](https://x.com/wildriverpeace/status/1836242384923066531) The usual figures that include part-time workers are used to mislead people into thinking that working couples are the majority in the world. The reality is that more than half of the working couples are part-timers, so the number is almost equally divided among full-time, full-time, and part-timers.

> [wildriverpeace](https://x.com/wildriverpeace/status/1836243432173674826) What is scary is that the Cabinet Office's White Paper on Gender Equality showed a correct graph separating full-time and part-time workers in 2022. However, this graph has disappeared since 2023. What is the force at work here?

> [ShinagawaJP](https://x.com/ShinagawaJP/status/1836737989155893322) The ironclad rule is to look at "percentages" rather than numbers in these situations.
>  "Wife's full-time employment rate" (the percentage of those whose work is their main occupation) in 2007 and 2022 shows an increase from 25% to 54% for those in Alaska, and from 27% to 44% for those in the United States.
>  The reason why the actual number has not increased is that the age structure of dual-earner households has changed and the number of young people has decreased by two-thirds.
>
>  Is the increase only part-time? Is the government hiding something? and specious post, but the data shows that it is completely misguided.
>
>  (*) We originally wanted to look at changes in "hours of work," but the 2007 survey did not take the indicator we wanted (hours of work for married couples), so we graphed another similar indicator (primary occupation of work).
>  The percentage of "work-based workers" tends to be 1 to 2 percentage points higher than the percentage of full-time workers (35 hours or more per week) in the government statistics.

> [ShinagawaJP](https://x.com/ShinagawaJP/status/1836738601658548666) Nowadays, nearly half of the people raising children are working full time together. The era of "working together but within the range of support" is coming to an end.
>  It is time to end talking about things with the old knowledge, preconceived notions, so to speak, of "full-time, full-time, and part-time in three equal parts".

> [ShinagawaJP](https://x.com/ShinagawaJP/status/1836742477501596024) Employment patterns have also changed over the past 15 years: the percentage of full-time housewives in their 20s to 40s has halved, while the percentage of full-time employees has doubled.
>  In particular, among "mothers whose youngest child is under 6 years old," the rate of full-time employment is 2.4 times higher (16% ⇒ 37%).
>  This is where you can't read about it in the "overused images" and "copy and paste government white papers" that flow on social networking sites.

> [ShinagawaJP](https://x.com/ShinagawaJP/status/1836752103500333265) If a prominent critic tells you that the median age of death for unmarried men is 66 and that the number of women with full-time jobs has not increased, it is not hard to believe him. It is not unreasonable to believe them.
>  I hope that data will become more accessible and that fewer people will be fooled by number tricks.
