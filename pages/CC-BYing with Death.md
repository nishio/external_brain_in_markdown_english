title: "CC-BYing with Death"
---

2021-06-30
I haven't officially made up my mind yet, but I'm thinking maybe I should make it something like "When I die, all my works placed there shall be [[CC-BY]]" to avoid the bug in copyright law that locks people up for decades without anyone being able to authorize their use.

If I make the Scrapbox jointly editable, I can't change the license at my sole discretion, so I need to get an agreement in advance saying, "If you write in this Scrapbox, you are deemed to have transferred the copyright.

But is that a hassle when I try to use what I wrote here in my own work?
