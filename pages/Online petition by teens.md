The following is an excerpt from [[Meetup with Audrey & Glen]] where Audrey Tang mentions "online petitions by teens and rule changes" based on the English audio of the conversation. A brief commentary follows the quoted portion.

> Quotation excerpts (original in English)
> (Audrey Tang)
>  “Very young people, like banning plastic straw from bubble tea take-out—that is from a 16-year-old. And they also petition for things that affect their life. Because in Taiwan the 15-year-olds go to school at 7:30 a.m., but the class doesn’t actually start until almost 9:00 a.m. So they started a petition that says, ‘We want to sleep two more hours; we want to go to school at 9, not 7:30.’
>  Research shows if you sleep 1 hour more, you get better score than if you study 1 hour more. … They got 5,000 people—many of them teenagers—to sign the petition. They did not get two hours more sleep, but they got one more hour. We really changed the regulation. … So they will find themselves a very strong citizen even before they turn 18—so not waiting for their 18 to cast the first vote, but they can start the conversation in society even when they’re 14 or 15.”

Commentary (Japanese)
- Examples of Online Petitions
    - Specific examples include a 16-year-old high school student suggesting that plastic straws should be banned from tapioca milk tea takeout, and 15-year-old students petitioning that school start times should be delayed.
    - In particular, the petition to change the starting time from 7:30 to 9:00 a.m. was actually partially incorporated into their proposal, as the rules were eventually changed in the form of an hour later (= 8:30 a.m. start, etc.).
- Significance of Young People's Political Participation
    - In Taiwan, even minors aged 15-16 can raise socially important topics through online petition sites (e.g. join.gov.tw), and if they gather 5,000 supporters, they can be debated at the ministerial level.
    - Through the experience of successful petitions and rule changes, as in this example, "even teenagers can feel that they can change their life and learning environment," Audrey emphasizes, "You don't have to wait for the right to vote (age 18) to participate in social discussions from age 14 or 15."
- Background Points
    - The fact that he made a logical appeal based on research data (e.g., sleeping for an hour more will get better grades than studying for an hour more) was a factor in garnering support.
    - In principle, the Taiwanese government has put in place a mechanism to "formally respond (or talk with relevant ministers)" to matters for which the number of online signatures exceeds a certain number, and this has encouraged younger people to participate in politics.

In short, Audrey Tang's episode shows that the [[Taiwanese online petition]] system provides "[[a]] place where even teenagers can have their voices heard in society," and that there have been concrete successes in changing the rules.
