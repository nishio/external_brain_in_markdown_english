I just remembered something I mentioned in a verbal chat the other day, so I'll make a note of it.
    - After [[Daimine Climbing 2024]], I have a feeling that the desire to wear [[Yamabushi]] costumes is more of an [[attachment]] to the material. I have a feeling that this is the case.

However, if the process of thinking about policy and the information and budget constraints that are the materials for thinking about policy are not made public, no matter how capable the voters are, they will not be able to think about it.

I kept pressing "not interested" on every [[advertisement]], and finally "[[nil]]" was promoted.

>  Interesting.
