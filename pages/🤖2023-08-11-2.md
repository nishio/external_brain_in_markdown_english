## Plurality and Polis Study Group
.
- Although not implemented in Polis, some have suggested that it would be nice to have a mechanism to express who you trust.
- I would like to decide who to delegate for each topic. For example, I would like to insert myself into a policy involving digital technology, but as for married couples, I would like to delegate to someone who is actually disadvantaged because he or she is not a party to the issue.
- The image is that people with interest and knowledge will participate. Not everyone is equally interested in every agenda item, nor are they all willing to devote the same amount of time to it.
- It is preferable that more information can be disseminated by those with many enthusiasm interests. Wouldn't a greater weighting by enthusiasm be a more correct statistic?

## X is Y and X is not whole Y
- X is Y and X is not the whole Y.

## Participation in forums of interest
.
- I feel that reading forums of interest is more beneficial than reading hard-headed books.
