title: "On days when I do managerial tasks, I can't do creator tasks."

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1818645470891463156) I was discussing with @takahiroanno and @0xtkgshn who came early before the lunch meeting about how to perform in a busy state, One of them said, "There are two types of tasks [[managerial task]] X and [[creator task]] Y. If you do X, you can't do Y on that day".

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1818647188035240402) If I reinterpret it in my own words, X is important to make decisions quickly and act quickly, so the [[gear]] in the mind [[rotates fast]]. On the other hand, Y needs to accumulate [[best moves]] with an eye on [[long-term value]], without being in a hurry and aiming for [[quick wins]]. In other words, the gears need to slow down. This transition is difficult.
    - [[Parable of the Gears]]
    - [[Throw the ball back.]]
