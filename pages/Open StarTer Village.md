> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1903599946848452820) It was interesting. The game design is [[selfish]] with the goal of maximizing individual victory points, but the flavor of OSS development and the fact that points are entered when the project is finished often make "cooperate to finish the project" the optimal behavior, and "selfishly choose 'altruistic behavior'" This behavior is called "altruistic behavior".
