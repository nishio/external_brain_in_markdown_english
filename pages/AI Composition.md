title: "AI Composition"

> [kur](https://twitter.com/kur/status/1644375654715244544) I'm trying to figure out how to use AI to write sentences, but in the end I think that generating a large number of sentences from various angles, selecting phrases that look good, combining them, and refining them, rather than trying to generate good sentences by devising various prompts, seems to be working better than generating a large number of good sentences from various angles. I have a feeling that it would work better to generate a large number of sentences from various angles, select and combine the phrases that seem to be good, and polish them.

> [kur](https://twitter.com/kur/status/1644376272477499394) What I find interesting about this is that it's not intentional, but it's the same process I usually use when I write without AI. Instead of trying to come up with a plan in my head, I just write the words, select them, and polish them. I am using AI, but it is the same process as usual.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1644378432472772608) I think it's the same for me, I feel like I have a fairly smart assistant next to me who is infinitely willing to wallow and chat with me, and I don't leave the writing to them, but rather the conversation. I don't want to leave the writing to them, but to have a conversation with them.
