- Since the goddess only has bangs, you can't grab her hair after she passes by.
- In other words, it indicates that when good fortune comes your way, if you do not seize it immediately, the opportunity will be lost.
- This proverb tells us that it is important to take immediate action to take advantage of opportunities and good chances. The message is that when good fortune comes our way, we should not hesitate to take advantage of the opportunity.

    - [Forsan et haec olim meminisse juvabit. - Taro Yamashita's Introduction to Latin](https://aeneis.jp/?p=443).
- Interesting that GPT4 associates this with this, but I think it's a bit of a distant association.

- [[Lady Luck]]
- [[fortune]]

Chances are limited.
    - [[Opportunities are limited resources]]
