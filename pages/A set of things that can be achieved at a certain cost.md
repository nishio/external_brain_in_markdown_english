A set of things that can be achieved at a certain cost

- 1: A set of things that can be achieved at a given cost
    - It feels spherical at a certain distance from the start s in the sense that we're used to that cost consciousness.
- 2: New Means X
    - New tools, etc.
    - The cost is lower for the purpose for which the means are suitable.
- 3:
    - 3-1: People who use that means X for purpose G1 for which it is not suitable at all and say "It's not useful at all, it's better to continue as before".
        - Not understanding what X is good for, or
        - He wants to say NO to new thing X, so he uses it for something deliberately unsuitable.
    - 3-2: People who try to do G2 with X alone and it doesn't work.
        - This one is a little off too.
        - Failure to divide the problem.
        - Just do half of the problems for which X is suitable, and do the other half in the conventional way.
        - In situations where there is a choice of means, you can do a wider range of things than you can do by individual means alone.
