title: "Consultants who push unsubstantiated templates."

- The "smart [[consulting]]" is really very, very smart.
- Such people are a scarce resource, so firms assign them only to their top clients.
- For clients that don't, "smart consultants" assign inexperienced newcomers equipped with in-house [[template]].
- Therefore, we understand that clients who feel that "consultants push templates that have no basis in reality" were just not good clients for the firm.
