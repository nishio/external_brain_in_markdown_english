> Are we the mitochondria of the computer? Or is the computer the mitochondria of the human? Digital Nature is my tentative answer to that question. In other words, since there is no end to the question of which is a subset of which, I am going to create a superset of [[digital nature]] on top of human and computer, and make both subsets of [[going along with something]].
