Paper abstract (Bondü & Esser, 2015)
- Topic: How justice sensitivity (JS) and rejection sensitivity (RS) are related to comorbid problems (depression, behavior problems, low self-esteem) in 10-19 year olds with ADHD tendency.
- Subjects/measures: 1,235 German schoolchildren; ADHD symptoms, JS (3 perspectives: victim, observer, and perpetrator), frequency of unfair perception, RS (anxious and angry types), depression, behavior problems, and self-esteem measured by questionnaire.
- Key Results:
    - Participants with ADHD symptoms had higher victim JS, [[perception of unfairness]], and anxiety/anger RS, and lower perpetrator JS.
    - Latent variable path analysis showed that JS and RS partially mediate the association between ADHD symptoms → comorbid problems.
- Implication: In ADHD support, there is significance in incorporating psychoeducational and CBT interventions (e.g., reevaluation of interpretations, relearning social cues) that work on sensitivity to "unfairness" and sensitivity to rejection. *Causality cannot be determined due to the cross-sectional nature of the study.

Terminology Positioning
- Justice Sensitivity (JS): a characteristic of how often one perceives injustice and how strongly one reacts to it. Standard to measure from multiple perspectives of victim/observer/perpetrator. ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7868537/))
- [[Rejection Sensitivity]] (RS): the tendency to anticipate rejection anxiously/angry and react strongly (Downey & Feldman model). ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8714401/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [PubMed [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9768487/?utm](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9768487/?utm) _source=chatgpt.com])

Related Research Map (representative examples)
- JS x Aggression: victim JS and RS associated with elevated reactive/instrumental aggression, perpetrator JS associated with inhibitory direction. Confirmed in a large sample. ([PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25136820/))
    - [[Reactive and instrumental aggression]]
- JS/RS x Depression (longitudinal): youth with higher depression show higher victim JS and (anxiety/angry) RS, an association that persists across time (N=1,665, at time 2). ([Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01446/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28955257/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Interrelationships among multiple "susceptibility" traits: JS, RS, [[provocation susceptibility]], [[moral aversion susceptibility]], etc. are bundled and correlated in ego-orientation/other-orientation and linked to [[aggression]] via hostility attribution bias and anger traits. ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4884733/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    - [[Sensitivity to Provocation and Moral Aversion]]
- ADHD and Social Feedback/RS: Young ADHD tendency is associated with hypersensitivity to [[Social Feedback]] and self-reported RS (task/neurophysiological indicators). ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6395560/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [PubMed [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30155685/?](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30155685/?) utm_source=chatgpt.com])
- Measurement development of JS: English adaptation of the simplified JSS-8 (distinguishing between "fundamentalist JS" and "opportunistic JS"). ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10627457/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Reading Points/Practical Tips
- Profile asymmetry: important in that it is easy to be "victim JS↑/perpetrator JS↓" in ADHD. Over-detection of injustice and underestimation of the perpetrator of self can occur simultaneously. This is easily connected to peer relationship friction -> depression/behavior problems. ([PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24878677/))
- Intervention Design:
    - There is a theoretical basis for cognitive reassessment (training not to assume that ambiguous cues = hostility) and rereading of social cues to lower hostility attribution bias and reduce aggression. ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4884733/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    - Responding to RS (monitoring rejection anticipation, attention shifting, strengthening supportive relationships) is effective in secondary prevention of depression/anxiety. ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3733267/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
Supplemental: Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) is a concept widely discussed in party and qualitative research, but it is not a diagnostic name and research accumulation is ongoing. There is a growing body of qualitative data on experiences with and making sense of criticism and rejection.
