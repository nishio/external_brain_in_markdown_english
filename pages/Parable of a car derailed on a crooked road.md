The story of the miscommunication between the engineer B's respondent is easy to understand by comparing it to a car derailing on a curved road: A wants to put the derailed car back on the road, but B thinks that if he doesn't understand that the road is curved, he will derail the car again soon after putting it back on, so he explains it to him first.

>  A. "No, that's not important, just tell me how to get the car back."
>  b "It's crooked, so you have to keep turning the wheel or it will break loose again soon."
>  A "I don't care about that now! Tell me how to put it back in!"
>  b "Even if I tell you how to put it back in, if you don't understand this part, you'll break out of the wheel again."
>  A "I'm asking you to show me how to put this de-wheel back on!"

>  A "They keep trying to explain things I didn't ask and won't tell me how to solve the crucial problem!"
>  B "Because if I tell you how to solve the problems here, you'll get hooked again right away and it's futile. If we could just understand that the road is crooked and then start over from the beginning, we wouldn't be addicted to those problems."

"B's poor explanation", "B's irritable and harsh words to A", etc.
