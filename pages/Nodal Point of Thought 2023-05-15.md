        - [[vibes]] is similar
        - [[Ph.D. can be in any field.]]

[[People who contribute to change]] ↔ [[People who get in the way of change]].

        - [[Formation of early adopter groups]]
    - We don't have to look back.
        - [[Even if a new continent is discovered, not everyone will emigrate.]]

People who are too hasty in their interpretations.
- Assume one interpretation of what you see
- [[fill in the blank]] ↔ [[delve into]].

            - Because these people are in a position to make strategies for the organization, the organization makes foolish strategies.
            - It's like [[An ordinary man killing a genius]].
    - [[Trade-offs between use and exploration]]
    - What does "bury" mean?
        - Pretend you didn't see something you don't understand, keep it away, cover it up, cover it with dirt and bury it.
    - What does "digging in" mean?
        - cut (a stencil, on a mimeograph)

    - It is both a productive force and a cost.
- The people are not always flesh and blood.
    - AI that eats electricity and performs information labor

    - I doubt that.
    - With the advent of LLM in the information industry, language barriers will be eliminated and the domestic market may be destroyed.
        - In that sense, China's Great Firewall is a useful barrier to entry.
