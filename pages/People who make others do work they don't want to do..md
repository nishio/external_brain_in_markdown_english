>  I want a secretary just to unzip the Excel sent to me in encrypted Zip from the government offices and circle the days I'm available, but Outlook's thread summary function is so bad that I can't find the corresponding password and I can't edit it back on my phone, which delays my reply an average of over a week. It's really hell when it's sent from several different government offices.

>  However, it's hard to open the file on my phone and not know the candidate date until I open the file, so please do something about that!
> I can understand putting passwords on personal information at a hundred steps, but putting passwords even on the list of candidate dates is obviously a pointless bad practice. The other party knows what they are doing (but cannot break the rule because breaking the rule will cause anger), so we should break the rule from our side.

The contrast between older people trying to get others to do [[thankless tasks]] that they don't want to do, and younger people trying to eliminate the task itself, is vivid and interesting. I was just working on a lecture material on "the need to [[change the rules]] for [[work efficiency]]". I've already FIXED it, but I may use it next time.
