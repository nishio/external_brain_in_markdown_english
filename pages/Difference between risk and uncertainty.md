title: "Difference between risk and uncertainty"

- Difference between [[risk]] and [[uncertainty]] by Knight
There is a black-and-white ball in a jar, and the white one is a success.
- Known distribution: risk: analysis required, classical statistics
- Unknown distribution: Uncertainty: estimation procedures required, e.g. Bayesian estimation
- I don't understand the principle itself: Knight's uncertainty: the methodology for this is [[effectuation]].
- p.31-35

On the counterpart of analysis and estimation
- If the distribution is known in a mathematical sense, the expected value is also known, without the need for statistical analysis.
