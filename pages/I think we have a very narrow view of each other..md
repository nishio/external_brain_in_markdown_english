- A thinks B is [[narrow-minded]] and B thinks A is narrow-minded
- You can't usually observe what's outside your [[field of vision]], and even if you do on some occasion, it's blurry and you can't see it well and it's [[underestimation]].

I think I've drawn this [[crossed out set]] diagram elsewhere.
- There it is.
        - [[A wraps around B.]]

I think there was also a Venn diagram-based representation of the inability to observe outside one's own set.
- Maybe this: [[We cannot know the totality of what others know.]]

impetus
- Someone A told B about C's behavior.
    - B described C as "narrow-minded."
- But from A's perspective, C could be considered "broad-minded" because he's been all over the world.
    - This information was not disclosed to B.
    - I'm sure C would think B is "narrow-minded" too.
        - On the basis of your own past activities.
- So both of you are just feeling that the other's vision is narrower by ignoring what's hard for you to see.

- [[A series of pictures of two people saying different things]]
