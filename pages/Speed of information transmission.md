- For D, B comes first, A comes after.

If we assume the existence of an absolute time line, then either A or B is first.
Apart from that, A and B are the "creators" and C and D are the "observers"

C might claim to B that he is "slower than A".
But to begin with.
- C is just a consumer, not a producer.
- C is slower than B, not A.


I wonder what this leads to...
- [[information transmission]]
- [[transfer speed]]
- [[propagation]]
- [[diffusion]]
- [[People who think they are superior to others by criticizing them.]]
