title: "People who aren't surprised are the problem."

>  Actually, it's not that lame.
>
>  But if you see something really great and you fail to weigh (even subconsciously) the greatness of it because of your pride, your position, or your past words or actions, that's pretty lame!

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1790366625532985533) People who are overly surprised are lame, but people who are just [[oblique]] when they don't know any better are also lame because they are totally obvious to people who have actually done a sufficient amount of trial and error and observation. But people who don't know better but are just [[oblique]] are also lame. And while the former are noisy but can be beneficial in communicating information, the latter have no use at all, so they are ignored by [[pragmatists]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1790369437893501105) It is [[the youth of the mind]] that can be surprised, and a mind that becomes indifferent to the changes in the new world grows old and withers.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1790555181014528425) To put it in a little more detail, there are people who give an N=1 example and say, "Wow! I can't even do this yet! Among those who talk without giving examples, there are those who say "You obviously haven't tried it yourself" or "If you had tried it, you wouldn't say such a thing", which is worthless.
- [[people with N=0, people with N=1]], people with N=100

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1790555610796437808) And then there's this latter group of people who "haven't even tried it in the first place, and are just echoing the information on social networking sites to rebel against it".
