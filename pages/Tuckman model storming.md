Conflicts and disagreements among team members arise. This is because members have different opinions about the team's purpose, roles, and responsibilities.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The "Tuckman Model" is actually known as "[[Tuckman's Team Development Model]]." Proposed by Bruce Tuckman ([[Bruce Tuckman]]) in 1965, the model shows the four main stages of a group or [[team]] reaching maturity and functioning effectively. It was later modified to five stages. The stages of the model are as follows

- Forming
- Storming ( [[confrontation]] )
- Norming
- Performing
- (Added later) Adjourning (disbanded)

To elaborate on "Storming (Conflict)."
- Storming (conflict):.
    - At this stage, it is common for conflicts and disagreements among team members to arise. Members may have different opinions about the team's [[Objective.]], [[role]], and their respective responsibilities.
    - Differences regarding personal opinions and methods, conflicts over [[leadership]], and [[uncertainty]] about appropriate behavior and rules often surface as problems.
    - The Storming phase is also a process where members build [[trust]] with each other. To get through this phase, skills in [[open communication]], [[expression of feelings]], and [[conflict resolution]] are required.
    - Not all teams will go through this phase, but many will go through this difficult process, which will help them form stronger and more effective teams.

Tuckman's model is used by many organizations and educational institutions as a framework for better understanding team dynamics and development.
