I think it is a derivative of Sun Tzu's "There are examples of success in short term warfare, but there are no examples of success in long term warfare.

I am surprised to know recently that "careful planning and short term execution" has worked well in past large projects. If you only look at the execution, it looks like they are doing it all at once.
