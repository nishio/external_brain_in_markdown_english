title: "Classification and Interest"
---

Not interesting -> "Why isn't it interesting?" → Because it's classified?
- The KJ Method Abhors "Don't Classify Anyway with Abstract Concepts!" So, why not?
- Classify non-specifics and turn into two non-specifics.

Classification is not interesting (hypothetical)
- It's interesting to see the unexpected interpretations."
- Do you find the classification of the unexpected amusing?"
- Do Surprising Classifications Actually Exist?"

The theory that classification is not interesting.
- Just give them one axis under the sun and say, "There are two opposing concepts to think about on this axis.
- Two opposing concepts can be created by providing the appropriate axes, so the existence of opposing concepts is self-evident and uninteresting.

It's fun to set up and categorize "axes of recklessness."
→ "Let's classify it on an absurd axis" "It's absurd" → "It's not funny.

Classification is "the process of asking a question (=axis) about an event and dividing it into three categories: "Yes," "No," or "Can't say either.
- Classification consists of two steps: "Create a question" and "Answer the question".
- It's not that classification is boring, it's boring because classification is a task.
- The "potentially interesting classifications" are the ones that cause me trouble when separating them.
    - Interesting answer after a good stutter of a question that generates a stutter.
