This text provides a discussion of how men and women perceive the concept of a "strong woman". In particular, it focuses on the differences in expectations and understandings from the perspective of different genders.

- Strong Woman Concept A:.
    - 'Don't be a lowly chore (i.e., don't be dependent on others).'
    - Image of a woman who is independent and not dependent on others
    - A "strong woman" is someone who rebuffs the demands and dependence of others and walks her own path independently.
- Strong Woman Concept B:.
    - To stand above and assume responsibility (= to be depended upon by others)."
    - Ability to take on a leadership role and garner the trust and dependence of those around you, and to take on the role of leading a group or project is a sign of strength

This discussion highlights how different perspectives and values by gender can influence the concept of "strength." In other words, expectations of strong women can vary widely by gender, and these differences can lead to discrepancies in dialogue and perceptions.

It is highly suggestive to consider the concept of a "strong woman" through the concepts of dependent/independent/independent/independent. Below is a detailed description of each of these elements for further clarification.

1. not dependent (Strong Woman Concept A)
    - Definition: A state in which one's self is less or not at all dependent on others.
    - Examples: Ability to solve problems on their own and do not need help or intervention from others.
    - Related images of a strong woman: a woman who is self-determined and not dependent on the opinions and assistance of others for her life and choices. In this concept, "strength" is strongly associated with [[independence]] and [[self-sufficiency]].

2. do not make them dependent (Strong Woman Concept A)
    - Definition: a state of not allowing others to depend on you or to feel the need to do so.
    - Specific examples: Support others to encourage independence and avoid forming dependencies.
    - A related image of a strong woman: a woman who promotes her own independence and the independence of others by avoiding the dependence of others on her. In this perspective, strength is related to [[the ability to make]] not only oneself but also those around one [[independent]].

3. dependent (strong woman concept B)
    - Definition: the state of accomplishing one's goals or tasks by seeking assistance or advice from others.
    - Examples: Achieve greater results by collaborating with team members and others around you.
    - Related image of a strong woman: a woman who recognizes her own strengths but also seeks to achieve her goals with the help of others. In this concept, "strength" places value on [[cooperation and solidarity]].

4. make them dependent (Strong Woman Concept B)
    - Definition: a state of enabling and encouraging others to rely on you.
    - Examples: Take leadership and create an environment where others rely on your direction and support.
    - Related image of a strong woman: a woman who is self-directed, who leads projects and teams, and who gains the trust and dependence of others. In this concept, strength focuses on [[influence]] and [[sense of responsibility]].

From these perspectives, we can see that the concept of "[[strong woman]]" is defined not only by her independence, but also by her relationship to her surroundings, her balance between [[dependence and independence]], and her sphere of influence. Understanding and respecting these concepts, beyond gender-based expectations and perceptions, is a step toward a more equal and diverse society.

The original text is hard to make sense of, but I had GPT4 clean it up because it takes out some interesting conflicts.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

> [MARAharuS](https://twitter.com/MARAharuS/status/1761307324587905365) I just realized after verbalizing this that "the concept of a strong woman from the point of view of women that men seem to dislike" is "not being a menial chore (= not being depended on by others). The "concept of a strong woman from the perspective of a man who seems to like men" is "to stand on top and take responsibility (= to be depended on by others)", so there's a subtle discrepancy.
