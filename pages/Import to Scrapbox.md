title: "Import to Scrapbox"

from [[pKakidashi-done]]
Import to Scrapbox
- old
    - Can be exported in text format
    - Better if it can be imported to Scrapbox with a single button press
    - [[Copy and paste as normal text]] Can be done.
    - Scrapbox-like nature as each item is on its own line
    - Here we go.
        - The reason I thought I needed an import function was because I was using a tool that didn't allow me to "copy and paste as normal text".
