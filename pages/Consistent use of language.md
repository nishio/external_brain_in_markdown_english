title: "Consistent use of language"
---

- Humans are stupid and are not good at using [[term]] in a [[consistent]] sense
    - [[mathematics]] and other areas, emphasizing consistent use of words and training in consistent meanings.
- Programming uses a notation in which words have a one-to-one correspondence with their meanings because "it would be difficult for a computer to understand otherwise".
- One-to-one correspondence allows the use of a particular word to be changed to another word in bulk
    - Therefore, it is easy to change the wording after the fact while maintaining consistency.
    - It is common for programmers to use editors to assist with this type of work
- [[Scrapbox]] gives similar assistance to natural language by batch conversion of links
