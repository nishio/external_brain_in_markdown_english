title: "Management Games"
---

A game with a management motif.
Even in games that are not, many games are [[optimal allocation of resources]], so there is an analogy with management.

When programmers consider the process of learning programming, there is a large element of "[[Learning from Practice]].
I think it is important to "learn from practice" in other areas as well.
However, the cost of actually running a company is high, and the damage when it fails is also high.
- If the damage of failure is too great, they will try to avoid it.
    - [[Increased risk of failure for knowledge acquisition]] does the opposite.
It is good to fail a lot in games.
