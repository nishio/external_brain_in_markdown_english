title: "A world of speed"

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>There is certainly a big difference between the speedy world and the [[slow world]], and [[friction]] can arise between the two. However, I think it is important for society as a whole [[to have people of various speeds coexist]] and fulfill their respective roles.

The main points are as follows
- The slow world also plays a necessary role in [[maintaining society]]. [[Core systems]] are intertwined with many elements and need to move [[carefully]].
- It is wise for speedy people to [[move to an environment that fits their pace]] instead of getting angry at slower people. It does not cause unnecessary frustration.
- The speed of society is [[continuously distributed]]. It is not a simple dichotomy [[information propagation happens smoothly]].
- There is no need to force [[slow down]] people who are speedy. If they are ahead of the curve, there will be a real benefit in bridging the gap later, even if some [[are temporarily left behind]].

What is important is to understand one's own pace and exert one's strength in an environment that suits it. And society as a whole needs to create a system that allows people of diverse speeds to cooperate with each other. It will be necessary to have a system that allows some people to excel while following those who are left behind.

Although friction arising from differences in speed is inevitable, we should aim for the harmonious development of society as a whole with a spirit of mutual understanding and cooperation.

Hate when speedy people try to move the world out of speed.
Better to have a proven track record in a fast-paced world.

As to whether that is okay or not.
- Can the world without speed stay the same?

- [[Torn of the world]]

[[A world without speed is necessary for the maintenance of society]].
A good theory to stay out of it.
[[Social maintenance system is slow.]]
- [[Social maintenance]]

The slower you are, the more you divide.
The faster you go, the faster you go.

Because [[people who are slow to react don't need to react quickly]].

- [[The backbone of the world is slow.]]
- Because [[it's]] connected to a lot of things.
        - [[fetters]]
        - [[entwined]]
        - [[clinging]]

- [[slow-moving business]]

You should figure out where you are in the "speed" distribution of society and organizations.
- [[Know your position in the distribution]].

- [[It is futile to be angry at someone who is slow]]
    - [[To accumulate frustration is a loss for me.]]

Should leave quickly and [[move]] to someone closer in step
- [[quickly leaving]].
- [[Walk with someone who is close to you in step.]]

I talked with person Y, who has a mutual acquaintance X, about this.

- [[A World Without Boundaries]]
- [[Let's only go if you can go.]]
    - [[False dichotomy]]
- It's not two states of being on a plate or not on a plate.
    - [[information transmission]]
        - [[Smooth World]]
    - [[chasm]]
        - [[Smooth, not discontinuous]]
    - Image distribution

- [[No need to slow down those who go fast.]]
Even if [[the world was torn apart]].
- = Even if there is a temporary "[[person]] who is taken out of the picture.
- Because there is a real benefit in closing this gap.
- [[After the world is torn apart]]
