title: "Rationale for finding value in transcribing sutras"
---

- In the discussion about [[copying of a sutra]], I asked, "When and how did a culture that saw value in transcribing sutras emerge?" I was curious.

The description is found in [[Lotus Sutra]], [[Dharma Master's Tenth Article]], which was established in [[early Mahayana Buddhism]].

> The Buddha's words to the Medicine King: "When Nyorai has passed away, if you listen to the Lotus Sutra or read one verse or chorus, you will be happy at any time. If you are able to read, recite, recite, explain, and write the Mystical Lotus Sutra, or any of its chapters, you may make offerings of all kinds to the Buddha, including flowers, incense, vases, incense, lacquered incense, smoked incense, smoked incense, banners, clothing, and music, and you may join hands with him in reverence. The King of Medicine knows that there have been a hundred thousand million Buddhas offered to the Buddhas and others, and that they are the fulfillment of great aspirations, compassion and compassion for others.
> The Buddha told Yakwang Bodhisattva: "Also, after the Buddha's annihilation, if anyone hears the Myōhōkekyō and willingly accepts it, even for a single chorus, even for a single thought, I guarantee that I will grant him [[anuttara samyak sambodhi]] ([[no supreme righteousness and equal enlightenment]], the highest enlightenment) as well. Furthermore, if someone accepts, recites, commentates on, and transcribes the Myriad Lotus Sutra, even a single chorus, and if he respects this sutra scroll like a Buddha, and makes offerings with flowers, incense, jewelry, incense wood, lacquered incense, burning incense, textile coverings, banners, clothing, and music, and pays homage with his hands, O Medicine King, then know. Such people have already made offerings to a hundred thousand billion Buddhas, and they are the ones who have fulfilled great wishes under the various Buddhas. And they were born into this human world out of compassion for sentient beings."

> "Medicine King, if you have any questions, please ask any other person in your future life. I am telling you that you must make Buddha in your future life. What is the reason? Good men and women, receive, recite, explain, and write the Lotus Sutra, or any one of its verses, and make offerings of all kinds, including flowers, incense, lamps, incense sticks, incense sticks, incense sticks, banners, banners, clothes, and music, and hold them in reverence and respect. I know that this person is a great bodhisattva who has attained anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, who is compassionate toward others, who wishes to live a life of peace, and who is a partaker of the Lotus Sutra. What is the situation of盡能受持、種種供養者？"
> "O Medicine King, if someone asks you, 'Which sentient beings will become Buddhas in the future?' In response to that question, tell him that these are the ones who will certainly become Buddhas in the future. For if good men and women accept, recite, comment on, and copy even a single verse of the Lotus Sutra, and if they honor this sutra scroll with various offerings (flowers, incense, jewelry, fragrant wood and lacquered incense, burning incense, textile coverings and banners, clothing, and music) and treat it reverently with their hands, they are beings to be respected in all worlds, For he should be offered in the same way that one offers offerings are offered to the Tathagata. Such a person is a Maha Bodhisattva, one who has attained anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, one who is born into the world with compassion for sentient beings, and one who acts to spread the Myohokekyō widely. And even more so for those who fully accept and make diverse offerings."

I think "if you are willing to accept even a single verse, even for a single thought," is a prerequisite. In other words, those who read a sutra and think, "Oh, I see," or "That's a good point," will be granted the highest enlightenment, but those who do not have such "willing acceptance" and are told to copy a sutra by someone else and just copy it while thinking, "Why should I copy this? .

>  So, what practices does this Dharma Master follow in order to promote the Lotus Sutra? Shakyamuni Buddha indicated the following five lines of practice.
>  1, Jyuji (acceptance) ...... to listen to and believe in the teachings of the Lotus Sutra, and to remember them in one's heart.
>  2, Reading (どく) ............ to see and read the characters of a sutra.
>  3, reciting ............ without looking at the characters, but reading them aloud.
>  4, Commentary (Gesetsu) ...... understanding the significance of the sutra and explaining it to others.
>  5, Shosha...to copy sutras and disseminate them far and wide.
