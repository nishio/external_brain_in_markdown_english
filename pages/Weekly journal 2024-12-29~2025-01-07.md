year-end progress

What we did last week
    - [[2024-12-26 Mystery meeting]]
    - [[Try Devin.ai 2025-01]]

I'll cut it out later in the next weekly journal.
The end of the year continues to be Devin
I had Devin look back, but it wasn't great, so I had o1 Pro do it via [[concatPages]].
[[2024]]
- Reflection by >o1 Pro: "The year 2024 was a year in which the practice and development of digital democracy tools advanced quickly and the seeds of "social implementation" grew through the TMG and multiple community activities. On the other hand, due to the rapid pace of development, there were also noticeable situations where the "humble infrastructure" of information organization and health management could not keep up."


I'm on my butt because it's bad enough when 2025 starts on Saturday and Sunday without a quicksand review of last year's events.
- After all, I was so busy regarding July-August that my weekly journal is two weeks apart and I wrote practically nothing, so a review in o1 is pointless.
    - How it should have been, even though we were busy, we should have done a weekly "AI recap and summarize the week's activities".
        - Let's build a tool to do this (have Devin build it).
    - We didn't have it then, but we could look back on it as we talked on Advanced Voice.

- Finished up to Day 2 of FtC.



2025-01-07

- I read "[What is logical thinking?
