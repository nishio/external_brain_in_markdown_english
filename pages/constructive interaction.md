    - [[Introduction to Educational Psychology]]  P.15
    - [[social structure]] of [[knowledge]] and [[understanding]]
- context
    - The child has a naive theory.
    - Highly abstract scientific concepts are not directly experienced by children.
        - An object will move with constant velocity if no force is applied to it."
            - What we actually observe is, "If you throw a ball, it will bend and fly," and "A ball you roll will eventually stop."
            - Because the situation of "no force being applied to an object" is rare.
    - When a teacher gives a "clear explanation" in school, "[[Bubble type understanding]]" occurs.
        - It is the only independent, empirically unconnected understanding.
        - This kind of knowledge disappears quickly.
    - These scientific concepts are "socially constructed" through discussions, hypotheses, and experiments.
        - This "social construction" is done through "[[dialogue]]" in the learning environment.
        - This is the "model of learning" that this book conveys


    - Also related to [abstraction
        - [[How do we acquire abstract knowledge?]]
    - [[Create a dialogue]]
