<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Operation testing of new features
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "motion test" is this "motion test"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The ability to resume the previous conversation has been added. (This conversation itself is resumed once a new browser tab is created.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's a browser tab, which in essence means an environment that doesn't carry over memories. Until now, nothing really carried over, so if you closed a tab by mistake, you could never reopen it again, but now the ID of the last conversation is carried over!
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that "tab"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Sometimes when I left the conversation unfinished, Safari on my iPhone would reload, and when I got home to check the log, it would be gone.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>What we are exchanging here. Also, I've improved the UI a bit to show "thinking about it", which is rather nice.

- How do you know this "tab"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Aside from that, might the focus be lost when sending a message?

- Where is this "tab" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's off...I don't know why this is.
