Specific examples C1 and C2 are different
    - When a [[new thing]] is created, the new thing is [[different]] from the [[existing thing]].
- If it's not different, it's not a [[creation]] of something new.
    - [[The same is not new.]]

But if C2 is separate from C1, wouldn't C1 [[experience]] be useless?
- Actually not, specific experience in past actions can be beneficial in new and different actions.
- So why does it happen?
    - [[abstraction]] because the [[model]] A that was created by [[abstraction]] is connected.
