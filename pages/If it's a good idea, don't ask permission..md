title: "If it's a good idea, don't ask permission."
---

Words from [[Grace Hopper.]], who developed the COBOL programming language.
In Japan, it is known by phrases such as "[Don't ask permission. Ask forgiveness.
There are variants.
> It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission.
> Variant: [[If it's a good idea, go ahead and do it. It is much easier to apologize than it is to get permission.]]
[https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper)
I think the variant is more complementary to the words and conveys the meaning better.
- Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness.
- If it's a good idea, do it without asking permission."

- When I come up with a [[good idea]], I try it first.
    - Waiting for [[permit]] in advance is not a good idea
        - We don't know in advance if we will be successful, only [[posterior]] can tell.
        - See [[result]] and [revise (e.g., of a rule, regulation, etc.)
        - If you try it and it doesn't work, apologize then.

[Commentary by Mr. Yoshioka (Rakuten Technology Fellow)](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/hyoshiok/20110205/p1)
>  [[Don't ask for permission. Apologize.]]

- Another expression of the same material [[Apology rather than asking for permission]].
    - [[strike while the iron is hot]]

- Short Expression
        - [[Apology rather than permission]]
        - [[Don't ask permission.]]

Many people find the word "[[apology]]" heavy. That would be contrary to the intent.
The important part is "[Do it without asking permission.
- Sometimes asking for permission is just a [[precautionary]] step to make sure you don't have to apologize yourself.
    - [[Mental model of behaving in a way that does not offend.]]
- That type of behavior is negatively reflected when the project's progress is considered a top priority.

- [[Shorten the time it takes for good ideas to be implemented]]
- [[Good idea.]]
