title: "Humans neglect others."

People neglect others.
Often, they are unaware of this and think they should not be neglected.

When you buy a 150-yen juice at a convenience store, that 150 yen is enough for three pneumonia treatments, the disease that kills the most children according to UNICEF.
It means that they value the pleasures that are not necessary for survival more than the three lives of others because the price of the water that is necessary for survival is much cheaper.

Some consider this in itself ethically objectionable, but that is not the main issue here.
He finds it interesting that "I act in a way that neglects others on a daily basis, while others think they shouldn't neglect me [[cognitive distortion]]."
