Omoikane Project Commentary at the end of June
2023-06-29~2023-07-02

Project applied for OpenAI's "[[Democratic Inputs to AI]]" grant in collaboration with [[Code for Japan]].

6/30
## Project Summary
.
    - The [[good-natured old man]] project is a joint application with [[Code for Japan]] for OpenAI's "[[Democratic Inputs to AI]]" grant.
- The objective of "Democratic Input to AI" is to improve the [[democratic process]] (i.e., the [[decision-making]] process by many people) that assumes the existence of AI. Prototyping] and [[digital technology]].
- Participants will read [[SF Short Shorts]], vote on them in [[Polis]], and write their own SF Short Shorts with [[LLM's support]].

## Progress this week
.
- We have submitted a grant application to OpenAI in collaboration with Code for Japan. We are currently awaiting review.
- Without waiting for the acceptance/rejection results, we have started recruiting project participants; we have created a description on Scrapbox and prepared a participation form. Currently there are 24 participants and over 200 pages and 1000 links have been created.
- The writing process using ChatGPT was shared by experienced writers, and several participants who had no previous SF writing experience created works.
- We have also observed the phenomenon of Polis voting results generating ideas and motivation for the creation of new stories.

## Schedule for next week and beyond
.
- We will be attending two events next week. We will prepare materials for an LT for the participants and aim to involve people from different communities to promote the project.
- In addition, OpenAI will announce the results of the judging on July 15.

The project became interesting as we were discussing what to apply for [[Democratic Inputs to AI]], so we started running it before it was selected.
    - Incorporate [[SF Prototyping]] to improve [[careful deliberation]] methods.
- Anyone can join: [/omoikane/join the project](https://scrapbox.io/omoikane/join the project).

from [/omoikane/project-goals](https://scrapbox.io/omoikane/project-goals).
Our project aims for three outcomes:
- The first goal is to compile the results of a [[careful deliberation]] involving several hundred Japanese on "[[the question about AI assistants]]".
- The second goal is to validate a new [[careful deliberation]] [[methodology]] based on [[SF Prototyping]] through this consultation.
    - This is intended to be applicable to topics other than AI.
    - I strongly feel this need from past [[Civic Tech]] activities.
- The third goal is to use the information from our deliberative process to create an AI that reflects the culture and thinking of the Japanese.
    - #Japanese Culture AI
    - This AI will be made available worldwide, allowing people to converse in their own languages.
    - This approach promotes [[cross-cultural understanding]] beyond language barriers and is a prerequisite for [[Global Deliberations]].
