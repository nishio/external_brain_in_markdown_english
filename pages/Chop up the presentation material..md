I think an hour's worth of [[Publications]] is big for a Scrapbox page.
- In terms of characters, that's about 10,000.
- There are a number of "[[newly created diagram]]".
    - It's a shame that this doesn't show up in the thumbnails.
    - Frankly, it's too much of a waste that a picture that I used my very brain and even went back to the original book to revise the inconsistencies and finally convinced myself in version 3 is not in the thumbnail, but it's not an appropriate thumbnail for the page itself.
        - This means that [it is impossible to give a fitting title to a page with many different things on it.

But what happens when you simply chop it up?
- You'd be throwing away the "[[unidimensionalization]]" connection that you went to all the trouble of creating.
    - This is another waste of time.

What should we do?
- Like this?

It's been a while since I wrote the idea of
- Why not do it right away?
- They feel that by doing this they are losing something, and this is preventing them from doing it.

Then do both.
- Duplicate X
- Split X
- Rename X(copy) to X

In retrospect, this is an issue about [[chunking]] long content
