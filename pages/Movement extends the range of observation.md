title: "Movement extends the range of observation"

- derived from  [[How do you know what your life choices are?]]

> [tkgshn](https://twitter.com/tkgshn/status/1390344021344587778): This is very abstract, it's like a [[movement]] -difference as various physical and community concepts!

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1403330777878732801): i was thinking about this and it developed a bit. [why is "mobility" important? Human [[Observation range]] is limited, we can't see far enough, we can't notice things outside of our limits, we can't see what is outside of our limits, and we can't see what is outside of our limits. [[Movement is an opportunity to see things that were previously unseen]], and one useful way to answer the original question, "[How do we know what our options are?" twitter.com/ tkgshn/status/...

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1403331710398341125): The strikingly observed "I saw a close stranger doing it," "I learned about it from a distant friend," and "I learned about it from a close mentor" are seemingly disparate People who see what they don't see..." are opportunities to "broaden one's horizons". I think these two are the main pillars (maybe there are others).

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1403332801080954884): First, be aware that your range of observation is limited and think about how you can expand it. Some people are lucky enough to have expanded it passively, others actively.
> In both cases, the first step is not always a big jump, more often than not people seem to

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1403336192217677829): some said "there were not" for "[[Life Choices]]". Of course [[Choice is not given equally.]], so there may be some who really didn't have any.
>  But more than that, like assuming that choices are "given" and not actively taking action to obtain them,
- #Prince on a white horse who thinks he can give and doesn't act to get.

> The case where the client thought that the [[Future value of options]] would be known at the time of selection, and chose only "options with clear (small) value" rather than "[[Options of uncertain value]]", resulting in below-average performance when compared to others (like the [[Cash Deposit Trap]]). (like [[Cash Deposit Trap]]).
- #Mistaken belief that future value can be known in advance #Planned contingency #Uncertainty

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1403337807108599811): And then there's the "[[the grass is always greener on the other side]]" effect, where you underestimate the value of what you've already gained, I've already made choices and benefited from them, but what I didn't get seems bigger than it really was.

- > I realized after walking three kilometers in the park wearing Vibram Five Fingers that [walking is good for thinking. (Related [[road of philosophy]])
