- Thoughts.
    - Should we separate them by length even or odd?
    - If we fix the center and expand the range, the new range will be doubled if the letters are different, and doubled if they are not different.
    - Still, that's not very efficient at all.
    - I'm surprised it's not "answer the remainder" when there are 200,000 characters.
    - DP to make the range a defined area?
        - If two pairs of letters are different, the number of cases is +1 for all ranges that include the pair of exchanges.
    - Ha, the inclusion-elimination principle?
        - No, you can't narrow it down by symmetry, so no.
- Official Explanation
    - Strings made up of two different kinds of characters at both ends can never match each other
            - [[Conditions under which the results of an operation are identical]]

                - [[Counting up what is X -> if X?]]

    - If you notice this, [[have an after-event]] turns into "count the number of matching pairs"
    - This is obtained by [Frequencyâ†’Triangular number
- problem partitioning
        - [[Update column ranges]]
        - [[Counting up the results of an operation]]
