title: 'It is not true that "the future is unknowable."'
---

The "know/not know" is [[false dichotomy]], which is a gradation of probability.
An event that occurs with a high probability is "not known" because there is slight uncertainty [[Bug that considers anything that is not 100% as 0]].
They disregard the foreseeable by calling it "[[natural]]". Many people do not take advantage of that "natural" knowledge.
- For example, a person who is 40 years old now will be 70 years old in 30 years, and a teenager now will be in his 40s in 30 years.
    - From this obvious fact, some people think about what the age structure of society will be like when they are now 40 and will be 70, and what the lineup will change when the people who plan various products and services are now teenagers, while others do not.
        - [[Knowledge of Rootless Grass]]
    - [[A system with a delay]]
    - For example, if we have a "circuit whose input is output with a 1-second delay," if we change the input from 0 to 1 now, we can predict that the output will change from 0 to 1 one second in the future.
    - Real world systems have more or less delays.
- [[foreseeable]]
- [[predictability]]
