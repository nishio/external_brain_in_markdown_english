title: "Felt Sense and Symbol Diagrams"
---

- [An expression created in Study Session 1 on "Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning" to illustrate what is written in text.
- It has been conveniently used to describe many things since then.
    - More descriptive names: [[Diagram of symbol-meaning correspondence]].

- Arrows coincide with time series
    - At first I used dotted arrows to represent relationships unrelated to the time line, but I didn't really need to use them.
    - A curved arrow indicates a creative use of the word differently from its original meaning, for example, as a metaphor ([[non-parallel symbol]]).

    - [[There are three patterns in the results of direct matching]]
        - [[Direct Match → Partial Match → Segmentation]]
        - [[Clarification was done through a series of direct matches.]]
- [[To invent a metaphor to express a prior felt meaning is "comprehension."]]
    - [[Creative Functional Relationship Summary]]
    - [[Translation difficulties]]
    - [[Clean language: withholding interpretation of symbols]]
    - [[There are two patterns of "I don't know."]]

The technique of using vertical arrows for parallel symbols and curved arrows for non-parallel symbols may work for simple situations, but may be difficult for "time series" or "many symbols".

- [[Expand the pertinence of useful concepts]]
- The phenomenon of throwing X or Y into the system in an attempt to point to F, but not finding it.
