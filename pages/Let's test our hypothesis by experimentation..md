    - [[hypothesis]] should [[experiment]] and [[verify]].
- You may think you "get it" when you are studying, but when you try to solve a problem, you may not be able to solve it.
- We don't know if we really know unless we experiment and verify it.
        - [[Okay" is a hypothesis.]]

- Plan ahead and take action,
- Consider the consequences of your actions,
- Go correct the results,
- We will continue to work through this cycle to advance our business.
    - [[PDCA cycle]]   [[plan]] → [[action]] → [[Discussion of Results]] → [[Revised plan]]

- Scientific research is similar.
    - Hypothesis.
    - Experiment.
    - Consider whether the experimental results are as expected.
    - Opportunities when expectations are different, revising hypotheses
    - [[hypothesis]] → [[experiment]] → [[Discussion of Results]] → [[Revision of Hypothesis]]

- Same with studies.
    - Understanding is a hypothesis
    - Act on your understanding.
    - I thought it would work and it didn't = I got a different result than I understood.
    - This is your chance to correct your understanding.

- Learn quickly by turning this cycle in small steps.
- For example, if you are programming
    - If you suddenly write a program with thousands of lines of code, try to run it, and then say, "It didn't work! Then, it is too late to learn.
    - It is more efficient to learn by repeating the execution of a small, one or a few lines.
- If it were a business, we would create, release, and verify a minimum number of products to verify "there are customers who want this.
- What was the first product that Dropbox released?
    - They did not create a product. They made an instructional video and placed a pre-registration form.

- Dr. Kawachi:.
    - If it were a one-shot entrance exam without a final review, we'd be in trouble.
    - That's why we test frequently.
    - Make the first step smaller. Make the cycle smaller.
- Exactly, however, "I thought it would work, but it failed" is important.
    - Failure is an opportunity to learn.
    - That's why we often give quizzes.
