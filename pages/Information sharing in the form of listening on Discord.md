> [igz0](https://twitter.com/igz0/status/1756286899034189825) When you are touching a new technology in IT, trying to solve a problem by reading the official documentation or setting up an Issue on GitHub is old hat, and these days the official Discord community and asking them is often the best solution.
>
>  So IT engineers who don't touch Discord should realize that they are not keeping up with the latest technology.

> [chika_s_it](https://twitter.com/chika_s_it/status/1756343651612184963) That's usually a bona fide free ride. Only you can benefit from it and other users can't get to it by searching.
- > [chika_s_it](https://twitter.com/chika_s_it/status/1756344386831663158) github issues are a great place for people who get stuck in the same place to get to the discussion process and solutions, so questions about personal issues and problems and Pointing out the issue is also a contribution to the community, but discussing something that can be understood by reading the official version in a closed community or pointed out in a public place is usually a free ride of good intentions,
- > [chika_s_it](https://twitter.com/chika_s_it/status/1756344669393592613) OSS developers want you to use what they've created, and many of them are altruistic to begin with, so they'll answer, but you should take advantage of that. Free-riding is not a good idea.

> [DarkForceC7](https://twitter.com/DarkForceC7/status/1756433226057527728) Heh, I see.
>  Disco?

> [Iwancof_ptr](https://twitter.com/Iwancof_ptr/status/1756361818182926364) I've gone to all the trouble of OSS, but because the latest information is exchanged on closed communication tools like Discord, search It is a defeat of collective knowledge and annoying that it is not indexed by search engines.
>  How it works on an individual level, I'd have to join the Diacord server now, but is that OK with the community managers?
- > I find this very annoying. I just wish they would communicate in Discussions on GutHub or in ML like GNU and make it available to the outside world.
- >  Defeat of collective knowledge is an appropriate expression. I would like to argue that there is no ecosystem to constitute collective knowledge.
- >  If you want, I think it is so important to be a gentleman in terms of knowledge that the public exchange of information > may play a role in the selection of technology. I'm sure there are many opinions out there.
- >  And then there are things like what if Discord's specs change and old messages are deleted (GitHub is the same, but Discord's purpose is different to begin with, so it's hard for companies to take it into account). I just hope they never lose the knowledge they've accumulated.

    - [I used Answer Overflow, a service that allows you to Google search Discord threads - GIGAZINE](https://gigazine.net/news/20230620-answer-overflow/)

        - Nice tool.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

Maybe it's because the first statement is so emotionally charged that it elicits an emotional outcry, but if you look at it dispassionately, this is the composition.
- Mr. A asks a question
- Mr. B will answer.
- Mr. C. says, "It's a bona fide free ride!" that
It's funny, isn't it?
- Discord is being created because the operators of that open source project want you to use it.
    - There is no rule that says, "Questions go to issues."
- Mr. A asks questions, questions also contribute
- Mr. B felt the question was worth answering.
- A strange person who wants to be in charge in a managerial position even though he/she is not a manager. c
    - C is the only one in the story so far that hasn't given an effort.
    - If you think not being searchable is the essential problem, just work on putting the information together where it can be searched.
        - In fact, tools already existed to make it searchable without the need for a human to do the summarizing work.
        - If they really thought that not being searchable was a problem, they would be working and working to get this tool in place.
        - If they don't, it's just a righteous gesture of "I don't like it.

- [[Talk about a bot that automatically closes issues.]]
[[who denies any other method of communication than the one he is accustomed to]].
