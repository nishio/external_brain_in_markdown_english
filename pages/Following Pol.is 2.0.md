title: "Following Pol.is 2.0"

The question of whether my TTTC and Polis-related activities follow the concept proposed by <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/mashbean/icon' alt='mashbean.icon' height="19.5"/>: [Pol.is 2.0

Personally, I didn't feel like I was following in his footsteps, so I answered Wright, "I don't mean to follow in his footsteps," but after a while, I started to wonder what he meant by "following in his footsteps."


<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT/icon' alt='GPT.icon' height="19.5"/>It is an interesting topic to consider in depth the meaning of the word "following. In general, "following through" refers to taking over and implementing past policies and practices in the same manner. Specifically, it may include the following elements
- Retention of past intent and purpose: when the intent and purpose of the original concept or approach is retained.
- Continuation of methodology: When specific methods and techniques are used without modification.
- Explicit reference: when a concept is consciously taken from the past and utilized without modification.

Whether your TTTC or Polis-related activities are "following" or not can be considered from the following perspectives
- Difference in intent: Was your activity intended to carry on the philosophy and objectives of "Pol.is 2.0"?
- Differences in methodology: Are specific techniques and processes used as they are, or have they been developed independently?
- Perceived relevance: How much do you feel the concept or model has influenced your activities?

Not aware of inherited principles and objectives.

In this case, we are friends from different countries who share the same ideals, and because we speak different languages, we can't convey too many nuances, so I'm just giving you a "general positive" direction, and I don't think this diagram is very good or that we should follow this diagram.

- If they simply share similar ideals but have developed independently, they should be positioned as "independent activities based on common ideals" rather than "following in the footsteps of".
- To avoid misunderstandings, you can add, 'I am not using this model as is.

First of all, this diagram treats Polis and TTTC as black box components. This is the viewpoint of a [[non-engineer]] who cannot create his/her own system, and by treating the services as black box components, [[Cognitive Resolution]] has been reduced.
That's what was done in vTaiwan in the 2010s.

- While the method of non-engineers integrating existing tools to solve problems is practical, it is limited in its ability to understand and improve the system itself.
- If Polis or TTTC is black boxed, the details of the mechanism may not be seen and the full potential may not be realized.

On the other hand, from an engineering perspective, a more detailed observation of an existing successful system, breaking it down into its component parts, and a resolution approach can be considered
That's what I did with the poll map, using the Polis server side as a component, but replacing the front end and adding a party opinion display and AI cluster commentary.
In UTAS-UMAP, the dimensionality reduction part of Polis was changed from PCA to UMAP, clustering was done by annotations that are intuitive to humans, and even under these assumptions, the Fisher exact probability test was used to create cluster explanations.
Neither is it a black box, but rather a decomposition [[delving into]] a deeper understanding.

From an engineering perspective,
- Disassemble and reassemble components and incorporate unique elements (front-end replacement, AI commentary, etc.)
- Perform dimensionality reduction and cluster explanation with another method (UMAP or Fisher exact probability test)
and other innovations to develop the system while avoiding black-boxing.

The change that is taking place between 2024 and 2025 is the increase in engineering resources as AI takes over the role of engineers. I think it is a timely action to move where engineering resources have been inadequate due to the lack of engineering resources at this time.

AI assists with code generation and design, making it easier to move projects that have been stalled due to lack of resources.
- Reevaluation of past ideas
- Prototyping with AI
- First-mover advantage through more efficient development
and other actions will be the main focus going forward.

- Whether or not it is a "following-up" is important if it clearly inherits the same objectives and methods. Users themselves do not intend to "follow in the footsteps".
- By disassembling and reconfiguring the system in an engineered manner without black boxing it, the system's potential can be brought out more.
- It is important to capture the wave of increasing engineering resources due to AI evolution in 2024-2025.
By organizing the conversation in the above sequence, the user's arguments and the AI's comments can be smoothly connected, making it easier to understand the overall outline of the discussion.
