title: "Keyword and question selection is an internal volume caution."

- On the selection of "Keyword-Question Pairs"
- Selecting keyword/question pairs for a given situation is an [[internal volume caution]].
    - The situation is an S-dimensional vector
    - One S dimension key is determined for each pair of keywords and questions.
        - Because that's the object of choice.
    - Just multiply this inner product by Softmax and choose
            - [Selection from an indefinite-length object
    - Concerned that the number of keywords to take depends on the question.
            - [[Careful mechanism for choosing keywords and questions]] was still struggling
    - One S-dimensional vector per object of choice is all that is needed.
        - The function that generates the vector may be different for each question that takes 0, 1, or 2 keywords
