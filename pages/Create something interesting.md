> [daichi_tlc](https://x.com/daichi_tlc/status/1871146382368944337) I'm getting older and I think, there are some seriously fucked up people with money, so if you fight there, you're not American to begin with and you can pick that kind of game. I'm not American to begin with. So I think that if you bet on the fun of the game, you have the best chance of having the most money. It's rare.
> [daichi_tlc](https://x.com/daichi_tlc/status/1871151176328052974) Of course there are people who like to make money, and I think that's a very blessed talent, and it's good if you can do what you like. I think it's good if you can do what you like to do, but if you put too much emphasis on whether or not you have money as a yardstick, you'll end up in a weird situation.
> [daichi_tlc](https://x.com/daichi_tlc/status/1871157652006347055) I'm starting to feel like I've never seen someone with a ludicrous level of wealth who wasn't interesting, frankly.

> [gdvonly](https://x.com/gdvonly/status/1871149763347034459) When I look at people over 40, there's almost no community where people value each other all the time based on whether they have money or not, or a little group of seriously unfortunate uncles (and not much money). And they're not very rich.
>  I think there are some things that look like a rich community to normal people, but actually the people in question can't keep up with the conversation if they just have money, so they are doing something anyway...
>  The older you get, the more important the qualitative aspects of what you do and what you have done are.

> [kensuu](https://x.com/kensuu/status/1871149763347034459) So, in other words, when you are over 40 years old, what you have done is not important.
>  Almost everyone is no longer interested in the results from 3 years ago.
>  I feel like the only thing they talk about is what they are doing now or what they are trying to do.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1871347059527479600) I've been thinking about this some more, and I think "everyone" is too abstract and can be interpreted differently depending on whether "the type of person who doesn't care about the results from 3 years ago" is [[someone you know]].
>  It's easier to understand when you zoom in and say, "I made XXX 25 years ago!" is a story that feels like "a long time ago, before I was born" to a 20 year old person.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1871349041134731632) When we communicate only with people of our age group, we don't realize that we are slowing down because our [[sense of time]] is slowing down together.
> If you are in an environment where the [[authoritarian gradient]] is strong and young people are added to the "bottom," you can defend yourself by saying [It's worse for young people who don't know about the past.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1871349720586784935) If you observe from the perspective of genuinely trying to learn from young people, you can observe that when they talk about five years ago, they develop feelings like, "You started talking about something long ago," "You were in middle school," "What are you doing these days that's not about that? What are you doing nowadays?

- Feel uncomfortable or feel a sense of emptiness in the way the community is based on money and the axis of evaluation
- As a result, "fun" and "what you are doing/what you are going to do" become more important.
- As we age, our attention shifts to "what we're doing right now" rather than "what we used to do.
- Prone to a gap in sense of time with the younger generation and a gap in perception due to authority gradients.
...and the like are discussed.

The more we grow up, the less likely we are to be valued solely on the basis of "money" or "old accomplishments," but rather on the basis of "what are you doing now?" and "What are you doing now? On the other hand, although they want money, they also feel the risk of not being able to create "interesting" and "valuable" things if they focus on money. Therefore, it is repeatedly pointed out in tweets that "doing something interesting" is more likely to result in scarcity and attract attention.

There is also the phenomenon that when people of the same age group are solidified together, their own sense of time becomes misaligned, highlighting the importance of a perspective that takes the youth's viewpoint straight to heart.

- Money is important in life, of course, but I find it difficult to keep people's attention if that is the only focus. Rather, it is "what you are doing now" and "what interesting things you are creating" that attracts people. Past achievements are not completely useless, but the older you get, the more you are required to keep renewing yourself - and for this reason, I think it is essential to get involved with the younger generation and different communities.
