## Commonalities between [[open source]] philosophy and [Marxism
.
- Sharing the [[means of production]]: The [[open source movement]] shares the [[means of production]] of knowledge by releasing software source code so that anyone can use, modify, and distribute it. Marxism seeks to give workers control over the value created by their own labor through [[co-ownership]] and management of the [[means of production]]. In this regard, both emphasize [[democratization]] of access to and use of the means of production.
- [[Cooperation]] and [[Community]] : Open source projects take a community-based approach where developers from around the world work together to develop and improve software. Marxism also emphasizes social progress through worker unity and cooperation. The value of working together toward a common goal is an important element for both.
    - Value of [[shared resources]]: Open source is based on the idea that knowledge and software create maximum value as shared [[public goods (i.e. goods or services such as parks or highways)]]. Marxism holds that goods produced jointly should be enjoyed jointly. The parallels are similar in that the focus is on the equitable creation and distribution of value through shared resources.

## different contexts and purposes
.
However, the open source movement and Marxism emerged from radically different contexts. Open source is a movement concerned with the sharing of technology and knowledge and focuses on methodologies of software development and distribution. Marxism, on the other hand, is a political philosophy that seeks broad analysis and transformation of the economy and social structure in general.

The open source movement has also developed within capitalist society, proposing new forms of business models and innovation. Marxism, by contrast, seeks to fundamentally critique capitalism and to build alternative social institutions.
