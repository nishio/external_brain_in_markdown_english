People who want to talk about politics.
> [takuramix](https://twitter.com/takuramix/status/1780150332921970780) I've had more than a few experiences where I happily respond to someone who wants to talk politics and they give me a momentary look of disgust...
>  In such cases, when we start a serious discussion, almost 100% of the time, the other side tries to dye our side with their argument....
>  Even a dull person like me would realize that.
>  "Oh, this is not what I want to talk politics about."
>  I'm sorry...

> [takuramix](https://twitter.com/takuramix/status/1780151596552495123) ... the other party wants
>  "I want to confirm myself as the chosen people to teach and lead the fools who have no interest in talking politics."
>  or some other distorted sense of superiority.
>  "Bow down to my teachings! But you fools will never understand!"
>  It's like a kind of "I'm special" kind of thing, where the person wants to feel special by being rejected.

> [takuramix](https://twitter.com/takuramix/status/1780152394644664669) ...So when we try to talk about politics with each other in a gruff way, these people look bad for a moment.
>  "Huh? If someone is more willing to talk about politics than you are, you can't mount them..."
>  I guess that's what they really want.
>  But you know, politics is interesting, so I don't think there's any reason to avoid it.

> [takuramix](https://twitter.com/takuramix/status/1780152766662689018) ...People who go around denigrating personalities and such just because they have a different opinion, no matter what the topic is, even if it's not politics, are the kind of people who do that. I'm not sure if it's about politics or not, but I don't think it matters.

> [takuramix](https://twitter.com/takuramix/status/1780155003904426092) ...By the way, I meet several times a year with Communist Party supporters who don't agree with me every time, I meet with supporters of the Communist Party several times a year, but no matter how much our opinions clash and our incompatibility becomes obvious, we always end up seeing each other again.
>  That's the way it is.
>  It is natural to have differences of opinion, and it is human to make mistakes at times.


If you have some specific ideal you want to achieve, you're going to want to talk to someone who can help you achieve it.
So anyone who says, "Let's talk politics," is someone whose behavior is beneficial (i.e., the goal is to get people to talk).

- [[Increase only when it is more beneficial to increase.]]
- [[Don't persuade people you don't need to persuade.]]
