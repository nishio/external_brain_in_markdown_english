In the past, the development of broadcasting technologies such as radio and television made it possible to reach a large number of people, but it was not possible to hear the voices of many. However, it was not possible to hear the voices of many people, and from around 2023, the development of [[large-scale language modeling]] technology will make it possible to summarize the opinions of many people, visualize them in an easy-to-understand manner, and summarize them in a report. This "technology of listening to many voices" is called [[broad listening]].
