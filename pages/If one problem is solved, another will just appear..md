title: "If one problem is solved, another will just appear."

> [@yamaz](https://twitter.com/yamaz/status/1557910813201285120?s=21&t=RxHkom8oSkgcqvY8V3PwDw): "AI will destroy software engineers" will probably not happen. It will happen because AI will extend humanity's problem-solving abilities, making more areas solvable and rather more needed.
>  The understanding is that even if some problem is completely solved by technology, it is only overwritten by a higher-level problem that is given to it, which is what has happened in human development up to now.
>  Even in programming languages, from the days of hand assembly, modern languages have evolved to compiler-compiler-compiler-compiler if you take into account the internal structure, and yet there is no sign of stopping.
