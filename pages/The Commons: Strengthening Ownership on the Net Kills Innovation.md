> The long-awaited new book by leading cyberlaw expert Mr. Lessig!
>
>  Since its publication last spring, his previous book, "CODE" has caused a stir among experts such as Ken Sakamura (computer science), Hiroki Azuma (philosophy researcher), and Dori Nishigaki (media theory), and has become a classic book that cannot be discussed without it in the cyber law debate. Now that the Internet has become commonplace, Lessig and Hiroo Yamagata (translator) present the hottest issues related to the Internet and law that are occurring today!
>
>  Existing books on the Internet have often argued that strengthening property rights is the key to technological innovation, and have emphasized the Internet as a tool for piracy only. This book directly contradicts this argument, and clearly argues that strengthening property rights will instead kill the potential for technological innovation and have negative consequences for all of us. This is an important issue for Japan, which is following the lead of the U.S. in calling for stronger ownership rights of all kinds.
>  This book is more specific in content than its predecessor, "CODE," and provides detailed background on the Microsoft court case. The arguments of the DOJ, which are not well understood, are clearly explained here. This book is a must-have not only for those who work in the field of intellectual property rights, but also for general readers who are interested in the Internet.
>  AUTHORBIO: ■Lawrence Lessig...Professor of Law at Stanford University and the world's leading authority on cyber law.
>  The Japanese translation of "CODE" (published by Shoei) presented a new perspective on the Internet and cyber law.
