title: "Pigs and Chickens"
---

Talk about a pig that is serving meat for a project and a chicken that is just serving eggs.

It was in the first edition of the Scrum Guide, but they removed it in the 2011 edition.
>  When the chicken and the pig were together, the chicken said, "Let's start a restaurant.
>  Pig thought for a moment and then said, "What's the name of that restaurant? What's the name of that restaurant?" Pig thought for a moment and said, "What is the name of that restaurant?
>  Then the chicken said. Ham and Eggs!" > > And the chicken said, "Ham and Eggs!
>  Pig said.
>  "No, thank you. You may simply get involved, but we will cut ourselves."

Pigs serving meat, a concept similar to "[[use one's own money]]".
- A story that focuses more on time and seriousness about the project than on whether or not to pay for it.
        - [[Cash is weak capital]] So.
        - [[Enthusiasm is a valuable resource]]

Chickens say a lot of ideas, but they are not sincere about their projects.
- Ideas (eggs) can be beneficial or futile.

> Pig
>  They dedicate themselves to the project and the agile team. They are committed to their work. They work in a pig pen with other pigs who prefer to share the work and their environment with them. If they were practicing Agile correctly, they would be more than happy to send their bacon out on the line every day. This is because they themselves are responsible for their work. They are proactive and responsible for the success of the project, and many, but not all, teams have performance goals that are directly related to the success of the project and their team.

>  Chicken
>  They go back and forth between projects. While chickens are very helpful in terms of providing eggs, they are not dedicated team members and do not always understand all contexts. So sometimes they may provide rotten eggs on a spur-of-the-moment basis. They are not responsible for the success of the project, even if they are responsible for a small part of the performance goals that are directly related to the success of the project.

    - There are other animals, this was new to me.
