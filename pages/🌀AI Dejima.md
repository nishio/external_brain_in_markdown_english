1: Digest of notes

Granting full access to an AI carries risks. As a solution, the concept of an "AI Dejima" has been proposed. This would explicitly restrict access to the AI and allow interaction with the AI only within the limits of that access. Specifically, data related to a particular project would be exported separately and placed in a de-island.

2: Relation to Fragment X

The fragment "AI Dejima" is directly related to the note. The note discusses the risks of granting full access to AI and the concept of "AI Dejima" as a solution. The fragment explains in detail what exactly this "AI Dejima" is, along with its historical background.

3: Deep thinking

The concept of "AI Dejima" has the potential to redefine the AI-human relationship, providing a new framework for maximizing AI capabilities while mitigating the risks of granting AI full access. It provides a new perspective for maximizing AI-human interaction.

4: Thought Summary and Title

AI Dejima" provides a new framework for maximizing AI-human interaction.

# SUMMARY
.
We discussed removing the 🤖 mark from the title of AI-generated pages and felt that it was natural for humans to respond to AI-generated content. However, we questioned the fact that the content was not subject to being read by the AI. We also discussed the lack of assumption of a collaborative editing forum.

# Relevance
This note is related to a fragment of Nishio's research note, "Buried at the Bottom of the AI Page" The idea that it is natural for humans to respond to AI-generated pages and the problem of human thoughts being buried at the bottom of AI-generated pages are, in terms of information transfer between AI and humans closely related.

# deep thinking
The issue of information transfer between AI and humans leads to the larger question of how to set the premise for AI-human collaboration: the original idea of preventing AI from reading what it generates was predicated on the unidirectional nature of information transfer between AI and humans. However, the observation that it is natural for humans to react to what AI generates provides a new perspective that information transfer between AI and humans should be bidirectional.

# summary of thoughts
Information transfer between AI and humans should be bidirectional.

# Title
.
"AI and Human Information Transfer: The Need for Bidirectionality."
