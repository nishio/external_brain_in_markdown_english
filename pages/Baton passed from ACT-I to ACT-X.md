Dr. Yuichiro Anzai, "[[Let's]] establish the individual."
- Advice: "Be free to think independently, promote your own research, and become a leading expert in your field.
- The ACT-I was designed with the aim of supporting young researchers with "passion," with an emphasis on helping them to "establish themselves.
    - Following the success of ACT-I, its successor program, JST ACT-X, continues to develop as "a program that hopes to establish individual young researchers

- 1 ) Supporting young researchers to "establish themselves
- (2) Support young researchers to promote challenging research and development while taking the initiative with free ideas.
- 3 ) Provide [[opportunities for human exchange]] that will serve as [[a foundation for future collaboration]] by young researchers.

Introduced "an immediate and confidential communication environment through text chat tools" to the interview screening process.
- Text communication in Slack
- Communication between the research director, area advisors, and JST staff on their own computers
- Not visible to applicants.
    - Exchange opinions during presentations and during questioning.
    - Share what opinions and questions you had while listening to the interview presentation.
    - Able to traffic what the research director wants the area advisor to hear in the Q&A session.
- Slack implementation has been dramatically superior
    - Screening of a large number of applicants and diverse disciplines made possible based on in-depth discussions
    - Impossible to just use the usual method of filling out the evaluation sheet after the presentation and sharing that file.

In ACT-I, the standard period of support was set at 1.5 years, and an additional accelerated phase period of 2 years was set for about one-third of the standard period by JST.
- We thought it was important to avoid the [[stage-gate]]-like misconception that "only the successful ones will advance to the acceleration phase."
- Explicit notice that the standard period is the heart of ACT-I's support
- All young researchers who took on the challenge of a year and a half of research can be proud to be "[[graduates]]" of this research area and be able to play an active role thereafter.
    - An important concept for unexplored juniors and unexplored IT<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - We need to make sure that those who were not selected as Super Creators can be proud to be "graduates".
        - We must ensure that those who did not advance to the Unexplored Advanced are not regarded as "those who could not lead to commercialization".
- Additional support was made available on request.
    - In fact, many do not wish to.


3 ．Act-I "Information and the Future" area meeting devised by
- [[Closed outside meetings where all can meet and actively engage in in-depth discussion]].
- A place for friendly competition and mutual inspiration
    - Foundation for future collaboration
    - be memorable
    - It is important to provide opportunities for human interaction

- It is difficult for about 70 people to interact with each other in a friendly and memorable way by simply repeating 70 short presentations and Q&A sessions, as is typical at academic conferences.
- (i) Creating an active voice environment through text chat
    - Related:.[[Announcement Parallel Chat]] <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - When you have a simple question about the content of a presentation that is far away from your area of expertise, it is less psychologically challenging to post it in a chat room.
        - Other audience members with close expertise provided supplementary explanations, which deepened the understanding of the audience as a whole.
    - Gives more feedback than the usual questioning
        - Visualize what a large audience thought of your presentation
    - Slack content displayed on a small screen in front so that it could be read
- (ii) Use of large, easy-to-read name tags
    - Postcard-sized nameplate with last name in a large, prominent font
    - Print the same information on both sides of the nameplate so that the first and last name can be read even if the nameplate is turned over.
    - Related:.[[RubyKaigi nameplate]] <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Also include the title of the research project
    - The color of the nameplate was changed for each fiscal year so that students could easily identify their peers.
- (iii) Seat assignment
    - To make it easier to talk to people you have never talked to before and to promote interdisciplinary exchange
    - All seating in the presentation rooms and at lunch and dinner were reserved.
    - Once you talk next to each other, it will be easier to talk during breaks, etc.
    - Convincing,[[指定席メソッド]]と呼ぼう<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

- Reflection with KPT
    - All participants reflect on the domain meeting and write a 5-minute summary in Slack at the end of each meeting.
    - An average of about 149 entries are written.

- Area Advisor Talks and Research Summary Talks: 5-minute talks per person when time permits on the program.
    - Content is left up to the speaker
- Alumni Session
    - Researchers (graduates) who have completed their research term may voluntarily participate in area meetings upon agreeing to a confidentiality agreement.
    - After 2020, when the number of presenters will be reduced, we will have time for alumni to report on their recent activities.
        - The Unexplored IT[[Boost Conference]] に近い<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - is "voluntary" meaning "available to those who wish to participate"?
            - If that's the case, then the route is a little different from the unexplored IT that "participates at the request of the PM"
            - In the fifth year (2006) after this trial began, Unexplored said, "By all means, come on over in droves!"
            - Since 2008, there have been so many people who wanted to participate that the time for alumni to report on their recent activities has been overflowing.
            - After that, they stopped taking requests to participate.


- The four regional meetings after FY2020 will be held using Zoom.
    - The audience always showed up, too, and we made an effort to clearly state the family name and the year of adoption.
    - The ability to see each other's faces during breaks and other times of the day made it possible to interact in a chat-like manner.
    - get-together
        - Zoom's Breakout Room
        - Random forced shuffling every 15 minutes
    - Advantages for alumni to participate remotely
    - There are many difficulties regarding which is better compared to the physical holding.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Definitely useful as a work-around for a time when it was not possible to hold a physical at COVID19
        - Ditto the benefit of facilitating alumni participation.
        - There is fatigue due to prolonged periods of constant frontal viewing.
        - There is a psychological hurdle to starting a conversation in a general shared setting during breaks.
            - When you go to the person you want to talk to in a physical holding and start talking, you start with a conversation between two people, and that conversation is visible to those around you, so people can gradually join in.
            - Zoom starts with a whole broadcast.
            - On the other hand, if you create a [[breakout room]] that can be freely entered and exited for individual conversation, the conversation in the room cannot be seen from the outside.
            - I think this is the degree to which Zoom's UI could be improved in this area.
            - Another solution was the use of [[Spatial Chat]] in 2020 at Unexplored Junior ([[2020 Unexplored Junior SpatialChat]]).
                - is not very good, and in 2021, the management allocated (rather than randomizing the system) to Zoom's breakout room
                - Close to [Reserved seat method
            - The 2022 Unexplored Conference Night was a get-together at [[oVice]].
            - I also have the impression that [[Remo]] and [[Gather.town]] are being tried here and there.


4 ．Act-I "Information and the future" ingenuity in the debriefing session of the results of the
- ACT-I Advanced Research Forum, a public forum for the presentation of results
- A place that attracts attention in an atmosphere different from that of a regular conference presentation
- It is important to provide "a place where people feel it is worth presenting.
    - Professionally staged and hosted stage
    - High-impact visual and musical effects when researchers take the stage
    - Opening and closing videos are shown at the beginning and at the end of the entire event.
    - Attractively designed pamphlets distributed at the event
    - The Unexplored Conference alumni LT may be pretty close in composition, although the number of slots is small.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I wish I could afford more, but it looks like I can't.
- Archives are also important
    - Video recordings of the presentations and posters were made continuously available on the Internet for anyone to view.
    - I completely agree with "archiving is important too."<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - In addition, the videos of boost meetings and interim presentations are stored in the private Scrapbox, in addition to the publicly available "results reports.
        - Participants from the next and subsequent years can see "what last year's participants presented" and have the opportunity to learn about the project development process
