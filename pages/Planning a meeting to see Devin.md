    - [[planned contingency theory]] : A way of thinking that makes use of chance in a planned manner.
    - [[Barbell Strategy]]: A method of managing risk by having both risky and safe assets.
- [Convert to non-monetary capital: Place emphasis on non-monetary values such as knowledge and trust.
    - [[Information is gathered to the sender of information.]]: An attitude of actively transmitting information and obtaining information interactively.
    - [[Bridging Communities Communities]]: move as a link between different groups.
