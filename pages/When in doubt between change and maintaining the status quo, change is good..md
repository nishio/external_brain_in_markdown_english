- I've been arguing for a while that [[when in doubt]] is an equal estimate of the alternatives, so you can [[coin flipping]] and decide, but I'm going to take it a step further from there.
- Unlike the case where you are lost between action A and action B, it is not valid if you are lost between action A and non-action notA ([[maintenance of the status quo]]).
- Because humans have [[status quo bias]], when we are torn between A and notA, notA is overestimated by bias and is rated equal, so A is more promising by the amount of bias.
    - [[change]] 、 [[movement]] 、 [[Step out and the landscape will change.]]
