from [/unnamedcamp/individual's purpose apart from the purpose of the place](https://scrapbox.io/unnamedcamp/individual's purpose apart from the purpose of the place).
- [[The problem of not knowing what to write in a shared project]]
> I feel there needs to be a purpose to the sharing
> Running knowledge/ Consciously doing something "a little hard"/ Aiming for atomicity/ Bringing knowledge together, exchange, interaction
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamedcamp/nishio/icon' alt='/unnamedcamp/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>There is an "individual purpose" separate from the "purpose of the place."
    - People are acting for their individual purposes.
    - People belong to a place because the purpose of the place is beneficial to their individual purposes.
    - Individual objectives fluctuate from day to day for a variety of reasons.
        - When the purpose of a place is no longer beneficial to the individual's objectives, the individual leaves the place.
            - Especially since the Scrapbox project has almost zero "unseen" cost, so you won't see it right away.
> I feel the need to recognize the issues and individuality of each
- It would be good if each of us wrote about this "problem consciousness," "individuality," and "purpose"-like thumbing.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamedcamp/nishio/icon' alt='/unnamedcamp/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

- I wrote[/nishio/Scrapbox Best Practices](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/Scrapbox Best Practices) in 2017 and it's still being looked at quite a bit 5 years later, so I want to rewrite it with current knowledge.
- My perception as of 2022 was that it was better to place it in a multi-person project instead of writing it alone, and it was felt that
- I did it in [/villagepump/Scrapbox Best Practices 2022 manuscript v1](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/Scrapbox Best Practices 2022 manuscript v1).
- Lack of knowledge and experience regarding multi-person projects through discussions
- from [/villagepump/Scrapbox best practices 2022 manuscript v1](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/Scrapbox best practices 2022 manuscript v1).
    - > It would be good to check out other projects that have multiple people working on them.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamedcamp//villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/unnamedcamp//villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - > If you have the time, I recommend joining a multi-person project that is working well first.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamedcamp//villagepump/yosider/icon' alt='/unnamedcamp//villagepump/yosider.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamedcamp//villagepump/kuuote/icon' alt='/unnamedcamp//villagepump/kuuote.icon' height="19.5"/>
- So, I think, at least for the present, everything that the other members do or don't do is useful as "observation of a public multi-person project".
    - It is interesting to note that both in and out of the project, "[does not write well (pen, brush, etc.)" and "seems hard to write" are found
        - e.g.  [[When do you think it is easy or difficult to write for a shared project?]]
