title: "Context Proto and Insights"
---

Looking back on my 2020 activities, I realized that I had never considered the relationship between [[contextual prototype]] and the insights presented in the [[Textbook of Design Research]], even though there seemed to be a relationship.

- What is a [[contextual prototype]]?
    - →Prototype to verify if users perceive value in the story
    - [[Textbook of Design Research]]
    - Extracting Insights
        - What is good insight?
            - Read and understand: so that it is possible to involve people who do not know the context in your team
            - Leading to innovation
            - New findings

In other words, contextual proto is about the people who receive what is created, whereas insight is about the people who participate in the design process
