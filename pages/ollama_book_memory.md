Devin made it.
I'll keep you posted on the review.

- [[book]]

Information about the book's structure, gleaned from the table of contents, is important for understanding the book's content.

I'm going to run it for now and go to bed.

For example, if you spend one minute per page, a 300-page book will be processed in one night.
- When I woke up, I was about 60 pages ahead.
