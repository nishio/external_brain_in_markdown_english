title: "Perception of one's own mistakes"
---

It was discussed in one of the chats and was interesting, so I made a note of it

A period in which you are unaware that you could be wrong.
↓
Observe your mistakes several times.
↓
I am aware that I can be wrong.
- Personality 1: So act humble.
- Personality 2: I can make mistakes, but the probability of mistakes is much lower than the average person, so I don't worry about it and go on and on.
- Personality 3: I can make mistakes, but the probability of mistakes is much lower than the average person, so I don't mind, but if I make it public, the average person is offended, so I act humble.
