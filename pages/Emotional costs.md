Not only money, but also time and emotion cost everything. Therefore, they would rather go through with it and look for other opportunities than to fight. The rich person thinks, "The cost of fighting is a waste of time," and goes for his goal. Short-term wins and losses are not important.

>  In business, for example, if a customer makes an unreasonable complaint, you quickly apologize, give a refund, etc., and never do business with them again. Every time you respond, it costs you time and labor, as well as emotional costs, and exhausts your staff. The right thing to do is to distance yourself from troublesome clients. Clinging to money, pride, winning or losing is not the way to go.
>
>  In addition, even if they won the fight, they would leave the impression to those around them that they are a "fighter" or "fighting company.
>
>  To begin with, rich people are rich because they have good negotiating and communication skills, so fights are very rare. They also rarely get into fights because they have plenty of money to spare, which is the cause of many fights.
>
>  "Rich people don't fight" is true, and conversely, it is easier to become rich if you don't fight.
>
>  However, when you need to protect someone important, for example, you should consider other means than fighting, and then fight thoroughly if necessary.
