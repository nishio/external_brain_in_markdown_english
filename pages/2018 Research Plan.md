title: "2018 Research Plan"
---

- The changes that information processing technology is bringing to society
    - Change, of course, includes technological advances brought about by information processing technology (like Mr. Ochiai's [[computer nature]]).
    - On the other hand, information processing technology enables diverse ways of working and actually generates diverse ways of working, leading to changes in organizational forms and management methodologies
        - Parallel work in the context of changing forms of work
            - Parallel work creates a pipeline between different organizations and is a kick-start for open innovation.
            - Diversity increases the speed of search.
            - On the flip side, diversity increases communication costs.
            - As forms of communication change and supporting software evolves, discontinuous change can occur

- Advances in Machine Learning Technology+.
    - Examples of functions that could not be acquired by humans through language-based thinking, but can be acquired through numerical-based optimization
    - Computational acquisition of language meaning as seen in word2vec
    - natural language processing
    - Changing forms of communication between people

- Language Support
    - Support for formalization and internalization
    - The Future of Groupware

- Evolutionary History of Programming Languages
    - Programming is verbalized by an artificial language
    - Language evolution has increased the efficiency of verbalization.
    - On the flip side, there has been an increased demand for the acquisition of concepts outside of the language. Object-oriented, for example.

- unexplored
    - Mechanisms for Innovation
    - This is the effect of "selection by unfixed scale" as mentioned in Mr. Ochiai's column the other day
    - Unexplored as a network generator
