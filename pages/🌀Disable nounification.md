### Considerations and questions

Given the relevance of the "superficial coined words" fragment, it seems important that the concepts to which the words refer be useful when creating the words. Considering the relevance of the "Judging by Actions" fragment, it would seem that not only words but also actions are important in making words. From these perspectives, what factors should be emphasized when creating a word?

In addition, given the relevance of the "post-LLM worldview" fragment, it would seem that training in expressing one's experiences in words would be important. But how should that training be conducted? And what do we think we can gain through that training?

### Digest of Research Notes
.

My previous research note was on the topic "Linguification is the abstraction of concrete experience". This refers to the process of transforming the concrete events we experience into abstract concepts and words.

Nishio's research note, "[[Dig deeper and see circulation]]," discusses the training of handling abstract concepts without connecting them to concrete experience. This is closely related to my research, which shows the importance of maintaining a clear connection between concrete experiences and abstract concepts when abstracting them.

In "[[Reproduction through labeling that verbalizes the experience]]," I explain the importance of labeling that verbalizes the experience and makes it reproducible. This is directly related to my research topic, which emphasizes the importance of representing concrete experiences in a reproducible way when abstracting them.

In "[[As yet unnamed concepts that emerge from experience]]," you point out that there are new concepts and theories that emerge from experience that have not yet been verbalized. This is related to my research topic, which is the potential for new concepts and theories to emerge from experience when concrete experiences are abstracted.


Clean Language as 🤖🔁 Board Game

Train yourself to express your own experiences in words, connecting language with specific sensations and experiences. Review and brush up tentative verbalizations over time to make them more precise and expressive.

It is a deeper understanding of metaphor, which in turn leads to a deeper understanding of clean language. This is not a contest where ideas alone are evaluated, but whether or not those ideas can be realized.

As for how to end the presentation, it is appropriate to end with an open question to the audience about what is troubling you at the moment.

### Relation to Fragment
.

The "questions cause a flow state" fragment relates to the concept that Clean Language questions promote verbalization. The point that it is important to enter the flow state by considering questions of moderate difficulty is helpful in setting clean-language questions.

The "Intellectual Production Techniques of Engineers: A Reaction Summary" fragment discusses the phases of information gathering and is related to the study of eliciting information with clean language.

The "Conversation Log 2019-07-27-2" fragment has a discussion about the detection of languageization and is related to the goal of encouraging clean language languageization.


Keichobot on ChatGPT
- For concepts where the verb is in the noun form, I have found it beneficial to change it back to the verb form before asking the question.
- I see, I understand. Indeed, I can clarify more specific actions and methods by asking questions after reverting to the verb form. I hope you will find this useful in your future communication. Is there anything else you would like to discuss?
- What kind of input is needed to transfer the knowledge gained from this conversation to the next conversation?
- Before you give your input, it may be helpful to organize and summarize for yourself the knowledge and insights you gained from this conversation. For example, we learned from this conversation that it is important to ask questions in the verb form, not the noun form. You can put that into your own words and summarize it as, "It is important to ask questions in the verb form in order to elaborate on a concept. In the next conversation, you can use such a summary to ask more specific questions.

You are a counselor who listens to my statements. You do not give your own opinion, but ask questions for elaboration on my statements. You are not to offer any new information. The purpose of this conversation is to help my vague ideas become more concrete mental images, and to gain awareness that will lead to action. You use Symbolic Modelling. You direct my awareness to my inner self by asking questions. You must ask one question per statement. Don't ask multiple questions. You begin by asking me, "What would you like to see happen in this conversation?" and find the key concept in my response, then ask a question that elaborates on that concept. Ask questions to elicit characteristics, specific examples, and metaphors. After you have fleshed out the concepts, ask questions about the relationships between them. You should never answer a question. Never ask more than one question in a single statement.

- But there is no need to be afraid.
You can put your thoughts out of your mind first, write them down so they don't disappear, and then improve them into a form that people can understand.
Even if written in your own personal language, the words act as handles, and they facilitate the manipulation of your thoughts.

It is important to focus on what has not yet been said.
For example, physical sensations, experiences, discomfort, etc.

> On the other hand, as in the case of "birdcalls," it is often the case that the concrete physical senses are disconnected from the language that is the handle.
There is a disconnect between the words that serve as handles and the specific experience.
On the other hand, handles are often disconnected from the concrete experience, as in the "birdsong" example.

On the other hand, it is often the case that the handle is disconnected from the concrete experience, as in the "birdsong" example. In such cases, it is necessary to go down to the physical sensations and experiences and reconnect them with the handle. The goal here is to connect "what is not yet verbalized in your mind" with the handle as a word.

The "not the continuity of an individual thing" suggests the viewpoint that an individual thing does not continue to exist, but rather is transformed into another individual thing.

Jiro Kawakita stated that "Jiro Kawakita did not say to abstract," because the word "abstraction" itself is abstract, so it is not clear what specific action should be taken when one is told to "abstract." In Study Session 1 of "Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning," he states that "felt meaning" is involved in the "idea."
