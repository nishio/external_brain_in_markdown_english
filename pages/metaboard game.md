title: "metaboard game"
---

- Some people who like [[board games]] are the type of people who "like to play new board games.
What I am referring to here is not a person with a distorted need for approval who wants to look big by playing a new game he has mastered with people who have not yet mastered it.
Someone is playing a [[meta-]]game where "the person who understands the new system the fastest wins."
It is a puzzle to understand the system and to find out how to behave efficiently based on the system.

Is it not limited to board games? Start a new game and play it as a puzzle game to find an efficient way out.

The word "meta" is hard to get across.
