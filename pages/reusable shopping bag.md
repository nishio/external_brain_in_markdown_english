> Compact yet large capacity! Cute looking stretchable eco-bag with a large capacity of about 5 kg, which can hold an A4-size bag. The stretchable fabric will expand and contract according to the size of your baggage. It is an item that you can carry with you every day for shopping at convenience stores and supermarkets, as well as for outings, commuting to work and school.
>  [Can be placed in a bag as it is! No need to fold】The bag has a wrinkled, squeezed texture, so when you are finished using it, you can put it directly into your bag♪ No need to worry about wrinkles, and no need to fold it neatly. Even if you take it in and out frequently, it is a stress-free and easy-to-use eco-bag.

I bought a new one because it got dirty while I was using it and it stopped shrinking.
