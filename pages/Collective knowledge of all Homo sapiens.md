- What [[qualic acid]] thinks is the most interesting in this era
> As for Mr. Qualia, I think the most interesting thing about this age is the [[wisdom of crowds]] of the whole Homo sapiens. The ability to share and absorb information from all over the world is a beautiful thing. The idea of having [[our own story]] is empowering, but we must remember that our personal story is also shaped by the [[collective history]] of other people's [[stories]] and [[civilization]]. Our [[Sharing Experiences]] will help us to create a more [[interconnected]] and [[information-rich world]].
