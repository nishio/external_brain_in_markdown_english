title: "The market can play the role of denial."
---

- [[Advances in Technology]] have made things more [[low-cost execution]] than they used to be.
A solution is created to a problem that was once [[difficult]] or for which no realistic solution existed.

An [[excessive abstraction]] of the [[obsolescence]] experience of "it was difficult then" by someone who has experienced difficult times, and "this is difficult in general".

This is one of the most harmful [[Pessimistic Misconceptions]] of misconceptions, so younger people should ignore older people's [[Pessimistic claims should be ignored.]]
    - [[Clark's first law]]

A common thought among older people is, "He doesn't understand [[harshness of the world]], so I have to teach him."
- But it is strange that an individual who is not a part of the "world" should take on the role of teaching the harshness of the "world" in the first place.
        - [[No one is equal to the market.]]
