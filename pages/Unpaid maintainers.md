title: "Unpaid maintainers"

- [[Plurality Books]]  p.89
> Communities form around common interests, freely leverage each other's work, scrutinize contributions through unpaid [[maintainers]], and "fork" projects into parallel versions when there are incompatible differences.

[[Basic income is needed for public goods maintainers.]]
[[basic income]] is needed so that the "unpaid maintainers" don't die, and
I wonder if this is basically an application of [[constraint theory]], where it is optimal not to make [[utilization rate]] 100%, and thus the activities of [[idle human resources]] that inevitably arise.

>  I think you mentioned before that there is not a steady demand for a steady amount of work for engineers in your company.
>  From a constraint theory point of view, it is not optimal to aim for 100% utilization, but if you reserve more space, you can create [[playing]] space and use it for [[public goods (i.e. goods or services such as parks or highways)]] type projects. I thought it might be a good idea.

>  The perception is that in the past, deployment costs were ridiculously high, so outsourcing because there was a wave of development to reduce the number of deployments.
>  So, as a result of this being in the cloud, we are building a lot of small software and deploying it at any time, the uptime wave disappears, and we go directly to hiring
- [[wave of operations]]

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1824358944304927001) But if the wave of operations is gone, then I can't use [[who has available hands]] to invest in public goods as I originally thought...
> [tokoroten](https://x.com/tokoroten/status/1824359343304970624) I'm wondering if it's possible to shove [[newcomer training]] for IT companies into [[public goods investment]].
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1824360997173465112) Hmmm, that's exactly the kind of patch that society needs, small but diverse, so it's hard to build a stable educational curriculum and a lot of work on the mentor's side... It would be easier if they were the ones who could just throw it all out there with "find the needs yourself and build a project of a reasonable size..."
