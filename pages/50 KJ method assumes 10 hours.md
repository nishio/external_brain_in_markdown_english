title: "50 KJ method assumes 10 hours"
---

- Jiro Kawakita wrote clearly about how long the [[KJ method]] takes.

I used to think that the "1.5 hours to do KJ method" workshop design was too short, but now I can use this as a basis for pointing out that it is not what Jiro Kawakita calls "KJ method in the narrow sense. However, from now on, I will be able to point out that this is not what Jiro Kawakita calls "KJ method in the narrow sense.

> First of all, [[Integrated Fireworks]] can be put together in a short time, while the KJ method takes some time. For example, for 40 to 50 pieces of material, it takes 2 to 3 hours for Integrated Fireworks and about 10 hours for KJ method. In this sense, the integrated fireworks is a simple summary, while the KJ method is a full-scale summary. In addition, in terms of the conclusions that emerge, the integrated fireworks is a summary that can be used on the spot, whereas the conclusions obtained by the KJ method can be used over a long period of time.
