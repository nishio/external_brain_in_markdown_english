title: "Stop image flashing"
---

- [[Canvas Pollution Solution Edition]], which was resolved in a sub-sequential manner.

It used to say "a realistic sized task on the iPad should run at a speed that is acceptable", but the problem we want to solve is supposed to be "stop blinking images", so we renamed it.
It was confirmed that replacing the Reconsiler will solve the problem, but it is quite difficult to fix with this policy

- Realistically sized tasks on the iPad should run at a speed that is not problematic.
    - I'm using a PC to move stickies because I can't do this right now, but if it works on the iPad, I can both handwrite and move stickies at the same time.
        - Includes a revamped [[state management]] mechanism
        - [[Verify if replacing the Reconsiler stops the image blinking on the iPad.]]  done
        - →This fix was put in the renew-states branch.
