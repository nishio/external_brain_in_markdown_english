title: "Distinguishing between PROBLEM and FAULT"

> [donkeydragonfly](https://twitter.com/donkeydragonfly/status/1755539075661210098) When I taught at an American university, I set up a "problem solving" session.

>  e.g., "the subway was late and I was late for my test" (an everyday occurrence in NYC).
>
>  Then I ask, "Whose problem is it?" Then the students will say that Yare Subway is bad or something like that.

I think you are mixing up "Who's fault is it?" with "Who's fault is it? You are mixing up "Who's fault is it? Whoever's fault it is, you are the one who loses out by being late for the test, so this is your problem. If you want to solve the problem, don't confuse the two.

Distinction between [[PROBLEM]] and [FAULT

> [takashikiso](https://twitter.com/takashikiso/status/1755398476412981608) Also, I was at a meeting yesterday, and when a problem occurs, even though everyone in the room is discussing the problem for "[[Problem Solving]]", some people start "looking for where the blame lies" instead of "solving" the problem. When a problem occurs, even though everyone in the room is discussing the problem for [[Problem Solving]], instead of [[Solution]], they start [[Searching for Responsibility]], or on the contrary, they try to say "[[It's not my fault]]". I really don't need people like that. I think they should wait until after the problem is solved.

Because of you! and "But, you know what? I want to say, "All the people here are not talking about that right now, if you're going to interrupt me, you guys should leave.
