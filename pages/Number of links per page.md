title: "Number of links per page"
---

The number of links per page is not a very good amount of features.

Scrapbox's backup page shows the number of pages and links.
I thought it was interesting that someone's project stated that the number of links per page was stable at about this value.
I thought I'd try it on my own project, but the simulation in my brain said, "Didn't you import a blog post without a link the other day and it decreased dramatically?" And it answered.

- [[Importing Hatena Diary into Scrapbox]]
It doesn't matter how many pages are unlinked and sunk with old updated dates and times, it doesn't matter for the regular use of Scrapbox.
Just a positive effect of that article being hit when you search for it.

What would be an appropriate indicator to describe the quality of the project?
