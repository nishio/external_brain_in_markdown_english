title: "Operating Scrapbox in multiple languages"

from [/villagepump/operating Scrapbox in multiple languages](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/operating Scrapbox in multiple languages).
- I wonder if it is possible to run a Scrapbox project in a way that English and Japanese are mixed.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/bluemountain/icon' alt='/villagepump/bluemountain.icon' height="19.5"/>
- If you put a link between English and Japanese words, you can use [[2 hop link]] to jump to the English page that leads to the Japanese page.
- Writing the title in multiple languages makes it harder to use as a Wiki!<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/増井俊之/icon' alt='/villagepump/増井俊之.icon' height="19.5"/>
- In the process of translating "The Art of Intellectual Production of Engineers" written in Japanese into English, there are times when I feel that a direct translation simply doesn't fit, so I have created a page that connects the Japanese notation, the English notation, and a number of English words to express it.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Example: [[IWAKAN]].
    - I have to choose one translation when I publish on paper, but I'm thinking that while it's in Scrapbox, I'd rather leave it in an indeterminate state for a better chance of future development.

If you looks something interesting but the auto-translated English is not good enough to understand it, feel free to let me know at [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en). I'm very happy to spread my thought to non-Japanese readers.
