Don't discuss anything on the internet [[kaityo256]].
> [kaityo256](https://x.com/kaityo256/status/1807789585243725833) Listen, student. Don't argue on the internet. They are conclusory, so there is no way to change their opinions. They don't even want your opinion in the first place. Don't waste your glorious youth on old people killing time.

It's easier to critique what someone else has published from a safe zone and feel like you've done something, but I want people to be on the "[[creator]]" and "[[transmitter]]" side. Without more people like that, the world will be boring.

In social networking sites, people use the word "debate" and try to "indoctrinate" others, so I think we should know that it is meaningless, as you said, it is only words.
