Polis has the following limitations and challenges regarding the deepening and development of opinions
- Fixation of Opinions
    - In Polis, [[clustering of opinions]] occurs when participants express agreement or disagreement with the opinions presented
    - However, once an opinion is expressed, it is difficult to change one's opinion or incorporate a new point of view in subsequent discussions
    - This may lead to fixation of opinions and inhibit the deepening and development of discussions
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I think there should be a UI to change this.
- context-sensitivity of opinions
    - In Polis, opinions are presented in short sentences, which may lead to a decision for or against without sufficient understanding of the background context.
    - If discussions proceed without sufficient sharing of the values, experiences, and knowledge behind the opinions, they may end up in superficial disagreements.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I'm having a hard time figuring this one out.
- Limits to Diversity of Opinion
    - Clustering in Polis is based on opinions presented early in the process, which may limit the scope of discussion
    - New perspectives and novel ideas may be less likely to emerge, and diversity of opinion may be lost.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>We should create a new Conversation.
- Lack of feedback
    - Polis allows participants to express agreement or disagreement with an opinion, but makes it difficult to provide reasons or alternatives
    - Lack of concrete feedback on opinions makes it difficult to generate constructive discussions
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>You're not the best at collecting improvement ideas.
- Lack of interaction between participants
    - Polis does not allow participants to interact directly with each other
    - Clustering of opinions takes place, but mechanisms to promote mutual understanding and consensus building among clusters are lacking
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I don't think the participants should be in direct dialogue with each other.

In light of the above limitations and challenges, Polis 2.0 is expected to facilitate the deepening and development of opinions by integrating Talk to the City. Through chats with clusters and interactions with virtual opinion leaders, participants will be able to review their opinions and incorporate new perspectives. In addition, the formation of a feedback loop is expected to facilitate the ongoing evolution and consolidation of opinions.
However, the resolution of technical issues and ethical considerations are essential to the realization of Polis 2.0. Facilitation methods must be established to promote constructive dialogue while ensuring diversity of opinions. Ensuring transparency and accountability to prevent manipulation and distortion of opinions by AI will also be an important issue.
