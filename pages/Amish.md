<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The Amish are a [[religious community]] derived from Mennonites, a branch of Christianity, especially in Pennsylvania and other states in the United States. They settled in North America in the 18th century as immigrants from Europe. The Amish are known for their emphasis on simplicity of life, modern technology, and ### [lack of
 electricity. The reason for this is to avoid the influence of the outside world, strengthen bonds within the community, and maintain a faith-based lifestyle.

Amish life revolves around subsistence farming, and the manufacture and sale of handcrafted goods is also an important source of income. They ### [[avoid the use of automobiles]]
 and use horse-drawn wagons, and many families are not connected to the electric grid. Also, in terms of education, Amish children generally receive education up to the 8th grade, after which they are employed in the family's farming or handicrafts.

The Amish community does not live in isolation from the outside world. They have access to modern medical care when needed and a certain degree of involvement with the outside economy. Even in doing so, however, they are ### [[cautious in their use of technology]]
 in order to preserve the values and traditions of the community.

This lifestyle chosen by the Amish symbolizes independence from the [[consumerism]] and [[dependence on technology]] of modern society, and their community shows that a different way of life is possible.
