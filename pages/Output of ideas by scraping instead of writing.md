In the past, "[[write]]" implicitly meant "I write."
- The style of [[output]] by [[AI writing and then human scraping]] was created.

Former Thoughts

    - Keep writing without erasing what you have written.
        - The act of erasing is throwing away [[food for thought]].
    - Writing allows you to [objectively look at your thoughts from a moment ago
    - By writing, we can recognize that [["natural" is subjective]].
    - Writing organizes information and [[combines]] abstract concepts with concrete examples
    - If you put your writing to bed, you will find [[unfounded assumptions]].

### digest
.

My research focuses on the act of writing to output thoughts. However, Nishio's study, "Don't Erase Manuscripts," points out that the act of erasing is discarding material for thought. This is relevant to my research.

My research claims that writing validates one's understanding and enables critical thinking. However, Nishio's study states that by continuing to write without erasing what you have written, you can find the best solution.

My research also claims that writing allows us to objectively look at our thoughts a moment ago. This is common to Nishio's research, "Tools for Thinking, Discovering, and Acting While Writing.

Furthermore, my research argues that writing allows us to recognize that the concept of "natural" is subjective. This is related to Nishio's study, "Putting the Normal into Words.

Finally, my research argues that writing helps us organize information and combine abstract information with concrete examples. This is related to Nishio's study, "Putting the written word to bed reveals unfounded assumptions.

For these reasons, I can say that my research and Nishio's research are deeply related. We argue that writing allows us to deepen our thinking and make new discoveries.
