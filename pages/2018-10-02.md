It is different from [[GAN]], but the concept is to use both [[generative models]] and [[Discrimination Models]].
- 1: First, train a generative model with selected sentences
- 2: Next, the model is used to generate the same number of fake sentences as the original sentences to train a discriminative model.
- 3: Select good sentences from a large number of sentences in that identification model.
I thought about the process of this.
