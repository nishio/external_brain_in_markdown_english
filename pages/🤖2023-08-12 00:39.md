## research related to diversity and personal credit systems
.

- QUESTION: How do we measure and update the value of individuals? How do we form personal trust while maintaining diversity?

## Transformation into a Critic and the Stretch Method
.

- Stretch methods may be an effective way to explore new value creation possibilities near corporate boundaries.
