The Japanese view of religion is very unique from a monotheistic perspective. It is common for the Japanese to follow several religions simultaneously, including Shintoism, Buddhism, and Christianity. This is because the Japanese view religion not as based on strict doctrines or precepts, but as a spiritual support and moral guide in life.

from [[🌸🔁Japanese language]].
Japanese is considered a difficult language to learn because of its complexity and unique ways of expression. However, this difficulty is also a reflection of Japanese culture and ways of thinking. For example, the Japanese language has honorific expressions that take into account the position and relationship of the other party. This indicates the Japanese tendency to place importance on social relationships and the feelings of others.
