> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1800321510479221035) I am taking on this challenge as an independent, and to be honest, I still do not have enough resources in terms of people and money.

- [[online campaigning]]
- I'm ready for "[[digital democracy]] sounds good..." at any time.
- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1800384469666504873) Audrey Tang" Reducing the time it takes for good ideas from young people to be understood and implemented by senior people is the key to advancing democracy. Digital natives do not believe that a four-year upload bandwidth is enough. They prefer to collaborate on a daily basis." Reference! #TOKYOAI
- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1800384686520500392) I summarized it to fit in one tweet, source:.
- >   [[Digital natives don't think that once-every-four-years upload bandwidth is enough.]]
- I'm not a digital native, but I can push the "once every four years is too slow a reaction time for the uploading interval of the public will" angle.
    - Even if Mr. Anno does not become the governor of Tokyo, I hope that the new governor will take measures in the direction of [[digital democracy]].



Interesting to observe a different perspective.

- An interesting point is that the Tokyo gubernatorial election was viewed as an opportunity to demonstrate technology, and the program used in the campaign will be released as open source after the election.
- This candidate would collect votes from Koike Yuriko, which would allow Renho to win.
    - I think there is a plot to visualize that even [[independent candidates]] can gather a certain number of votes by advocating [[digital democracy]], and that in the future there will be more and more candidates who promote digital democracy in various regions.
- Why is this candidate working alone and what is his/her relationship with [[Code for Japan]]?
- Regarding the motive for paying a deposit of 3 million yen to run for office, some have suggested that it is a desire for self-expression and others that it is simply a way to pass the time.
