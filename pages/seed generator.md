title: "seed generator"

2018-12-04
I have a feeling that having people who produce technical [[seeds]] pursue economic [[innovation]] may reduce the level of satisfaction. Just as it is not always successful to have competent researchers manage an organization. Another skill set.

Not only is it different, it may be the opposite. [While it is necessary to be "Inherent in the evaluation axis" and to "go your own way" without being influenced by what others think in order to be able to continue [[original]] research," economic innovation requires "Abandon inherent axes of evaluation to yourself," that is, "It is not what you, the [[creator]], think, but what [[the customer]] thinks that is important. On the other hand, economic innovation requires "being [[Abandon inherent axes of evaluation]] to yourself" that "it is not what [[you, the creator]] think, but what [[the customer]] thinks that is important. Some people can do both, but it takes a lot of mental toughness.

It might be better to apply a word that is not "[[innovator]]" to the type of person who has an inherent axis of evaluation and continues to do research on his/her own original line to create new [[technological seeds]], so that his/her thinking is better organized. I wonder if he is a seed generator because he is a person who creates seeds.

Associative connection: [[composter]].
