- A sigh of relief after [[Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning" Study Session 4]].
- I'll watch the recording next week and add to it.

No need to put a "diary" tag on the diary page.
- All you have to do is search.

I was tired or suddenly sick and slept from 5-7am.
- (Some believe it is simply lack of sleep.)
- I wasn't aware of it, but the temperature changes were so drastic this week that I thought my autonomic nervous system might have been compromised. (According to my wife)
    - Well, I'm sure it's falling apart around the fact that you're not sleeping as much as you should be.

I lay there for a while after dinner, but I'm feeling much better, 9pm.

I'd write directly on the well what I thought might grow if I spread the seed on the well, but it doesn't grow, or I'd forget to transcribe it later and it just sinks, what a waste!

- The "backup to a local file system or private project" I wrote here should be taken rather seriously.
