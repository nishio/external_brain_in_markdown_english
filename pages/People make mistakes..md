To err is human

Latin
- errare humanum est

English language after Alexander Pope's An Essay on Criticism of 1711: "To err is human, to forgive divine"

Livy
- > Venia dignus error is humanus
    - (Storie, VIII, 35)
Cicero
- > is Cuiusvis errare: insipientis nullius nisi, in errore perseverare
- (Anyone can err, but only the fool persists in his fault) (Philippicae, XII, 2, 5)
- BC44〜43

> But, however, that matter is not open for consideration now; an embassy has been appointed.” But what is there which is not open for consideration to a wise man, as long as it can be remodeled? Any man is liable to a mistake; but no one but a downright fool will persist in error. For second thoughts, as people say, are best. The mist which I spoke of just now is dispelled: light has arisen: the case is plain: we see every thing, and that not by our own acuteness, but we are warned by our friends.
>  You heard just now what was the statement made by a most admirable man. I found, said he, his house, his wife, his children, all in great distress. Good men marveled at me, my friends blamed me for having been led by the hope of peace to undertake an embassy. And no wonder, O Publius Servilius. For by your own most true and most weighty arguments Antonius was stripped, I do not say of all dignity, but of even every hope of safety.

- But as far as modifications can be made, what is not open to consideration for the wise? Any person can make mistakes, but no one except the truly foolish will stick with a mistake. As people say, it is best to reconsider. The fog I spoke of earlier has dispelled and the light has come in. The case is clear. We see everything, but it is not due to our own acuteness, but our friends are warning us.

In this context.
- [[err and not change one's ways, this is what it is to err]]
Nuance similar to

- [Only stupid people stick to mistakes.
    - [[a wise man changes his mind]]
    - [[Stupid consistency is a ghost created by narrow minds.]]
