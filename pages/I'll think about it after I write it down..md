from  [[Blind spot card with no picture yet]]
I'll think about it after I write it down.
Write it down and then think about it. If you didn't write it, you will forget it.
- Writing makes your thoughts concrete and prevents you from forgetting them.
- Writing may also generate new perspectives and ideas.

After 1000, [[A place to write comfortably]] should be used even if no image is provided.
