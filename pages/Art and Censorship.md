Michelangelo's "The Last Judgment" was a nude painting that did not cover the local area, but the social system of the time could not accept it, and after Michelangelo's death, Daniele da Volterra added a loin cloth and fig leaves. (16th century)

The existence of the "clothed Maha" and "naked Maha" pairs by Goya also indicates that nude paintings could not be exhibited normally at that time.
