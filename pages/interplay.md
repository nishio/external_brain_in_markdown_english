>  [[interplay]] (interplay) means [[interaction]] or [[mixture]] in English. It is often used as it is without translation as a term for jazz performance. [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/インタープレイ](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/インタープレイ)

>  Most [[jazz]] performances are made up of interplay. But when the interplay is particularly noticeable in a performance, it is called "great interplay", etc. [src](http://modernjazznavigator.a.la9.jp/glos/inter2.htm)
