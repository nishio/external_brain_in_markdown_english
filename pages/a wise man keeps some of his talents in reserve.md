- Evaluation is a matching opportunity
    - Where [[opportunity]] changes from 0 to 1, [[effect]] changes significantly.
    - I get an opportunity = [[selection]].
    - Opportunity selects people.
- Even where the opportunity changes from 1 to 2, it would seem to simply increase utility.
    - Actually, it consumes a limited resource called "[[Hours.]]", so it cannot be acquired infinitely.
- People who are given a lot of opportunities will conversely make selections that leave good opportunities and discard others.
    - Opportunities are selected by people

- #Porter
- I think there are many people who do not understand how it is related, so I will give a supplemental explanation.
    - In some cases, showing fingernails in the early stages of one's career gives one an advantage over "those who cannot show their fingernails" when it comes to matching opportunities.
    - On the other hand, more opportunity is not always better, because the time available to an individual is finite.
    - So, the "hawk with ability" who has had enough opportunities will no longer need to show his claws.
