    - [Intellectual production is not stoicism.
    - When you want to use all your brain energy for intellectual production
    - If there's extra work to be done, that's where the energy is taken up and you're not at your best.
        - [[When you're pushing the limits of your own intellect, the least burdensome method is chosen.]]
        - For example, I usually write equations in TeX, but when it comes to really difficult topics, I don't have the brain resources to devote to TeX, so I write by hand.
            - [/nishio/Information-Geometric Optimization](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/Information-Geometric Optimization).
        - Another common direction is the "it's not good to devote resources to creating beautiful documents" kind of talk.
        - Yeah, Scrapbox seems like a lot of work for someone who's not good at keyboarding.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - In fact, I've heard some people say, "What you're missing is not a good note-taking tool, but an improvement in your typing speed." I'm sure there are people who are like that.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I started to write [/kozaneba-forum-jp/line-drawing-function](https://scrapbox.io/kozaneba-forum-jp/line-drawing-function) in a "is-tasu" style, but halfway through I was forced to write in a "da-da-are" style in fragments.
            - Well, I'll clean it up.
    - When someone teaches "intellectual production techniques" with a lot of "you have to" rules attached to them, it makes me think, "Hasn't this person ever really done any intellectual production themselves? I get the feeling that "this person has never done any real intellectual production himself.
