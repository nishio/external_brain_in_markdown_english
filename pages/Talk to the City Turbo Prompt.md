> I provide a long list of comments extracted from various video interviews.
>  Please suggest a way to split the information contained in these comments into topics and subtopics.
>  Topic and subtopic names should be very brief, with a brief description of each topic. There should be multiple subtopics under each topic.

> You will receive a transcript of the video interview and a list of topics and subtopics already extracted.
>  Extract a list of brief assertions that the interviewee may have stated or supported.
>  We are only interested in claims that can be related to a given topic and subtopic. Claims should be relatively general, but should not be clichéd. It should be something that others might disagree with. Each claim should focus on one topic.
>  For each claim, please also provide a citation to the relevant transcript. Please keep citations as brief as possible while still being sufficient to support the claim. Quotes do not need to be logical arguments. It can be a personal story or episode that explains why the interviewee is making the claim.
