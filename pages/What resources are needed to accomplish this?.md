title: "What resources are needed to accomplish this?"
---

When you have something [[achievement]] you want to do, do you need [[money]], [[Hours.]], [[knowledge]], or [[labor]]`? It is better to be clear about this.`
Some resources can be converted from another, but the conversion efficiency is not always good. So, if you acquire an inappropriate resource (by spending time or money) and then realize that the appropriate one is something else, you will incur losses, or worse than that, you will not be able to make rational decisions due to "[[the]] psychology of wanting to avoid losses.
