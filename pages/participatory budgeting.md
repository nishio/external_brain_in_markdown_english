<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Participatory budgeting is a democratic approach in which citizens participate in discussions and decisions about the allocation of public resources. It began in Porto Alegre, Brazil in 1989 and has spread around the world. This approach provides an opportunity for citizens, especially those from low-income and less educated backgrounds, to be involved in [[public spending]] decisions.
