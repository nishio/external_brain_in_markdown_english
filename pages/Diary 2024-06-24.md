> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1804891464478146716) Today, I traveled around Tokyo giving speeches in the streets. Unfortunately, it was raining, but many people listened to me and I really appreciated it. I was able to speak to many people over the past two days, and I will create more opportunities to convey my thoughts directly to them.
>  >[annotakahiro24](https://x.com/annotakahiro24/status/1804855186651066405) Today, I went around to 6 locations in Tokyo to give speeches in the streets. I was very thankful that many people stopped to listen to my speeches, even though there were times when the rain was very heavy.

> [mqmqmqnq](https://x.com/mqmqmqnq/status/1804866240013602873) Listening to some of Mr. Yasuno's street speeches today, I could hardly believe that he is someone who has no intention of being accepted, as is often said on the Internet. A person who does not intend to be accepted cannot make such a speech with a smile on his face with so much physical and mental effort.


> [crystalroad2006](https://x.com/crystalroad2006/status/1804892391910031842) I think it's great that Yasuno-san's github issues are growing and becoming more and more visible.

Interesting point about the opportunity to find others who are close to your own sensibilities, you are certainly right!

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1804742097901137985) I asked #Takahiro Yasuno, "What would you think if, for example, another candidate used TTTC during the election?" I asked him "How would you feel if, for example, another candidate uses TTTC during the election?" and he immediately answered "It would be a good thing to promote digital democracy in Japan.

> [hazuma](https://x.com/hazuma/status/1804942316395712822) I like the fact that Mr. Anno is actually making speeches in town, not just making up topics for the progressive crowd like AI and GitHub. I'm looking forward to seeing how far he will go in the next two weeks.

> [tumada](https://x.com/tumada/status/1804853281870475684) I wrote a blog post about my recent sense of crisis: the vicious cycle and shrinking equilibrium that will occur if VC fund sizes begin to shrink, and the urgent need to create new industries in Japan. I am really feeling a great sense of urgency right now. I really think we need a big challenge and support for it now.

> [tumada](https://x.com/tumada/status/1804162481298047020) I felt that when young people run for office, it has the effect of making the young people around them more interested in politics and policy. I hope more people become interested in politics, policy, fairness, and democracy.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1805015363912192443) This is definitely true in my 5 meter radius. People who used to propose modifications to open source but not to policy, but now that policy has come to the realm of open source, there has been a change in perception that they too can make a difference. Politics and open source projects are the same in terms of collective decision-making.

> [YoshifumiSeki](https://x.com/YoshifumiSeki/status/1804890227691098203) I've been walking around putting up posters, and I've enjoyed it very much as it's the first DX step against the legacy system of election campaigning.

> [HK27129551](https://x.com/HK27129551/status/1805011845847367693) I listened to Yasuno's YouTube live yesterday.
>  "The list of places to put up election posters is handed out on paper. Even people in their 70s and 80s are watching digital media such as YouTube. Young people are the ones who should eliminate the prejudice that old people don't use digital media.
- While attention tends to focus on the digitization of the ballots themselves, there is room for digitization to make peripheral tasks such as posters even better.

> [ikimonowo](https://x.com/ikimonowo/status/1804917958449500414) I think it is very good to have a candidate like Takahiro Yasuno who has a strong color in his field of expertise. Without such a person, only people of color who are "interested in politics" will go to elections. I think Mr. Yasuno's appearance has probably made a considerable number of engineers and elitists interested in the gubernatorial election.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1805030446750957980) I've seen 3 references to broad listening in Mr. Anno's repository and have written comments on them (track record unlocked!).



> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1805034164238115057) The probability that this is [[a turning point in history]] is getting higher and higher. The [[Sunflower Student Movement]], which was the catalyst for Taiwan's turning toward digital democracy, had 110,000-500,000 participants. When Ieiri ran for office, he received 90,000 votes. It is difficult to make a direct comparison between protest movements and voting, but when there are more than 100,000 people actively supporting a movement, existing politicians can no longer ignore it
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1805083905047032037) Note that Taiwan's population is larger than Tokyo's, just in case anyone is mistaken!

- [[The basic premise is degrading.]]


> [levinassien](https://x.com/levinassien/status/1805019777859236221) The Tokyo gubernatorial election, it's a Tokyo story and not really talked about in Kansai, but why do big city residents elect egotistical, autocratic, anti-intellectuals as governors and mayors? Why do the people of big cities elect egoistic and dictatorial anti-intellectuals as governors and mayors? Maybe the voters are not voting because they think that they will be "happier" if they entrust the administration to such people.
> [levinassien](https://x.com/levinassien/status/1805020832890335314) Perhaps you are projecting your "ideal self" onto them. I wonder how good it would feel to be able to pursue my own selfish desires like that and cast my "vote for my own desires" --- is this a hypothesis that would stand up to scrutiny?
> [levinassien](https://x.com/levinassien/status/1805025995931685052) In other words, many voters feel that they deserve to be "represented" not by "a public figure who seems to be drafting and implementing policies on behalf of their interests," but by "someone who is actually implementing their raw (hidden) desires on their behalf. Many voters feel that "the person who is actually carrying out their raw (hidden) desires on their behalf" is the best person to "represent" them. Only time will tell who the former is. But the latter is not.
> [levinassien](https://x.com/levinassien/status/1805027349299433853) The "omnipotence" that person feels is painfully obvious without the use of imagination. I feel "pent up" when I see the way they kick up a foot of moderation and impartiality as public figures, stripping the privileges of public officials, teachers, intellectuals and professionals, and humiliating "the guys who are so high and mighty".
> [levinassien](https://x.com/levinassien/status/1805028838545723797) public figures' "usefulness" not by the "good things" they may achieve in the future, but by the "exhilaration" they give us in the here and now. We consider them by the "exhilaration" they give us here and now. The certain present is more important than the uncertain future. It is no wonder that we make such a choice if "only now, only me" is important to us.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1805058190658449906) Interesting cut.
> [kuro_shirty](https://x.com/kuro_shirty/status/1805071227729715708) This is not about the electorate or the sheikh,
>  We consider that in large cities, community members have a high degree of independence from each other, so they are more likely to evaluate a chief who makes a choice opposite to their wishes as an "autocratic personality" or "anti-intellectual".

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1805073598207713587) Well, sure! That's an interesting consideration!




> [kmizu](https://x.com/kmizu/status/1804836695403299208) There are a lot of opinions about policy recommendations on GitHub, but with the current one, only a very few recommendations can be made, yes, but there are many ways to do that, like creating a wrapper app. I'm sure there are plenty of ways to do that, such as creating a wrapper application.
>
>  I don't think it's wrong to use GitHub as a cheap and quick place to start, because I think it's important to know how to make use of it, not to undermine it. I can say from experience that if you want to do something meaningful, you should "think as you move," and "anyone" can say that this or that is not good. The only other thing is that "continuous improvement" is important, whether it's PDCA or anything else.
>
>  I think it's a bad habit to make things worse unless a smart and clean "solution" comes along right from the start.
> [nagise](https://x.com/nagise/status/1804836695403299208) I think that per law and policy, something like Git is required, if not Git itself.
> [nagise](https://x.com/nagise/status/1805032776506507448) In short, concepts such as branches and plurics are necessary for bureaucratic document management in the form of policy and law, and it would be desirable to have the assistance of a computer system fitted to policy and law as a use case centered on these ideas. In short, concepts such as branch and prurik are necessary for bureaucratic document management in the form of policy and law.
> [kmizu](https://x.com/kmizu/status/1805055061493727477) Actually, you need version control inherently. So I think GIt-based is even a good starting point (as long as you have a wrapper on the front end that is easy for the general public to use).
> [imunolion](https://x.com/imunolion/status/1805034492316533180) As for other popular examples (examples of computer system-derived changes in legislative and administrative workflows), such as MAC (Mandatory Access Control) and Clark-Wilson's Integrity model, I think they make a good point. Control) and Clark-Wilson's Integrity model.



> [z_zabaglione](https://x.com/z_zabaglione/status/1805054424794235152) I feel like there are a certain number of people saying that releasing information to github is pointless because only developers can use it. （I hope it's just my imagination.)
>
>  Not really, it is important to have information in an open form, and if it is open, we can make applications that are easy to use. So I think it makes sense to have information in an open format, but I guess not...
> [max_2608](https://x.com/max_2608/status/1805065550483292607) I guess you assume github is a developer only tool.

> [kazuho](https://x.com/kazuho/status/1805072632439877695) I don't mind discussing policy on github, but wasn't the deadline for election bulletins to be distributed to each household the day of the public announcement (i.e. the day of the candidacy)?
>  I don't want you to write "We will update our policies from now on" in the election bulletin that most voters will see (because they can't compare the candidates' claims).
> [kazuho](https://x.com/kazuho/status/1805073216144327133) I'm going to discuss it now, is the same as a blank check. This time it's not a blank check at all, but it's hard to evaluate compared to candidates who have various policies in place, so points are deducted.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1805076369602150553) I'm not saying that the major policy hasn't been decided, in fact I think it's been laid out pretty clearly. I'm not saying that the level of detail in the campaign gazette won't change. You haven't seen the manifesto, we've already published a 1-page summary, a 29-page summary, a 93-page detailed version, and we're talking about adding more details to that introductory version.

> [kazuho](https://x.com/kazuho/status/1805110335361409341) What?
>  "Even if the proposal is in a different direction from the initial manifesto, we will seriously consider it and see if we can reflect it."
>  and the repositories?　I'm fine with the policy itself as stated, but I'm sorry that the GitHub release has been delayed until the date of the public announcement, when the commitment must be solidified.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1805144338957291587) Did it get moved up? Did it say anywhere that it would be published before the date of the public announcement and firm up by the date of the public announcement? I think you must have misunderstood something.
> [kazuho](https://x.com/kazuho/status/1805145692069110100) "We might still tweak the manifesto based on the GitHub discussion," it says, so Nishio's policy is already solidified, just to "enhance" the details. I'm saying that the explanation that we're going to use GitHub might not be right.
> [kazuho](https://x.com/kazuho/status/1805150860718280882) It is fine for those who can wait until polling day to check the information, but the fact that they might make changes in the manifesto that are different from the current direction (which has already started) makes it impossible for those who come to the pre-polls (which have already started) to trust the appeal. If you still have the possibility of making changes to the manifesto that differ from the current direction, it means that the people who come to vote in advance (which has already started) cannot trust your claims, right? At the very least, it goes against the spirit of a manifesto election.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1805154320478056507) I'm not sure I understand the premise of the discussion. Well, my point was that "it is False that it is the same as a carte blanche", so I think that concern has been addressed, so I think I'll leave it at that.
> [kazuho](https://x.com/kazuho/status/1805156630264422439) I'm not sure, but I'm still aware that the candidate has publicly stated that he may change his manifesto after the gazette is out and absentee voting has begun.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1805175199618531625) I think that's True. You think "staying the same" should take precedence over "getting better". I think that is an individual value. It is different from my values.
> [kazuho](https://x.com/kazuho/status/1805175621934530750) I am glad to see that we are in agreement on the facts. Everyone has their own values, but I am aware of the historical context as I wrote in [https://x.com/kazuho/status/1805166697823002937...](https://x.com/kazuho/status/1805166697823002937...)
- > [kazuho](https://x.com/kazuho/status/1805166697823002937) Elections, in the past, tended to be based on party affiliation and personality, but in the past 30 years or so, people have been working hard to change this to a form of "fighting with a manifesto". For example, Governor Koike's "Seven Promises. For example, it is thanks to this accumulation that we are able to grade the number of zeros in Governor Koike's "7 zeros.
- >  I want you to take care of that kind of thing.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1805178687349788840) I agree that the likelihood of scoring has increased. However, that scale seems to me to be a scale that negatively biases new candidates in favor of incumbents. So I'm pushing for a change in the value axis to make technical execution ability a point of contention rather than something like that.
> [kazuho](https://x.com/kazuho/status/1805189237270024361) I think it has generally been believed that manifesto elections, which are fought on the basis of policy rather than name recognition or experience, are more favorable to newcomers (which is why the opposition parties tackled them first).
