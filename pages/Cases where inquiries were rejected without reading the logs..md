[Malfunction of online application for Kanagawa public high school entrance examinations caused by misconfiguration of operators | Kanaloco by Kanagawa Shimbun](https://www.kanaloco.jp/news/government/article-1055357.html#google_vignette)
> The operator did not follow Google's guidelines and sent a large number of e-mails in a short period of time, resulting in the e-mails being treated as spam.

[Why didn't only Gmail receive it?　We asked Kanagawa Prefecture for more details on the high school application system issue (ITmedia NEWS) - Yahoo! News](https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/a504527bf152de2106e06e2d90b05a4b446a1937?page=2)
>  The person in charge speculated that the cause of the problem was that "a large number of emails were sent from the application system at the same time without sufficient settings, and Gmail may have judged them as spam or junk mail," but he did not know which settings were at fault. When we contacted Google, they only said, "We want you to follow the guidelines," but they could not tell us what was missing or wrong with the current settings. The person in charge of the matter prefaced his explanation with "personal speculation," and said, "Google may not disclose too many details because they are afraid that spammers and other companies will abuse the information if they do so.

> [ktgohan](https://twitter.com/ktgohan/status/1755853718791328124) What this confirms is that the prefecture and its contractors "haven't seen a single line of the log". I don't care if it was taken to Quarantine, but rejects are always logged on the sending mail server, and Gmail is kind enough to show the URL in the error message, saying "Read this reference"!

If it is true, it means that "I tried to consume [[expensive human time]] by not reading the output in the log and making [[inquiries]] without a [[support contract]], and was rejected. Personally, while I think "it's normal," I understand that there are some cultures that do not consider this "normal. Interesting case study.
