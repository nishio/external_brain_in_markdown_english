title: "It's not about how you win, but where you win."

> [tumada](https://twitter.com/tumada/status/1782799007951298630) "Where to win" is often more important than "[[how to win]]" in terms of [[grace (of God, Buddha, etc.)]], I am bothered by the fact that "how to win" is discussed more often than "how to win", so the focus tends to be on [[how]].... Also, the discussion differs depending on "[[how much to win]]".
