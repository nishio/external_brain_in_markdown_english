## digest
.
Intellectual production is used in the sense that it is not material and is not consumption. Knowledge is outcome-focused information, and the art of intellectual production must be self-made. The art of intellectual production is to use one's mind to submit new information in a form that people can understand. The value of intellectual production is that it is submitted in a form that people can understand.

## Relation to Fragment
.
The fragment "Intellectual Production" elaborates on the definition of intellectual production and its importance, directly related to the notes. The fragments "Producer of Knowledge," "Knowledge Creation," "The Art of Intellectual Production Must Make Itself," and "The Goodness of the Art of Intellectual Production is Determined by the Value of the Intellectual Product Produced" also help to deepen understanding of the concept of intellectual production and how it is practiced.

## deep thinking
Intellectual production is an important process for generating new knowledge and ideas, the value of which is determined by its products. As producers of knowledge, we "produce" non-material "intellectual" things. Today, both the production and consumption of non-material things are common, so a higher level of resolution is required.

## summary of thoughts
Intellectual production is the process of creating new knowledge and ideas, and its value is determined by its deliverables.
