from  [[Diary 2023-12-29]]
- [[Niche Top Strategy for Cross-fertilization]] is a [[formation]] in [[domain coupling space]].

context
    - [[Presence across many mountains.]]
        - [[Cross-cutting niche-top strategies are destroyed.]]
    - [[Stable trade routes spring up]]

The niche-top strategy of multiplying domains is not a strategy of taking a position in [[domain space]]$S$, but a strategy of taking a position in the space of the domain combination $S \times S$, and it was still a strategy of taking a position just because the space had changed.
The limited capacity of the human brain once made it easy to find [[a safe haven]] in the vastness of [$ S \times S

The development of LLM technology has changed this composition.
Tasks that would have been possible only through knowledge of multiple disciplines are easily accomplished by LLM
- Examples of sentences that cannot be written without knowing Japanese, Chinese and English: [[Cooperative/Collaborative/Collaborative]].

Ideas are [[new combinations of existing ones]], [[new combinations]] are facilitated by having [knowledge of different disciplines
