>  In Japan, I see it as non-academics preserving the discourse of futurology, etc., which led to [[SF Prototyping]].
>  Looking at the content, the U.S. movement and others are SF prototypical.

>  Then we end up with [[Yujiro Hayashi]] and [[Koji Omi]] in Japan, and we need to look at what their legacies lead to.
>  I wish people who look at the current metascience movement would speak more on the basis of this kind of genealogy.
