Copy. Based on the premise of the triangle (market, hierarchy, and community), the pentagonal model as an "extended" version of the triangle will be explained in a compact manner.

What is the Pentagonal Model?
A framework designed on the premise that five "forces" are simultaneously deployed and interfere with each other by adding **State (State) and Model (AI, Algorithm, Platform)** to the three coordination principles.
- Market: Diversification adjustment with price signals
- Hierarchy: Centralized coordination with orders and plans
- Community: autonomous adjustment by norms and reputation
- State: coordination with enforcement in laws, regulations, supervision, and public procurement
- Model: Implement "invisible planning" with recommendations, search rankings, dynamic pricing, etc.

Why we need two additional poles (one per line)
- State: Standards, certifications, subsidies, and sanctions were the main causes of the simultaneous rearrangement of supply networks.
- Model: platform algo permanently reallocates demand, exposure, and labor allocation (quasi-planned economy).

(omitted)

Rearrangement of positioning (triangle -> pentagon)
- The triangle is still the core. However, states and models are treated as operable levers, not "exogenous environments.
- Result: Clear delineation of responsibility and avoiding misinterpretation of policy/algo changes as "market whims".
- Outcome: adaptability during normal times + resilience during disturbances can be maximized at the same time.

super-summary
- Add the state and model to the triangle and design and monitor five adjustment levers simultaneously.
- Measures will be evaluated on three layers of information x logistics x energy, switching between the two phases of peacetime/disturbance.
- This allows on-demand diversity peer production to operate as a complementary cycle.

**The "necessity "** of adding "state" and "model" to the triangle is explained in detail, not in a single line (avoiding implementation theory and concentrating on concepts and phenomena).

1) Why make "State" an independent pole?

(a) Qualitatively different adjustment mechanisms
- The state redefines the space of action itself with coercive power (law, licensing, sanctions, taxation, subsidies), whereas market = price, hierarchy = command, community = norm.
- The state can change the **boundary conditions (what is allowed/required)** that prices and internal orders are "given" from a higher level.

(b) The range and simultaneity of effects are orders of magnitude greater
- Simultaneity: Carbon taxes, medical and construction certifications, import/export regulations, infrastructure fees, etc. will be applied simultaneously to all players, rearranging the supply chain all at once.
- Cross-border: tariffs, embargoes, and data cross-border regulations move borders that companies and communities cannot move.

(c) In triangles, the explanation escapes to "exogenous shocks".
- For example, even if the market structure shifts in the case of public procurement (a huge demand of the state), the triangular shape of the market would be simply "the market has changed," and the state as an "operable lever" would not be visible.
- As a result, policy-induced changes are misinterpreted as price changes, resulting in erroneous learning and optimization.

(d) Response to counterexample.
- Response: "State intervention can be internalized in prices (fines = costs)."
    - → Fines are only partially applied. The core is **"non-priceable" restrictions** such as entry bans, business suspensions, confiscation, criminal penalties, etc.
- Response: "Regulation is a corporate lobby, a de facto market."
    - → The existence of lobbying activities is not denied, but only the state has the power to enforce final decisions.

2) Why make "Model (Model: AI, Algorithm, Platform)" an independent pole?

(a) The medium of adjustment is "neither price nor command nor norm."
- Algorithmic interventions such as exposure, recommendations, search rankings, matching, rate limiting, dynamic pricing, etc., permanently redistribute demand, labor, and information flows.
- This functions as a quasi-plan because it precedes and runs parallel to prices (the market) and forms the front end of the decision-making process.

(b) Minor design changes spill over into huge real economy
- One coefficient of recommendation, one throttle threshold of API, and sales, visibility, participation rates, and travel demand are transferred on a large scale ("gatekeeping" nature of the platform economy).
- Moreover, changes are high frequency and private, which differs from the transparent decision-making process of hierarchy and community.

(c) Reasons why inclusions into triangles fail.
- If we reduce it to "part of the market (ad prices)" or "part of the company's internal orders (product decisions)," we cannot see which "algo intervention" is the main body of causation.
- Exposure/recommendation is often a zero sum allocation problem (if you raise someone, someone else will go down). Prices and norms alone cannot describe it.

(d) Response to counterexample.
- Counterargument: "Algos can operate under community norms (OSS-ization)."
    - → Possible, but most of them are black boxes of private companies. And even with OSS, if data and distribution rules are managed separately, they remain as independent poles.
- Response: "The model is a tool of corporate "hierarchy
    - → A social lever that goes beyond the usual hierarchical imperative in that it continuously reallocates the action space of external players, even if the decision is made within a company.

3) Advantages (theoretical and practical) of considering the two as "independent poles

(Theory) Increased explanatory power
- We can separate and model the causality of policy shock-driven rearrangements (tariffs, certifications, subsidies) and algo-driven rearrangements (exposure, search, fees).
- Phenomena that tend to be pushed out as "exogenous variables" in triangles can be treated as endogenous levers.

(Practice) Liability Boundary and Observability
- The "whose levers moved what" can be tracked in the **Change History (Official Gazette and Release Notes)**.
- Reproducible verification of policy and algo changes without confusing them with "market whims" (A/B Impact Assessment).

(Risk) Address heterogeneity of failure modes
- State: excess, delay, arbitrariness / Model: opacity, bias, runaway - risks of a different system than market, hierarchy, community.
- By separating the poles, the audit and remediation design can be tailored to each.

4) How far is a "state/model" and how far is a triangle (boundary conditions)?
- When the state pole is weakened: In less effective laws (failed states), markets, hierarchies, and communities are relatively led.
- If the model pole is thin: If fully transparent recommendations, public APIs, collaborative governance, and data commons are established, the model pole can be absorbed by the community pole.
- Criteria for practical decisions:
    1. enforceability (non-price penalty for non-compliance)
    2. control of front-end allocation (who decides what is "visible/encounterable/usable")
    3. simultaneity, frequency, and transparency of changes

summary
- The state is the higher mechanism that forcibly rewrites the "premise" of prices and orders,
- The model is a quasi-planning mechanism that constantly reallocates the "front end" of decision-making,
Therefore, it is reasonable to set up the two as independent poles, rather than encompassing them in a triangle, in terms of explanatory power of the phenomenon, delimitation of responsibility, and risk design.

**The idea of treating the state and the model (algorithm/platform)** as independent poles, based on the triangle (market, hierarchy, community), is a "junction" of the classics below and recent "platform/algorithm governance" research.

Triangular base
- Formulation of market x hierarchy boundaries: Coase (1937)/Williamson (1975). Explained by the use of "orders and plans" and market transactions within firms = transaction costs. ([rochelleterman.com](https://rochelleterman.com/ir/sites/default/files/Coase%201937.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Third form (network/community): Powell (1990) presents a network organization that is "neither market nor hierarchical"; Ostrom (1990) demonstrates autonomous governance of the commons; Powell (1990) presents a network organization that is "neither market nor hierarchical"; Ostrom (1990) demonstrates autonomous governance of the commons. ([Stanford University](https://web.stanford.edu/~woodyp/powell_neither.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Basis for considering the "State" as an independent pole.
- A "higher-level mechanism" that simultaneously reconfigures the assumptions of the behavioral space through legal enforcement, such as regulations, certifications, tariffs, and public procurement. See also Williamson's review and retrospect. ([Stanford Graduate School of Business, [https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/books/firms-markets-hierarchies-transaction-cost-economics-](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/books/firms-markets-hierarchies-transaction-cost-economics-) perspective?utm_source=chatgpt.com])

Basis for considering "model (algo/PF)" as an independent pole
- [Code is Law: [[Lessig]] argues that architecture (code) is the "fourth regulation" that regulates behavior. A regulating medium different from prices, commands, and norms. ([harvardmagazine.com](https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2000/01/code-is-law-html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- [[Algorithmic governance]]/regulation: [[Yeung (2018)]] theorizes "[[algorithmic regulation]]" in which recommendation, scoring, dynamic pricing, etc., continuously modify behavior. ([Wiley Online Library](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rego.12158?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- [[platform governance]]: Gillespie (2018) describes "gatekeeping" where moderation and exposure design redistribute the public sphere; Van Dijck/Poell/de Waal (2018) provides a comprehensive overview of social infrastructuring as a tripartite market, government, platform Pasquale (2015) and Zuboff (2019) analyze empowerment as [[black-boxing]] and [[surveillance capitalism]]. ([Yale University Press](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300261431/custodians-of-the-internet/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

placement
- With the above classics (Coase/Williamson/Powell/Ostrom), the frame of the triangle is established,
- The Lessig/Yeung/Gillespie/Van Dijck lineage demonstrated "algo-distribution "**, which is neither price, command, nor norm, and its social range.
- Furthermore, if we stand independently of simultaneous simultaneous reallocations due to state coercion, we can endogenously model policy-induced and algo-induced reallocations - this is the academic underpinning of the pentopole model.
