title: "Periodic exports from Slack"
---

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1717535695441412603) Sometimes discussions on old open source communities and mailing lists are very helpful after 10 years or so, I have the feeling that if the community becomes a free Slack, those discussions will disappear.
- > [kis](https://twitter.com/kis/status/1717726582750826635) It was also nice to see the ML archive caught in the search.
- > [_ikebo](https://twitter.com/_ikebo/status/1717848297434730724) Some of the old mailing lists are archived because they appeared in Japanese and English with real names, so it's rather embarrassing to be left in the dark.
- > [hyakkitikun](https://twitter.com/hyakkitikun/status/1717885744528937160) I feel that all the people who are actively posting on X now, including me, will disappear in a few decades at the most.

    - This one was already gone and turned into WebArchive.

> [hal_sk](https://twitter.com/hal_sk/status/1717539995010154583) Sure! Maybe it's a good idea to Discord and export the logs regularly [GitHub - Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter: Exports Discord chat logs to a file](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter)

> [kuboon](https://twitter.com/kuboon/status/1717676031560315063) export would work for slack too.
>  There is a github action I made.
>  This is the one that exports to google sheet, but I'm wondering if I can modify it a bit to export to github pages.

- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1717714448759271506) I didn't know there was such a move!

> [kuboon](https://twitter.com/kuboon/status/1717715635315319258) I'll make a github pages version if there seems to be a demand for it, but I need prior recognition from the community.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1717717576787402899) I thought only administrators had the authority to export anyway? >Community Consent.
- >  Oh, you mean in terms of whether or not the non-admin public participants agree to have their Slack > statements placed in a public, unerasable forum?
- > [kuboon](https://twitter.com/kuboon/status/1717721728816984088) Yeah, yeah.
    - I think [Do it without asking permission.
