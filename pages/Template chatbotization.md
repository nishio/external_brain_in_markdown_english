title: "Template chatbotization"
---

- As I was thinking about [[Create ✅empathy writing mode]], I realized that the "fill in the template" method encourages verbalization by having humans think about filling in the template, so it shares the same composition as a chatbot encouraging verbalization by asking questions.

If the chatbot can handle one "fill in the template" type method by creating an empathy writing mode, the mechanism can be horizontally expanded to other template-based methods.

Things that I can think of now that could be developed.
- Chatbotized [[KPT]] and look-back bot
    - Related [[PRO Model]].
    - [[Value Hypothesis Sheet]] is converted into a bot, Value Hypothesis Support Bot.
    - [[Cybozu's Problem Solving Method]] as a bot and a problem solving support bot.

relevance
    - [[Fill in the template.]]
    - [[template]]
