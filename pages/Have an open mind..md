title: "Have an open mind."

from [[The Art of Worldly Wisdom]]
Have an open mind.
lvi

A child of agility with a happy spirit. Thanks to this vivacity and broad vision, he does not fear danger or calamity. Many people ponder and eventually fail, while others achieve their goals without thinking beforehand. Some qualities of [[antiperistasis]] work best in emergencies. They are like monsters who succeed in everything they do instantly, but fail in everything they contemplate. Things are thought up quickly or never, and for them there is no court of law. Promptness is applauded because it proves superior ability, subtle judgment, and prudent action.
