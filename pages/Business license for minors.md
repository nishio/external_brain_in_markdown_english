title: "Business license for minors"
---

- According to [[civil code]] 4-5, a [[minor]] under 20 years of age must have the consent of a legal representative (e.g., parent) to perform legal acts (e.g., contracts).
However, if you have a [[business permit]], you have the ability to act with respect to your business under Article 6 (i.e., you can make contracts, etc. independently).
There is no special method for business licenses.

> The age of twenty (20) years shall be the age of majority.
> Article 5. A minor shall obtain the consent of his/her legal representative before committing a legal act. However, this shall not apply to legal acts merely to obtain rights or to be relieved of obligations.
> Article 6. A minor who is permitted to operate one or several types of business shall have the same capacity to act as an adult with respect to such business.

> There is no special method for business permission, and the fact that a minor's business is supervised by a person with parental authority can be recognized as the fact that permission for the business has been granted. (34.3.22, 34.3.22, Penal Code, 7-3-37)
