title: "Gitcoin Grants 20 Experience"
---

from  [[Diary 2024-05-03]]

I've been wanting to experience [[Quadratic Funding]] with [[Gitcoin]] for a while, and I just saw a call for [[Gitcoin Grants]] 20, so I'm going to try it.

> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1785971222582579699/photo/1) We're about 15th now, if anyone with a crypto in Arbitrum can help! 5 more days to go!

- [[Arbitrum]] first heard of it.
    - I don't think so, I wrote down the word [[Arbitrum Orbit]].

I'll put it in my cart for now.

Hmm?
You put it in your cart and then decide how much you want to pay for it.
How much is 1[[ARB]]?

![image](https://gyazo.com/85cbd7309a81c3c15c82d268171bc2b3/thumb/1000)
1 ARB is about a dollar.
If I donate $1, I get about $21 from [[the matching fund]].

If you pay 16 times, you get 4 times $84, and if you pay 100 times, you get 10 times $210, which is how [[Quadratic Funding]] works.

Well, I don't have an ARB, so that's what I'm going to do.
Is this the right network to begin with? It doesn't look good.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1786267423362203843) I got as far as adding it to my cart, but I'm not sure how to get Arbitrum from where to where! (exchange it for ETH or something at some [[DEX]] and then somehow put it into the Arbitrum chain?)
> [yudai007004](https://twitter.com/yudai007004/status/1786276008414572745) As for me, I'm using [Arbiturm's bridge [https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?) destinationChain=arbitrum-one&sourceChain=ethereum], move ETH from Ethereum (or other) to Arbiturm, and swap (ETH -> ARB) using DEX (Uniswap for example). I was able to do it!
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1786407646989582413) Thanks for the info! I will try it!

What is a bridge...
Access for now
- [https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?destinationChain=arbitrum-one&sourceChain=ethereum](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?destinationChain=arbitrum-one&sourceChain=ethereum)
- Connect with MetaMask
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/8e0ca1fb4d68c792c5a1ed1bd1809db5/thumb/1000)
- Let's see, how much is 1 ETH?
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/62e1fe6e2bde9a028079fb69136196ea/thumb/1000)
- So you have about $50,000 in your wallet.
- So let's move about 5,000 yen in the "let's charge 5,000 yen to Suica" vein.

- The fee is $3.65, just like a bank transfer.

While we're waiting.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>This section describes Arbitrum, Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Orbit, and the bridge.
- Arbitrum is an ethereum scaling solution that uses layer 2 optimistic rollup technology. This significantly reduces transaction costs while maintaining the same security as ethereum (Bridge to Arbitrum).
    - [Quickstart: Arbitrum bridge | Arbitrum Docs](https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbitrum-bridge/quickstart)
- Arbitrum One is Arbitrum's primary network, employing the Optimistic Rollup Protocol and supporting transactions that are batch processed directly into the Ethernet mainnet (Layer 1) (Arbitrum Docs ).
    - [A gentle introduction: Orbit chains | Arbitrum Docs](https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/orbit-gentle-introduction)
- Arbitrum Orbit is a framework that allows developers to create their own custom chains without any permissions. This allows for a high degree of customization to meet project-specific needs and provides a "universe of chains" for new applications and protocol innovations Orbit chains can be deployed on top of existing It can be deployed on top of Arbitrum Layer 2 chains (Arbitrum) (Arbitrum Foundation).
    - [Arbitrum Orbit](https://arbitrum.io/orbit)
    - [Arbitrum Orbit — Launch new chains in the Arbitrum ecosystem](https://arbitrum.foundation/orbit)
- Bridge is a tool to facilitate the transfer of assets between a parent chain such as Ethereum and Arbitrum One or other child chains. Using this bridge, users can move ETH or ERC-20 tokens from the parent chain to the child chain and vice versa (Bridge to Arbitrum).

Using these technologies, Arbitrum strongly supports the development of highly customizable and scalable distributed applications (dApp). In addition, with Orbit, projects can have their own application-specific chain, providing additional performance and governance control.

It said to wait 15 minutes, but it took less than 15 minutes to SETTLE.
![image](https://gyazo.com/ad04832fe402f105da6291d7b2eb9475/thumb/1000)

So, now that we have moved ETH (Token) from Ethereum (Network) to Arbitrum One (Network), we need to exchange ETH (Token on Arbitrum One) for ARB (Token on Arbitrum One).

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>It is important to validate custom network information in MetaMask when using Arbitrum One; when adding a custom network to MetaMask, please review the following information carefully, especially
- Network Name: The name used by MetaMask to identify the network.
- Network URL (Network URL): The URL that MetaMask uses to access the network.
- Chain ID: The ID of the chain that MetaMask uses to sign transactions for the network.
- Currency Symbol: The currency symbol used by MetaMask for the network's native currency.
- Block Explorer URL (optional): This is the URL that MetaMask will direct you to in order to investigate your account and transactions.

If inaccurate information is displayed, or if MetaMask warns you that something is wrong, it is recommended that you take the following steps to verify the correct information:
- Visit Chainlist: search by the chain ID or network name provided and identify information that does not match.
- Search Google for the network's name: Evaluate the legitimacy of the network through its official website, Twitter and other social media presence, number of followers and reputation, news articles about the network, etc.

From these sources, you can determine if the network is legitimate and trustworthy and if the information provided is accurate. If uncertain, it is wise to refuse to add the network, investigate further, and retry later.

[[Chainlist]] first time I heard of it.

Oh, so this is how it's going to be.

Put the rest in [DeSci Tokyo
Where do I see how much the remaining ARB is...?
![image](https://gyazo.com/f759a840bd2eac6e16d816e21f12ecac/thumb/1000)
If you know it's not enough, you know how much is left, show me.
11.8, maybe.

If I put $16 in DigDAO and got +$83, I thought I would get less Estimated Match if I put $11 in DeSci Tokyo, but unexpectedly I got $322!
I thought it was a mystery, but then I looked at Donation History.
![image](https://gyazo.com/5ed3268373991fb1670ffda14230fa48/thumb/1000)
Since the rounds were divided like this, I'm guessing the matching pool is divided as well.
Is DeSci's matching pool larger or is there less competition compared to dApps & Apps?
Where would I find out?

dApps: Total Crowdfunded 130K USD is 36k Donations, so 3.6USD per one
DeSci: Total Crowdfunded 5467 USD is 470 Donations so 11.6 USD per
Assuming the shape of the distribution is the same.
sqrt(3.6) * 36000 == 68305.197459637
sqrt(11.6) * 470 == 1600.7623183970816
DeSci is 43 times more influential than DeSci, even with the same amount of donation, taking the ratio of
On the other hand, the matching pool is 12 times smaller for DeSci, so
As a result, the money DeSci gets from the matching pool when donating the same amount is 3.6 times larger

![image](https://gyazo.com/709a4c35f5b41b4aee8695048a35264d/thumb/1000)![image](https://gyazo.com/f634ac800ca911869fc9e45f36058c66/thumb/1000)
Actually it was 4 * 21 for 16ARB(4^2) and 3.3 * 97 for 11ARB(3.3^2), so
97 / 21, or roughly 4.6 times
Well, I guess it's an order of magnitude, but DeSci's distribution is more skewed because of the smaller number of participants, so the sum of votes after taking sqrt is smaller, so the percentage of votes you get for the same amount of donation will be larger.

I can see why collusion is a problem.
I spend about 1,500 yen, and the donated person gets a little less than 50,000 yen. So what happens if I say, "I'll kick back 10,000 yen and you do this procedure," and there are people who will do it?
I honestly didn't expect to get so much matching funds.
If the ratio is 100 yen for 2,000 yen, 1,600 yen for 8,000 yen, or 10,000 yen for 20,000 yen, it is too small to split the 2,000 yen, and if you spend 10,000 yen and get 20,000 yen to split, there is an incentive to take the 10,000 yen and run away without doing any work. So, it's not possible to make a very good composition of rags to riches.
I wonder if this is a problem that occurs when there are too few participants for matching funds and the match on donations is too large.

That's $111 for 15ARB, so a factor between DeSci and dApp.
