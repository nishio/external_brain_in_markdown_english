core of the concept
_
| Perspective egocentric allocentric |
| -- |
| Reference origin Your body/line of sight<br> e.g., tip of your right hand, 2 m behind you Outside world (environment) itself<br> e.g., 50 m to the north, next to a tree |
| Symbolic images Subjective camera, FPS games Overhead map, GPS "north fix" |
| Major brain regions Parietal lobe (especially right hemisphere) Hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex |
| Pros Fast response / Directly connected to the act of operation Strong for wide-area navigation / Reusable |
| Disadvantages Prone to errors in wide ranges and rotations High initial learning cost |

- egocentric
    - Immediate self-centered operation
    - A method of placing coordinates with "I" as the origin.
    - It is suited for momentary operations such as reaching out, typing, or looking for the next hold in bouldering.
- allocentric
    - Environment-centered overhead planning
    - Use [[coordinates fixed on the world side]], such as topographic landmarks and azimuths.
    - It is suited for wide-area planning, such as understanding the entire city, choosing shortcuts, and finding the same entrance when revisiting.
