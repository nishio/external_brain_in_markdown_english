> “Don’t worry about what anybody else is going to do… The best way to predict the future is to invent it. Really smart people with reasonable funding can do just about anything that doesn’t violate too many of Newton’s Laws!”
- [[Alan Kay]] (1971) at a 1971 meeting of [[PARC]]

> I think that the best way to predict the future is to invent it by Alan Kay in 1983, and a slightly different expression by Gerbordinesch in 1963.
