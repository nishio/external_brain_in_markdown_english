This book is a classic work in [[philosophy of education]] by the American philosopher [[John Dewey]]. [[Dewey.]] presents the following main ideas.

- 1.[[education]] is a process of social development of individuals and should be considered [[Schools are small social communities]].

- Learning should be an [[active]] process through [[experience]], not passive absorption of knowledge. The child's [[interest (in something)]] and ability should be the starting point.

3. the curriculum should be related to the child's [[current experience]] and strict division of [[subjects]] should be avoided.

4. the central goal of education is to develop habits of [[thinking]] and [[reflection]].

5. in a [[democratic society]], every child should have the opportunity for an appropriate education.

6. the ultimate aim of the school is to enable individuals to develop freely and in balance and to engage constructively in [[social change]].

Dewey criticized the traditional education of his time and advocated a pragmatic [[progressive]] educational philosophy that emphasized experience. His ideas had a great influence on the [[educational reforms]] of the 20th century.
