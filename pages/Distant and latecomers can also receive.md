Voice and Text
- Voice cannot be received by people who are far or late.
- When text information is shared via a server, even people who are far away or late can receive it.


2025-02-25

- Rather than improvements in YouTube itself, the key is the improvement in smartphone performance and the proliferation of [[video conferences]] by [[Covid19]].
    - Easy sharing of videos without the need for a dedicated video camera.
