title: "Demerits of Democracy"

X is the [[democratization]] of Y!" I realized that people who make such statements implicitly assume that "democratization" is a "good thing.

- 1.[[Winston Churchill]] : "Democracy is the worst political system, but the others that have been tried are worse," noting that democracy is not perfect.
2. [[John Stuart Mill.]]: criticizes "[[tyranny of the majority rule]]" and points out that minority opinions are sometimes ignored in a democracy.
3. [[Alexis de Tocqueville.]] : warns against "[[Tyranny of Equality]]" and argues that democracy can limit individual freedom.
        - [[Alexis de Tocqueville.]]
        - [Alexis de Tocqueville - Wikipedia [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AC%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BB%E3%83%89%E3%83%BB%E3%83%88%E3%](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AC%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BB%E3%83%89%E3%83%BB%E3%83%88%E3%) 82%AF%E3%83%B4%E3%82%A3%E3%83%AB]
        - I've been communicating with [[J.S. Mill]], so it's hard to separate which opinion is which.

- [[Churchill.]] is saying that "democracy is better than other forms of government that were tried before the advent of AI," so after the advent of AI, of course, "a better form of government than the current democracy" could emerge.
- If the constraints change, the optimal solution may also change.
    - I personally believe that "of course a better form of politics will emerge."
        - It doesn't matter if you call it [[digital democracy]] or not, it's confusing when you try to describe something new with a term created to classify something existing.
- So I'm thinking, "How can we end our current democracy warmongering?"
- Because if we don't, eventually there will be a revolution in a violent way.
        - [[If you refuse to change slowly, violent change will strike you.]]
- Japan in particular is a country that has suffered greatly from the disadvantages of [[silver democracy]].
        - [[Balance between life after birth and life before birth]]
