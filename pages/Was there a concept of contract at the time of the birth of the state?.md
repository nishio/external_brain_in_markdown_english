<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>As you point out, it is doubtful that the concept of contract in the modern sense existed at the time of the birth of the state in actual history.
During the period of state formation in ancient times, there was a complex interplay of various factors, including [[blood relations]], [[religious authority]], and [[rule by force]]. In Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt, kingship was considered to be derived from the gods, while in Phoenicia and ancient Greece, multiple city-states existed side by side. The concept of contract in the sense of an agreement between equal individuals does not seem to fit in these societies.
In medieval Europe, there was a relationship of service and protection between lord and vassal under the feudal system, but this was not a contract on an equal footing either.
- [[Hobbes.]]'s [[social contract theory (e.g., Rousseau's)]] is only a [[theoretical model]] to explain [[the legitimacy of the state]], not a description of [[historical facts]]. Rather, Hobbes' ideas reflect the contemporaneous political situation of the rise of [[absolutist states]].
The [[democracy]] and [[the idea of human rights]] derived from the social contract theory were reflected in the actual political system after the 18th century through the [[civil revolution]]. [The influence of the social contract theory can be seen in the American Declaration of Independence and the French Declaration of Human Rights.
Thus, in considering the relationship between the origins of the state and the concept of contract, it is important to distinguish between historical facts and theoretical models and to view them within the context of the [[history of social thought]].
