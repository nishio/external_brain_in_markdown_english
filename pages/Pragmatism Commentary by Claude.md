<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This is the full text of the book "[[pragmatism]]" by [[William James]]. Pragmatism is a school of philosophy developed by James and others in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The flow of this document is as follows
- Discusses two opposing temperaments in philosophy ([[tough-mindedness]] and [[tender-mindedness]]) and suggests that pragmatism can be the mediator.
- Pragmatism's methodology is explained. It judges theory by [[its]] usefulness in the real world, and argues that [[truth]] means "[[coming to terms]] with reality.
- Applying a pragmatist perspective to some metaphysical issues, such as [[realism]] and [[free will]].
- [[The Problem of Unity and Plurality in the World]], arguing that pragmatism does not seek absolute unity, but emphasizes [[Empirical Ties]].
- The relationship between [[pragmatism and common sense]] is discussed and the affinity between the two is pointed out.
- He elaborates on pragmatism's view of truth and argues that truth is [[verifiable and useful ideas]].
- Discusses the relationship between pragmatism and [[anthropocentrism]], arguing that [[human experience and values define the way the world is]].
- He discusses the relationship between pragmatism and religion and concludes that [[pluralistic and moralistic atheism]] is consistent with the pragmatist position.

Overall, James presents pragmatism as a new way of thinking that moves beyond traditional philosophical oppositions and emphasizes [[experience and practice]].

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>Important perspectives of pragmatism that are still relevant today include the following.
- The attitude of evaluating theories and ideas by their [[usefulness]] and practical consequences in the real world is also a part of the modern [[problem-solving]] way of thinking.
- [A pluralistic worldview, which emphasizes experiential connections rather than absolute truth and unity, is more appropriate for today's globalized and increasingly diverse society.
- The anthropocentric position, which emphasizes human experience and values, is also relevant to the contemporary issues of [[respect for the individual]] and [[coexistence of diverse values]] in a [[democratic society]].
- The advocacy of a flexible way of thinking [[that is not bound by dogma]] is also important as an [[intellectual attitude]] to adapt to [[today's rapidly changing society]].
- Overcoming the conflict between science and religion and taking an atheistic position in an empirical sense presents one ideological option in today's increasingly secularized society, where the influence of religion cannot be ignored.
- This attitude of viewing philosophy as something that has contact with the real world resonates with the modern tendency to seek practicality and sociality in philosophy.

Thus, many of pragmatism's arguments, although proposed more than 100 years ago, are also deeply relevant to the challenges of contemporary society. Reading the classic texts can provide insights for the present day.

- [[Empirical Ties]]
- [[Aristotelian position in the empirical sense]]
- [[Tough Mind and Tender Mind]]
