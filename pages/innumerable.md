## digest
.
If you refer to "[[non-numerical]]," you will find a discussion of the myriad characteristics of experiences. Experiences are not expressed numerically as one, two, or many, but can be viewed differently depending on the characteristics and meaning of the experience. In "[innumerable feature (e.g., in a programming language)," the assertion that the meaning of an experience has non-numeric characteristics is introduced. Furthermore, "[[atomic v.s. non-numerical]]" explains that human experience has no clear boundaries and that specifying, selecting, or creating symbols for the experience makes it "one experience." These discussions provide an opportunity to think deeply about the non-numerical properties of experiences and experiences and their implications.

## Related to Fragment
.
The fragments "[[non-numerical]]" and "[innumerable feature (e.g. in a programming language)" and "[[atomic v.s. non-numerical]]" share a They share the same discussion. These fragments provide a perspective for understanding the non-numerical properties of experiences and experiences and creating their meaning. Specifically, "[innumerable feature (e.g. in a programming language)" introduces the claim that the meaning of an experience has non-numerical properties, and "[[atomic v.s. non-numerical]]" discusses how to identify, select and or creating symbols to make it "one experience".

## deep thought
.
Thinking about the non-numeric properties of experiences and experiences and their implications provides an important perspective from which we can make sense of the world and create new knowledge. Understanding the diversity and complexity of experiences that cannot be captured by numerical representations enables us to gain richer knowledge and insight.

## title of discussion
.
"Non-numeric characteristics of experience and experience: their implications and impact on knowledge creation."
