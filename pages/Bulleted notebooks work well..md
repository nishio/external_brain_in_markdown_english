- Marie

    - My wife checked out some of the books on [[Bullet Journal]] and suggested the ones that she thought were the best for me.
    - Marie, who was [[I'm not very good at keeping things organized]], discovered the Bullet Journal in 2013 and has been using it ever since.

- Developer: Ryder Carroll, Digital Product Designer
        - I have a [[learning disability]] and have made ingenious efforts to improve my own life with [[(powers of) concentration]] problems.
- The most important rule
        - [[Quickly record]] ：[[Rapid Logging]]
        - The rules are as simple as possible.
        - Marie's experience was as follows: "When I separated the pen colors by genre, it was easy to see when I read back, but I had problems writing because I didn't have the necessary color pen on hand. [I had to stop color-coding because it was difficult to even carry a pen of each color.
        - I wrote in "[[Color of nameplate and fusuma]]" in [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]], "I don't distinguish the colors of fusuma. It looks pretty, but it's a pain to use multiple colors of labels. The same idea as
    - The phrase "you can make anything but the basic rules to your liking" has taken on a life of its own, causing a trend of posting painstakingly and beautifully finished notebooks on Instagram.
        - Simple things don't get shared because they don't look like installations, and only things that require a lot of work get noticed.
        - Going through the hassle is contrary to the principles of Rapid Logging.

- A daily log called "[daily log
    - It is important to note that [[space is not limited]] and [apply (makeup) to anything
        - ⇔ Notebooks with pre-defined space for one day and pre-defined contents to be written
    - The "anything" in "anything you want" is the following two words
        - Things to do that day = [[task]].
        - What came to mind that day
    - Write whatever comes to mind that day = "[Write whatever comes to mind.
        - [[I can write about anything.]] Benefits of a notebook
        - I just thought of something.
            - Where to write.
            - Do you write in a notebook or a notepad?
            - Where to write in your notebook?
            - How much to write about how much to write about how much to write about how much to write about how much to write about
        - You can write instantly without thinking about things such as
        - To take advantage of this benefit, it is a poor idea to generate "which color pen to write with".
        - Changed from [[Notebook for scheduling]] to [Notebook to record what you want to do and what you have done
        - Accumulating a record of what you've done gives you confidence.
        - Know Our Strengths by looking at the record of what you've done.
        - Logging" is the main focus.
        - Manual [[life logging]].

Four basic configurations
- Index: Table of Contents
- Futurelog: Six-Month Schedule
- Monthly Log: Monthly Schedule and Tasks
- Daily Log: daily schedule and tasks
Details
- index
    - Part that is to increase the freedom of placement of other parts.
    - Leave the first 4 pages or so open.
    - Write what is on what page
- future log
    - Write a six-month schedule on a spread.
    - For example, divide the page into three parts.
- monthly log
    - Write down your schedule and tasks for the month
    - Write at the beginning of the month
- daily log
    - This is the bulk of this notebook.
    - I'll add to this daily.
    - configuration
        - Title (Today's date)
        - Bullets and Keys
        - page number

Bullets and Keys
- Make it easy to understand at a glance by devising a symbol (key) to put at the beginning of each bullet point.
- Not a special concept, but something that many people do naturally, and we've named it "the key."
- Early keys used
    - □Task
    - ☑︎Completed Tasks
    - Clearly distinguish between "what just came to mind" and "tasks that really need to be done today".
        - This allows you to determine at a glance if what you really need to do today has been completed
        - Don't "task" something to the extent that it occurs to you that you might want to do it.
- Marie's early keys (excerpts) and Ryder's proposed key from 2015
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/4a3663b109d11de28e15290cd78a746c/thumb/1000)
    - Personally, I'm familiar with Marie-style "tasks are check boxes".
        - I too had differentiated between "task, completed, and cancelled", but I didn't put a different symbol on the one I sent the next day.
        - The postponement symbol keeps a record that "this task was not executed and sent to the next day".

Consider the relationship between [GTD
- Writing down anything that comes to mind" is a concept shared with [[GTD]].
- In GTD, Inbox is a "box for everything".
    - Empty this Inbox
- In the Barrett Journal, the Daily Log is "a box for everything."
    - Empty the box at night or the next day.
        - = Looking back
    - Uncompleted tasks will be rewritten in the log for the next day
        - This re-writing effort is positively worth it.
            - It creates opportunities to read and think.
            - Continued use of the same task list over multiple days does not provide this opportunity.
                - What you didn't do will just stay there forever.
                - Eventually I'll get sick of looking at it.
    - Tasks that continue to be carried over, that's what the logs reveal.
    - Is this task really necessary?"
    - If you don't do it today, you have three options
        - Cancel
        - Divide (e.g., into 5-minute and 10-minute increments)
        - (Marie didn't write it, but the logic is) schedule it on a specific day.
    - Difference between canceling and erasing
        - Unlogged electronic task management tools make it impossible to "erase" and look back.
        - Cancellation in the Valet Journal will be recorded as "I was going to do it and put it on task, but after putting it off for days, I cancelled it".
        - Even after you turn it off, you can look back.
            - Maybe things have changed and it's easier to do.
            - Maybe we can come up with a new way to divide them.
            - The objective you wanted to achieve might be achieved with a different method instead of that method.

- My impression is that it is a notebook technique that can nicely complement the daily practice part of GTD.
    - GTD is heavy on initial collection work.
    - The Bullet Journal is a [[incremental]] improvement by writing down all the kids you think of on a given day, clearing them out on that day, and repeating the process.
