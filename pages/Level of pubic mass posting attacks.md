title: "Level of pubic mass posting attacks"

There are levels of pubic mass posting attacks.
- 1: Just a temp. same wording: easy to filter by checking if it is the same or not
- 2: Some changes to the template: easy filtering based on edit distance, embedding would also work.
- 3: Multiple people generated by LLM from the same prompt (this is where it gets difficult to deal with)
- 4: A single LMM smart enough to properly scatter and generate opinions

I think 2 is easy, so I thought I'd make a quick-win demo of how to get rid of it first.
