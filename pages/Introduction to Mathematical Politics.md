- >  "A mathematician who has studied mathematics intensively should be a very good logical thinker. However, the fact is not always so.
- >  I don't think that is the case. I know from many years of association with mathematicians that they excel at "making valid inferences.
- >  I don't think it's very likely. Sometimes I hear people say that the mathematics department is a baggage of the faculty" (Fujiwara, "Mathematician's Break Time.

- >  "It is not necessarily decreasing in validity. In contrast, the "logic of the world" has a short chain of logical steps, and "the legitimacy is always reduced at each step.
- >  "The validity of logic is a function of the situation. The validity of logic is a function of the situation. The indeterminacy of the situation makes the validity of the inference a function of the length of the chain of logical steps.
- >  The justification decreases sharply with time. All people are aware of this, albeit subconsciously, so they dare to use a short logical syllogism.

- >  Dr. Fujiwara, by the way, says that the purpose of mathematics education is to develop logical thinking because of the above circumstances.
