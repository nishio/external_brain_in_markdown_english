I pass the above article on to [[o1 Pro]] with the prompt, "I'll show you some past articles I've written thinking about sending out information to the world.
- Pick up these articles via "[Vector Search in Nishio
- I look at it with my eyes, open the page, "judge" it, note the title here, and put the content on the prompt.
    - There is a feeling that this process is awkward and may need assistance from the system.
    - On the other hand, I don't think it's a "put in a keyword and everything is automatic" kind of thing.
        - It's going to make sense in the human process of making the decision to put it in context or not once you've looked it over.
        - You could say it's time to awaken something that's sunk deep into the brain.
        - It can be said that what is not verbalized by keywords is expressed by "to put in context or not to put in context".
        - I follow links and read the next page, and sometimes I hit a hub page or a useful, fragmented note.
    - Sometimes it's a mixture of technical details and program output logs that you don't need.
        - I guess I should really do the "take out only what is useful for the current focus" thing, but I haven't because it's a hassle.
        - Maybe this is where AI should be able to summarize and segment, rather than raw text, to easily express "what is loaded in context".

In the discussion on information dissemination to the world, the issues of multilingual development through automatic translation from Japanese to English, cultural and linguistic homogenization on that basis, and English becoming the common language on the Internet are mentioned. It is also indicated that in a society where English has become the natural lingua franca, the inability to read and write English could become a kind of "disability," and that multilingual education and the use of translation technology are needed as countermeasures.

On the other hand, the report also addresses issues surrounding attempts at "Continuous Translation," which emphasizes quality and speed/quantity, the automation of English translation strategies, and post-translation improvement policies. In conclusion, the report suggests that a combination of diverse efforts through technological and social responses is needed to simultaneously achieve diversity and inclusiveness in a globalized language environment as the "new nature.

The reason we chose "information dissemination to the world" this time is because we felt that English need not be the only language to begin with, nor should it be the hub, so direct conversion between Japanese and Chinese is more preferable in some cases.

Now that I'm done loading this into context, I turn on [[Advanced Voice]] and take a bath.
- Yesterday was rather nice having a conversation while washing dishes.
- I'm wondering if bathing and walking are other use cases.
- No need to operate the screen, so no accidental touches from water droplets.

It didn't work.
- I tried using 4o, but it didn't work, and I couldn't even start Advanced Voice normally, so it was probably a server-side problem.
