title: "Freedom and control are false dichotomies"
---

- [[freedom]] and [[control]] are [[false dichotomy]].

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3/icon' alt='o3.icon' height="19.5"/>The following is a representative academic and ideological literature that discusses the dangers of cutting reality with the simple dichotomy of "freedom vs. control". All of them present a "third framework that is not zero-sum" and urge us to rethink it with an eye toward multi-layered and decentralized power and digital environments.

1992
- [[Gilles Deleuze]], “Postscript on the Societies of Control”
- He points to the shift from the "disciplined society" of the modern era to a "controlled society" where boundaries dissolve and are continuously monitored. He warns that freedom and control are no longer opposites, and that actions considered free can be subsumed into algorithmic control.
2010
- [[Nadina Feješ]], “Is there really a dichotomy between security and liberty?”
- Using the UK's anti-terrorism legislation as an example, he criticizes the political rhetoric of "giving up freedom for security" as creating a "false dichotomy" that leads to ineffective legislation. He presents an alternative approach and argues that "freedom and security can be compatible.
2020
- [[Petter Törnberg]] & [[Justus Uitermark]], “Complex Control and the Governmentality of Digital Platforms”
- [The "sharing economy" and "self-organization" narratives of freedom are reexamined within the framework of [[Foucault]]/[[Deleuze]]/[[Bauman]]. He points out that platforms, while advocating "autonomy," exercise elaborate behavioral control and disrupt the freedom/control dichotomy.
    - [[Michel Foucault]]
2020
- [[Yevhen Laniuk]], “Freedom in the Society of Control: Ethical Challenges”
- Updates Deleuze's theory of control society and suggests that "redefining freedom" is essential under [[data sovereignty]] and [[algorithmically uneven power]]. He explains the need to put freedom into concrete practices such as privacy management and algorithmic auditing.


[Deleuze's "control society" theory warns against the danger of falling into "one-bit thinking" (freedom = good/control = bad) and misinterpreting [[algorithmic surveillance]] = increased control as "voluntary - free choice.
