Project goals and member values
The goals of the project are objective, while the values of the members are subjective and different.
- Tachikawa and Nishio discussed the objectives and goals of software development projects,
- While the goals of the project are objectively achievable,
- Members' values and well-being are subjective,
- He shared his opinion that he is often not interested in others.

Tachikawa: In your mind, what are the values and objectives of software development, for example?
Nishio: Let's say you are developing software for a project, and everyone on the team agrees that the software must be released on, say, March 31.
Tachikawa: Delivery date?
Nishio: It could be a deadline. Well, there should be a goal for what that project is going to do that everyone on the team agrees on.
Tachikawa: The goal of the project.
Nishio: No, the goal of this project is objectively observable, and regardless of what individuals think, either the goal of the project has been achieved or it has not.
Tachikawa: Objectively.
Nishio: On the other hand, what makes us happy and what makes us happy are completely subjective to the individual, so it is impossible to observe whether or not they are achieved, and frankly, it does not matter.
Man X: (laughs) Yeah, yeah.
Man Y: It means that some people like doing the project and some don't like it but feel they have to work hard because they get paid.
Nishio: Yes. It is possible that there is a type of person in the project who wants the project members to be happy, but I think the default state is that each person has a different idea of what makes them happy, and they are not interested in what makes others happy.
