title: "Singularity in physical ability"

There are hints of singularity in the way physical abilities have been treated since then. For example, marathons were practiced as a necessary ability to report war victories, but now they are done more for the significance of the act itself than for its functionality (a phone call or an email is better to convey information quickly).

If you want to win, you can just listen to the AI's instructions, but you don't do that because you feel the significance of the act itself. The same will happen in academia. People will become like amateur mathematicians, and even those who used to be academics will enjoy mathematics as an activity.

> [kojinoshiba_jp](https://x.com/kojinoshiba_jp/status/1938855399874334749) I think an intellectual act that feels the significance of the act itself is an activity where there is truth and beauty. For example, a machine or a human being can give directions, so it will be eliminated. Design, for example, when done as a pursuit of truth and beauty, retains the significance of the act itself, and the respect, admiration, and interest in the human being who pursues it also remains.
