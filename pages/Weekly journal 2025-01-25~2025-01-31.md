New Year's party participation and meeting new people
- It was interesting to meet different people at the New Year's party and try [[voice changer]]. The stimulation from new encounters and the experience with the tool will have a positive impact on future activities.

Close of [Devian Watching Group
- As we close our month-long "Seeing Devian" meeting, we would like to organize our articles.
- We have been working with an AI-based task management system, but some of the improvements have caused confusion and need to be sorted out.

Viewing a film about the Sunflower Student Movement in Taiwan
- I realized anew how difficult it is to change society. I reaffirmed the importance of accumulating what I can do little by little.
- 1/22  [[Viewing of "My Youth in Taiwan]] <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

Trial new tools and workflows
- Test of LLM ([[DeepSeek-R1]]) running in a local environment: smart enough and likely to expand its useful utilization.
- [[Video to Summary]] workflow: under consideration as an efficient way to generate [[seeds for discussion]].
- Non-destructive scanning of books" -> LLM connection: Explore the idea of passing scanned information to LLM first and then viewing it on a large screen while working.
        - [[I want to scan books non-destructively.]] <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - â†’[[CZUR Shine Ultra]]
    - Exploring ideas for working while browsing on a large screen is not something I did this week, but something I'm thinking about now and would like to explore in the future.
- Voice recognition memo by [[j-Moshi]]: An attempt to automate note-taking while reading or working.
    - This is also what I want to do in the future<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

Task management and project progress
- Task organization is somewhat confusing, and a system for prioritizing tasks while integrating list duplication, etc. is needed.
- Task definition for MVID dataset analysis is unclear and has not been started, so clarification is an issue.
- Preparation for the lecture is in the idea stage. There is remaining work to be done on the book, with only the first part of the book to be checked.
- The possibility of writing a sequel article ([[Intellectual production techniques for engineers who use LLM]]) is also being considered.

Other Topics
- Experience the new wargame "Pandora's Werewolf".
    - 1/20  [[Pandora's Werewolf]] <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- J-Moshi is a strong candidate as an alternative to Advanced Voice because of the problem of losing connection after about five minutes.
    - Successful [[Writing experiment from Roo to Cosense]].

generalize
Overall, while the week was full of new encounters and challenges with tools, it also highlighted the importance of task organization and clarification. Going forward, we will continue to work on projects and events of interest while improving our task management system and workflow.

Of course, there are many places where the transcription fails in terms of terminology, etc.
- I wasn't sure if I should keep it, but I rewrote it.
- Just make a list of pairs of failures and correct answers for these things and have them check them off at the end.
- It's a good feeling to have a human link to a summary written by an AI.
- When you're looking back, you say things like, "Let's do this next time.
    - If you have an idea, you should say it out loud.
        - [[put off the record and it will disappear]].
    - But I haven't been able to determine the separation of that with the o1 Pro.


task-reflection
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Share the backlog of tasks. We'll take a deep look into this week's and next week's activities, and then propose short, medium, and long-term strategies.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>
The following is a discussion of the activities that will be the focus of this week and next week, and the strategies for the short, medium, and long term.

# 1. Focus for this week/next week
.

1.### Priority handling of deadline tasks
.
    - T3243: Guerrilla check for Plurality book (due 1/31)
        - Work efficiently by utilizing iPads and using travel time.
    - T0058: 2/5 Preparation for in-house presentation (10 minutes, not yet finalized)
        - Since the date is close, even though it is for internal use, confirm the theme finalization and availability of necessary materials as soon as possible.

2.### Devin-related "Go Private & Restructure" task
.
    - T8567: Devin's privatization
    - T8568: Migration of connection to personal Slack
    - T8569: Organize WebUI members
    - * T8570: Make all repositories private.
    - T8571: Creating a closing article
        - These are highly interdependent and collectively need to proceed as a phase of "making Devin specialized for personal use". Considering the timing of publishing the closing article and the backward tasks (T8572, T8573, etc.), it is desirable to start early and complete in phases.

3.### Preparation of lectures by late February
.
    - T0057: 2/25 "Scalability of Democracy," prepared talk (20 min.)
        - We are in the process of organizing ideas at this point, but need to finalize slides and content by mid-February. It would be better if the flow can be streamlined in conjunction with the preparation of the in-house presentation (T0058).

4.### MVID dataset analysis system (related to TTTC)
.
    - T0008: Analysis of MVID dataset at TTTC
    - Once this is completed, it will be easier to start developing and documenting tools such as T0009, T0010, etc. in the chain.
    - If time permits, we would like to finalize the specific analysis process somewhere this week/next week and proceed with the subsequent steps.



# 2. Short, medium and long term strategies
.

## Short-term (this week to 1-2 weeks)

1.### Intensively clean up Devin's privatization and system transition
.
    - T8567 to T8571 will be processed together to complete the redevelopment of the Devin environment.
    - This simplifies the work environment and facilitates subsequent tasks (e.g., writing articles and using case studies for companies).

2.### Tasks with deadlines are given top priority
.
    - Plan ahead with the guerrilla check of T3243 (due 1/31). Thoroughly utilize travel time.
    - T0058 (2/5 In-house lecture preparation) will also be conducted as early as possible to finalize the theme, and to start making slides and a framework of talking points.

3.### Initiate small scale analysis and documentation
.
    - Implement the MVID data set (T0008), even if only as a "first step", to lay the groundwork for subsequent T0009, T0010, etc.
    - Even if it is not completed immediately, it is easier to see the prospects when it is initiated.

## Medium-term (about 1-3 months)
.

1.### Improve the quality of lectures and seminar-related activities
.
    - 2/25 "Scalability of Democracy" (T0057) is likely to have an external component, so be careful to prepare compelling slides and case studies.
    - You can increase your persuasiveness by using specific examples of your own efforts, such as examples of AI applications or summaries of dialogue logs.

2.### Full-scale development of automation and efficiency systems
.
    - Gradually increase the completeness of the task management automation line, such as T0045 "Automation of nighttime task registration" -> T0046 "GitHub Actions for task management prompts".
    - Established a "Task Extraction -> Integration -> Optimization" flow, including T0027 "Development of Task Management Scripts using ChatGPT 4.0 API".
    - After the transition to Devin's personal environment, we should be able to test more boldly automated functions, and we will also proceed with technical validation.

3.### MVID dataset analysis - TTTC system function expansion
.
    - T0008, T0009, T0010, T0039, T0040, T0042, T0043... and coordinate a chain of analysis and tool development tasks that can proceed in parallel.
    - The knowledge gained here can be used for lectures and articles, which will lead to external appeal.

## Long-term (3 months to 6 months or more)

1.### Consider large scale task management automation and organizational implementation
.
    - The entire T0004 "Task Automation System Construction Project" is now in full swing, crossing all GitHub/Scrapbox/chat logs.
    - A step-by-step approach was considered with a view to "expanding from personal use to internal use and to other organizations," referring to examples of in-house implementation (e.g., T8572: Mr. Yasukawa's case study).

2.### Multilingual development and content maintenance
.
    - Stable operation of T0001 "Multilingual deployment of Scrapbox information" and T0036 and T0037 "Automatic English translation and multilingual distribution system" to incorporate actual feedback from overseas users.
    - Full-fledged "outreach outside the Japanese-speaking world," including the release of code (T8573) such as Devin and the Public Opinion Map Project, can be expected to have long-term reach.

3.### Mature AI-assisted reading flow and deliberation systems
.
    - Full-scale refinement of idea-stage functions, such as T0051-T0054 "Reading Support System" and T0064-T0065 "Fractal Summarization and Deliberation".
    - These have the potential to significantly increase an individual's intellectual productivity and are therefore worth pursuing over the long term.



# Summary
.

- This week to next week, the first priority is to deal with "Devin privatization and environment restructuring" and "imminent due date tasks such as gala checks and internal speeches", while starting MVID analysis (T0008) to connect to the next step.
- In the mid-term [1-3 months, the flow of task management automation and TTTC system analysis will be promoted while improving the completeness of the lectures, and will be developed into articles and external presentations.
- 3 months and beyond will be developed with a mid- to long-term vision of expanding from individuals to companies and other organizations, with a focus on multilingual development and more advanced AI support (reading and deliberation).

Based on these factors, it is advisable to make steady progress while adjusting priorities in the daily task management system.
