title: "Statistics on the Scrapbox of the Unexplored Juniors"
---

Unexplored Junior is using a shared Scrapbox project for the entire project starting in 2021.
- Detailed story written at the time: [[Unexplored Junior 2021 Boost Conference]].

This time, I saw Mr. Ukai's writing about his efforts after 2021 in [Unexplored Junior Advent Calendar 2023 - Adventar](https://adventar.org/calendars/9101) and thought it would be interesting to add some statistical data to it. I thought it would be interesting to add some statistical data.

At this time (2023-12-05), the values that can be seen from the UI are as follows
- 156 members
- 2950 pages
- 12175 Link
However, I thought this did not tell me at all what kind of phenomenon was happening, so I looked at the creation date and time of each row and tallied the number of rows added per week.

# Number of rows added per week

At this time there are 125732 rows, and the number of rows added, summarized by week, is as follows

There are three major chunks, each for three years starting in 2021
- I can usually tell you that the activity starts around May and ends around November.

The peak immediately after the start is [[Boost Conference]].
- Around 6,000 lines have been added in a week.
- The Boost Conference is an event where selected creators present their projects to people other than the mentors who adopted them, saying, "This is what I am going to do from now on! and ask questions.
- Past Unexplored Juniors were in the form of oral presentations and oral discussions.
- Starting in 2021, "make a video presentation and post it in Scrapbox" and "each participant watches it and writes comments and questions in Scrapbox during the week".
- This results in a question log of several hundred lines for each creator for his/her project
    - Audio feedback tends to be taken down due to nervousness or overflow of capacity, but since it is in text, it does not disappear and can be read calmly and slowly
    - Also, after a period of time, for example before the presentation of the results, the initial feelings of the project can be reflected on, and the following year's creators can use it as a reference.
    - A collection of facts can convey the sense that things often do not go as planned and that we are flexible and change things from time to time.

Peak around August is the midterm camp.
- Like the Boost Conference, this will be done in the form of posting videos and adding comments.

The peak around the end of the period in 2023 is the results meeting
- The peak of the results meeting is not very clear in 20212022.
- To begin with, the results debriefing is for people outside of this Scrapbox project, so it's not unnatural to not peak on Scrapbox.
- In 2023, the oral question and answer period after the presentation was eliminated.
    - In connection with this, he hired a graduate part-time to reprint YouTube comments.
    - It must have peaked because it was used as a place for creatives to waiver while watching the actual presentation on this page.

# Number of users writing per week

Around 50 people are active during peak times such as events.
- Around 20 during the rest of the year.
- A total of 131 people have written

First, regarding the time of the event
- Around 15 adopted creators and 10 mentors will certainly write in, so 25 people.
- The remaining 25 are graduates of the Unexplored Junior Program and graduates of the IPA Unexplored Project who are participating as guests.
- I'm very grateful that the latter are proactively involved.
    - The former is, after all, "coercion by event management."
    - The latter, those who are not under any compulsion to do so, are helping us by promoting their own interests and desire to improve the community.

Regarding Normal Time
- Why is it that there are about 25 people in the adoption creators and mentors, but the weekly active users are around 20?
- This may seem surprising, but the adopted creators and mentors will discuss how to proceed with the project during the term, and the mentors will use their discretion to implement the project in the way they deem best.
    - So some projects don't write their weekly minutes in Scrapbox.
    - Roughly half?
- I'm thinking this is, well, we don't need to make the minutes mandatory, etc.
    - By the way, I'm a record-keeper.
    - I personally think it's very beneficial, because just talking verbally doesn't convey what you want to say to the creators, and in the process of compiling the minutes, you may realize that I misunderstood what the creators said or overlooked something that I should have pointed out.
    - However, whether or not this is not a hardship depends on the individuality of the members, i.e., the cost paid varies from team to team. For projects where I am the mentor, the cost to me is quite low, which means that it is cost-effective.
        - I have also tried the "creators write the minutes" and "creators write the report in advance" patterns, but in the end, each creator has his/her own personality, so I basically write the minutes myself.

Outside the adoption period
- Less than 10 people and renewals are happening in detail.
- Surprisingly, there are no "weeks with no updates at all".
    - What's being written.
        - Check it out, for example.
            - New recommendations have been added to the Recommended YouTube Channels and
            - There are some slides that were shared for reference.
            - The page for [Unexplored Junior Advent Calendar 2023 - Adventar](https://adventar.org/calendars/9101) was created.
    - Recommended YouTube channel, posting to chat without context is a psychological hurdle, but adding to it when you already have a list is a low hurdle.


(Note: Scrapbox's specification is that each line has an updater ID instead of a creator ID, so if a line is updated after it was created, the creator cannot be easily confirmed. In this case, since we are only looking at a rough overall trend, we judged that this would not have a major impact).
