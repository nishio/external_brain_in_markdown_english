> Because the buzzwords are symptomatic of a business or of a category where many people are doing them. The fact that you've heard certain buzzwords many times before, it’s a tell that you’re bluffing, that there’s nothing unique in your business. The more buzzwords you have, the less differentiated your business is.
(DeepL) Because buzzwords are a sign that the business is a category that many people are in. The fact that you have heard a particular buzzword many times is a [[bluff]] that indicates that your business does not have [[originality]]. The more buzzwords you have, the less [[differentiation]] your business has.
