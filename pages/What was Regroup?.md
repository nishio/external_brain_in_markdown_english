What was [[Regroup]] 2021/6/23 Looking Back
    - When [[KJ method]] type of [[assistance in organizing]] is done on a computer, the [[work area is too small]] is a problem at present.
- It would be good if [[Intuitive zooming in and out]] could be done with [[two-finger gesture]] on the assumption of [[iPad]] (hypothesis).
- In addition, it would be good if [[handwritten addition]] could be done with [[Apple Pencil]] (hypothesis).

result
- Nishio stopped using the KJ method on paper and started using this one.
    - N=1 but there was a clear [[Product/User Fit]].
- I used the Apple Pencil mainly for adding enclosures and arrows.
    - During user testing, users were observed to refuse to draw and to try to write letters by hand
    - I can take notes, so I did, but it was sluggish compared to existing note-taking apps and failed to save to the cloud.
    - In increasing users, "assuming an iPad and Apple Pencil" is a very high hurdle.
- Initially happy to use the iPad to zoom in and out.
    - But as the number of stickies increased, the stress caused by screen size and performance issues outweighed the stress, and I started organizing them on my PC.
        - Easier to increase the number of sheets than with paper, because the number of sheets can be easily increased
    - Wheel zooming in and out is unsatisfactory for organizing on a PC
        - →Very comfortable with the ability to view the entire display with the space key.
            - So, in fact, smooth scaling was not necessary.
- Most people cannot say, "Let's make 100 sticky notes first."
    - After using the multi-line import function, Nishio himself started using it all the time.
    - Mainly import flow of Scrapbox bullet points, Keicho chat logs, and


What is [[Movidea]]?
- Approach to realize in DOM instead of Canvas by discarding the pen function and [lasso choice
    - This should make the [[React Differential Update]] work in a straightforward manner.
    - Search works with browser functionality.
    - Testing made easier? → Did not.
