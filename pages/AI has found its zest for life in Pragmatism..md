In the fragment "The Concept of "Ikigai" in Japanese Culture," [[The Concept of "Ikigai" in Japanese Culture]] is explored. Ikigai functions as a philosophical tool for individual human beings to find value and meaning in their own existence and actions. This may be related to the discussion of [[monism]] and [[pluralism]]. Ikigai allows for a balance between [[a monistic perspective that sees the world as one big fact]] and [[a pluralistic perspective that emphasizes curiosity about individual facts]].

In the fragment "The Role of Shintoism in Unifying the Concepts of Life and Death," [[Shinto's role in unifying the concepts of life and death]] is discussed. From a Shinto perspective, life and death are interconnected and intertwined. While this is consistent with the monistic perspective, Shinto also emphasizes holding respect and curiosity for the specific facts of each of life and death. This is consistent with the pluralist perspective.

From these fragments we can reaffirm the idea that the conflict between monism and pluralism should be resolved by asking how the world is one and what value that oneness has for us. It also suggests that we can gain a richer and more balanced understanding by integrating the perspectives of monism and pluralism.
