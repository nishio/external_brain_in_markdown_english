- Well, I don't have a rash, just a [[shingles]]-like skin tingling sensation... I should go to the doctor...
    - > Before visible symptoms, pain or discomfort appears in the affected area. This is called prodromal pain, which can appear in a wide variety of ways, including tingling, prickling, dull ache, creeping, and itching. A typical case of shingles is the appearance of a red rash after a few days to a week of prodromal pain.
    - Ugh, this.
        - from  [[shingles]]
            - > Unusually, the activity of the virus is suppressed by the immune system, so symptoms do not occur. However, when the immune system is weakened due to aging, fatigue, stress, or illness, the virus ramps up again and painful shingles appear.
            - > The virus causes inflammation of the nerves, so the pain is said to precede and then follow the skin symptoms. Some people have a stabbing pain and cannot sleep.
            - This is exactly what it feels like, not so much like a "stabbing pain" but more like the prickly side of Velcro growing on the back of your clothes.
