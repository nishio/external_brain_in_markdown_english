title: "metadowniness"
---

I'm thinking of something called meta-dorkiness.
- Let's say there's a cool person P who does a certain act X.
- Let's say there is a person Q who does X in that act because he wants to seem cool.
- Q is [[uncool]] Yes, I do.
- Structure: It's lame to do act X to look cool
- The structure here is flipped around to say, "The behavior of 'I don't do act Y because I don't want to seem tacky' is tacky, isn't it?"
- This is meta-dorkiness.
    - I don't do it because it's lame." I don't do it because it's lame.
        - → →.
- This meta-dork is nested.
    - Level 2 meta dorkiness can be done.
    - I don't do it because it's tacky." "I don't do it because it's tacky." "I don't do it because it's tacky.
        - →non-extant
