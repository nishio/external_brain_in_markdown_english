title: 'You shouldn''t say, "That''s hard."'
---

from  [[2019 Unexplored Junior]]
You shouldn't say, "That's hard."
- It's not that it's hard, just that "I haven't come up with a solution to it at this point."
- The "difficult" is just a personal interpretation.
- It is true that "the proposal did not specifically state how to do it."
