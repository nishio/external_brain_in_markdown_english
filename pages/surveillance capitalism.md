- Sucking up human experience as "free raw material
    - [[人間からの収穫]] / [[リソースとしての人間]]<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I think I wrote something related but couldn't find the keywords.
- Predicting and selling future behavior from behavioral data
- To further improve prediction accuracy, the user's behavior itself is manipulated.
He explains that it is established in three stages.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3/icon' alt='o3.icon' height="19.5"/>[[Zubov]] emphasizes that "[[t]]he most reliable way to predict human behavior is to intervene and shape its source," and points out that companies "guide" people's choices ahead of time through notifications, recommendations, and price manipulation. She calls this** "[[Instrumentarian Power]]"** and warns that it is a "[[behavior modification architecture]]" that is different from traditional "[[Big Brother]]" type surveillance.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3/icon' alt='o3.icon' height="19.5"/>Zubov calls this "[[the privatization of human agency]]" in which [[an individual's future options]] = "[[the possibility of will]]" is transformed into a commodity on an advertising infrastructure.
