> So at the end of the day we will have to implement their vision anyway, but after a very high social cost. So to shorten the time that a genuinely good idea gets thought by a teenager or young people, and the time that it's understood by the senior people and implemented, is key to moving democracy forward. The younger people, because they're digital natives, they don't think that once every four years is sufficient upload bandwidth, the latency is too high, they prefer to collaborate on a day-to-day basis. --- [[Audrey Tang]]

- (DeepL) So we end up realizing their vision, but at a very high social cost. So the key to moving [[democracy]] forward is to have teenagers and young people come up with really good ideas and shorten the time it takes for them to be [[understood and]] implemented by the senior people. Younger people are [[digital natives]], so they don't believe that once-every-four-years upload bandwidth is enough, and [[latency]] is too high. They prefer to collaborate on a daily basis.

> The key to advancing democracy is to shorten the time it takes for good ideas from young people to be understood and implemented by senior people. Digital natives do not believe that a four-year upload bandwidth is sufficient. They prefer to collaborate on a daily basis.
