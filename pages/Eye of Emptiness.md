title: "Eye of Emptiness"
---

I was thinking about self-display in VR space.
- In the first place, physical localization is an old generation idea.
    - Isn't it not good enough to go to the trouble of mimicking the localization that is characteristic of matter in a world without physical constraints?

- [[I want to be the eye of the void]]?
- Eyes open when and where you want to see them, close them when you lose interest, and disappear.
- When you want to operate, a hand comes out of the void.
- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Horus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Horus)

Rather, the main body is a pyramid?
- No, no, it is not self.
- The eyes and hands that arise and disappear temporarily are the self, while the pyramid was there originally and will be there after the disappearance of the eyes.
    - A hand appears when you want to do something to it.
- My eyes open and close, and one day they won't open anymore.

- Pyramid is not self-displaying, yet what is valuable in this picture is the pyramid
    - Ah, well, homo sapiens implicitly tend to think of the self as "valuable".
        - [Humans are fragile parts that only operate for a mere 100 years or so.

Does this mean that you recognize as "self-display" a mark that indicates the "object you are interested in now" that changes from time to time, rather than some kind of "self" that does not change?
