title: "Achievement exists side by side with disappointment."
---

> [Jn_Matsumoto](https://twitter.com/Jn_Matsumoto/status/1700151464998391925) [[Ryu Murakami]] said it best.
>  "In the world of [[tastes]] there are no life-shaking encounters or discoveries in exchange for nothing that threatens you. True [[sense of accomplishment]] and [[fulfillment]] are found in work that involves a great deal of [[cost]], [[risk]], and [[sense of danger]], and always exists side by side with [[disappointment]] and [[despair]]. In other words, they are only in "[[work]]."
>
>  I read this in a book I read a long time ago, and I always try to remember it when things get a little tough at work.
>
>  Hobbies are certainly enjoyable, but the joy that makes my body tremble has always been found in "work," as I look back on my own experience.
>
>  When we create something in the world that has never existed before, or when we are able to provide great value to others, those are the moments when we are truly happy with our work. And that is something that can only be achieved by taking risks.
>
>  The joy of being able to work. I am grateful for the opportunity to work with you, and I am determined to do my best again.
