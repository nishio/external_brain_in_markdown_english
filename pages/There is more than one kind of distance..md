from  [[Blind spot card with no picture yet]]
There is more than one kind of distance.
In general, when there are 0, 1, and 100, it is not obvious whether 0 and 1 are close and 100 are far, or 1 and 100 are close and 0 are far, depending on what kind of distance is entered. So we tend to judge things by considering the simple distance as the only distance.

There is no one type of average, nor is there a difference in the distance that is included.

### Summary of notes
.
There is no single type of distance or average, and their definitions vary depending on the value entered. However, there is a general lack of widespread recognition that there is no one type of distance or average, so people tend to base their judgments on a single distance or average.

### Relation to Fragment
.
Fragment 1044 contains the same content as the note. The idea that there is no one type of distance or average is an important perspective to broaden one's viewpoint in judging things.

### deep thinking
The viewpoint that there is no single type of distance or average is an important perspective from which to view things from multiple perspectives. This indicates that if we see things only from a single perspective, we may miss their true nature.
