title: "Original methods and fidelity"
---

- Discussion of whether one should be [[faithful]] to the original method
- Arguing that "we should be faithful" or "we don't have to be faithful" is [[False dichotomy]].
- There is a long-established three-step explanation of skill acquisition in the martial arts and arts: "[[Shuhari]].

- First, follow the pattern. This means to be faithful to the original method.
    - In this process, knowledge about methods that was outside of you is internalized within you.
    - By actually using the method, you can accumulate your own experience.

- Then the type [[spontaneously bursts]].
    - > If the disciple learns to observe, he will break the rule himself. Separation is the combination of these two, and also the protection of the two.
        - Kawakami Fubaku (1719-1807), founder of the Edo Senke school of tea ceremony
    - Compare to programming:
        - First, try entering the code as it is written in the textbook (Mamoru).
        - Eventually, "What would happen if we changed this part?" will naturally arise.
        - As you try it out and learn from the results, you will be able to write programs that are not just a copy of the code in the textbook.

- The word "detachment" is difficult to explain in words alone, although those who have experienced it will say, "Oh, that's it.
    - It is not "the teacher told me to do X, so I have to do X" (mamoru) or "the teacher told me to do X, but I dare to do Y" (shakai), but rather "I think it is good to do Y, so I will do it".
    - A bird's-eye view of the "defenses" and the "breakthroughs" that are well understood but not biased toward one or the other
        - [[dialectics]] It's also a bit of a [[dialectics]] look.

- Those who insist that we should be "faithful" are those who have not yet reached the "breaking point."
    - Or [[Ritualization of Means]], [[Businessization of Methodology]].
- Those who insist that "you don't have to be loyal."
    - If you're assuming "first follow the pattern," you're making a decent argument.
    - If you neglect "first of all, follow the pattern," then you are a person who cannot even "follow" the pattern.


Whether this idea is unusual in the world?
- Because of the weak influence of [[monotheism]] thought in Japan, the idea that righteousness is transformed over time was stronger than the idea that righteousness is given to man from outside.
