John Rawls' focus on "[[careful deliberation]]" was influenced by the political and social conditions in the United States and Western society in the mid-20th century. Rawls addressed the challenge of how to build a just and stable society in a society rife with inequality and injustice.

In it, he positioned "[[right]]" as a fundamental principle of society and emphasized the importance of deliberation as [[a process for]] people with different positions and values to form a fair consensus. In particular, Rolls used the concept of "[[veil of ignorance]]" to propose a way of thinking about social principles without being influenced by individual interests or privileges, and this is the foundation of "[[justice as fairness]]. This is the foundation of "justice as fairness.

Rolls' thought was also strongly influenced by [[his criticism of utilitarianism]]. [[utilitarianism]] is the principle of pursuing the happiness of the greatest number, but Rawls pointed out that this may ignore the rights of minorities and the weak. His view of deliberation is seen as a means by which diverse voices can be respected and a fair agreement reached.

Thus, criticism of [[social inequality]] and utilitarianism, and the pursuit of [[fair consensus building]] are some of the factors that led Rawls to emphasize deliberation.
