title: "Unexpected things happened and things didn't work out, it's not my fault."
---

I did what I did last year, [Unexpected things happened and things didn't work out, it's not my fault.
    - Doing the same as [[PREVENTION]] is my [[area of responsibility]], and I believe that the result is not my area of responsibility.
    - It happened during the civilization collapse phase of [[Atlas shrugs]].
    - I'm doing the same thing, but it didn't work out because of the weather, [[not my fault]].
    - I'm doing the same thing, but I didn't get the materials that were supposed to arrive, no fault of my own.
        - And then the next processor says the same thing again because that trouble didn't get manufactured as planned.

- [[Expect the Unexpected to Happen]]
- I have a plan B in place in advance for a wide variety of problems.
- If something really "[[unexpected]]" happens, don't use it as an excuse.
    - If there are no results because of the "unexpected," that's [[my responsibility]].

These two mentalities seem incompatible.

- [[It's not my fault.]]
[[You didn't see it coming.]]
