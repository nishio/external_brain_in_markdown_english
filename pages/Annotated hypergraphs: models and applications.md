An annotated [[hypergraph]] is a model in which each node of a hypergraph is assigned role information. The main contents are as follows
- We present the definition of an annotated hypergraph and construct its configuration model (null model) and a sampling method using the [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] method.
- We extended traditional network analysis methods for annotated hypergraphs, such as [[Role Density]], [[Assortativity]], [[Centrality]], and [[Modularity]].
- We applied the proposed method to six real data sets, including the Enron email data set, and showed that new insights can be gained by considering node role information.
- Future prospects include extensions to time-series data and support for more complex hyper-edge structures.

This study can be said to provide a new framework for modeling and analyzing network structure by utilizing metadata inherent in the data.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>An annotated hypergraph consists of the following four elements

- Node set V
- Labeled edge set E (a multiset, a subset of V)
- A finite set of labels M
- Function to assign labels to pairs of nodes and edges (v, e) ℓ: V × E → M

In other words, in addition to the node and edge information in a normal hypergraph, an annotated hypergraph is created by labeling each node with its "role" in joining the edges.
For example, when expressing co-authorship relationships in academic papers, labels such as first author, middle author, and last author can be assigned to the roles of nodes (authors) at each edge (paper).
Thus, the annotated hypergraph is a model that can flexibly incorporate metadata and describe rich information that cannot be expressed by simple graphs or hypergraphs. It is essential to design appropriate role labels for the data.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>There are both manual and mechanical methods of creating annotated hypergraph data.
Manual methods:
- This is a method in which experts with a good understanding of the nature of the data define and annotate node roles based on domain knowledge.
- While high-quality data can be obtained, it is difficult to apply to large data sets.

Mechanical methods:
- Natural Language Processing Methods
    - This method extracts entities (nodes) and their relationships (edges) from text data and automatically assigns each entity's contextual role as a label.
    - For example, the roles of authors (first author, middle author, last author) can be inferred from the textual data of academic papers.
- Rule-Based Methods
    - This method defines rules for automatically assigning node roles based on structural characteristics of the data.
    - For example, in the case of e-mail data, roles such as sender, recipient, and CC can be assigned automatically from the information in the e-mail header.
- Machine Learning Methods
    - It is a method of building a model that predicts the role of a node by supervised or unsupervised learning using node and edge features as input.
    - Applicable to large data sets, but requires a certain amount of supervised data.

These mechanical methods can be used to efficiently create large annotated hypergraph data. However, it is important to select the appropriate method depending on the nature and purpose of the target data. In addition, data quality can be expected to be improved by combining manual checking.
