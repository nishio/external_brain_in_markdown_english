- [[hiragana]] is obviously optimized for vertical writing so that the final stroke is toward the upper left corner of the lower character. But in fact, since it is often used in horizontal writing in modern times, shouldn't [[redesign]] be necessary so that the final stroke is toward the upper left of the left character?
