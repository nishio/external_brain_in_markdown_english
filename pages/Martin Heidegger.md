title: "Martin Heidegger"
---

- The concept of [[dwell]] in [[Heidegger]], I looked it up because it seemed relevant to what I wanted to think about
- At least we know it's "Bauen Wohnen Denken".
- I finally figured out when it was made on the English Wikipedia. I wonder if a Japanese translation is available - I haven't found one so far.
- It was in this one, which apparently means it is too short to be a stand-alone book: [[What is technology?]].

[Martin Heidegger - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger)
    - [[Martin Heidegger.]] (1889-1976) was a German philosopher. [[Heidegger.]]
- February 1927 "Existence and Time" (age 38)
- 1951 "Building Dwelling Thinking" (age 62)
- Some claim that there was a major ideological shift "the turn" (die Kehre).
    - Various perspectives
        - Poetry and Technology
        - Dasein ([Dasein - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasein)) to language
            - > an emphasis on language from a previous emphasis on Dasein in Being and Time eight years earlier
        - Formulation of the famous phrase "language speaks" in a 1950 lecture
            - These words were later published in the 1959 essay collection Unterwegs zur Sprache and included in the 1971 English book Poetry, Language, Thought
        - Shift from living (being) in the world to doing (time) in the world
            - This aspect, especially the 1951 essay "[[Building, Dwelling, Thinking]]"
- Some people claim that there was no Kehre.
