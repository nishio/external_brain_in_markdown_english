[New puppet show "With Mom" also features genderless characters "It's the times," viewers agree: Chunichi Sports, Tokyo Chunichi Sports](https://www.chunichi.co.jp/article/419543)
> On April 16, NHK announced that the puppet show on E-television's toddler program "Okaasan to tosho" will be replaced in April. A new "Fantane! will begin, featuring "Mimomo," a kappa girl, "Yakoro," a gourd child with no gender, and "Lucita," a lion boy.

> First of all, Lucita has come to Fantane Island from a distant island and does not yet know much about the island, which reflects the existence of children with overseas roots and the cultural differences that arise. Yakoro has no parents and lives with her eight siblings, who help each other out, which also reflects the fact that there are children from various family backgrounds.
>  Furthermore, yakoro is a plant, so it does not have a gender. In addition, since yakoro is a plant, it does not have a gender. "There are not many episodes in which the viewpoint of boyishness or girlishness itself is mentioned, but even in stories that refer to such things, yakoro can freely express its opinions based on the idea of being neither a boy nor a girl, as yakoro. Some children may be able to relate to that.
>  Also, Lucita, a boy, dreams of being a ballet dancer. In today's Japan, some children may feel a little embarrassed to say that a boy has a dream of being a ballet dancer. But I was conscious of the fact that they are free to have any kind of dream. By the way, Mimomo hasn't decided what she wants to be, and she said, 'I want to be anything! I can be anything! I can be anything!
