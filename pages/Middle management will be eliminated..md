title: "Middle management will be eliminated."
---

- [[postcapitalist society]]
> An organizational reform to improve productivity is to eliminate most of the management hierarchy. In an orchestra, there are often more than 100 musicians playing together. But there is only one management, or conductor. There will be a departure from the tradition of rewarding performance with promotions to middle management. Organizations will have few such positions in the future.

- This was an eye-opener.
- Most people think that "a book about management" is a book about how to survive in middle management. That's what I thought at first.
- That's why I didn't think I had anything to do with Drucker's management books or anything like that.
- I told my friend that I did not want to do management and wished someone would manage me well, and he pointed out that "unless you learn to manage yourself, you cannot judge whether you are being managed well or not. I started reading the book.
- And then I understood. Drucker's Management is not a know-how book for middle managers.
- He argues that middle management will be eliminated.

> Management was defined as "taking responsibility for the work of one's subordinates." This is the definition that many will still draw in their minds. The correct definition is "one who is responsible for the application of knowledge and its work.
