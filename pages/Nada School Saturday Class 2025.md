question
- Isn't there a possibility that the AI could skew it when it collects the opinions of many people and puts them together?
    - Of course there is that.
        - Related question: is there a bias in the LLM?
        - Diverse biases by LLMs.
                - [[Ask Qarasu-14B a question]]
    - But is there no bias if it is put together by a human being? Of course, humans have biases.
    - So this is not an "AI or human" issue.
    - Issues that should be resolved by creating mechanisms such as making the process open and verifiable by a third party
- Not all people can think and speak out about politics, what do we do with those who don't?
    - Some radical views like [[unconscious data democracy]] are not in favor of it.
    - The current lack of opportunities for people to have their opinions heard and to feel good about expressing them is the reason why the ability to think and express opinions is not developed.
        - Minors in particular do not have the right to vote, and when they come of age, they are suddenly told they should vote, which is absurd.
        - Taiwan has created opportunities for students to voice their opinions from the student stage through systems such as JOIN.
            - Taiwan case study to be written later
                - [[Shin Tokyo 2050 Broad Listening]]
    - Social networking sites stand out for their radical opinions.
        - Most people don't want to argue with radicals.
        - The [[pro-social media]] mindset is designed to draw attention to "[[Bridging Opinions]]" that are favored by those in different opinion clusters.
            - [[Bridging Bonus]]
- Influence the international community?
    - Of course, the elimination of language barriers is significant
- If the generating AI creates a manifesto based on "what opinion will be received by the citizens", won't all parties be the same?
    - When they gather in large clusters, the differences disappear.
    - When you visualize it, there are clusters that are not represented by a political party even at this point in time.
    - Small clusters
        - With 1% you can become a political party.
        - Going for the majority.
        - red ocean
    - Everyone should be going to the big cluster, not the other way around.
    - In the long run, it's unclear whether party politics will continue to feel the same way as it does now in the first place.
        - compulsory adherence to a party decision
- It may not be stable if the support base changes from one place to another.
    - It wouldn't change a colossal amount.
