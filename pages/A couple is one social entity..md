title: "A couple is one social entity."
---

In Europe and the U.S., the idea that "a couple is one social entity" seems to be stronger than in Japan.

In ancient times, in Japan, "husband and wife were one social entity," but the woman was the shadow of the man.
- International Encyclopedia Britannica, Commentary on the Encyclopedia of Minor Entries
    - > San-Cong
    - > An ancient Chinese proverb about a woman's life. It is also found in the Rituals and Etiquettes. A woman is supposed to "obey her parents when she is young, her husband when she marries, and her children when she dies (or grows old)", showing the subordination of women in the family. A principle of female morality derived from male-centered [[Confucianism]] morality.

On the other hand, English has the expression better half.
- You see yourself and the other person as "one" and the other person as "the better half".

I traced the origin of this idea to Plato's [feast - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/饗宴)
- >  In primitive times, there were three kinds of humans: male, female, and male-female (bisexual), all of which were back-to-back and bisexual (male-male, female-female, and male-female).
- > They challenged the gods with their strength and spirit, so Zeus had them cut in half and their faces turned the other way, and the scar on the cut surface is the belly button.
- > This is how we humans, as half-bodies, came to seek each other, and the longing and pursuit of that former perfection is what is called erose.
- In other words, the idea that "what was originally one has been cut in half" and "that is why we seek each other in order to return to perfection.
- It's not limited to "men and women."

This difference may lead to differences in the treatment of female spouses in Asia and the West.
