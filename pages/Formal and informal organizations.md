For organizations that are "[[closed]]" (have barriers to participation), [[Two types.]]
- Formal organizations that can be observed from the outside, such as a "corporation."
- Informal organizations whose existence itself is invisible except to those who belong to the organization

[[Closed informal organizations]] are [[less exposed]], so we tend to think of "closed formal" in terms of closed organizations

For example, "a group of friends who belong to different companies but have a strong relationship of trust" have different resources and knowledge from each other, so they can be a win-win relationship by accommodating each other. This is a closed informal organization.

Creating closed informal organizations that straddle the walls of formal organizations is useful to promote [[knowledge circulation]] and increase opportunities for [[new combinations]].
