title: "chaperon problem"
---

The problem of [[clustering]] of protein [[interaction]] graphs is made difficult by the presence of proteins that stick to everything.
[https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/シャペロン](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/シャペロン)

- There are cases where [[distance]] does not satisfy the property of distance, and it is troublesome.

The [[Link is small]] in [[Scrapbox]] could be interpreted to mean "don't make chaperones".
