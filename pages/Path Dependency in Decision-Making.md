title: "Path Dependency in Decision-Making"

> How the set of decisions people face in any given situation is constrained by the decisions they made and events they experienced in the past, even if past situations are no longer relevant.

- [[Path Dependency]]
    - [[Path Dependent]]

In the context of [[Organizational Knowledge Acquisition]], this term is used to describe the suppression of acquiring knowledge B, which is not clearly related to "the current business," compared to knowledge A, which is evidently related.

- From the perspective of individual members of an organization, when engaging in [[Knowledge Acquisition]] of knowledge B, there is a "[[Persuasion Cost]]" involved in convincing [[Decision-Makers]] to allocate resources like time to knowledge B.
- The acquisition of knowledge A incurs a lower cost.
- This cost difference biases individuals to choose knowledge A as the acquisition target.
- This results in a situation where only members with knowledge A exist within the organization, and no members possess knowledge B.
- From the organization's overall perspective, [[Knowledge Diversity]] is lost, leading to suboptimal outcomes.

There is an argument that this is the principle behind the occurrence of [[Disruptive Innovation]].

- [[Newly Emerged Knowledge]] is knowledge not used in current operations.
- Existing companies, due to path dependency, cannot acquire new knowledge, while emerging companies do not have this bias, leading to a [[Knowledge Gap]] where existing companies lose out.

Examples of Countermeasures:

- [[Lowering Persuasion Costs]]
    - > For example, if an engineer wants to study Rust, they can purchase a Rust book even if they are not using Rust in their current duties.

    - By making such declarations in advance, the psychological barrier for individuals can be lowered.
- [[Belonging to Multiple Organizations]]
    - [[Bringing in External Elements Not Present in the Company]]
    - [[There Are Two Information Inflow Paths into the Organization]]
    - When belonging to multiple organizations, "current businesses" also become multiple.
    - There can be negative cases for individuals: [[Company Boundaries and Individual Evaluation]]
- Establishing a [[Research Department]]
    - Create a department responsible for the acquisition and creation of knowledge.
    - The persuasion cost related to members' knowledge acquisition activities is reduced.
        - Because [[Knowledge Acquisition Activities Themselves Are Work]]
