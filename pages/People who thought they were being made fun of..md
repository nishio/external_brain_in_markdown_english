title: "People who thought they were being made fun of."
---

- The person who thinks he has been made an [[idiot]] tries hard to show that he is not an idiot by saying difficult things, but he is incoherent because he is [[cobbling together]] a [[not a well understood concept]], and as a result, he effectively shows that he is an idiot. He is effectively demonstrating that he is an idiot. Hilarious.

How can I avoid being in the opposite position?
