title: "People Confining Themselves to Specialization"

> [potato4d](https://twitter.com/potato4d/status/1655463600667099137) It's not just about being a perfectionist; the technical assertions are becoming more [[radicalized]]. This is because the wind of the engineer bubble is shifting slightly, and those who used to say things like "talking about work skills outside of engineering deviates from specialty and is wrong" are starting to feel uneasy. It seems they need to strengthen their assertions to maintain their value.
> [potato4d](https://twitter.com/potato4d/status/1655464085985841154) There is a certain group of people who found it emotionally easier and naturally optimal to assert "I'm strong as an engineer" simply because being an engineer was valuable. They are merely trying to survive by changing the direction of their assertions without altering their consciousness.

That's why there's been talk for a long time about the need to become [[T-shaped individuals]] or [[Π-shaped individuals]]. However, people who confine themselves to their current [[specialization]] find it difficult when faced with [[environmental changes]], and their assertions become [[extreme]] to [[justify]] their decisions.

The process of moving from "[[specialist]] → [[T-shaped individuals]] → [[Π-shaped individuals]]" is inherently continuous.
