# First, a quick review of [Plurality
.
- [Plurality: Technology for Collaborative Diversity and Democracy - RadicalxChange]](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/plurality-technology-for-collaborative-diversity-and-democracy/#日本語)
    - [[Audrey Tang]], [[E. Glen Weyl]] 2022-09-15
    - > [[Technology and democracy are at war]]. Technology is increasing authoritarian surveillance and eroding democratic institutions. Meanwhile, democracy is fighting back with restrictive regulations and public sector conservatism. This conflict is inevitable. In this context, we have chosen to invest in [[anti-democratic technologies]] such as artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrencies.
    - At that time, he said "[[technology and democracy are]] at war" and "[[AI is]] an anti-democratic technology."
    - This was followed by the release of [[ChatGPT]] on 11/30
- [/nishio/Plurality Tokyo Keynote from Audrey Tang](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/Plurality Tokyo Keynote from Audrey Tang)
    - [[Audrey Tang]] 2023-04-12
    - > In recent months, the rapid development of the [[language model]] has raised concerns about [[existential risk]] and raised the question of imminent [[singularity]].
    - > However, I am convinced that "[[assistant artificial intelligence]]" (assistive intelligence) will free up our time to pursue more meaningful goals.
    - > The creation of this speech was also aided by the language model. This is the power of [[transformative technology]]. And this power [[will have]] an irreversible impact on human society. Just as the Internet did.
    - Using ChatGPT, a concrete application of AI rather than vague "AI," [[Audrey Tang]] is convinced that "assistant artificial intelligence is beneficial
    - On the other hand, he believes that "this power will bring about irreversible changes in society."
    - > ... As transformative technologies emerge, diverse communities create their own patterns of use to achieve their goals.
    - > Whereas [[dictatorships]] use technology as a means of control, we democratize technology and strive for plurality or [[cooperative diversity]] ([[collaborative diversity]]).
    - Diverse communities will explore patterns of how to use this power.
    - Dictatorships will use this power as a means of control.
    - Let's make our community a people of this power and [Diversity to collaborate

# [[Democratic Inputs to AI]]
- On 5/25, OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, the "headquarters of AI," announced
- OpenAI "supports experiments to improve democratic processes."
- Total $1,000,000.00 ...... One hundred and ten thousand yen?
- What is this? [[democratic process]]`? Why would OpenAI pay 100 million for this?`

# Objective of "Democratic Input to AI"
.
- AI has far-reaching economic and social implications
- It is not right that [[decision-making]] of "what AI should be" is done by "[[a]] few people" such as the management of a for-profit company.
    - Should be shaped by "[[Diverse perspectives]]" that reflect [public interest (e.g., public good)
- Support experimental projects to take the first steps in this direction
- Recruit a [[team]] to develop a [[proof of concept]] of a [[democratic process]] that can answer the question, "What are the rules that AI systems should follow?"
- We (OpenAI) want to learn from these experiments and use them as the basis for a [[more global, more ambitious process]].
    - We hope to explore issues related to [[decision-making]] and build [[new democratic tools]] that can inform decision-making more directly in the future.

- Sounds really interesting, doesn't it?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon' alt='/nishio/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - It would be interesting to participate in "[[an]] attempt for the future of AI" that OpenAI is flagging!
    - [[want to be involved in creating]] [the basis for a more global, more ambitious process!

# Applied!!!!!!!!
- I applied for the project with Mr. Seki of [[Code for Japan]] and Mr. Shiramatsu of [[Code for Nagoya]]: [[Introduction of founding members]].
- We'll know the results on 7/15.
- Normally we don't talk about this kind of thing in the undecided stage, but as we started planning the project, the project members themselves started to get excited and said, "[[It's]] interesting, so let's do it regardless of whether it's accepted or not.
- We are already active and accepting applications for participation in the project.


# [[the basis for a more global, more ambitious process]]
- In a word, we want to realize "[[Global Deliberations]]".
- Roads and other infrastructure were closely coupled to the physical land, so it was reasonable for a physically localized "country" to oversee them
- AI is a global infrastructure, so countries are not the proper governing unit, new governing technology is needed.
    - (I think many people would agree with this story if it were read as "Ethereum is a global infrastructure...")
- > (Audrey 2023)These communities may have different norms and cultures, but by clarifying common values, they can all be thoughtful and deliberative and foster an interoperable copresence.
    - Each community has different norms and cultures for global deliberations
    - In order for everyone to deliberate on a global scale, we need to acknowledge the existence of different cultures and identify the common values within them.

# Repeat SF prototyping and Polis-like system
.
- How this project works
- ![image](https://scrapbox.io/files/6499b485af32bb001bf19a81.png)
- For a deliberative discussion, we need to share our prerequisite knowledge first.
    - But even if you prepare a list of knowledge, most people won't read it.
    - Need to induce a "desire to read."
    - Sharing a worldview through science fiction shorts would be a good idea (hypothetical).
- Gathering and visualizing reader feedback on stories generates new ideas and creates new stories
    - This iteration is repeated for gradual improvement [[iterative structure]].
- All of these things accumulated and as a result...

# [[Japanese cultural AI]] can be done.
- AI can be created using a dataset of thoughts and emotions of Japanese speakers.
    - This AI will be available worldwide, allowing people to speak in their own languages
    - This AI facilitates [[cross-cultural understanding]] beyond language barriers and is a prerequisite for [[Global Deliberations]].
    - [[the basis for a more global, more ambitious process]]
- Many people may associate the term "Japanese culture" with classical culture, but the first thing I want you to imagine is...
    - [[Doraemon]]
        - A [[science fiction]] animated series that has been running for 44 years.
        - No one in Japan has ever heard of Doraemon, and the recognition of Doraemon is spreading quite well around the world.
    - Doraemon is creating a "[[AI is your friend]]" worldview.
        - The antithesis of the Hollywood-style "AI trying to destroy humanity" story
        - Those who envision a bad future based on the "AI trying to destroy humanity" storyline try to create legally binding regulations on AI.
- Another keyword that came up from the project participants: the
    - [[mourning god]]
        - A human-made tool, after long use, becomes a soul and eventually becomes [[god]].
        - Future image of LLM becoming wise and personable.
        - People in monotheistic cultures recoil at the idea of calling it "God."
        - The Japanese concept of "God" is quite different from that of monotheistic religions.
        - Japan has only 1% Christianity, while the U.S. has almost 70%.
    - AI is a tool, an argument that should be regulated to prevent it from acquiring capabilities comparable to humans.
        - God made man.
        - God is a higher being than man.
        - Man created AI.
        - You think AI could rival humans?
            - "The created can line up with the Creator" would be a challenge to the concept of "God is a higher being than man," irreverence!
            - Man has done God's work of "making man."
                - It is ethically undesirable, as is the cloning of human beings!
        - To make [[Global Deliberations]] possible, we need to understand each other's cultural differences.
        - Action is needed to help the people of the world understand the concept of doraemon and attached mourning gods.

# epistemological pluralism
.
- [Why I Am a Pluralist - RadicalxChange](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/why-i-am-a-pluralist/)
    - E. Glen Weyl, February 10, 2022
- > There are two aspects to pluralism, institutional and epistemological.
- Plurality of religion (≈worldview) and language
    - >  [[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]] ... It is obvious that some languages are better suited to express certain thoughts than others.
    - In order to think, it is necessary to attach a [[Name]], which is a [[handle]] for manipulation, to the [[concept]], which is the [[thought component]].
    - But these "names" differ by language and culture.
    - For example, the thought "[A democratic process is a process that creates consensus among as many people as possible.
        - If you try to translate this into English, the question is how to translate "[[convincing]]".
        - The fact that there is no translation that translates easily means that translating it will result in a loss of thought
    - Trying to unify these hinders "[[Plural Thinking]]"
    - It would be nice if Japanese speakers could deliberate in Japanese and then share it with the rest of the world through AI.
        - In other words, [[Japanese Culture AI]]!

# Technical feasibility of [[Japanese cultural AI]]
- It may seem like a pipe dream, but it is highly technically feasible.
- First, they use Scrapbox as a "place for communication".
    - Anything can be written here, including generated stories, impressions, and other ramblings.
- Realized implementations
    - Export data from Scrapbox once a day with Github Actions
    - Divided into chunks of 500 tokens and vector embedded with OpenAI Embedding API and stored in Qdrant
    - Web service that enables vector search with Qdrant is already available: [[Omoikane Vector Search]].
    - Now we just need to create a connection between the English UI and the ChatGPT API, and we will have a [[Minimum Viable Product]] that can be released to the world.

# [[be part of a larger story]]
- Issue [[Proof of Participation NFT]] / [[Proof of Contribution NFT]] using MintRally
    - This will prove to people around the world that "I participated/contributed to the establishment of Japanese cultural AI".
- There is an idea to use [[Hypercerts]] and others as a test bed for [[Retrospective Funding]] if adopted (from [[halsk]]).
    - [Hypercert: A new way to fund public goods Primitives - Fracton Ventures](https://mirror.xyz/0xF5CA53792C47e3a0792380292D15c894097015fF/_HTDmPnphXXVdHVsKPJghVoVdsSVR72cHolcT9cbINE)

# now in open beta!!!
- What one participant had to say
    - > New[[MMOTRPG]]の[[オープンベータ]]だと思っている<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/tsuzumik/icon' alt='tsuzumik.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - [[Acceptance or rejection has not yet been determined]], but we are prototyping the project itself in open beta!
    - Currently 30 people are participating.
    - Of course, you are welcome to join us after the adoption on July 15!
    - I want to recruit people from different communities to gather [Diverse perspectives
    - I think there are a lot of people in this community who are interested in improving [[the democratic process]] and [the methodology of deliberation
    - If this project becomes an opportunity to connect with people who are strong in AI and other technologies, it will surely create an interesting future.
