title: "Vague task execution"
---

I thought again that I am not good at executing [[vague tasks]], either.


- As for lifehack tips,
    - Create a "[[quiet environment]]" where the Internet and other people's stimuli do not enter.
    - Start the timer with a time of 10 minutes and
    - Thinking as you write out your thoughts
    - Do not start any other work until the timer goes off, and concentrate only on "thinking about the theme you have chosen.
    - 〜It is often effective to do something that feels like ~.


- It's too unclear to call it "[[task to be done now]]" and I'm going to put it off again.
    - So, I think it would be a good idea to do the following task: "Take 10 minutes to think about it carefully and write down everything that comes to your mind.
- → Write it down.
    - →I can't write.
        - →I visualized [[not thinking about specifics]].
                - Maybe this is what [[New Keichobot]] should do.
            - [[formerly Keichobot]] was designed to ask questions about "important but highly embodied concepts.
                - [[Embodiment System]]
