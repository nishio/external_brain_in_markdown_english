title: "Move Switching"

Q: I feel that the pattern of behavior has changed since about 2022~3

A:
In my mind, it's verbalized as "I switched from [[a la working adult move]] to [[master's student move]].
The trigger was [[LLM Unemployed]].
- [[2023-04-10 LLM Meetup]]
    - I saw people quit their jobs to tinker with LLM.
    - I felt I needed to take more risks myself.
    - On the other hand, I didn't have a business idea that I wanted to put all my energy into, and the decision to "quit my job to raise time to tinker with LLM" was not feasible for me, who spends about 90% of my time on discretionary work in the first place.
- Two days later, [[Plurality Tokyo]].
    - I felt that broad listening was a concept that bridged three points: the intellectual productivity improvements I have been making, the LLM that is hot right now, and Audrey Tan's recent activities.
        - When I introduced myself to Audrey at [[Manazuru 2023-05-13]], I talked about the idea that broad listening is [human augmentation
    - Later, [[name-your-price conference]] was held as an outgrowth of Plurality Tokyo.
