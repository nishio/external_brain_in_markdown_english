As an engineer, it is actually quite manageable to commit to implementation work in English just by being enthusiastic, but as my position, role, and responsibilities increase, I feel that English for "convincing people, gaining their trust, making decisions, and moving people and companies" has a completely different nature. It is not only vocabulary and grammar, but also behavior, negotiation, communication, positioning, and so many other factors. Lately I have been hitting a wall and struggling a lot, and I am trying my best to study and improve while making a lot of mistakes. I hope there will be a fun world after overcoming the obstacles.
>  Thank you very much for your hard work. I support you in your next challenge!
