title: "do not pursue those who leave, but choose those who come to you"
---

There is an idiom, "[[do not reject those who come to you, and do not chase those who leave you]]."
I don't mind not chasing those who leave, but I think we should be selective about those who come.

We don't chase those who leave because we prefer to see unprofitable communities shrink and fewer operational resources consumed. [[Make a lot of them and let them disappear naturally.]]
- [[choose what comes to you]] to prevent a beneficial community from being diluted and losing value.

relevance
    - [[gated community]]
    - [[Why do social networking sites rise and fall?]]
    - [[Is it right not to pursue those who leave?]]
