A gridlock economy refers to a situation in which economic activity is stalled because many different rights holders cannot move forward without mutual agreement. This concept is particularly seen in areas where rights are highly divided and complex, such as [[intellectual property rights]] and [[real estate rights]]. Gridlock can impede the efficient use of resources and the development of new technologies, and ultimately hinder overall economic growth.

Causes of Gridlock Economy
- [Over-division of rights: The fragmentation of rights and the large number of rights holders make projects and transactions difficult because everyone must agree.
    - [[information asymmetry]] : Because information is not shared among rights holders, it is often unclear who has what rights or what the necessary terms of a transaction are.
    - Increased [[negotiation cost]]: The number of parties involved increases the cost of negotiating to reach an agreement.
- Increased complexity of regulations and laws: Increased complexity of laws and regulations can make it difficult to introduce new businesses and technologies.

Impact of Gridlocked Economy
- Delayed innovation: slow development of new technologies and services reduces the competitiveness of the economy as a whole.
- Inefficient use of resources: resources are not allocated to their optimal uses, resulting in wasted costs.
- Slower economic growth: Delays in innovation and inefficient use of resources hinder economic growth.

solution
The following approaches are possible solutions to the gridlocked economy problem.
- Reform the legal and institutional framework: develop a legal framework to reduce division of rights and lower negotiation costs.
- Facilitate information sharing: Develop a platform to facilitate information sharing among rights holders and streamline the negotiation process.
- Use of Alternative Dispute Resolution: Establish a mechanism for quick and efficient resolution in the event of difficult negotiations.

The gridlock economy is a deep-seated problem in many modern economies. To solve it, governments, businesses, and individuals must work together to create a more flexible and efficient system.
