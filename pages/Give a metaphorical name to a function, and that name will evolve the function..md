### digest
.
We advocate the use of metaphors as names for functions and the idea that the names facilitate the evolution of the function.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The note is related to the fragments "Metaphor First and Explanation Later", "Concepts and Metaphors", and "Eugene Gendlin's Metaphor Concept". These fragments are deeply connected to the subject matter of the note in terms of the important role metaphor plays in thinking and concept formation.

### deep thinking
Metaphors can be powerful tools for forming and understanding abstract concepts and new ideas. It allows us to relate unknown events and complex concepts to known events and simple concepts. From this perspective, the use of metaphors in the names of functions has the potential to deepen our understanding of those functions and facilitate their evolution.

### summary of thoughts
Metaphors are powerful tools that facilitate the understanding and evolution of new concepts.
