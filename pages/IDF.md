title: "IDF"
---

- inverse document frequency
- Inverse of the word's document frequency [[df]] ([[document frequency]])
- Used in [[tf-idf]].
    - It is common to take log
    - Implications are unclear.
        - Some people say "it's the amount of information," but I don't see the point in multiplying it by log(TF).
