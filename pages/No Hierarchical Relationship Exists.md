In relation to [[Axes Are Not One-Dimensional]], when dealing with two or more dimensions, hierarchical relationships do not hold.

I felt a sense of discomfort when I came across the expression, "Mr. A is an excellent person, so from Mr. A's perspective, everyone around him is inferior."

This essentially means, "It's [[Implicitly Assuming One-Dimensionality]], but no matter how you look at it, it's not one-dimensional."
