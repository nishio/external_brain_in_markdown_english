- The concept of broad listening is a technique that assists in listening to the opinions of many people.
- Being able to summarize the main points makes it easier to handle large numbers of opinions.
- When you can handle diverse opinions, you can move away from a localized view and see things more broadly.
- Feeling that the opinions based on them have come back to you gives you a sense that your opinion has been heard.
- In broad listening, it is important to hear from at least as many people as possible.
- However, when the number of people and the volume of opinions is too large, it is practically difficult to deal with each person's opinion.
- Hence, there is little need to read 100% of everyone's opinions, but to summarize what is common and to listen to the least important opinions.
- The next thing to do is to learn practical methods of broad listening.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>If you have a small number of people, you can ask them normally, but if you have, say, 100 people, you have to ask 100 times more than you can talk, and it becomes practically impossible.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What "quantity" is that "quantity"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>If 50 out of 100 people have similar opinions, but each one is shown as a separate opinion, that's 50 times as much.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that "quantity"?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is that "quantity"?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It's preferable to read all of them because if you don't read them all, you'll be biased.

- How do you know this "opinion"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Do you know your opinion ex post facto? No. Sometimes you know after the fact by output in response to the stimulus of someone else's opinion.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to "opinion" for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Too many can't be caught, so they need to be compressed down to the amount each person can catch.
