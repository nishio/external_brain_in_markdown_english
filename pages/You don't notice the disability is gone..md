- 1: Trying to go from a certain start S to a goal G, but hitting a [[disability]] on the way [[change of policy]], and [[compromise]] at a different goal G'.
- 2: Think it would be smoother if you changed the policy from the start instead of changing it after you hit a bump.
- 3: The obstacles are gone with the passage of time, but without realizing it, we assume the "smooth path to the compromise goal" is the right one and repeat it.

This is the kind of conversation we're having in a situation where (1) is no longer experienced and (2) is being repeated.
- conversation
    - New person: "Why don't you go straight to G? Why do you go to G' instead of G?"
    - Old people "have been doing it all along!"
- When new people try out their ideas,
    - I could easily go straight ahead and get to G and be like, "What was that all about?" (3)
    - Or the obstacle hasn't gone away again, and you hit it the same way as (1) and say "I see...".
- Those who choose to repeat themselves, convinced by "I've been doing it all along," will be extensions of (2).

- [[I saw it in a dream.]]

- [[Principle of generation of old people]], I thought, but this is a principle that makes organizations stick to inefficient methods rather than individual behavior.
    - [[organizational adherence]]
    - [[Organizational Inertia]]

- [[technical debt]], but it is also likely to include code that, under the circumstances at the time it was created, had to be implemented by bending the ideal G and using G' or straight and straightforward implementation, but which is no longer necessary due to subsequent changes in circumstances.
