title: "Kegon Summary"
---

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472422079593336847): I think I understand the concept of "[Kegon (sect of Buddhism)", so I will try to explain it to verify my understanding.
> First of all, this "Hua Yan" is not only about "[[Avatamska sutra]]" but also about the Hua Yan Sutra, which was born in India and developed in China [[Hua Yan philosophy]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472422454174044163): The difference is that the Kegon Sutra described a process in the world W1 that is different from the material world W0, whereas the Kegon philosophy considered the process of going from W0 to W1, gaining awareness there, and then returning further to W W0 and then return to W0.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472424144755392513): With respect to this material world W0, things are either "there" or "not there". What "is" continues to be for a while, then breaks down and becomes "not," and when it is gone, it remains "not" forever. This is the view of the world that we, who were born and raised in the material world, have unconsciously, naive physics.
> On the other hand, the Kegon Sutra doubted it.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472425817242497027): Both the Indian-derived Hua Yan Sutra and the ancient Chinese [[Zhuangzi]] had in common the idea that it is not a dichotomy of being and not being. From this comes the thought about what is beyond the opposition of "is" and "is not.
- [[To be or not to be is a false dichotomy]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472426876237131782): In addition, this "what is beyond the opposition of being and not being" is not "what happens if we assume such a thing" but "I saw such a thing when I meditated, and I became such a thing". I saw such a thing when I was meditating and I became such a person.
- I use the term "style of questioning assumptions" in the sense of [[methodic doubt]] or [[critical philosophy]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472427528472379396): I've been using easy words to describe "there is" and "there is not", but then when I say "there is something beyond the conflict between "there is" and "there is not"", the second "there is I should split "there is" a little higher resolution because the "there is" is confusing because of the "there is". There is "[[immaterial entity]]" that transcends the opposition between "[[material existence]]" and "[[non-existence of matter]]."

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472428435448680449): As for this "immaterial existence," we moderns may be disappointed and say, "Oh, you were talking about something that sounded so difficult, but is that what you're talking about?" But this is because we are overwhelmingly [[man of the future]] compared to them, and there were no [[VR Goggles]] or even black and white [[projectors]] in their time (fairly new ones invented around 1900).

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472430940857434112): to go back a bit and talk a bit more about the physical laws of the material world, "material existence" [[occupies space]] so you can't have more than one thing in the same place. A material entity can only be one. There can only be one material being, so if more than one person wants it, they will fight over it. This is the naive worldview of people born and raised in the material world.
- [[Competitiveness]]

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472432439297716225): How did you feel "immaterial existence" in the age without VR goggles, first of all, you probably "saw a very realistic image created by your brain". When you think about it, it makes sense to do "adjust your posture, breathe, don't think, and ignore all stimuli from the outside world" as a means to see it. I'm creating an [[immersive environment]].
    - [[(1) body, breath, and mind conditioning]] = the basis of [Zen (Buddhism)

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472435714302562307): So, people who repeatedly "do a full dive into the VR space created by their own brains" in the days when there was no TV, realize that "this thing that appears and disappears and exists in the same position They realize, "This thing that appears and disappears in the same position, looks a lot like a material existence, but it is something else. Then they think, "Then what is this?" Then they think, "Then what is this?

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472437209081200641): After thinking about it, "There is a Something that transcends the conflict between material existence and non-existence, and a part of it is manifested in this way. And then you realize, "I am a part of it." And then he realizes, "I am a part of it.
> This is a big difference from the idea of [[monotheism]], where [[God and man are separate]] because [[the transcendent personality that creates the world]] "[[god]]" makes man, but in monotheism [[God and man are separate]].
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472437636170391553): In the [[Buddhism]] way of thinking, [[transcendent beings without personalities]] branch out and appear as all things, including oneself, so naturally [one considers oneself to be a part of transcendent beings I am a part of the transcendental being.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472439298503081989): And those who, based on their experience, [[understanding]] that everything and everyone, including themselves, is just a temporary manifestation of a split "reason ], what do those who have [[understanding]] think about next?
> I believe that everything is fundamentally connected as one, and that I am included in this "everything".
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472441338369277955): Then, just as you see a butterfly and have an image in your mind that "there is a butterfly", the butterfly sees a human and "there is a human". Just as I have a butterfly in the VR space in my mind, I am in the VR space in the butterfly.
- > When we focus on one thing, that thing has other things in it. And every thing can be its subject.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472442016969953280): here it gets related to "[[Butterfly Dreams]]". I had a very realistic VR immersive experience in a dream, where I experienced the world from a butterfly's first-person perspective and felt like I was a butterfly completely, but when I woke up from the dream, I was a human. Was the human dreaming of a butterfly, or was the butterfly dreaming of a butterfly that was so real that it felt like it was a human? This is a story about
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472442545796169730): So, this is indistinguishable, and since humans and butterflies are both just temporary manifestations of a split "reason" in the first place [[no need to distinguish]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472443465875488771): So, after thinking this far, you come back to the material world, and you see two people A and B fighting over the ownership of one thing. You see that and think, "Ah, A and B are both rooted in the same being, but they fight because they don't understand that, and I wish everyone would take a full VR dive.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472443862660837378): then there are people who say things like "I'm afraid of dying". I look at them and say, "You think of yourself as something that exists materially, so you find special meaning in the end of that existence, even though it is only a temporary manifestation of reason. Wouldn't you be less afraid if you had the experience of becoming one with reason?" So I think.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472446015966167046): And up to this point, the idea was "let's all be [[zensetsu]]" since there was no VR yet, but as technology progresses and [[VR full dive]] becomes possible, anyone can easily create, annihilate, duplicate, superimpose, and become someone else's point of view, in other words, [[experience through zensetsu]]. However, if the technology makes [[VR full dive]] possible, anyone can easily create, annihilate, duplicate, and place things on top of each other, or put themselves in other people's viewpoints, in other words, "experience through zen" [[lower cost through technology]].
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472446817044660225): the lower the cost, the more people will take that path, so the more people will reach enlightenment in the Huayan sense. Since they reach it without explicitly allocating the cost to the practice of enlightenment, they become "enlightened when they realize it." When the [[digital native]] is enlightened, it will look ridiculous for the unenlightened old man to cling to material existence!
- The older generation is often derisively referred to as the [[enlightened generation]], but I think they are the generation that is more likely to be enlightened because they are actually practicing more efficiently by being immersed in [[Minecraft]] since they were kids.

>  >[nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472242305088499717): the 3D printer talk can be confusing if you're not careful. The boundary between the "world of reason" and the "world of things" does not coincide with the boundary between "old nature" and "[[computer nature]]", but people are quick to jump to simple dichotomies.
>  An addendum on this: it is not that the VR space is a "world of reason". The old physical world and the virtual world on a computer are both "worlds of things" that humans perceive with their senses, but the natural laws of these worlds are different, so it is easier to imagine the "world of reason" when experiencing the virtual world.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472450248220225537): that when using a 3D printer, the two arrows "reason -> thing" and "digital existence -> physical existence" are occurring at the same time, which may easily confuse the reader. thing.
