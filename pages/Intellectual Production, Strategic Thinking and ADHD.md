title: "Intellectual Production, Strategic Thinking and ADHD"
---

from  [[Diary 2024-11-23]]

The other day, I saw a statement that "[[intellectual production]] and [[strategic thinking]] seem to be related," so I checked [[strength]] and found that [[all of the top 5 strengths are strategic thinking]].

[[ADHD]] enhances [[limited (scale) warfare]] performance through [overconcentration
- This is going to be the equivalent of doing [[tactics]] well.

- If it leads to enhanced [[Intellectual Production]] and [[strategy]], then it is highly beneficial for ADHD.

... I thought about the night of the day when I did what I was not going to do and did not do what I was going to do

- [[What is the difference between tactics and strategy?]]
