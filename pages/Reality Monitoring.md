Reality Monitoring is a metacognitive process that distinguishes between memories and experiences that are "events actually perceived in the outside world" and "events imagined or inferred in the mind.

Inferential-dominant reality monitoring refers to a state in which judgments are made based on logical inferences and semantic consistency rather than on the clarity of visual and auditory sensations. In other words, it is a mode in which top-down inference is strongly activated: "I don't think I saw or heard what I saw or heard correctly, but I believe I did under the circumstances.

Association with schizophrenia
- In clinical interviews and qualitative analysis of autobiographical memory, patients have reported a tendency to recount events in favor of inferred or imagined information.

- The source monitoring task shows that the participants are more likely to confuse "words they have read" with "words they have thought up themselves" and are more confident (overconfident) when doing so.

- In fMRI meta-analysis, decreased activity in the [[frontal pole]]-[[anterior cingulate cortex]] correlates with guess-dominant judgments, suggesting impaired function of circuits that integrate perceptual information.
