- Audrey Tong, a pioneer in the use of virtual reality (VR) for civic deliberation, shares her personal experiences and insights in a lecture. She believes that VR can bring the "magic" of deliberation to more people, as it removes physical barriers and costs associated with traditional face-to-face participation.

- Tong introduces the idea of "The Overview Effect", a sense of awe experienced when viewing Earth from space. This profound feeling, which can now be simulated using VR, increases pro-social behavior and encourages participants to consider alternate positions.

- She also emphasizes the potential of VR to explore "Ground Reality Effect". By using photorealistic VR platforms, participants can explore specific locations, such as a construction site, and understand the implications of decisions made about that location. This technology can help people feel more emotionally connected to the spaces they interact with.

- Tong highlights the sense of autonomy VR can provide, giving users the freedom to move across space and time. She shares an example where she interacted with students and other participants via a VR space called "High Fidelity". This platform allowed for more immersive, detailed interactions and recorded the interactions for future review.

- Finally, she discusses the concept of "Building Assurance" in VR. By changing acoustics and optics, VR can provide a safe space for people to listen and interact without the distractions and physical limitations of the real world.

- In conclusion, Tong emphasizes the transformative potential of VR in promoting more inclusive, immersive, and profound deliberations. She concludes with a prayer, asking for the internet to be an internet of beings, VR to be a shared reality, machine learning to be collaborative learning, user experience to be human experience, and reminding us that plurality is already here.

- Audrey Tong, a pioneer in the use of virtual reality (VR) for citizen deliberation, shares her experiences and insights in her talk. She believes that VR can bring the "magic" of deliberation to a wider audience by removing the physical barriers and costs associated with traditional face-to-face participation.

- Tong introduces the concept of the "[[overview effect]]," the feeling of awe experienced when looking at the Earth from space. By recreating the awe one experiences when looking at the Earth from space in VR, it is said to increase pro-social behavior and encourage people to consider other perspectives.

- The Ground Reality Effect also highlights the potential of VR. Using a photorealistic VR platform, participants can explore a specific location, such as a construction site, and make sense of decisions about that location. This technology allows people to feel more emotionally connected to the spaces they interact with.

- Tong will emphasize the sense of autonomy that VR offers, allowing users to move freely through space and time. She will share an example of interacting with students and other participants through a VR space called High Fidelity. This platform allows for more immersive and detailed interactions, and interactions were recorded for future review.

- Finally, the concept of "Building Assurance" in VR is discussed. By altering acoustics and optics, VR can provide a safe space for people to listen and interact without the distractions and physical limitations of the real world.

- Finally, Tong emphasizes the transformative potential of VR to facilitate more inclusive, immersive, and in-depth deliberations. He concludes with a prayer reminding us that the Internet has become the "Internet of Being," VR has become "shared reality," machine learning has become "collaborative learning," user experience has become "human experience," and plurality is already here.
