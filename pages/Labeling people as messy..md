title: "Labeling people as messy."
---

>  People who immediately use the word "genius" are not looking at the person in question. They are just taking a fluffy view of the person's title or idol. We want a "genius," not a child, and other "geniuses" are perfectly acceptable.
- [Please stop the "genius" harassment. It means labeling people in a way that is easy to understand and consume. | orange people / Satoru Kondo | note](https://note.com/orangeman/n/n5a0cd63d3874) #Genius harassment
- Yes, yes, this is it. The act of sticking [[Miscellaneous labels]] on a human being for consumption.
- The analogy of "a delicate dish being doused with sauce" is excellent.
        - The person doing the [[labeling]] thinks, "[[genius]]" is a nice [[label]], so you can put it on, what's wrong with that?" I think.
    - Even if you like mayonnaise, the cook does not like mayonnaise on every dish.

This and a related story:.
- >  It takes study to tell the good from the bad, but the youngest and the first in history can be understood without knowledge and easy to explain. That's why some media cover it that way.
        - [[Media that uses up the youngest]]
- Pouring sauce or mayonnaise on food can be done by those who cannot cook.
    - That destroys the flavor of the original dish, but people who are not interested in taste don't mind destroying it.
    - The cook is a person interested in taste and finds the act distasteful.
    - So this is the kind of composition.

- I think it might have something to do with the story, "Are there any [[excellent people]]`? I think it has something to do with the story "Excellent people don't join an organization that says, "[Excellent people.`
