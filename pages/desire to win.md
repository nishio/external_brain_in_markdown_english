title: "desire to win"
---

My wife's story about not feeling like winning at board games.
When you think about it calmly, it is strange to feel the desire to "win" against a game when there is no profit in winning

So do sports.
- There are two types of winners: those who win over themselves and those who win over others.

- Is it related to a desire for [[sense of important people]]?
