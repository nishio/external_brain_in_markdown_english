### Multi-head thinking and its effects
.

In my previous research, I observed that the process of thinking proceeds through "writing". This takes the form of a one-dimensional progression of thinking, with new ideas being built on top of old ones. However, this process has been called "single-headed thinking" and its limitations have been noted.

Nishio's research, "Multi-headed Thinking," proposes a new form of thinking that extends this single-headed thinking: multi-headed thinking. This is where AI reads and writes multiple pages at the same time, enabling thinking from multiple perspectives.

This enables "output of ideas by scraping instead of writing" and provides a new perspective on the possibility of "writing" by non-human entities.

Multi-headed thinking is also effective from the perspectives of "judgments supported by multiple perspectives" and "thinking that creates the future. This is because it makes it possible to integrate information from multiple perspectives and create new perspectives.

However, as the "don't mix hot and cold water" warning suggests, we should avoid creative and analytical thinking at the same time. This is because while multi-headed thinking allows multiple perspectives to be considered simultaneously, each perspective can interfere with one another.

In sum, while multi-headed thinking has the potential to diversify the thinking process and generate new perspectives, it should be applied with caution.
