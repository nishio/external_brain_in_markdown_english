There is concern that if I get up early to go to the morning speeches, I will not be able to get enough sleep and will not be able to deliver the microphone at night (I am too weak).

The safe line would be to get up at 7:30.
- Already 1:30 now.

Ends at 11:00
Microphone closing begins at 19:00 Tokyo Station.
- I want to be there by 6:30 p.m.

Maybe it would be better not to go home, but to go into a proper private manga cafe and stay in a cool place until the end of the mic?

Woke up at 7:30.
- Couldn't sleep until 4:30.

Looks like you can get from Nerima to Yurakucho in one line.

> [team_mirai_jp](https://x.com/team_mirai_jp/status/1946314034929934425) This one seat will make a big difference in Mirai.
>
>  Nothing will change in Mirai with just one seat.
>  Don't you think so?
>  If the new party "Team Mirai" gets one seat and becomes a national political party.
>  We will create a team of engineers in Nagatacho with political party grants.
>  We will continue to solve political and social issues one after another,
>  The system we have created will be made available to legislators, local governments, and anyone who wants to use it.
>  The future where Japan will continue to grow.
>  A future where the current generation is well rewarded.
>  Mirai, where you can raise your children and grandchildren with peace of mind.
>  Mirai, where the issue of politics and money is completely resolved.
>  It is not a dream,
>  A future where everything can be realized with technology.
>  This is a challenge that started with only one person believing in Mirai.
>  And now, with your vote, this future will begin to move forward.
>  Team Mirai is a new party where your vote counts most.

> [jujunjun110](https://x.com/jujunjun110/status/1946217670116065287) During this election period, I wrote a technical introduction part about "AI Anno" which answered 20,000 questions! I think I was able to embody "Team Mirai's style" by continuing to improve the quality with 7 updates in 14 days since the first release!

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1946442470843351094) I went into a comic book cafe to work until the end of the mic, but when I got in, I got really sleepy and couldn't do any major tasks... ...

> [Uematsu1987](https://x.com/Uematsu1987/status/1946204746920214536) I put in for the National Democratic Party that you left 3 years ago! I have a few people here and there who say that they did, but I'd like you to put me in Team Mirai this time if you like.
>  Mr. Yasuno will do the same thing (agree with Mr. Tamaki's economic policy) as the KDP members, but the KDP can't do Mr. Yasuno's work no matter who is elected.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1946470164624449991) It has a Project X feel to it.
>  >akirasince1989: Volunteer posters of Yuya Mineshima, a candidate of Team Mirai for the Tokyo election for the House of Councillors, have been put up at 14,119 places all over Tokyo.

> [akirasince1989](https://x.com/akirasince1989/status/1946472849298129085) I would like someone to go into the bombast of making a map.


I made two short videos.

- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1946483708145566165) I'm waiting at a manga cafe that I can get to within 10 minutes of the mic venue, but I've made two cutout videos and there's nothing left to do, so on second thought, I might as well eat dinner first. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to eat dinner first (in order to replenish salt and water).
- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1946487447468298713) The Kai-Katsu Club in Ginza was all private rooms and the reception was automatic, and when I had my membership card read, a piece of paper with a QR code printed on it came out. I forgot that paper once in the restroom. w The key is information, not paper, so I took a picture of it and put it in my phone, but when I looked closer, it looks like it goes into the phone app as well? I didn't read the instructions properly.

>  Teenage turnout: 39.43%.
>  Voter turnout in the 20s: 34.62% Really too low, as we have reported before.

>  "I want to vote!" There are a lot of kids who want to

>  On July 20, let's vote with all our might.



> [yamaneyukiya](https://x.com/yamaneyukiya/status/1946065973632782721) It's too amazing that all the members in this picture are running for office!
>  Well, technically he's not running for one, but he's probably giving as many speeches as the candidate.
>  >[syuhei_mirai](https://x.com/syuhei_mirai/status/1946065973632782721) As the election enters its final stages, I was thinking back to last year's gubernatorial election.
>  Last year in Yurakucho on Tanabata, the last day of the microphone session, I also spoke on the campaign car to give a speech in support of Takahiro Yasuno, saying something like this.
>  "Yasuno-kun is good at talking about dreams. He is good at envisioning the future."

> [izutorishima](https://x.com/izutorishima/status/1946511697705128007) So ！！！！ I arrived just in time for Team Mirai Yasuno's last speech at Tokyo Station Marunouchi Ekimae! He's a hell of a guy and too bad ！！！！！！！！！！
>  I wondered how many people would show up, but it was definitely in the thousands, too amazing! Rollover: ！！！！！

> [izutorishima](https://x.com/izutorishima/status/1946512756779483601) He's really an outrageous person and is scared to death, isn't he even more than Ishimaru was in the Tokyo gubernatorial election...?

> [djdeppa](https://x.com/djdeppa/status/1946525726347268372) I wandered over to see the end of the microphone for Team Mirai. I was surprised to see so many people gathered.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1946538011354706166) I'm sure the TV station will have a good picture of how many people were there, so I'll wait.


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1946528336278425603) The glow sticks I bought are very bright when folded, but they don't last very long, so it was difficult to find a use for them. There were people who had glowing rings to put on their wrists, electric lights, and glowing cubes.
> [tomato_mayosand](https://x.com/tomato_mayosand/status/1946559091222171754) I hear it's easier to clap if it's wrist shaped

> [mir_ai_sptr](https://x.com/mir_ai_sptr/status/1946541883817406696) Mine was the kind that glows when you fold it, but it was the kind that glows for 6 hours for 100 bucks! LOL!
> [jmutualaida](https://x.com/jmutualaida/status/1946561651454722413) I was on site to secure the flow line, but there were too many people and the induction team had to have shiny objects... thanks for your efforts!

I should not summarize the Upper House election tomorrow because it involves sending out information to Cosense.
