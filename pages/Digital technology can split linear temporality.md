Digital technology can split linear temporality
The notion that "digital technology can split linear temporality" is often discussed in the context of technophilosophy and digital culture. This refers to the fact that digital technology is reshaping the traditional linear flow of time, creating new experiences and perceptions of time.

1. what is linear temporality?
Linear temporality refers to the continuous flow of time, moving in one direction from past to present to future. This concept is a common view of time in Western philosophy and science, and is embodied especially through such tools as clocks and calendars.

Example: Analog movies and music are structured based on "linear time" that progresses in sequence from beginning to end.
2. division of time by digital technology
Digital technology has the ability to divide and reconstruct this linear time. There are several aspects to this:

(1) Time fragmentation
In digital media, time is divided into discrete frames or data units.
Example: In video editing, time is divided into frames, which can be rearranged in any order. This differs from the one-way editing of analog film.
(2) Nonlinear experience of time
Digital technology disrupts the linear flow of time and allows for nonlinear navigation.
Example: Streaming services allow the viewer to jump to any point or repeat a portion of the video. This fragments the traditional flow of time.
(3) Real-time and time compression
Digital technology emphasizes the "real-time nature" of the event, where multiple events feel as if they are happening at the same time.
Example: In social networking sites, events from different regions and time zones appear on the screen at the same time, dismantling the linearity of time.
(4) Algorithmic time reconstruction
Algorithms analyze data and provide an optimized time experience.
Example: YouTube recommendations suggest content to watch next based on your viewing history, allowing the algorithm to "manipulate" the flow of time.
3. philosophical and cultural meaning
The division of time by digital technology includes the following profound implications

(1) Multi-layering of time
In the digital age, different time frames and paces exist simultaneously. Personal lives, the speed of technology, and our global sense of time intersect.
(2) Subjectivation of time
Digital technology makes time dependent on personal choice and dismantles the universal sense of time.
(3) New structures of memory and future
Through digital archiving, past events are instantly recalled and simultaneously used as data for planning the future. In this way, time is reconstructed in a way that blurs the distinction between past, present, and future.
4. critical perspectives
Risk of de-temporalization: the increasing division of time may lead to a loss of a linear view of time and a diminished relationship to the past and future.
The downside of fragmentation: when time is fragmented too much, coherent experiences and narratives are lost and fragmented information consumption becomes a priority.
Conclusion.
Digital technology has broken up traditional linear temporality, allowing us to fragment and reconfigure time. While this has allowed us to manipulate time at will, it is also transforming the meaning and value of time. This change is bringing about new questions in philosophy and culture about how we perceive time and how we live our lives itself.
