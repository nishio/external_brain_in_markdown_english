title: "Osamu Shimomura"

> Yasuno: I think it is very important to raise the income of the people, but it is said that there are three simple ways to achieve economic growth: population growth, use of natural resources, and use of technology. Since the first two are difficult to achieve in Japan, my basic strategy is to focus on technology.
>  This is not unrealistic; looking back in the past, Japan's [[period of rapid economic growth (esp. Japan's period of rapid economic growth after WWII)]] was a very successful example. During this period, innovations centered on the manufacturing industry--electric rice cookers, light cars, color TVs, automatic ticket gates, and other revolutionary new products that made full use of technology were being created one after another. Of course, there was a demographic bonus, but Japan, with its scarce resources, was able to miraculously "[[double]] its income" in just seven years.
>  The plan was designed by economist Osamu Shimomura, who was the brainchild of the then Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda. By opening the door to foreign countries, the plan aimed to introduce advanced technology, stimulate domestic investment, and increase exports, as well as to achieve full employment for the people of Japan. Based on the idea that "the economy is run by people," Shimomura placed great importance on the "creativity" of each and every citizen.
>  In other words, [[bottom-up creativity]] is one of the key pillars of economic growth.
