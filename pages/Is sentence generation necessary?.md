    - In the context of [[chatbot]], suddenly trying to generate long sentences from [generative model
    - I think the hurdles are suddenly too high.
    - In the [[developmental process]], the complexity gradually increases from [[lover's whispers]] for attention, to one-word sentences, to two-word minutes, and so on
- I've seen Scrapbox titles like "X and Y" and "Is X a Y?" There are simple ones like.
        - In the context of [[Support for Intellectual Production]], it is good if you can suggest unexpected connections that are neither meaningless nor obvious
    - > X is Y, but ~X is also Y
    - > The relationship between A and B is similar to the relationship between C and D
- It would be nice if at most 3 lines of bullet points were generated.
