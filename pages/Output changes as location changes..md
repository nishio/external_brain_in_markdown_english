title: "Output changes as location changes."

from [/villagepump/2023/09/16](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/2023/09/16)
- Similar nuance to "[[Changing the project in Scrapbox changes the text you write]]," where changing the location changes the output.
    - It looks like "[[change location]]" is also triggered when writing a comment on a bullet point in someone else's writing in Scrapbox bullet points.
    - What's going on?
    - Are you unconsciously trying to connect with [[your surroundings]]?
    - [[contextual connection]]?

relevance
- [[output changes as language changes]].
        - [[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]]
    - [[Intellectual production by changing formats]]
