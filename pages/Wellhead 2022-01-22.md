    - [[If I provide useful information, will I get something in return?]]
    - [The words "ill-defined" and "low resolution" are similar but different.
- [/villagepump/too much trouble linking one line on a phone](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/too much trouble linking one line on a phone).
- I walked 10,000 steps.

    - [[right shoulder]]
- [/villagepump/about the elation of learning about Scrapbox](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/about the elation of learning about Scrapbox).
    - A good source of information for those who are learning to use Scrapbox, as it verbalizes everyone's Scrapbox learning process.
    - But I don't think it has anything to do with "exuberance" for the most part.
    - The reason I didn't write about it was because I felt uncomfortable, like it wasn't really an uplifting experience...
    - I think something like, "Write about your relationship with Scrapbox" would be more appropriate.
    - I was searching Scrapbox and found [[ScrapboxDrinkup]].
    - I tried to organize the beginning of our relationship, but it turned into a "Hatena Diary service will be terminated" kind of story, and it didn't turn out to be at all interesting.
            - [[Scrapbox period]]

            - [[The blog was dismantled and became a social networking site and Scrapbox.]]
        - Ah, I see.
        - While looking for a blogging service to migrate to, you began to suspect that the blogging system itself is no longer an archaic structure.
    - I started to write about it because it was mentioned so many times on Naresome, but it got too long, and since no one commented on Naresome, I think I'll put it on my project and link to it.
    - [[ScrapboxReader as a custom view of Scrapbox]]
    - It's hard to decide whether to put these ideas on a personal project or a well.
    - A willingness to [[search]] for things that have never been done before (in the sense of [[trade-offs between use and exploration]]).
    - [[Face icon freed from the physical body]]
