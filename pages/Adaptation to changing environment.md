title: "Adaptation to changing environment"
---

Business organizations need to adapt to changes in the environment.

Specifically, the usefulness of a domain that was useful in the past decreases and the usefulness of another domain increases.
In the past, companies responded to this change by [[personnel change]].

On the left, two people are placed in domain A.
If the usefulness of that domain decreases and the usefulness of the new domain B increases, the firm reassigns one person from A to B. The person just moved is less productive (center).
Productivity will increase as the person learns new areas.

As time has progressed, software has been used to increase productivity. As a result, the learning of those who moved to a new domain alone no longer increased productivity as much as in the original domain.

In this situation, adaptation to a newly useful domain requires the development of software for that domain.
When software is ordered outside the organization and made under a contractual agreement, the specifications need to be clarified in advance. However, a person who has just moved to a new domain cannot describe the appropriate specifications. Outsourcing software has a negative impact on the speed of adaptation to change.

To address this problem, software development must occur in parallel with the learning of "those who cannot yet verbalize their requirements specifications" who have just moved into a new domain.
There are tools such as [[agile]] as a methodology for development and kintone as a tool to support this approach. kintone allows non-engineers to create business applications while learning a new domain, without having to verbally communicate the domain knowledge they are learning to others.

How the story started
    - [[DX=Transition to double-loop learning using digital]]

relevance
    - [[System development by non-engineers]]

- Background of [[Creating Agility in Personnel Changes]] not working so well anymore.
