> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1943867992422723799) [[Miyagi Prefecture]] provided poster board locations in Excel format uniformly throughout the prefecture, which was easier to work with than other prefectures that provided poster board locations on paper. But I believe Miyagi was the first prefecture to complete the work. I feel like the effect of Miyagi Prefecture's progress in DX is showing in the numbers.

>  I understand that Tokyo and Kanagawa are progressing well, but Miyagi Prefecture is fast and amazing. Is it a high affinity?

Parallel task with many switches
- It would exceed the capacity of the brain.
- Tasks should be written out.
- Why not a so-called task list?
    - Because the task is implicitly atomic.
    - In fact, in parallel tasks with many switches, the switches are made in units finer than "what is written in the task list".
        - In other words, there is an "unwritten one-unit task."
        - The problem is that this is not written and is lost
    - It's more like a work log that I write when I'm doing difficult tasks, not a task list.
    - Sometimes the task list is "abstract and vague directions" or "concrete but distant goals that are not immediately obtainable".
    - Why write a work log when doing difficult tasks?
        - Because it's essentially an exploration.
        - Do what you think would be good to do this, and then the observations will tell you that this is not the way to do it.
        - We need to go back to the step before us.
        - That's why I can't keep it in my memory, so I go ahead and record it, and that's the work log.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1944061401729052727) From Friday night to Saturday, I added a new function to Polimoney, published a report on the AI An's in the public hearing AI, fixed a broken map in the Looker Studio, and cast my vote before the deadline. I've also done some advance voting, which I thought was great.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1943884281702756597) Interesting!
>  >nununnuun: I don't know anything about politics, but I find it interesting that all the TikTok people are calling themselves the Suffrage Party, and all the Tweepers are calling themselves the National Democratic Party. And the parenting group says "Team Mirai"...
