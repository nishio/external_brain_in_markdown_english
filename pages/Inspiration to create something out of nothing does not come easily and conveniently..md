Inspiration to create something out of nothing, etc,
It is not so easy to come up with such a convenient and easy way.
Scratching through piles of notes, walking around with folded arms, sighing,
We worry about the time that passes in vain and fight the temptation to re-burn,
I wrote down a few thoughts and felt dissatisfied with any of them,
He drinks coffee and despairs that his talent has run out,
He puts on eye drops, washes his hands with soap, and reads his notes again.
Never let your strength slacken

- [[Shinichi Hoshi]]
