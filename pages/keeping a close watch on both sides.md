Literally interpreted, it means "to stare at both," thus indicating a state of trying to balance attention to two different directions or elements. This expression is used to refer to situations that require equal attention to each, especially when there are multiple options or concerns. This expression emphasizes the importance of considering all relevant factors and moving forward in harmony in complex situations and choices.

- The term "both sides" in [[go]] refers to a situation in which a single move has the potential to achieve two different objectives at the same time. This is a tactical element of Go, meaning that a player can aim for multiple effects with a single move. Double-flank moves are very difficult for the opponent to deal with and can be an important strategy for a player to gain an advantageous [[position]].

Both eyes as an example
- Both territory and influence: a player secures his territory in one move while at the same time expanding his influence over his surroundings.
- Both attacking and defending: in one move, you apply pressure to your opponent's stones (attack) and at the same time strengthen your own weak stones (defend).
- Saving two groups simultaneously: when a particular move has the effect of saving two different groups of stones at the same time.

Strategic value of both sides of the equation
Both-against-the-other is of great strategic value. Since the opponent must respond to both threats and often can only prevent one or the other, the player who executes both ninches has the upper hand. A two-sided hand is often a major turning point that changes the course of the game.

To be successful on both sides of the equation
Effective use of both nikumi requires a good understanding of the overall situation on the board and the insight to read the opponent's intentions and possibilities. In addition, creativity and flexible thinking are required to find the best moves for both sides. Finding such tactics in Go requires a high degree of skill and experience, as there are countless possibilities in each phase of the game.

Ryonin in Go is an excellent example of the importance of deep strategy and the ability to read the situation. It has value beyond a mere move and can even determine the outcome of the game.
