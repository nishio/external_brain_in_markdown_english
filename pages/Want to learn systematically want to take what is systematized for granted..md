If that is not possible for various reasons, there is probably no single answer, and it depends on your goals and the resources available to you. If you ask me a question vaguely, I can't answer it.
- This is an important point, because people who say "I want to learn [[systematically]]" are saying "I want to take what someone else has systematized", and even if they feel they have learned from that, they will not acquire the skills to systematize new things at all.
- In the short term, efficiency appears to be high, but this is only because you are not paying the cost of acquiring "[[Systematizing Skills]]" and the cost of payment appears to be low.
