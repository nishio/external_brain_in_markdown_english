- Virtual Futures is a method developed by the Japanese "[[future design]]" movement, in which participants take on the role of "residents in 2050," etc., in order to alleviate the myopic bias of the current generation and promote sustainable and innovative consensus building. This is a mechanism. While institutionalization at the municipal and national levels is progressing, issues such as representativeness and cost have also been pointed out.

1. origin and definition
    - In "Future Design" proposed by economist [[Tatsuyoshi Saijo]] around 2012, "virtual future persons" are introduced as a mechanism to allow future generations to participate in current decision-making as imaginary personalities.
    - Participants will be asked to "travel back in time" and take on the role of themselves in 30 years' time, representing the interests of future generations in the discussions.

2. theoretical background
    - While markets and democracy maximize the utility of the current generation, they fail to adequately factor in the interests of future generations -- this is called the "myopia" problem.
    - Experiments have confirmed that when virtual future persons are inserted, participants' thinking switches from "present mode" to "future mode," and futurability, the desire to preserve resources for the future, increases.

The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) has prepared a bill to establish a "Commission for Future Generations" in 2023, which would establish a "Commission for Future Generations" in the Diet with nine experts from the private sector.
