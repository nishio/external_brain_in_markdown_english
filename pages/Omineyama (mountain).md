> Omineyama (大峰山) is a mountain located in the southern part of Nara Prefecture. [[Omineyama (mountain)]].
> In July 2004, Ominesan-ji Temple, Omine Okugakemichi, and other historic sites were registered as major components of the cultural landscape of the Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range by UNESCO.
> Omine-Okugakemichi, which runs from [[Yoshino]] to [[Kumano]], was first opened by priests [[shugenja]] who came from Fujiwara-kyo and Heijo-kyo to this area to practice [[Shinsen-sha]], [[Taoism]], and [[Buddhism]], which were brought from China and became a part of the ancient belief in nature. The mountain was opened by [[YAKUZOKAKU]] in the late Asuka Period (around the time of the Emperor Bunbu). In the Chokyu period (1040 - 1044), Shugenja ([[Giei]] and [[Choen]]) systematized Omine Okugakemichi from Kumano to Yoshino while [[Kumano Shugen]] was growing in power.
