As long as it is written, AI can target

I'm engaged in the act of "getting it right" by thinking in a situation where all I have is my phone.
- This is not "[[clean copy]]"
- Write before the unwritten word disappears.
- No need to be clean first.
- As long as it is written, AI can target

relevance
    - [[Intellectual production in small time slots]]

### digest of notes
.
The act of writing down thoughts using a phone is to record the words before they disappear, not a clean copy. If it is written, AI can target it.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The Notebook and the "Diary 2023-08-25" fragment are related in terms of how the AI handles written material. The notebook states that if it is written, the AI can target it, while the fragment discusses whether or not the AI will advance its own thoughts.

### deep thinking
Subjecting an AI to what it writes can reduce the burden of human writing and allow it to advance its thinking more deeply. However, the pros and cons of allowing AI to advance its own learning depends on how the results affect human thinking.

### summary of thoughts
While AI self-learning deepens human thinking, we should be cautious about how the results affect human thinking.

### title of thought
.
"The Relationship Between AI Self-Learning and Human Thought."
