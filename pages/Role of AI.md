How to put AI

- Isn't the Next Action to include AI here? I'm thinking.
- Not clear yet what will be done.
    - but the concept of [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]] is
    - The Intellectual Production of Engineers as a Book."
    - → "[[Engineers' intellectual production as a place of communication on Scrapbox]]"
    - → "[[Engineers' intellectual production techniques as a place for AI and human participation]]"
    - It's going to develop like
- I'm having a little trouble figuring out what kind of way to put it in.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/enchi/nishio/icon' alt='/enchi/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - [[Incremental Reading]]Likely to be relevant.

In general, it's a matter of "[[AIボット]]に与える『役割』や『目的』が重要」という気持ちがしている<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/enchi/nishio/icon' alt='/enchi/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- It would be annoying if the AI updates daily on a project that doesn't have daily updates.
- The theory that updating 7 pages once a week is better than updating 1 page every day.

I wrote this before starting the review phase of this book.[[Scrapboxをもっと活用する案]]が浮かび上がってきて再度読んだ<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/enchi/nishio/icon' alt='/enchi/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Reason why "doing the divergence phase again won't fit into the schedule" didn't do it.
- If so, now would be a good time to do [[the divergence phase again]].
- So what is the "[[divergence phase]]"?

- Rethinking what to do about AI in omoikane
- It must be properly questioned.
- What would you like to see happen with AI on this project?"
    - What about [[Role of AI]]?
    - AI reads AI novels written by everyone else and writes their thoughts?
    - AI writing AI novels from various perspectives?
...
- [Github](https://github.com/nishio/omoikane-embed/commit/3f87c4c6b769a75b5012b70e71e6efed1e32676a)
- [[Omoikane Bot]] now selects a page at random and adds his/her impressions at the end of the page.
    - I don't think it should be limited to novels.
- Hypothesis that the needed role is "read the novel and write your thoughts on it".

- Consider again "[[Role of AI]]" for AI here.
    - Context: [/omoikane/chat page 5#64f05875aff09e0000cfc497](https://scrapbox.io/omoikane/chat page 5#64f05875aff09e0000cfc497)
- I'm thinking of it as a role to split up pages where multiple topics are mixed together (chat pages are typical).
- Maybe the curse of "when it gets to 100 pages" caused the pressure to push content onto one page and not cut it out.
- There are a lot of pages that aren't cut out by that.
- Research to divide and summarize the chat by the content of the conversation when given.
    - [[MemoChat]]
    - I've been trying it out on the Scrapbox tree, and first of all, it turns out that it's basically a tree split.
    - So take the tree and split it into pages?
- I could suggest a semi-automatic split at the end of the longest page.
    - Longest page: chat 3 sustain and wait for fruit to ripen (15935 tokens)
- That's about it for today.
- I thought this cutout was good.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamed-project/yits-khawk'9483/icon' alt='/unnamed-project/yits-khawk'9483.icon' height="19.5"/>
