title: "Six-round cumulative KJ method is less than 1%."
---

Jiro Kawakita used nearly 1,000 pieces over a five-year period from 1981-1986, but only 8 pieces did the six-round cumulative KJ method, or just under 90% of the total [[Expedition Net]].
Well, it's not surprising that the number of pieces of time-consuming items is small, so I would really like to know the percentage of time spent on them, but I guess we don't have that data.

- [[Jiro Kawakita did KJ method about 10% of the time.]]
[[only 129 KJ's in 5 years]].
