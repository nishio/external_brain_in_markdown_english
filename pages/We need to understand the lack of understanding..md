Need to [[understand]] the [[lack of]] understanding

This has not been well verbalized yet.

Some specifics
- A story about handing over software and the user not being able to use it well.
    - If you can use the software, but the user can't, it's not because the software lacks functionality, but because the user lacks "understanding" of the software.
    - The creator doesn't understand "not being understood" because he already has a deep understanding.
- When writing an explanatory text
    - We need to understand what our readers don't understand.
- Communication with others
    - Probably the same composition.
- Relationship between society and the individual
    - This probably has the same composition.
