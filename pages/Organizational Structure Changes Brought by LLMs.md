- 1: As the size of an organization grows, it becomes impossible for one person to handle all the information individuals produce.
- 2: Therefore, people created a [[hierarchical structure]] #HierarchicalOrganization
    - This structure allows middle management to mediate information.
    - Information from top management is conveyed to subordinates through middle management, and information from subordinates is summarized by middle management and communicated to top management.
    - This enabled organizations to expand in size, but issues such as slow information transmission and distortion became problematic.
- 3A: With the development of communication methods, it has become easier to deliver information from top management to all employees.
- 3B: However, even in this era, top management cannot process all information, so middle management is still necessary.
    - The problems of slow and distorted information reaching the top persist.
- 4: With LLMs creating natural language summaries, information can reach the top without human mediation.
    - From the top's perspective, it acts as "glasses that allow them to see what was previously unseen" and provides a "broad perspective."
        - This is similar to what is called [[Broad Listening]] in the context of [[Plurality]].
    - From the bottom's perspective, it might resemble a [[Panopticon]], where the top can potentially observe at any time.
    - The top feels the greatest need for this, so the introduction of systems enabling this is driven top-down.

The dynamics of creating a [[Brown Organization]] as discussed in [[Teal Organizations]] become obsolete due to technological advancements, accelerating changes in organizational structure.

Unsettled Thoughts:
- Will the "glasses for seeing the entire organization" obtained by the top also be provided to many employees?
    - There is an issue of [[access rights]], as the information one is allowed to see varies by person.
    - The demand is high.
        - Skilled craftsmen with special talents absorb this by acting as [[internal information curators]].
        - This involves using "information accessible to everyone" as input and producing a single "curation output for everyone."
        - This will evolve into [[Diversity Production]], shaped by individual access rights and interests.
