title: "Importance of the ability to think about what to make"
---

>  As [[Evolution of Programming Languages]] increases [[program production efficiency]], the relative importance of the ability to determine "[[What should be made]]" will increase.
[[Supplement #5b7a511faff09e00007b17a4 to Why Invest in Intellectual Production Techniques]]

In the past, I insisted on this.
Is this claim True?
- rebuttal
    - Increased program production efficiency lowers the cost of creating the program.
    - Lower costs allow more programs to be created at a given cost
    - Cheaper to make than to pay the time cost of scrutiny.

orthographical variants
- 「 [[What should be made]] 」
- 「 [[What to make]] 」
- 「 [[What to make]] 」
relevance
- What is "should"?
        - [[Should→why?]]
        - [[Reasons to make it]]
