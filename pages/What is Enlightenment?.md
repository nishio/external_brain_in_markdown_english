    - What is [[For Eternal Peace]] / [[enlightenment]] and 3 others
    - [[Kant]]   [[Hajime Nakayama]]

    - Kant's ideas about [[enlightenment]] are concentrated
- >  What is Enlightenment?
- >  It is to get out of the [[minor status]] that man has brought upon himself.
- >  The state of being a minor means that one is unable to use one's reason without the direction of others.
- >  > The human being is in a state of infancy, not because he lacks [[reason]], but because he cannot have [[Determination to use one's reason]] or courage without the direction of others!
- >  So man remains a minor in his own responsibility.
    - #Minor status
        - [[awaiting instructions]]
        - [[Guardianship of Divine Reason]]
            - [[guardianship]]

- I'm talking about the need for [[decision]] to act based on one's own reason.
