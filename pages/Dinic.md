    - Algorithm for finding [maximum flow
    - Dinic is O(V^2E)
    - [[History of Algorithms for Maximum Flow]]
- [AOJ GRL_6_A Maximum Flow](http://judge.u-aizu.ac.jp/onlinejudge/description.jsp?id=GRL_6_A&lang=jp) to verify implementation.
- My Python implementation (verified by AOJ)
    - The edge is waiting in defaultdict(dict), so there is no need to have the index of the inverse side to get the inverse side.
        - (Many C++ implementations have an inverse index on each side.)
    - Do not search for previously explored edges.
        - This is achieved by having "the first index of the edge not yet explored" in the `itertion_count`.
        - To use this, we need a mapping from index to edges, so we make it first in `max_flow`: `edges_index`.
