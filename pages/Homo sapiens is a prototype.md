Homo sapiens is a prototype
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1730277373231427744/quick_promote_web/intro) Homo sapiens is a prototype that has been repeatedly modified in an ad hoc manner, "as long as it works anyway". In my honest software engineering mind, I feel the need to refactor or throw away the prototype and rebuild it.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1730277578035097933) There are no comments in the source code and no commit messages, so there are tons of parts where I don't know why it's implemented this way.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1730281422407999977) Testing is beneficial for refactoring, and the inability to repeat tests under the same conditions due to the inability to replicate instances of homo sapiens is Refactoring is hindered, so the first step is to create a digital twin so we can experiment on digital space, which we've already started to do.
