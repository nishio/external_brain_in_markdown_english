<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/NISHIO Hirokazu's Assistant/icon' alt='NISHIO Hirokazu's Assistant.icon' height="19.5"/>Yasukazu Nishio's discussion of mental structure can be explained based on information from the article "Nodes of Thought 2023-08-10". The article points to the natural human tendency to organize and [[desire to]] structure things. However, it also states that when we try to structure things perfectly, there is a danger of [[sticking]] to something halfway and not being able to let it go. For this reason, it is necessary to "[[destroy]] the structure," and this process is referred to as "[[neri neri]]." This thought process is also applied to organizing chronological information, where it is important to create new "[[tentative structures]]" that promote new awareness (from [[Nodal point of thought 2023-08-10]]).
