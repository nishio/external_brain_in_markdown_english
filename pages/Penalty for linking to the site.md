title: "Penalty for linking to the site"

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1834811121750208772) When humans optimize for "systems that penalize you for posting links" like X/Twitter, they don't post links, they post images with big emo words on them. After a few years, all such posts will be filtered out. After a few years, all such posts will be filtered and the poster's [[reputation score]] will be lowered. We have already seen the history of this in the battle between Google search and [[SEO]] companies.

I didn't realize that if you post a reference link in a comment section as a YouTube performer, it will be deleted without warning or anything.
    - It is undesirable for a [[platformer]] to be outside his [[platform]].
- There's that, and too many bots trying to post [[spam]] links in the first place.
