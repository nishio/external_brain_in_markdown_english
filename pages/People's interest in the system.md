title: "People's interest in the system"
---

- Something doesn't feel right, so I'm trying to verbalize it.
- There's a difference between being interested in people's systems and being interested in people.
- Poor ability to identify people
- I happened to observe a case study of connecting people to create a beneficial community up close.
- I don't understand what they are thinking and doing at all.
- But I sensed there was some logic to it, so I tried to verbalize it through observation.
- I could verbalize it to some extent.
- Once you feel like you understand it, try to implement it and verify that you understand it correctly.
- Not only are they not interested in individual people, they may inadvertently not even be interested in individual communities.
- I'm more interested in how each community is working and what problems they are solving.
