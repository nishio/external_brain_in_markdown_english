prev  [[Weekly journal 2024-06-03~2024-06-08]]

I've always used the weekly journal as a page to look back and summarize after the week is over, but I'm starting to think that a different way of doing things is possible, so I'm pinning it this time as an experiment.
- Under the title ``Weekly Journal 2024-06-09~`''

Since this page will stay at the top of the page in the future week, I'll write here what's on my mind.
    - [[Hayashi's Video]]
- Watch and comment on the Unexplored Jr. video.
    - Through the weekend.
- We're at a camp this weekend, so I'll have to check the schedule.
    - Saturday and Sunday events are often waved in lieu of Friday and Monday, but that's an in-house study session on Friday.
    - Or take Thursday off.
        - Thursday meeting 11:00~13:00 Hongo area
    - Let's get ready for Friday's study session on Tuesday.
- I think Talk to the City is just right for the study group.
