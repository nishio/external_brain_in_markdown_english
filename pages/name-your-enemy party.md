# 「Gradual」
Update ownership with smart contracts
From a single blue chip to a fragmented market
Bulk purchase → installments or smaller amounts → Paidy
Liquidity of [[small]] tokens
- Allows buying and selling of items that are being paid in installments
- Smoothing of ownership
    - No longer a binary "own it, don't own it."<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

    - Or [[SALSA]] or something.
- A: The possibility of not having a target when you want to exercise is not good from a UX perspective.
    - I wasn't sure why the proposed system would solve the problem.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Supplement to the discussion here: [[Gradual and PCO]].
- Comment: if the ticket is exercised after NFT Auth, no problem, depends on the nature of the NFT being targeted.

Scenarios where you want to hedge your risk against price declines
- The "bet high and you'll get it" is fragile.
    - No, PCO can claim rights for a period of time.

PCO is a solution for how to interact with limited goods, not for something like Profile NFT.

What is the incentive to issue here instead of OpenSea?

coinage
Money has moved from the realm of "state-made" to the realm of "people's manufacturing".
community token
- Lower utility than legal tender
    - market scale
- There is value in having multiple axes of evaluation.
    - Adding an extra axis rather than replacing legal tender
    - Work for a living and make purchases in legal tender and use community tokens for hobby activities.
    - This makes a lot of sense.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - When there is enough legal tender income to guarantee the stable continuation of life, any further income will reduce utility.
        - For those in this zone, it may be more beneficial to get 10,000 points for "something that may have another value" than to receive 10,000 Japanese yen.
        - Something interesting could happen if there is a currency tied to something that cannot be bought with Japanese yen (e.g., trust through ongoing community service activities).

Create many small economic zones
- Small good things are appreciated.

The occurrence of intra-group bias is an issue.
- Ourselves or Others.

Community Tokens vs. Legal Tender
- Community tokens are like loyalty cards.
- Why compare with legal tender and not with existing point systems?
- Establish a rate of exchange with legal tender?
    - If it is set forth, "more evaluation axes" cannot be realized.
    - Unipos: 1 point = 1 yen
        - Thanksgiving points that can be sent via Slack
        - round peg
            - Won't the value go down?
        - It would be interesting to use it for voting rights in corporate decision making.
        - Would it be interesting to have a trade of points between different companies?
            - Who sells points for company X and buys points for company Y. Will they change jobs?
            - Does the high reputation at the previous company carry over to the next one?
- Community tokens can be issued by anyone.
    - Is the value determined by the issuer's valuation?

Sad when tokens disappear.
- The company providing the service is not prevented from erasing it.
    - On-chain can continue to be used in principle.
    - I can't help it if it disappears from the DB before I do withdraw.
    - In the long run, trust in the company and its people who did that kind of thing will diminish.

- Community Currency Q
- It's more interesting if you don't connect it to legal tender.
- The issuer should be able to choose whether or not it can be linked to legal tender.

I want to add a Gezel/QV-like function.

- Workshop Experience
    - In the early stages of the actual workshop, the participants will "delegate to someone who seems to be smart because they do not have the confidence to make decisions on their own".

- Welfare is maximized

Risk of collusion collusion
- Post a SCAM project and some people will vote on it.

Q: What is the input data?
- On-Chain Activities
- Q: Will a large number of SBTs be submitted, thereby controlling the evaluation?
    - Not mechanically calculated from specific types of SBT ownership information
    - Use the entire on-chain activity
- Q: Distance in space is affected by scaling of axes, is anything taken care of?
    - The similarity measure is not determined computationally from a vector of activity alone, but rather by the subjectivity of a large number of crowd workers

- The feeling of being watched by your future self is kind of funny.

nuun I remember a story about a sick comedian who said that if you stroke your poor old self's head in your mind, your future self will be able to stroke your present self and heal you.

Do pseudo asynchronous, delays matter to humans?
- irreversibility
- What comes from having constraints.
- It's about values as much as it's about accepting longevity.

cyclical time
    - [[Message (SF)]]
- Star charts are mental models of looping time
- predictability
    - Neither 0% nor 100%.
- [[Ozma issue]]

How much can we distort circadian rhythms?
- Human experiments were not very flexible.
- Animal studies show that removing the pineal gland makes it more flexible.

# "Presentation of Results and Challenges of Implementing PICSY with Smart Contracts"

Issue 1: Must be permission-full
- The number of participants is fixed at N
- Civil Attack Issues
- How about distributing the social minimum in proportion to the contribution rather than dividing it by N?
- How about imposing a minimum work requirement and thereby handing out social minimums?
- DeCartography is determined by peer forecasting methods
    - Babies have no common sense, so they contribute 0?
- QV will hand out the first 99 votes.
- Ken Suzuki, "Social Minimums Are Not Intentionally Embedded."
    - There are three ways to realize budget constraints
    - This section came up in the process of creating the Virtual Central Bank Act.
    - I thought about the implications of this section and came up with "It's a social minimum."
    - The meaning was thought up after the fact, not embedded first.
- So it is possible to remove it.
    - That's a good way to start now.
    - As for experimenting in a limited setting, there doesn't seem to be a problem with that.
    - Applied to all societies, the fact that you have to work to earn money may be a problem, it may lead to the accumulation of wealth
- Worldwide introduction
    - Whether or not to do a social minimum, the countries that want to do it should do it.
- That's the next "national" concept.
    - Japan has a Japanese social contract.
    - neocameralism
    - mobile voting
- The concept of "working" varies from community to community.
    - If you're looking to collect and analyze data on babies' fresh reactions to the world, babies work better than adults.

Is labor valuable because of inflation, or does PICSY inflate?
- Just let the asset evaporate.
- Talk about adjusting parameters.
- official discount (bank) rate
- It's in the textbook, why don't you read it?
- How do you set up alpha?
    - Set up per community and loosely connected by trades between multiple PICSYs?
    - Unpopular systems decline.
    - Ken Suzuki: "When I thought about PICSY, I didn't anticipate the current blockchain situation, and in retrospect, it's lame that the central bank controls alpha."

fallacy of composition
- Why not just use schering coins?
- Or a distributed oracle.
- You can make it a dictatorship.

If you don't like [[silver democracy]] in favor of old people, go elsewhere.
- The unpopular side declines.

public blockchain
- We parted ways at The DAO.
- A real vote on which chain each validator will choose
- super subjectivity
        - [[subjectivism]]

Wouldn't it be better if PICSY itself split?
- Just create a PICSY-only Layer 1 blockchain.
- ↔ You can do an exchange of people belonging to each community.
- At the bridge
- lightning network
- (AMU? AMM? AML? I didn't catch it.) of the swap.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/5fabe76a636396429197a797f1fc8ee3/thumb/1000)
- Sell ETC and buy ETH

Issue 2: Computational complexity

Proof of Useful Work
- Make them do useful work, not useless work.
- Primecoin
- The work must have a high computational cost, low cost of validation of results, and adjustable difficulty.

Eigenvalue calculations have high computational cost and low cost of verifying results
- I think you meet the requirements!

Problems that depend on where the elements of the matrix are calculated at any point in time.
- Difficult to share the matrix at a certain point in time all at once
- Why not just share by the difference?
    - It's a matrix of real values, so even if you take the difference, the values in all the cells will have changed, so it won't compress.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>And I thought on the day, the difference would follow a probability distribution around zero, not random, so I feel like it's compressible.
- Should we hierarchize?
        - [[divide and rule law]]
- Sharing of frequently updated matrices -> more interesting than PICSY if distributed computing can be done
- Bitcoin is a superior protocol in that regard, and Ethereum has its problems.
- As long as the person who sent it doesn't duplicate it.
- Is that possible?
- If we just want to guarantee that the budget constraint does not break down, why not just ask for an upper bound without the need to propagate the true value?
    - When buying goods, how many shares you should pay yourself depends on your own stock price.
- If the probability of a problem is low, can't we solve it with an insurance approach that only makes allowances for problems when they occur?

> [0xCommune](https://twitter.com/0xCommune/status/1679158003617128449) Yes
> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1679150950639087617?s=20): I thought it was a very interesting idea to decompose the matrix as a Proof of Useful Work #NameEnemyKai

tkgshn In commenting on the Proof of Useful Work mentioned in the context of how to handle PICSY's computation volume.
- I don't know much about it, but is there any reference to [[TruthCoin]]'s [[merge mining]], which tried to create a decentralized oracle with a Bitcoin sidechain?
    - minor
        - a. As a sidechain of Bitcoin, the marginal cost of mining is zero because of merged mining. Therefore, miners always have an incentive to mine blocks. Even if Bitcoin disappears, there is no incentive to stop mining because they can still become Truthcoin miners.

    - [Merged Mining | Binance Academy](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/merged-mining)

Bluemo
- As an alternative approach, is it possible to let a mechanism like reality.eth do the calculations?
- (If the time/cost can be used to verify the correctness of the calculation in case of a dispute over the results, it seems to be feasible...?)

People who think they're being swept away aren't being swept away.
- I realize there are multiple options.
- I grasp that I am in a less proactive way on one option.
- And since you're not trying to move on it, you're self-determining, kicker aside.
- People who are truly adrift don't realize they have options other than what they've been given.

Ken Suzuki: "Plurality has a good message about trying to make the axis of value Plural."
- JOI said it was 'only calculable,' and that they wanted to 'focus more on Eastern thought.'"
- Does one person have one preference order?
- Talking about QV, is the strength of the demand really one dimensional?

Cabs and inns don't get to choose their customers.
- By creating an "uncomfortable" atmosphere, customers are encouraged to voluntarily avoid the site.
- Should AI have the right to choose its customers?
    - Prohibiting customers from choosing will only make them avoid the human side of the equation as well.
    - Related: [[Right to refuse to provide web services]].

[[DeSci]]
- Drs. are decreasing.
- Mechanisms for participation of researchers not at the university
- Of the 19 trillion yen, the government has 3-4 trillion yen
    - The rest are corporations and foundations.

    - Cost of papers is high.
- Why continue to use a place that costs so much?
    - In the matter of the university's evaluation system
    - [[Matsuo Laboratory]]
    - A system that makes money for itself.
    - That's fine in the short term, but in the long term?
        - If long-term research is really beneficial, we would create our own pooled fund.
        - Assumption that corporations have more freedom to govern in the first place, and that corporations cannot do long-term research.

- Desire to "keep it"
    - Just like there are lots of people who deposit money in the bank even though it doesn't earn interest.

Should I be able to see the votes of my delegates?

- "In the 21st century, economists have come to believe that the monetary and currency systems were not created as a development of barter and exchange of goods!" The "New Monetary Theory" has emerged as a theory that "the monetary system and currency system were not created as a form of development of barter and exchange of goods! A representative reference that explains this "New Monetary Theory" in layman's terms, including prior empirical studies, is "A Monetary Theory for the 21st Century" by Felix Martin, Toyo Keizai-sha (2014)."
