title: "Bias to think a clean framework is the right one"
---

    - [[All models are wrong.]]
    - [[Problems that are not easy are complex]]
- There is a framework for representing complex problems with a well-rounded appearance.
- It pays an additional cost for "[[well-rounded appearance]]"
- So a well-rounded appearance framework is highly out of touch with reality.
- However, many people prefer a well-defined appearance.
- This is because [[Cognitive Burden]] is offensive.
- Excessive [[simplification]] by trying to avoid discomfort
