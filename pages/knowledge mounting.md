title: "knowledge mounting"
---

Both those who feel "knowledge [[mounting]]" when someone tells them something they don't know and those who feel they can "show that they are stronger" by saying something the other person doesn't seem to know both implicitly believe that the amount of knowledge they have determines their strength.

However, there is already more knowledge on the Internet than any one person can store, and it can be retrieved by searching. A "[[specialist]]" who has collected knowledge in a limited number of fields has knowledge in some of those fields that is deeper than what is available on the Internet, and humans are already many orders of magnitude inferior to machines in terms of the overall amount of knowledge.
