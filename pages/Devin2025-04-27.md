- We just barely succeeded in using up all of Devin's tokens before they expired.
    - I feel like it was a good experience.
    - I still can't verbalize what was so good about it.
- Less suffering.
    - Stop "tabbed work-in-progress tasks
    - Devin's WebUI list is getting better, but I don't rely on it.
        - PR'd, merged, etc. are now shown as icons, so it is much easier to grasp the situation.
        - On the other hand, "why are you doing it, how did you think about it, what did you ask for?" is on the human side, so the WebUI can't tell you.
        - I've been confused because I've been switching tabs and such without verbalizing it.
        - Better to keep it free-form with Cosense bullet points.
