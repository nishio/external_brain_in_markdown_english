This concept is a fundamental part of the [[KJ Method]] (Kawakita Jiro Method), devised by [[Jiro Kawakita]]. The KJ Method emphasizes collecting information, grouping related keywords or pieces of information, and finding connections among them to generate solutions or ideas. By adopting a 360-degree perspective, the method prioritizes a comprehensive and multifaceted approach to understanding problems.

Jiro Kawakita, as both a geographer and a cultural anthropologist, recognized the importance of approaching themes or problems from every angle to gain a deep understanding. This approach encourages flexibility and a broad view, enabling researchers to uncover diverse perspectives and solutions for specific issues.

The concept of looking at a theme from a 360-degree perspective is the first principle among the "[[Five Principles of Exploration]]" that Kawakita advocated. This principle underlies his research philosophy, focusing not just on gathering information but also on how to synthesize, interpret, and utilize that information effectively. It forms the foundation of Kawakita's fieldwork and the KJ Method, continuing to serve as a valuable research approach in various fields today.
