title: "It's not the sticky note that matters."
---

When trying to do the KJ method, the first thing that stands out would be the sticky notes.
But the point is not to use sticky notes.

When Jiro Kawakita invented the [[KJ method]] and Tadao Umesao the [[knee-swing (gymnastics)]], personal computers were not yet as widespread as they are today. At that time, the only way to freely move "fragments of text" was to "write them on a piece of paper and physically move it.
That is why pieces of paper were used, and later Post-It was invented and came in handy.

The key is not to use sticky notes.
- To be written, not to disappear.
- To express a "relationship" like a thin thread that has not yet been put into words by "placing things that seem to be related nearby.
- Gathering these fine threads together and making them stronger.
It is. If you can do this, you can use an outline editor or Excel cells, for example.
