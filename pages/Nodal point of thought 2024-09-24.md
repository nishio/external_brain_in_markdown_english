Nodal point of thought 2024-09-24
- I think [[2024-09-08External brain GitHub work]] and [[2024-09 Improve vector search]] and [[Extract questions at various levels of abstraction]] are related.

Utility gained by accumulating information
- If this goes down slowly, eventually the utility gained will be less than the cost of adding it, and it will not be added.
- This is a three-day system.
Scrapbox enhances the ability to discover and reuse past relevant articles compared to blogs.
- It will improve "profit per addition" for a while.
They don't keep improving.
- For example, the KJ method already has over 100 links, and the utility of adding another link is low.
- For example, there are various pages on the subject of "intellectual production" such as Keicho, Kozaneba, and its predecessor Regroup, the KJ method, etc., but they are not well connected by "keyword string matching".

    - I wouldn't have known this, either, if this layer hadn't happened to be written on this untitled page.
    - I really think it's right that it's presented as an abstraction from a bunch of concrete pages, and then I look at it, and if I think it's different, then I revise it, and then the higher-order pages are created over and over again.
        - Raising the layers
        - I tend to write more concrete descriptions because I dislike thinking only in the abstract layer without connecting it to the concrete layer because I consider it "not being grounded".
    - KJ Method Ideas
        - Each of the 20,000 pages of this Scrapbox is like a fragment of the KJ method
        - Higher order structures are discovered as they are bundled together.
        - The discovery process is not all done by the machine, but the interaction with humans.


These areas are improved by TTTC extraction and [[Extract questions at various levels of abstraction]] in ways that were not feasible before the LLM.
