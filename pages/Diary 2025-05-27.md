> There was also confusion over the candidacy of a candidate for the proportional district in the Upper House election. The executive committee, which was looking for "immediate power" to further expand the party's strength, prepared to field four candidates, including Shiori Yamao (real name Kanno), a former member of the House of Representatives from the National Democratic Party of Japan, and Genki Sudo, a former member of the House of Councillors who had been a member of the Rikken Party. However, after some media reports during April, criticism of their past words and actions became prominent on social networking sites.

Q: Why is this immediate?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3/icon' alt='o3.icon' height="19.5"/>
The main reasons they are considered "ready-to-work" can be summarized in four points.
- 1: All four members have experience speaking at plenary sessions and committee meetings of the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors - in other words, they can read bills, ask questions, and respond to the media "without training. Representative Yuichiro Tamaki himself has stated that they are "experienced legislators who will be an asset to our party," and this is the main reason for their speed in getting up to speed on the practical side of things.
- 2: Name recognition and support base to attract votes
    - Shiori Yamao: Has already gained a fixed fan base and a reputation as a policy wonk through her many TV appearances on issues such as the declining birthrate and constitutional debates.
    - Genki Sudo: Former fighter and leader of WORLD ORDER, he has penetrated the younger generation and has over 1 million SNS followers.
    - Yasushi Adachi: Known among political YouTube viewers for his sharp debates during the Restoration era, he is also expected to receive organizational votes in the Kansai region.
    - Michiyo Yakushiji: Coming from a medical doctor background, she has a strong pipeline to medical and nursing care organizations.
    - The ability to capture this "diverse fan base" all at once is a major attraction for the KDP, which hopes to increase the number of seats it holds in proportional districts.
- 3: Complementary policy portfolio
    - Yamao: Constitution and Childcare
    - Adachi: Economic, Industrial and Administrative Reforms
    - Sudo: Sports and Cultural Diplomacy
    - Yakushiji Temple: Medical Care and Welfare
    - The ability to quickly fill in areas where existing party personnel alone were stretched thin has led to an evaluation of "immediate ability.
4. campaign cost compression
    - Unlike newcomers, each of them already has (1) support and funding channels, (2) media exposure channels, and (3) campaign know-how, which reduces the resources invested by the party headquarters - another reason why the executive committee emphasizes that they are "experienced and highly competent personnel.

But there are risks.
- Past reports of adultery (Yamao), anti-vaccine statements (Sudo), and criticism of labor unions (Adachi) have resurfaced on social networking sites, and it is true that the headwind of online public opinion is difficult to read. The party has signed a letter of confirmation that it will give back seats to those who do not abide by the agreement, thus ensuring control of the party and judging that return > risk.

I see...<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Since there are many people in my social network who value correct scientific findings, the first thing I observed was the outrage over Sudo's anti-vaccine comments, which gave me the impression that there was "some kind of trouble here.

The concept of equilibrium


I get soawed when the response on social media is so loud.
- We need to be aware and disconnected.
