> There was also confusion over the candidacy of a candidate for the proportional district in the Upper House election. The executive committee, which was looking for "immediate power" to further expand the party's strength, prepared to field four candidates, including Shiori Yamao (real name Kanno), a former member of the House of Representatives from the National Democratic Party of Japan, and Genki Sudo, a former member of the House of Councillors who had been a member of the Rikken Party. However, after some media reports during April, criticism of their past words and actions became prominent on social networking sites.

Q: Why is this immediate?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3/icon' alt='o3.icon' height="19.5"/>
The main reasons they are considered "ready-to-work" can be summarized in four points.
- 1: All four members have experience speaking at plenary sessions and committee meetings of the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors - in other words, they can read bills, ask questions, and respond to the media "without training. Representative Yuichiro Tamaki himself has stated that they are "experienced legislators who will be an asset to our party," and this is the main reason for their speed in getting up to speed on the practical side of things.
- 2: Name recognition and support base to attract votes
    - Shiori Yamao: Has already gained a fixed fan base and a reputation as a policy wonk through her many TV appearances on issues such as the declining birthrate and constitutional debates.
    - Genki Sudo: Former fighter and leader of WORLD ORDER, he has penetrated the younger generation and has over 1 million SNS followers.
    - Yasushi Adachi: Known among political YouTube viewers for his sharp debates during the Restoration era, he is also expected to receive organizational votes in the Kansai region.
    - Michiyo Yakushiji: Coming from a medical doctor background, she has a strong pipeline to medical and nursing care organizations.
    - The ability to capture this "diverse fan base" all at once is a major attraction for the KDP, which hopes to increase the number of seats it holds in proportional districts.
- 3: Complementary policy portfolio
    - Yamao: Constitution and Childcare
    - Adachi: Economic, Industrial and Administrative Reforms
    - Sudo: Sports and Cultural Diplomacy
    - Yakushiji Temple: Medical Care and Welfare
    - The ability to quickly fill in areas where existing party personnel alone were stretched thin has led to an evaluation of "immediate ability.
4. campaign cost compression
    - Unlike newcomers, each of them already has (1) support and funding channels, (2) media exposure channels, and (3) campaign know-how, which reduces the resources invested by the party headquarters - another reason why the executive committee emphasizes that they are "experienced and highly competent personnel.

But there are risks.
- Past reports of adultery (Yamao), anti-vaccine statements (Sudo), and criticism of labor unions (Adachi) have resurfaced on social networking sites, and it is true that the headwind of online public opinion is difficult to read. The party has signed a letter of confirmation that it will give back seats to those who do not abide by the agreement, thus ensuring control of the party and judging that return > risk.

I see...<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Since there are many people in my social network who value correct scientific findings, the first thing I observed was the outrage over Sudo's anti-vaccine comments, which gave me the impression that there was "some kind of trouble here.

- 1: A set of things that can be achieved at a given cost
    - It feels spherical at a certain distance from the start s in the sense that we're used to that cost consciousness.
- 2: New Means X
    - New tools, etc.
    - The cost is lower for the purpose for which the means are suitable.
- 3:
    - 3-1: People who use that means X for purpose G1 for which it is not suitable at all and say "It's not useful at all, it's better to continue as before".
        - Not understanding what X is good for, or
        - He wants to say NO to new thing X, so he uses it for something deliberately unsuitable.
    - 3-2: People who try to do G2 with X alone and it doesn't work.
        - This one is a little off too.
        - Failure to divide the problem.
        - Just do half of the problems for which X is suitable, and do the other half in the conventional way.
        - In situations where there is a choice of means, you can do a wider range of things than you can do by individual means alone.

[[People who find value in what others find valuable]].

When a person P has 1000 Attention Power and wants 10,000 Ps to listen to him.
- It is impossible to allocate Attention Power 1 to 1,000 people in the first place.
- Allocating 1 Attention Power to 1,000 people is not usually done.
    - The person who is asked is selected according to [[SOC]], such as past relationships, and receives mixed attention: one person receives 100 attentions, another 50, and so on.
    - Receiving 100 Attentions" and "discussing at length" are roughly equivalent.
    - When this "listener" is a politician, it means that many people's voices are not heard.
    - Consider this situation undesirable and improve it.
        - 10000 people discuss at length with the AI, the output of which the AI organizes and makes available for reading in 100 attentions.
        - This composition was in place before AI, 10 assistants each paid 100 attentions to conduct interviews, which were then summarized into something readable with 10 attentions and fed back to P with a total of 100 attentions.


The concept of equilibrium


I get soawed when the response on social media is so loud.
- We need to be aware and disconnected.
