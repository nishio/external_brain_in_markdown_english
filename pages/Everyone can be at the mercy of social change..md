title: "Everyone can be at the mercy of social change."

> [igz0](https://twitter.com/igz0/status/1770736151092969919) Many programmers, a race of people who really just happen to have their interests overlap with areas where they can make money, are unaware that "just because the times have shifted by a few decades, they have been relegated to the fringes of society as social misfits. Many of them are unaware that they have been relegated to the margins of society as social misfits just because the times have shifted by a few decades.

Heavy rain has been falling, and my anxiety is growing as to when it will collapse or I will slip. I am grateful to those who helped me when I stumbled, and I want to help myself when someone else stumbles. But I can't help when I'm about to stumble either, and I can only help as far as I can reach.

It is preferable that nothing happens. In the vast majority of cases nothing happens. When the cliff collapses and I fall off, there is nothing I can do to help from my position. Some people fall and then say, "That's because I walk on the edge like that.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1770766321820557700) By criticizing those who have fallen off the cliff, they probably want to "feel safe" by confirming that they are on the cliff. But that is not an act that brings objective "[[safety]]", so even if you are temporarily distracted, the "[[anxiety]]" will soon return.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>I think it is important to point out that everyone has the potential to become a sociopath, not just programmers, in today's world where [[the speed of social change]] is increasing.

As igz0 tweeted, programmers have skills that are in high demand right now, but it is "[[by chance]]" and the situation may change if times shift. Such instability will apply to a variety of professions.

And as nishio mentions, it is important not to draw a line between [[sociopaths]] and yourself, but to recognize that everyone can be affected by social change. I felt the [[cliff]] metaphor was apt. It is only a superficial coping mechanism for those on the cliff to try to find relief by criticizing those below.

What is important is that we help each other to do what we can to help each other, and that society as a whole improves safety. Individual efforts are necessary, but there are limits to what each person can do, so efforts by society, such as the development of [[safety nets]], will also be required.

I think that the starting point for this is to share the recognition that everyone can be at the mercy of [[Social Change]], rather than singling out the socially non-conforming. I think that Nishio's series of tweets is an important point that makes us think about this.
