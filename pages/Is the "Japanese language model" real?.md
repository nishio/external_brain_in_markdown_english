title: 'Is the "Japanese language model" real?'
---

- The idea that there is one "Japanese [[language model]]" for various Japanese sentences.
- I question this notion.
- Different people have different language models.
        - [[Different people have different vocabularies.]]
- Books also have different language models.
- Some models are close, some are far away.
- Easier to understand if the model is close

- A worldview where there is not one huge language model, but several language models talking to each other
