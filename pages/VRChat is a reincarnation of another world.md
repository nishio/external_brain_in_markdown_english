title: "VRChat is a reincarnation of another world"
---

from  [[People who want to wear avatars and communicate.]]
    - [[VRChat is a reincarnation of another world]]
> 4. what are VRChat natives doing in VR?
>  Then what are the VRC natives, some of whom spend thousands or tens of thousands of hours in the VRC, doing?
>  I think what they are doing is "[[transferring from one world to another]]".
>  I don't think "[[VR]]" is important, but "transforming into what you want to be, living and communicating in that transformed form" is what is important.
>  I have studied and practiced cross-dressing for a long time, and I think that only [[kigurumi]] and VR can completely change one's appearance. So I think VR is very innovative and can be described as a very rich kigurumi experience.
