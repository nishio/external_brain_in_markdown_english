title: 'In some cases, symbols that do not symbolize "one felt meaning" facilitate understanding (v1)'
---

from  [[Study Session 1 on "Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning]]
In some cases, symbols that are not symbols of "one felt meaning" facilitate understanding
    - However, there are cases where symbols that are not symbolic of that "one felt meaning" promote understanding
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>So here's what I mean.
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/1c558545432dc5fcd3bed27bc1fbe993/thumb/1000)
        - SR does not symbolize Fx, but helps Fx symbolize into Sx
        - This is "RELEVANCE."
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I thought that this "understanding" uses UNDERSTAND, which is different from the COMPREHENSION translation of "understanding"...
- Relevance is "that kind of related felt meaning whereby the symbolization is thereby made intelligible."
    - > relevant felt meanings, from out of which symbolization is understandable
- Here's what they say in everyday conversation
    - > To understand, we need "past experience".
    - > " [[context]]" must be understood
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>This is different from COMPREHENSION.
        - What does UNDERSTAND mean here?
- > A set of symbols comes to be understood with the help of many other experienced meanings, not just the one felt meaning they represent (p. 158).
    - This "understanding" is UNDERSTOOD
