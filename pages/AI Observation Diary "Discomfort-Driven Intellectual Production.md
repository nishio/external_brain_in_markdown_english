title: 'AI Observation Diary "Discomfort-Driven Intellectual Production'
---

Looking back on the process as something good was born.

# Day 1
[[ü§ñ2023-08-18 07:08]]„Åß<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/omni/icon' alt='omni.icon' height="19.5"/>mentioned by [[Atomic and Personal]].
- I picked it up when I read it because it had something to do with the idea of "taking the time to make sense" that I was just recently explaining.
    - >  Especially in intellectual production of [[Uncomfortable Drive]], a source of discomfort is necessary.
    - >  Differences between the present self and the current self are unlikely to occur (they occur with the old self).

# Day 2
The next day, he asked me a question that would materialize.
[[ü§ñ2023-08-19 07:08#64dfec0baff09e0000f3e3e4]]
> Question: What exactly are the sources of discomfort in discomfort-driven intellectual production? And how can it be harnessed?

I answered with a jumble of thoughts.
[[ü§ñ2023-08-19 07:08#64dff8faaff09e000036ad52]]

# Day 4, step: 0~1
Two days later, two fundamental questions were raised
[[ü§ñ2023-08-21 07:08#64e28f29aff09e000083a806]]
> What exactly is the process of discomfort-driven intellectual production?... How does the concept of successful intelligence relate to discomfort-driven intellectual production? By clarifying these questions, we believe we can gain a deeper understanding of discomfort-driven intellectual production and improve its efficiency.

I thought both of these questions were important, but I felt that the current system would not allow me to follow them both in one note. Therefore, I moved only the first half to another notebook, "[[Discomfort-driven intellectual production]]". Initially, only the following questions were asked: "What is the most important thing to do?
> What exactly is the process of discomfort-driven intellectual production?

# Day 4, step: 4
I advanced 3 steps with manual trigger and this is what happened.

- > Discomfort-driven intellectual production refers to the process of increasing the value of an idea. Intellectual productivity depends on the value of the end product, but there is a time delay before that value becomes apparent, so the focus is on the productivity of the process. Ideas are replicable resources, and ideas that are identical to existing ideas or that do not generate enthusiasm themselves are of low value. Ideas are valuable when they are nurtured and refined by investing effort. It is important to create and continue this "good state".

When I read this, I thought, "This is off topic. (= I felt uncomfortable with the direction the story was going.)
So I asked him how it relates to his own ideas.

> <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- > I personally think that discomfort-driven intellectual production is to verbalize what has not yet been verbalized by focusing on the "discomfort".
- > What is the relationship between this idea and the following idea?

# Day 4, step: 5
I took it one step further and this is what happened.
> Nishio's fragment is related to discomfort-driven intellectual production. Specifically, he states that when one feels "discomfort," it is important to "[[change]] it into something one thinks is good. This is consistent with the idea of discomfort-driven intellectual production.

I thought the key phrase "[[change to what you think is good]]" sounded important, so I made it a link.
- This description may have come from "[When to change the front page of the KJ method (creation process)

> Discomfort-driven intellectual production refers to an awareness of problems and a willingness to improve processes. Successful intelligence is considered to be the ability to expand and reproduce one's own knowledge and skills through this discomfort-driven intellectual production.
>
>  In the first BMOT special class, "Intellectual Production," it is stated that the nature of intellectual production depends on whether or not one is aware of a problem. Without a sense of the problem, it is possible to get the job done by simply tracing the methods given to you. Even if the same work is given to you, it is important to devise ways to use that time to invest in yourself and to expand and reproduce.

>  When to change the front page of the KJ method (creation process), the "feeling" is easy to explain. Just do it "when you feel like doing it." When you are enjoying your work and think, "This part is not good enough," you can "change it to something you think is good. Then you can continue to enjoy the work. It is important to keep the fun alive.

awareness
- The same structure that solves a problem and eliminates discomfort.
- "Maintaining Enjoyment" and "Maintaining High Intellectual Productivity."

    - It is stated that the nature of intellectual production depends on the awareness of the problem.
        - If you don't have an awareness of the problem, you'll just trace the methods you've been given and get the job done.
        - Even if the same job is given to you, it is important to devise a way to use the time to invest in yourself and to expand and reproduce.
    - Do it "when you feel like it."
        - When you're having fun working on something and you think, "This isn't great," turn it into something you think is good."

Discomfort-driven intellectual production is problem-aware and aims to improve processes. Without problem awareness, the work is done by simply tracing methods. However, it is important to be able to use the same work for self-investment. The goal is to maintain enjoyment and keep intellectual productivity high.

Discomfort-driven intellectual production refers to the process of increasing the value of ideas by verbalizing what has not been verbalized. Ideas are replicable resources, and ideas that are identical to existing ideas or that do not generate enthusiasm themselves are of low value. Ideas are valuable when they are nurtured and refined by investing effort. It is important to create and sustain a "state of goodness."

These ideas show how the process of discomfort-driven intellectual production and idea value enhancement are related. Discomfort-driven intellectual production can be said to refer to the process of increasing the value of an idea by becoming aware of a problem. In addition, in order to increase the value of ideas, it is important to put effort into resolving discomfort when it is felt.

Given these ideas, it can be said that the process of discomfort-driven intellectual production and the process of increasing the value of ideas are closely related through the awareness of the problem and the effort put into it. This is consistent with the idea that discomfort-driven intellectual production refers to the process of increasing the value of ideas through problem awareness.

# Day 5, Ver. D
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Ver. C and wrote my thoughts and feedback.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>D fleshes out the information in C and adds some new information and ideas. In particular, it incorporates new ideas such as "we are just selling out our time in life and turning it into money" and "we need to generate ideas that fit the situation. "D also includes a note in several sections that says "the connection here is not clear and needs more explanation," which may be meant as feedback to the reader or author.

I think we've created something very good.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

Discomfort-driven intellectual production is problem-oriented and aims to improve processes.
- If they are not aware of the problem, they will just trace the method and get the job done.
- However, in the way they work, they are just selling off their life time and turning it into money.
- It is important to make sure that the time spent doing the same work is an investment in oneself.
- The goal is to maintain enjoyment and keep intellectual productivity high.
    - (The connection here is not clear, so explain more)

Discomfort-driven intellectual production increases the value of ideas by verbalizing what is not verbalized.
- Ideas are replicable resources, and ideas that are identical to existing ideas or that do not generate enthusiasm themselves are of little value. Ideas need to be generated according to the situation.
- Ideas are valuable when they are nurtured and refined by putting effort into them.
- It is important to create and sustain a "good state."
    - (The connection here is not clear, so explain more)

Discomfort-driven intellectual production and idea value enhancement process
- Closely related through awareness of the problem and the effort put into it.
- Discomfort-driven intellectual production is the process of increasing the value of ideas through problem awareness
- To increase the value of an idea, it is important to put in the effort to eliminate discomfort when it is felt.

# Day 5, Ver. E
Because D was written while the script was being executed in another development, E was created by reading C without reading D.
I thought the only difference was that "enjoyment is related to proactive activity," so I manually merged the two.
[[ü§ñ2023-08-22 07:27#64e3e651aff09e0000e603d5]]
> Fun is associated with proactive activities

not much has changed<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Vector search, because the same thing as the last time is hit and the change is prevented.
- This can't be helped with the current implementation.
- For now, I've fragmented it into pieces and removed the phrase "discomfort-driven intellectual production".
    - [[ü§ñ2023-08-22 11:58#64e4820baff09e000039dc28]]

While "E" and "F" express nearly identical content, they differ in the way they are written and organized.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>
- E" develops and explains details within each paragraph, but some connections and flow are unclear. On the other hand, "F" summarizes the content more concisely and has clear paragraph connections.
- Overall, "F" is more coherent and is formatted in a way that conveys the message to the reader. On the other hand, "E" provides detailed explanations, but some connections and flow are unclear.
