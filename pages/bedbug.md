> [@ryan_4649](https://twitter.com/ryan_4649/status/1653548308399554566): [[bed bugs]](bedbugs). I think that because of the [[weak yen]] and the easing of travel restrictions on coronas, travelers from overseas are flooding in, and they are being brought into cheap hotels like the Kabukicho Apa, mixed in with their luggage. I think there are many people who will be traveling to Tokyo for events this time of year, but please be careful if you are staying at a hotel. ⚠️

I am releasing a countermeasure document regarding the bed bugs (so-called bedbugs) that are said to have infested a certain hotel in Tokyo.

I'm too scared to hide in a book.
