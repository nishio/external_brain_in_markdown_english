    - The reality of a [[Knowledge Broker]] that builds careers through [[transborder learning]] mechanisms [[community of practice]] and back.
    - [[Tsuneyuki Ishiyama]] (Author)
- [Amazon](http://amzn.to/2BytP1x)

- I bought it because I thought the title was very relevant to what I call "a [[Knowledge Traders]] strategy to increase one's [[knowledge accumulation]] by [[belonging to multiple organizations]] and [[mediating the distribution of information]]" #ParallelCareers
- Today I read this book, and from the title I thought it might be relevant to something I've been working on recently, and it was as I expected. It is a survey of the type of learning that is fostered by moving back and forth across organizational boundaries. It looks like a good way to organize the relationship with peripheral concepts such as communities of practice and gatekeepers.
    - In my mind, "[[community of practice]]" is a term I encountered in the context of [[design thinking]], "[[gatekeeper]]" in the context of [[Organizational Knowledge Acquisition]], and "[[Legitimate Peripheral Participation]]" are concepts that I encountered in the context of the history of changes in the concept of [[study]], and they are not firmly connected. It would be great if these concepts are connected through this book.
