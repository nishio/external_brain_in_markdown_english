- Very good issues of [[dominion]].
- The answers are reasoned and match my pattern of thinking very well.
- I had no idea what "[[Double bottom 1/66]]" was, but later I realized it was Mr. [[Trichoptera (the order of insects comprising the caddisflies)]].
    - I understood the intent of the Alliance's split deck in this article: [Dominion: Alliance, Day 2 of Previews - I think the Marchists are going to Dominion](https://www.sandomi.net/entry/Allies2).
    - By the way, I see that you're a thermarchin on your blog and a sealed clay on Twitter. I didn't know what "double bottom 1/66" meant at first either, but I guess it means the probability that the two cards you bought in your first hand sink to the bottom of the deck and don't come in 3-4T is the inverse of $_{12}C_2$.
