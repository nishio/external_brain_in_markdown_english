- There's a [[community manager]]-like Mr. P and Mr. Q.
    - Each manages a different [[Community]] C1 and C2
- Mr. R is there, and he is good friends with Mr. P and Mr. Q.
- Mr. P frequently calls Mr. R in community C1
- Mr. Q only rarely calls Mr. R to community C2.

「 [[self-inflicted alienation]] 」
- This was a story about Mr. S and Mr. T, and Mr. T was not invited to the community C3 involving Mr. S.
- At this time, Ms. S thought that she could not call Mr. T because of his behavior problems.

In this case, Mr. P and Mr. Q have different decisions on whether to call Mr. R or not.
- Why is this?
- Hypothesis: Mr. R is [[culture fit]] with C1, but not with C2.
- Even if you are close, you can't call them if your [[culture]] is different.
    - Because the question is not whether Q and R get along, but whether C2 and R are a culture fit

The connection to the concept of culture fit made it possible to think of this event in the metaphor of corporate recruitment
- Mr. Q sometimes calls Mr. R when there is a role where "Mr. R's behavior" fits in.
    - That is to say, it's "outsourcing" where you hire someone who has the ability to do the job when it needs to be done, for a short period of time.
        - Isn't this "[[job-based employment]]"?
- In retrospect, the need for culture fit is tightly coupled with [[membership-based employment]].

[Difference between "temporary" and "permanent
- [[People who are always there create the culture]].
