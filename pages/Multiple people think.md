title: "Multiple people think"
---

The Intellectual Production of Engineers] focuses on what can be done alone. This is because it is difficult to use methods that require others from the first step. On the other hand, there are cases in which efficient intellectual production can be achieved through discussions among several people. I was curious to know when this happens. I found some clues in the discussion on the design of [[group work]] at [[CUMOT2019]].

- It's easier to think with more than one person than it is to think alone, which is why we do [[group work]]."
- But the observational fact is that some people don't see the benefit of group work."
- 'Can't you see the benefit of thinking with more than one person if you don't first think until you hit [[the wall]] alone?"
- "The advantage of multiple people is that you can force [[A Fresh Look]] by [[changing one's point of view]], thereby breaking down walls."
- 'So first you have to think to the limit alone.'
- If you listen to something very difficult early in the lecture, and you can't figure it out on your own, then you do group work, there's more incentive to talk to each other about what you don't understand."
    - 'There's no incentive to discuss things when you're listening to something you can understand on your own, when you're doing group work.'
