title: "The Parable of the Fish and the Fishing"
---

- Giving a starving man a fish will only starve him for a day.
- Teach him to fish and he can eat for the rest of his life.
- So instead of giving them fish, we should teach them how to fish.
        - [[Teach them to fish, not give them fish.]]

- I'm hungry. Give me some fish."
- We don't give them fish, we teach them how to fish."
- I'm too hungry for that!" #The Parable of the Lumberjacks

- Customers want fish.
- Even if fishing is better in the long run, it is the customer's responsibility not to seek it out
- Should sell fish and make a profit
        - [[Sell the hole, not the drill.]]

- Don't ignore the time cost of catching fish.
- Time in life is limited.
- Time is more valuable than money.
- Even if you can take the time to fish, you shouldn't.
- What can be bought should [[outsourcing]].

- Just because a customer wants fish doesn't mean that what the customer really needs is fish.
- If customers are starving, grains, etc. are preferable.
        - [[I need a fast horse.]]
