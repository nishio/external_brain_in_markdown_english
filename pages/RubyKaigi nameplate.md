[Write your name in large letters on your nametag, why not prepare your nametag in advance? - RubyKaigi Nikki(2010-08-15)](https://rubykaigi.tdiary.net/20100815.html)
> Every year at RubyKaigi, we use postcard-sized [[name tags]]. This is to have the names written in large letters and to make it easier to recognize them from a distance.
> We have been asking people to write their names with a magic marker at the reception desk every year, but unfortunately, many people do not take advantage of the large nameplates because the letters are too thin or too small.... So, why not bring a name tag that has been printed in advance in a large, bold font and in black and paste it on the nameplate? If you include your Twitter icon or ID as well as your name, it will be even easier for people to recognize who you are.
> The area where you can write your name will be "89mm (width) x 98mm (height)" in this year's design (the photo is a sample based on last year's design). Please prepare two copies, as there are two sides.
- Bring a pre-printed copy
    - Make two sheets and put in both sides.
- If you didn't bring it, you can handwrite it at the reception desk.
