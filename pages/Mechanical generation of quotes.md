title: "Mechanical generation of quotes"
---

2018-10-03
- I was talking about the mechanical generation of [[wise saying]] and felt uncomfortable when I was introduced to the automatic generation of poems and catch phrases ([[AICO]]) as related research.

I know a little bit about what that is.

First of all I am interested in the intelligence of machines.
- Research on giving intelligence to machines included the [[Mind Pixel Project]].
- There, true [[common-sense knowledge]] such as "humans are mammals" was collected.
- However, people did not feel [[value]] for this kind of set of knowledge. [[Common sense is worthless.]]
- Since the customer in the early stages of machine knowledge creation is a human being, it is important to know what the customer values.
- The "quotes" are samples of short sentences that people found valuable.
    - Quotes are pieces of thought that humans have deemed useful.
    - In many cases, it may have gone through the [[Test of Time]].

While "humans are mammals" is true, "[[time is money]]" is not.
- When the metaphor is turned directly into "time is as precious as gold," it is still only a subjective assertion.
- I believe that knowledge creation starts with subjective, personal [[analogy]] and [[metaphor]], which are organized and crystallized after the fact.
        - [[Words that are being spoken]]

- [[People do not value information that is obviously true.]]
- [[Knowledge creation is subjective]]
- [[JTB formulation of knowledge]]
