A "contrarian bet" refers to investing in the opposite direction of the prevailing market view or the opinion of most people; Vinod Khosla states that he makes the following contrarian investments
1. Open AI: In 2018, many did not see Open AI as a business and were concerned that it was a non-profit organization. However, Khosla believed in the potential of AI and fully invested in it.
2. Fusion: invested in Commonwealth Fusion Systems in 2018, but at the time few people thought fusion power was feasible.
3. new AI approaches: even now, Khosla sees potential in neurosymbolic integration and probabilistic methods for AI directions after transformers and LLM.

In other words, Khosla focuses on identifying promising technologies and ideas before they become mainstream in the marketplace and investing in them with a long-term perspective. This entails high risk, but it is also an investment with the potential for great returns.

In addition to Khosla, [[Warren Buffett]] is another representative of contrarian investors. They select investments based on their unique perspective and beliefs, and are characterized by long-term holdings that are not subject to short-term market fluctuations.
