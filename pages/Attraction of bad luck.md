title: "Attraction of bad luck"
---

It is unclear whether the "draw or pull something toward oneself (e.g. chair)" of good luck, which is often mentioned in spiritual contexts, is real, but [[Attraction of bad luck]] is.

> [mhl_bluewind](https://x.com/mhl_bluewind/status/1647163866797981698) There are people who are unlucky, and through no fault of their own, all kinds of bad things happen to them.
>
>  But close observation shows that they are making choices that are a bit uncomfortable in their decision making, and this seems to indirectly attract bad things to them.
> [mhl_bluewind](https://x.com/mhl_bluewind/status/1647164622447984642) It's little decisions like that that make your life squishy by a few centimeters and ultimately doom you to "bad luck". ...

When I asked if he had checked with Timey, Shingo shook his head, saying, "I don't know. I didn't ask because I didn't want to incur Timmy's wrath."

> [Count_Down_000](https://x.com/Count_Down_000/status/1790755850963063170) When dealing with humans, if you continue to communicate without understanding what the other person is saying, the other person may become angry, or in some cases, the other person may say something directly to you. In some cases, the other person may tell you directly.
>  "Apparently, I don't understand [[other people's feelings]]," I guess.
>  In addition, things other than interpersonal problems are not going well, but [[the environment does not speak for itself]], so they consider it as "bad luck" and are always talking about it.

> [Count_Down_000](https://x.com/Count_Down_000/status/1790757513400655881) "I don't know how other people feel" - and at the same time, "I'm the unlucky one" was often the phrase they used.

> [Count_Down_000](https://x.com/Count_Down_000/status/1790941483274784855) I have bad luck! I've heard people say that they have habits that are actually highly repeatable.

> [Count_Down_000](https://x.com/Count_Down_000/status/1790942467950526781) I think it's bad luck when I only hear "I get tangled up with strange old men or suddenly get angry".

[[select a situation where no dice are to be rolled]].
> [VMxmfDbt3wEjDFZ](https://x.com/VMxmfDbt3wEjDFZ/status/1791105240802189747) When I see people play "[[bad luck]]" in certain games, I realize that they play appropriately.
>  Lucky players choose situations where they don't have to roll the dice, and when they do roll the dice, a 3 or 4 or better makes for a good situation!
>  But unlucky players tend to make choices that leave almost all options to the 6 of dice!



[[Preliminary action]]
> [kis](https://x.com/kis/status/1791290516472246345) There was a time when the expression "people who don't use their blinkers" was popular among my friends and I. We used to talk about how people who don't use their blinkers must look like they are in the wrong, like "I'm turning to change lanes and they won't let me in" or "I'm turning and a car pulls in. I have talked about how people who don't use their blinkers seem to think the people around them are in the wrong, like "I'm trying to change lanes and they won't let me in" or "I'm turning and a car pulls in".
> [kis](https://x.com/kis/status/1791448433540444517) Some people put out their blinker after starting to turn, but the blinker does not indicate that you are turning, it indicates that you are about to turn. It is important to put it out before stepping on the brake.
>  This is the same for hazards. They do not indicate that you are stopped, but that you are going to stop.
