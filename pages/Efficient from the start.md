- As systems become more complex, the idea of "[If only we had done this from the beginning.
- Starting over from the beginning only creates another "if only we had done it this way from the beginning".
- Why do these phenomena occur?

- The situation after the system becomes more complex cannot be observed in the early stages of the project

- Optimal design can be found in [posterior
- Later, "I should have done this" is "[[hindsight]]."
