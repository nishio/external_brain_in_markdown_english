title: "People who see the future don't decide the future by majority vote."
---

- [[Majority gets no first-mover advantage.]]

↔ The future is determined by dynamics such as [[(the) market (as a concept)]], which is a kind of majority rule.
- ↔ Not [[one vote per person]].

The following two are not dichotomous, some are neither
- Decisions are made by individuals or a small group of people.
- Decisions are made by a large number of people with equal say.

→Isn't this "[[velvety]]" in the narrow sense?
- A few people make decisions = some with decision-making authority and some without = steps
- One person one vote = everyone has an equal say = flat

A [[future viewer]] does not decide [[future tense]] by [[majority rule]].

[[see future]].
- [[future tense]]
