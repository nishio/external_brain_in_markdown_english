## Research Notes

Regarding the interpretation of "skillful and slow is better than poor," the importance of having a strategic and planning perspective is emphasized. This is the perspective of aiming for long-term success rather than short-term success, which is also an important perspective in research and business. However, having this perspective requires a certain level of anxiety tolerance. People with low anxiety tolerance tend to be "zero-risk oriented" and may have a tendency to pursue short-term success.

Regarding the Cloud Functions code that hits the Scrapbox API, this is for retrieving Scrapbox information, which could be used for data backup and analysis. However, one should be aware of CORS issues when using such an API.

Regarding re-titling in collaborative editing projects, this is a communication issue and illustrates the challenges of people with different perspectives and understandings working together. It illustrates the importance of collaboration and relates to the SECI model.

Regarding the content of the Programming Change Study Group, this shows the evolution of programming languages and the thought behind them. In particular, the comparison between Rust and C++ shows the trade-off between safety and efficiency.

Regarding the Hatena diary, this illustrates the problem of preserving and migrating digital data. It shows the importance of backing up data and is also related to the code hitting Scrapbox's API.

Regarding anxiety tolerance, this shows the connection between human psychology and behavior. This is also related to the interpretation of "skillful and slow is better than poor" and the re-titling of the project in the joint editing project.

Regarding the content of the conversation between Keichobot and ChatGPT, this shows the evolution of artificial intelligence and its potential. This shows the importance of tracking the evolution of artificial intelligence as part of our research.

For the ABC014C problem, this is a test of programming problem-solving skills and demonstrates the application of coordinate compression and the Imosu method.

Regarding the issue of the input field and the most recent statement overlapping with the keyboard, this is a UI/UX issue and indicates a commitment to improving the user experience. This demonstrates the importance of working to improve the user experience as part of the study.

From the above information, a wide range of themes emerge as research directions, including human psychology and behavior, evolution of programming languages, data storage and migration, evolution of artificial intelligence, and UI/UX improvements. Each of these themes is an important element in considering the process of knowledge production from a different perspective.
