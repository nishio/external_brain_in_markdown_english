[Megumi Hayashibara

[In the midst of my daily life as a puppet, I'm lost between zero and infinity.
[The power to break the threads of entanglement still lies dormant in your heart.
Behind the eyes of the Karakuri doll, my heart is shaken by a dream that was set up.
- [The courage to throw away a rusty screw.
