Purpose: Consideration of shared purpose between humans and AI

Microformats are useful for sharing objectives between humans and AI, and clarification of task details and context is important. There are "written" and "unwritten" ways of communicating information, each of which affects problem-solving approaches and task management; setting rules for AI-human interaction and whether AI can support or replace human judgment are important issues. Balancing human and AI is an essential thought that is more important when considered over time.

### Fragment Relevance
.

Fragments such as "changes in the rules of work caused by advances in information technology" and "AI will take jobs away" could affect the way humans and AI share objectives and communicate information. In addition, the "human-AI boundary" is related to the balancing act between humans and AI.

### Deep thoughts and questions

The ability of AI to support or replace human judgment depends on the AI's capabilities and the degree of human acceptance. Also, the balancing act between human and AI depends on the degree to which the AI is trusted and the degree to which the human retains his or her own judgment. These issues may change as AI evolves.

Regarding "AI taking jobs," it is important to take the perspective that AI is not taking jobs, but that humans with high technological affinity are taking the jobs of humans with low technological affinity. This indicates that as AI evolves, the nature of jobs will change and new skills will be required.

Regarding the "human-AI boundary," it is difficult to draw a clear line between humans and AI, and the boundary is likely to be fluid. This indicates that AI capabilities may exceed those of humans.

Purpose: Summary of shared purpose considerations for humans and AI

Microformats are useful for sharing objectives between humans and AI, and task details and context should be made explicit. For information transfer, "written" and "unwritten" methods of information transfer are considered, and the implementation of written APIs and automatic generation and deletion of information are important. The relationship between technology and problem solving is presented, influencing technology selection and problem solving approaches. Insights into task management and prioritization methods are provided, providing a method for improving productivity. The problem-solving process for bug resolution is presented and provides a problem-solving methodology. Insights into the use of metaphors and understanding customer needs are found, providing techniques for problem solving and improving customer satisfaction.

From Nishio's "GPT4 and the Nodes of Thinking that Talk 2023-08-10" and "Scrapbox+GPT4," we see a discussion of setting rules for AI-human interaction and how AI can support or replace human judgment. In "Diary 2023-06-09," we see a discussion of the challenges in implementing AI technology in a responsible manner and the benefits AI technology can bring to society. In "The Omoikane Project," goals are presented regarding the examination of a new methodology for deliberation based on science fiction prototyping and the creation of an AI that reflects Japanese culture and thinking. These provide important perspectives in the consideration of shared human and AI goals.

Nishio's "Nodal Point of Thought on Scrapbox and AI 2023/8/16" shows that a balancing act between humans and AI is needed, and "One Diary a Day" shows that more important essential thinking is done by taking time to think. In "Preparing a Column on ChatGPT," it is shown that the emergence of ChatGPT and AI requires a change in human mental models. In "Diary 2023-06-08," it is indicated that when AI becomes smarter than humans, it is better for AI to set its own rules. In "Diary 2023-03-24," it is hoped that AI will expand documentation. These provide an important perspective in the consideration of shared objectives between humans and AI.

Purpose: Consideration of shared purpose between humans and AI

Microformats are effective for sharing objectives between humans and AI; Nishio's "intelligent collaboration between AI and humans" and "AI is a friend" indicate that task details and context must be made explicit and that "collaboration" with AI is important. For information transfer, "writing" and "transfer by unwritten methods" are considered, and implementation of writing APIs and automatic generation and deletion of information are important. The "Technology and Problem Solving Diagram" shows the relationship between technology and problem solving, which influences technology selection and problem solving approaches. The "Engineer's Guide to Intellectual Production: A Full Hierarchical Table of Contents" provides insight into how to manage and prioritize tasks, providing a method for improving productivity. In "A Mysterious Log Breakdown Bug Happened and I Need to Talk to You," a problem-solving process for resolving the bug is presented and provides a problem-solving approach. In "Transcript of BMOT 4th Session," insight into the use of metaphors and understanding customer needs is found, providing a method for problem solving and improving customer satisfaction.

Purpose: Consideration of shared purpose between humans and AI

Microformatting of objectives is useful for humans and AI to share objectives; Nishio's fragments "AI should manage tasks" and "Collaboration with AI" suggest that humans need to find the details and context of tasks and put them into words. In addition, "Collaboration with AI" indicates that AI can provide a broader perspective and that it is important for humans and AI to "collaborate" to share experiences.

Considerations can be seen from "write-in" and "non-write-in" methods of communicating information. In order to make the system easily usable for information, implementation of a writing API and automatic generation and deletion of information should be considered.

In "Constraints with N around 10~20," the variation of computational complexity with the value of N is shown. This is helpful when considering the processing load due to the amount and complexity of tasks.

The "Technology and Problem Solving Diagram" shows the relationship between technology and problem solving. This influences technology selection and problem-solving approaches.

The "The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production: A Full Hierarchical Table of Contents" provides insight into how to manage and prioritize tasks. It provides specific techniques for improving productivity.

Objective: Advancing the discussion of humans and AI sharing a common objective.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

In order to find intent in the AI's output, it is useful to write the objectives in microformat. This allows humans and AI to share the same objectives.

Nishio's fragments "I wish AI would manage my tasks" and "Collaborate with AI" suggest that humans need to find the details and context of the task and put them into words, rather than having AI provide the information. Also, "What would you like to see happen by doing this?" or "How will this bring you closure?" and other questions can help clarify the purpose of the task and the definition of completion.

The "Collaboration with AI" section indicates that AI can provide a broader perspective and that it is important for humans and AI to "collaborate" to share experiences. For this, a cycle that includes cooporation, such as the SECI model, rather than the PDCA cycle, would be beneficial.

The "write in" and "communicate by non-write in" sections provide insight into how information is communicated. In order to make the system easy to use information, implementation of a writing API and automatic generation and deletion of information should be considered.

In "Constraints with N around 10~20," the variation of computational complexity with the value of N is shown. This is helpful when considering the processing load due to the amount and complexity of tasks.

The "Technology and Problem Solving Diagram" shows the relationship between technology and problem solving. This influences technology selection and problem-solving approaches.

The "The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production: A Full Hierarchical Table of Contents" provides insight into how to manage and prioritize tasks. It provides specific techniques for improving productivity.
