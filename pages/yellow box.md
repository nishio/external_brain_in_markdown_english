yellow box
Yellow Box is a concept related to art exhibition and spatial design, particularly as part of efforts to critically reinterpret and replace the traditional exhibition space "[[White Cube]]" (White Cube). Specifically, it refers to the attempt to create exhibition spaces that actively incorporate cultural context and social elements.

1. features of Yellow Box
(1) Context-sensitive exhibition space
Yellow Box aims to deeply connect the exhibition space to its cultural and historical context, as opposed to the "neutral" and "pure space" philosophy of the White Cube.
Example: Exhibit artworks rooted in a particular region or culture, along with their background and social context.
(2) Emphasis on interactivity
Yellow Box is designed to allow the spectator to be more actively involved in the exhibition space.
The viewer becomes a part of the work, or the entire space can experience the context of the work.
Example: Interactive installations that are experienced through tactile, visual, and acoustic means.
(3) Responding to cultural diversity
This concept aims to expand diversity in the exhibition space by breaking away from the Western-centric "white cube" exhibition format and incorporating non-Western cultural elements and exhibition styles from Asia and Africa.
2. background of Yellow Box
(1) Criticism of White Cube
The White Cube is designed with the intention that the work be presented as a purely aesthetic object, detached from its background and context.
However, this format has been criticized by
Context exclusion: the social and political context of the work is ignored.
Passivity of the viewer: The viewer is relegated to the passive position of viewing the work as a mere "object of appreciation.
(2) Origin of Yellow Box
Yellow Box is often discussed in the context of contrasting traditional Chinese culture and Asian exhibition formats with the white cube format in particular.
For example, there are attempts to promote social dialogue and participation by applying the traditional form of "Gashu" (artistic and poetic gathering) to contemporary exhibition spaces.
3. examples of Yellow Box in practice
(1) Cultural integration
Yellow Box designs exhibition spaces that reflect local culture and history so that artworks can be viewed in a context specific to the region.
Example: Utilize former factory sites and historical buildings as exhibition spaces, and link the artworks to their backgrounds.
(2) Modern exhibition equipment
Utilizing digital technology and interactive devices, the exhibition space itself is experienced as part of the work.
Example: Digital projection or virtual reality (VR) technology is used to allow viewers to explore the entire space.
(3) Community Relations
Yellow Box engages the local community and spectators and provides a venue for dialogue and discussion to occur through the exhibition.
Example: Incorporate workshops and artist dialogue sessions as part of the exhibition.
Philosophical Significance of Yellow Box
(1) Universality across contexts
Yellow Box demonstrates that the exhibition space is not just a backdrop, but functions as part of the artwork.
The space itself becomes an intermediary that creates a dialogue between the viewer and the artwork.
(2) Introduction of non-Western perspectives
This concept aims to incorporate the art views of Asian and other non-Western cultures, whereas the White Cube is based on a Western view of art.
Example: Reflect the "unity of space and nature" shown in Chinese landscape painting in the contemporary exhibition space.
5. impact on the present day
(1) Construction of multicultural exhibition space
The Yellow Box concept emphasizes multicultural perspectives and serves as a guideline for constructing new forms of exhibition spaces for international exhibitions and events.
(2) Dissemination of interactive art
As more and more art forms actively engage the viewer in the artwork and space, the Yellow Box approach provides a theoretical foundation to support this practice.
6. conclusion
Yellow Box is a new model of exhibition space that goes beyond the neutrality and purity of the white cube, relying instead on context and emphasizing dialogue with the viewer. This concept allows for exhibitions that reflect regional and cultural diversity, the active involvement of the viewer, and an exhibition experience in which the space itself becomes part of the work. In particular, as a place that integrates different elements - traditional and contemporary, East and West, technology and humanity - Yellow Box offers an important perspective on contemporary art, architecture, and exhibition design.
