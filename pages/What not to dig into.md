from  [[What we know, what we don't know, pretending to understand, trust in honesty]]
What not to dig into
- [[trust in the individual]], "What this person says in this area will be right."

    - "[[authoritarianism]]"?
        - What is authoritarianism?
            - What is [[authority]]?
        - In this case, the subject who decides "which person's statement in which field to trust" is you.
    - [[Intellectual Integrity]]
        - [[Do not lie.]]
        - It's not about stating that you don't know what you don't know.
            - Because we don't know almost everything.
            - It's a lie to say you "know" what you don't know, but it's not a lie not to mention what you don't know.
                - Social networking sites are full of people who write emotional opinions about current affairs they don't understand, just based on their impression of the article's title, but honest people go through with it, thinking that it's a topic they don't know the details of.
        - When asked a question in a one-on-one conversation, you say you don't know what you don't know.
            - That's because the place is limiting the topic.
            - In the case of dissemination to an unspecified number of people, the sender decides what to talk about.
                - So we can choose not to talk about "what we don't know".
