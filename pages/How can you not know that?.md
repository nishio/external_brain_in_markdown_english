title: "How can you not know that?"
---

A "How can you not know that!"
B "How can you not know that!"

A said, "How can you not know that!" I said.
This means that A does not know X: "why B does not know".
If A is allowed to ask this question of B, then B can similarly ask A, "Why don't you know X?" (if the relationship is equal).
