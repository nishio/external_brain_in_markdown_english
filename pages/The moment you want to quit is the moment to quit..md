title: "The moment you want to quit is the moment to quit."

> [badassceo](https://twitter.com/badassceo/status/1033277949863055360) The moment you think [[want to do]] is the moment to do it. The moment you think [[want to stop]] is the moment to stop. Simple. In Japan, quitting = [[escape]], so it's hard to quit, but don't worry about it. Life is short. You don't have time to endure what you want to do, nor time to do what you don't want to do.
