title: "Knowledge and Information"
---

    - The words [[knowledge]] and [[information]] have similar meanings and are often used without much distinction. Note to self.
- Organize how you use them in your own way.
    - Knowledge is within the individual.
    - It is difficult to transfer knowledge as it is to others.
    - For example, by converting it into "information" in the form of writing, etc., the reader reconstructs the "information" in his/her own mind and makes it into knowledge.
        - In the [[SECI Model]], knowledge is what "[[explicit knowledge (knowledge management terminology)]]" enters into an individual through "[[internalization]]".
        - But I don't feel comfortable using the term "[tacit knowledge (knowledge management terminology)" to describe it.
        - The implicit process of "[[verbalizing]] is difficult" comes into play.
        - Sometimes you can verbalize it smoothly, and sometimes you can't, no matter how hard you try.
        - Independence there

    - Items marked with a circle are information
    - In the brain, it has a network structure with "connections". This is knowledge.
    - The network structure cannot be directly transferred to others. Therefore, it needs to be verbalized.

- I hate [[JTB]] formulations of knowledge.
    - JTB: Justified True Belief
    - Plato
    - [[pragmatism]] is a better fit.
