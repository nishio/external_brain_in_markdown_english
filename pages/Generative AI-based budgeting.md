title: "Generative AI-based budgeting"

> Shinagawa Ward used "Chat GPT" to analyze 6.5 million characters worth of opinions gathered from approximately 100,000 people in a survey conducted last August for all ward residents in preparation for the draft of the supplementary budget for fiscal 2024. It took about one and a half hours to analyze the 6.5 million characters, and the AI analysis, which eliminated human subjectivity and preconceptions, ensured objectivity.
