Read Unexpected Hits.

On second thought, I originally did a grep cross search of cut and scanned books and read some unexpected hits.
- Scrapbox had the effect of "unexpectedly finding related articles I've written in the past" by means of links, also read some hits on this.
    - I implemented [[Vector Search in Nishio]] and found something unexpected in the vector search that was beneficial to read.
    - But the "Search" UI has a "use it when you want to find something" feel to it.
- [[red link extension]] feature, and the AI reads the hits and picks them up unexpectedly.

Chatting after thinking about this.
    - [[In the end, what is needed is improved search accuracy]]
