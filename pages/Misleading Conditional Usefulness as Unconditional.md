- The logic is that Cleverine gel produces chlorine dioxide, chlorine dioxide inhibits the action of viruses, and therefore it is useful to have Cleverine gel in the room.
- In reality
    - Chlorine dioxide at "1.5 ppm" inhibits viral action.
    - Cleverine gel produces "less than 0.03 ppm" chlorine dioxide.
