### Enlightened (ENL)
- Believing that shapers have existed since ancient times and have facilitated human evolution (from the stone age to the modern age), we seek to utilize XM (Exotic Matter) to advance and enlighten through art, music, science, education, etc. We see XM as the key to revelation and evolution and insist that it should be open to all mankind.

### Resistance (RES)
- We believe that the Shaper has a self purpose and that XM is a dangerous entity that causes a "hostile takeover" of the human mind; XM and knowledge should be strictly controlled and we hope that humanity will evolve on its own.

The two sides are at odds regarding the existence of shapers and the use of XM, and this difference in ideology is the root of the enduring conflict.

I know this game is 12 years old, but as of 2025, it's like the "AI is the key to evolution" camp and the "AI is dangerous" camp.
