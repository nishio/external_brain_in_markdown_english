2018-01-02 Explanation over 4 years
- 1: State of [[fragmentary]] descriptions picked up in the book.
- 2: Knowledge in the book is combined but not yet connected to "knowledge outside the book," such as one's own experiences or descriptions from other books.
- 3: Knowledge in the book is connected to knowledge outside the book, but not yet determined in terms of importance.
- 4: The state of being able to determine [[priority (e.g., traffic)]] by actually using the connected knowledge, knowing which roads are well-traveled and which are not.

I think I wrote this somewhere else.

relevance
    - Correctness by [coherence theory (theory that a proposition is true if it corresponds with a specified set of other propositions)
    - [[De-emphasizing the "extracted" theory]]
- I wrote in my column on the intellectual production of engineers: [[KNOWLEDGE CONSISTENCY]].
