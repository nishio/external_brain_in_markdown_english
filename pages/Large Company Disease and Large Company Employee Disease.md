title: "Large Company Disease and Large Company Employee Disease"
---

The "big company disease" seems to be a disease of big companies, but based on the principle of "[[There is no Mr. Company.]]," it is a disease of individual employees working for big companies.

Not everyone is sick. Problems arise when the percentage of sick people increases or when sick people are in charge of decision making.

The disease can be transmitted by new employees. The more infectious [[meme]] is, the more it spreads within the company.

- Excessive risk aversion
- Focus on measures that are likely to produce results (e.g., cost cutting)
- Disregard for outside knowledge
        - [[NIH syndrome]]
- When they think there is a problem, instead of reporting it, they talk about it behind your back.
