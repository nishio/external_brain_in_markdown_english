title: "Active and Passive"
---

After digging into the disagreement, I found that there are two interpretations of the word [[active]] and [[passive]].
- In the context of whether [[information gathering]] is [[active]] or [[passive]]:.

- Interpretation 1:.
    - Passive: information gathering with extrinsic motivation
    - Active: [[intrinsic motivation]] to gather information
- Interpretation 2: The
    - Passive: information gathering done through [one-way communication
    - Active: Information gathering done through [interactive communication

For example, in the situation "I attended a study group and listened to a lecture and left because of my own interest rather than an order from my boss," Interpretation 1 is judged as "active" because it is based on intrinsic motivation, while Interpretation 2 is judged as "passive" because it is only received in one direction.
