- 1: The view from the walking eye, for example, looks like this
    - It features a gently curving path, which is why you can't see what's ahead.
- 2: A map of the scale of daily life looks like this
    - You know, there's an intersection ahead, there's a post office and a park, and if you go further ahead, you'll find the nearest train station.
    - Red circles, roads and intersections were traced from the actual map
        - This is the extent of the curvature of the road at the point where the first picture was drawn
        - Information ignored in the recognition at the scale of this map
- 3: The map of the railroad network looks like this
    - In 2, only one station was mentioned.
    - This figure depicts the connections between those stations.
    - The area marked in figure 2 is about the size of a dot on this map.
    - The original of this diagram can be seen by searching for "Osaka Municipal Subway" on Google Maps
        - So the geographic shape is maintained.
        - If you search for a route map, you will find a diagram that distorts the geographic shape to make it easier to see station connections
            - Even on the same scale, different things to be expressed will be discarded in different ways.
- 4: What you see from the airplane's perspective
    - Sea! Land! Large lakes! Mountains! Cities!
    - If you want to see the original image, you can use Google Maps to see the Kinki area, or search for "Kinki Aerial Photo".
        - The river is easy to see downstream, but upstream is not so clear.

- > KJ diagramming is like looking at a view from an airplane, and narrating is like landing in a city and taking in the sights.

When you read a text, it is a walking eyeshot. We don't know what will be said in the paragraphs a little further on. It is like a winding road where you cannot see the intersection ahead.
- So a decent book will have a well-organized [[Table of Contents]]. It's like a map.
- Reading a book without reading the table of contents is like landing in an unknown tourist area without a map. You can get lost or miss important sights on the right side of the map because you are only looking to the left.

Writing is also from the perspective of a walker. If you start walking haphazardly without a map, you may end up in a place you did not want to go, or you may have to turn around after entering a dead end, which takes a lot of time.
- You may be able to walk without a map in a town you are familiar with, but you cannot do the same in an unknown tourist destination.
- Even if it takes time to prepare a map, if the time lost by getting lost without a map is significant, then preparing a map is a more beneficial use of time.

The engineer's intellectual production technique, p. 170, uses the metaphor of "taking a bird's eye view of the whole [[eyes of a bird]] and moving steadily forward [[bug's eye]], paying attention to the details.
- Then I saw Jiro Kawakita talking about airplanes, and I thought this analogy was better.
    - Because many people have experienced the viewpoint from an airplane, but few have experienced the viewpoint from a bird.
- The insect side was changed to a "walking perspective" accordingly.
