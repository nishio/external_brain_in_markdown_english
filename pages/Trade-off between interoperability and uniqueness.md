title: "Trade-off between interoperability and uniqueness"
---

- [[interoperability]] means to increase the possibility of value creation through combination.
Uniqueness increases the likelihood of demonstrating unique value.
- Interconnectivity is often an overhead in achieving uniqueness

The two are in a [[trade-off]] relationship.
- So "which is better" is a low-resolution argument
- We have to recognize the situation at a higher resolution and find the appropriate [[incorporating the benefits (while ignoring the drawbacks)]] point.
