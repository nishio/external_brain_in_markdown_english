[Even in the U.S., the stakes are high. Even more than in Japan.](http://anond.hatelabo.jp/20090703232636)
- This reminded me of the following
    - > A comparative experiment in experimental economics between Japan and the U.S. shows that Japanese students are more likely than their American counterparts to pull the legs of those who free-ride even at a loss to themselves. // Another similar experiment with Japanese and U.S. graduate students showed that Japanese students were more likely than their American counterparts to try to make their non-participating counterparts lose money, even if it considerably lowers their own profits.

    - Related: [[spiteful behavior]].

- Regarding the original sentence ["...it seems that there is a system built into the national system to spot the real ones among the stakes and support them without hesitation.
    - That is not to say "the stakes are high.
    - The "out of the box" attitude is a form of "the stakes are high," and even if the content of the work is good, it will be beaten just because it is out.
    - It is natural to strike at things where there is a discrepancy between the claim and the reality, or to strike at things that are detrimental to one's own interests.
    - I don't benefit from it, but beating it for the public good of society is, well, not so bad.
    - The problem would be the existence of people who beat them even though no one would gain anything by beating them.
