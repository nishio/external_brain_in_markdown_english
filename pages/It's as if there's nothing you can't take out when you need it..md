- What cannot be [[extracted]] when [[necessary]] is [[the same as]] nothing.
- The ability to not only [[store]] information and material things, but to be able to use them appropriately when needed is important
        - [[Information design]] is "[[the]] art and knowledge of preparing information in such a way that it can be used efficiently and effectively by people" (Robert E. Horn).
    - Make it [[arrangement device]] or [[searchable]] to make it easier to use when needed.

### Digest of Research Notes
.

My previous research note discussed the subject of "anything that cannot be retrieved when needed is as good as nothing". This illustrates the idea that it is important not only to store information and material things, but also to have the ability to use them appropriately when needed.

In this connection, some of Nishio's research notes, fragments of "[[Hatena2011-01-25]]" and "[[Hatena2009-10-07]]", as well as "What you can't find is as good as nothing" are considered relevant. These represent considerations about the management and use of things in terms of deciding whether to throw things away or keep them, and whether or not the stored items can be retrieved when needed.

Fragments such as "If you don't write it down, it will disappear and will not stand the test of time," "Don't fight someone anonymous who has nothing to lose," "Unfeasible ideas," and "Most things are not gained because you simply don't try" show the importance of recording things, challenging yourself, and taking risks. The following is a list of some of the most important things to keep track of.

Taken together, these considerations suggest that managing things, keeping track of them, challenging them, and taking risks are key elements in effectively using knowledge and material things to improve productivity.
