    - Some people say things like, "What I've learned in business school so far is useless."
    - But the principles have not changed.
    - Applicable conditions have changed.
    - Better to learn the principles first, then how conditions have changed.
        - Conditions will continue to change.

- general principle

    - Business Models for Advertising

    - [[Product sales model]]

            - [[Groupware reduces internal information asymmetry]]
- One example is advertising

radioactive contamination
- Although the technical cost is low
- High reputational costs
    - The cost of making people believe they are safe is higher than the cost of making them safe.
- Majority of the 21 trillion yen cost

advertising model
- physical matching
    - near
        - → [[location (e.g. of industry)]] Important
- Online Matching
    - search (e.g. for someone using a search engine)
        - →SEO is important

- Products chosen to create Amazon
    - Low quality uncertainty
    - Small and expensive (low percentage of price of transported volume)
    - Lots of variety (searchable online stores are more advantageous than physical stores)
- Examples: CDs, etc.

- [[counterparty risk]]
- [Counterparty risk - Wikipedia [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%AB%E3%82%A6%E3%83%B3%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%E3%83%91%E3%83%BC%E3%83%86%E3%](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%AB%E3%82%A6%E3%83%B3%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%E3%83%91%E3%83%BC%E3%83%86%E3%) 82%A3%E3%83%AA%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF]

Data Monetization
- credit limit
- advertisement

Banks
- Payment Services
- Information on the movement of money can be found
- How can we make use of this information?
- →Financing.

There used to be incidents of bank employees copying passbooks and selling them to registrars.
- Compliance is strict now.
- Cannot sell information for money.
- The "use the information yourself" line.
    - The same principle applies to accounts receivable.

- [[economy of scope]]
- Lower costs of doing disparate businesses together.

Purchase behavior information → alcohol and tobacco purchases → health risks → insurance

If uncertainty is reduced too much, insurance and financing will not be established.

- [[(the) market (as a concept)]] and [[organization]]
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/41405976da24211c26372a400b7dbcdd/thumb/1000)
- The market is the sea and the organization is the land.
- The state in which everything is organized is [[communism]].
        - [[planned economy]]
- It's not efficient (?) when it's all in the market.
    - Why？
        - The [[amoeboid organization]] in [[Kyocera (company name)]] is an approach that markets smaller units of organization rather than the entire company as one organization.

- [[planned economy]]
- Gather all the information and try to make a plan.
- But it is not practical to collect and analyze all the information
    - Implicit assumption: because human information-processing capacity is poor
- Difficult to gather local information
        - [[high efficiency]] "[[Knowledge of the specific circumstances of a time and place]]" is difficult to communicate.
    - "There's a need in this place at this moment, so if you open a store, you'll make money!" Something like that.
        - In a planned economy, it takes too long for that information to get to the command center and for action to come down, and the timing is missed.

- question
    - Planned economies have gone awry due to poor human communication skills.
    - The development of information technology has enhanced information transfer.
    - Would a planned economy be advantageous?
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I'm not sure about the national level, but I have skin in the game that it's the other way around at the corporate level.
    - At Cybozu, where groupware is used to communicate information all over the place
        - Movement to "abolish the manager position" rather than strengthen the supervisor's command and control.
            - ["Don't you need another manager?" We asked the Development Division, which abolished managers, about salary evaluation and transfer mechanisms | Cybozu Style](https://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m005359.html)
            - [Cybozu's development headquarters tried to eliminate managers "If you can't do it without them, just make them again" | Cybozu Style](https://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m005343.html)
        - As described in [[teal organization]], the pyramid hierarchy is being dismantled in various companies.
    - Why is this?
    - Because the bottleneck is not "human information transmission capacity" but "human information processing capacity."
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/8d82de47ee02dc6e0e53d6e28668dd65/thumb/1000)
        - In an era when means of information transmission were poor, humans were the medium of information transmission.
            - The hierarchy is deeper because of the poor ability of humans to communicate information.
            - Deeper hierarchies resulted in greater delays.
        - Technology such as groupware (and [[radio]] and television) has made information transfer more efficient.
            - In that era, it's easy for a large number of employees to receive the president's thoughts.
            - Receiving the president's real voice on a daily basis has facilitated the sharing of vision.
        - One hundred employees can hear the voice of one president, but one president cannot hear the voice of one hundred employees.
            - ![image](https://gyazo.com/8d244c287e29e32269b83074162de7fb/thumb/1000)
                - Notification brings [information flood
            - It may have been several times more efficient than in the days when information was communicated by voice or paper,
            - The volume of information circulating within the company has increased by two to three orders of magnitude as all employees disseminate information.
            - Current technology is not yet in a position to handle this.
    - How organizations change when decision makers' ability to process information is the bottleneck
        - Delegate decision-making
            - Process information without centralizing it
            - Made possible by sharing the vision and the information needed for decision-making in advance
            - Groupware has eliminated information asymmetry between management and employees.
                - 「 [[Facilitation of transactions]] 」
                - No labor-management conflict
    - summary
        - The reason the planned economy didn't work is not "human [[information transmission]] capacity" but "human [[information processing]] capacity."
        - Information technology has enhanced the ability to communicate information, but not so much the ability to process it.
        - As a result, authority will be transferred to avoid localization of the burden of information processing
        - This trend will be reversed when decision-making itself is done by computers.
            - That's still a long way off.

division of labor
- Fixed costs to variable costs
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Skin feeling that doesn't really fit in the context of parallel work.
        - Increase uptime by car sharing cars that are not working while parked in front of the company.
        - The "increased occupancy" aspect of the car owner's position that
        - The "fixed cost to variable cost" position is on the side of those who use car sharing without owning a car.
        - Working in between childcare, for example, is certainly an improvement in utilization, but it doesn't feel right.
