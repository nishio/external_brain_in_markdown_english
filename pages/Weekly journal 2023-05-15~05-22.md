I say weekly, but lately it's been in two-week increments all the time.
- from  [[Weekly journal 2023-04-29~05-14]]
    - > Meeting Mr. Seki on 17... The Rapid Increase in the Need to Speak English
    - This was a foreshadowing of [[Manazuru 2023-05-13]].
            - [[jump at the chance to ask for advice]]
    - He made time to introduce himself, and I was able to do it because I had written a draft beforehand.
    - I can't say I did a very good job of discussing it.
    - I was so nervous, I was like, "Awww.
        - This is not a matter of English proficiency, but of interpersonal communication skills.
    - I was able to communicate my intent to ask questions and get useful information.
- I signed up for an English conversation school with a plan that allowed me to put in two classes every day, but during the last week I decided that I was done with the English cramming phase and used that time to read interviews.
    - I think it was the right decision.
    - Check the rest
        - 17 panels by 7/19
        - It's roughly 60 days, so you should be able to digest one session every four days, or two sessions a week.
        - I'm tired, so let's not think about anything for once.
        - If you can't come up with anything, just put in two panels on the weekend.
- I'll look back at some earlier weekly notes.
        - [[Weekly journal 2023-04-17~28]]
        - You're too descriptive.
        - At that time, [[tkgshn]] invited me to [[Plurality Tokyo]], I joined, saw the VESS card and said "I want one", and [[hal_sk]] asked me "Do you want one? I was invited by [[Manazuru 2023-05-13]] there.
- Looking at the front of it, I wonder if the overflow of capacity is happening around the 3/10 Unexplored Conference and 3/15 GPT-4 release after all.
    - No, you've been going crazy since before that.
            - [[Weekly journal 2023-03-05 to 2023-03-10]]
            - Ah, [[secret meeting 2023-02-21]].

I think [[brainstorming alone]] and [[Clean Language as a Board Game]] lead to [[broad listening]].
- As it stands now, it's "What? What are you talking about?" They will think "What are you talking about?
- By using LLM, one person can brainstorm alone, and then symbolically model the brainstorm using "a clean language designed for verbal conversation, redesigned for visualization on a PC screen by a single person". After that, "[[careful deliberation]]" can be achieved by incorporating other people's opinions in a Polis-like manner.
    - As I was writing this, I thought "[[Symbolic modeling as a board game]]" would be better.
