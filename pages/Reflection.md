Excerpts from the lyrics
    - [The ones who don't have dreams are the ones who come to me, drunk on reality and with a smug look on their face.
    - [[I'd rather walk like me, even if I'm clumsy, than live well.]]


- There's too much noise to live in the moment, too much noise to confuse life.
    - [The Trap in Kindness.

    - [[The real answer within you.]] If I could face [[I am going to change little by little from now on.]]
