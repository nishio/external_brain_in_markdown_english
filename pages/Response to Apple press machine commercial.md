> [tim_cook](https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1787864325258162239) Meet the new iPad Pro: the thinnest product we’ve ever created, the most advanced display we’ve ever produced, with the incredible power of the M4 chip. Just imagine all the things it’ll be used to create.

> [Takuta](https://twitter.com/Takuta/status/1787898004231569432) I felt sad when I saw creative tools such as musical instruments and cameras being destroyed. I don't think the creators will like this video. Is it my Japanese sensibility that makes me feel this way?

> [o_kilo_byte](https://twitter.com/o_kilo_byte/status/1787898022753616384/photo/2) iPad introduction video at Apple event, too vulgar and in bad taste. Pianos, guitars and other musical instruments, DJ equipment, cameras, art materials, balls of emoticons, etc. are crushed and destroyed by a press machine... It is a production that disrespects analog creativity and makes a mockery of the entire cultural arts. I don't want an iPad when I see this.

> [sm_hn](https://twitter.com/sm_hn/status/1787890500735000892) I thought it must have been an outburst on the site that caused the video to be so arrogant and less than shitty and vile that it didn't seem like the #1 brand company in the world, but then Tim Cook usually posts it too. There was no way out. You should watch it before it disappears because it's a gross video that you'll look back on later and think that this really was the pinnacle of Apple's history (view warning).

> [shiology](https://twitter.com/shiology/status/1787858071186030832) The video of the instruments being crushed and destroyed, it was hard. I felt pain in my whole body. It is beyond sadness that Apple, who loves music, would make such a video expression. I hope Apple has not become so arrogant. Please take good care of your instruments.

> [shiology](https://twitter.com/shiology/status/1787869458637459649) I have been a consistent fan of Apple and Apple products since I started using a Mac in 1988, and I have conducted 100% of my classes on an iPad since 2013. I have been a fan of Apple and Apple products since I started using a Mac in 1988, and have been teaching 100% of my classes on an iPad since 2013, but at the same time I have played the violin since 1972 and love the piano, guitar, and various other musical instruments.

> [masui](https://twitter.com/masui/status/1787902522520490168) It's terrible. I feel disgusted to use Apple products. I feel disgusted to use Apple products.

> [Toshl06](https://twitter.com/Toshl06/status/1787880597005980071) It's a great shame because Apple was the image that I most valued as a live instrument. I don't want to think of it as a result of Jobs leaving and sensibilities getting thinner and thinner, but it's hard to see Tim tweeting that image.

> [tanukiponkich](https://twitter.com/tanukiponkich/status/1787864325258162239) You know, it's not just Apple that has love for its products. How can people who love music and care about their instruments think this video is good... What's wrong with you, Apple?

> [tanigon](https://twitter.com/tanigon/status/1787914803601912065) I'm going to hate the whole iPad Pro because it pisses me off so much that I'm going to have to peshank the instrument. The guy who directed this movie...
>  Is Apple okay with a movie clip of an iPad Pro exploding in the middle of the screen and saying "Our new product"? That's what you mean, isn't it?

> [HomeiMiyashita](https://twitter.com/HomeiMiyashita/status/1787865748091936851/history) "Instrument for Expression" is destroyed and messed up to the point of grossness (especially the eyeball popping out is really gross). Didn't Company A used to be a good thing in the culture where their products were loved as instruments? I think they would be saddened if their products were treated like this.

## Reaction written in English
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The main reactions to this video can be summarized as follows
1. many people were saddened and offended by the scene where musical instruments, cameras, and other creative tools are destroyed. Some said that creators would not like this video.
- Some people say that there is no point in making the iPad even thinner.
3. requests for improvements to the software features of the iPad, not the hardware. For example, some posts pointed out the absence of a calculator app.
4. criticism that the content of the video did not relate well to the actual product; some felt that watching the one-minute video was a waste of time.
- On the other hand, there were some positive comments that expected great things to be made with the new iPad Pro and Apple Pencil.

In general, many people felt uncomfortable with the scene in which creative tools are carelessly destroyed, giving the impression that the content of the video did not fully convey the product's features. However, the reactions were not entirely negative, as some people expressed their expectations for the new product.


> [kouta_hikichi](https://twitter.com/kouta_hikichi/status/1787864325258162239) The advertisement is not good because it "destroys diversity" and makes us feel the arrogance of being concentrated on "one answer". Their philosophy should have been to respect and honor creativity that is different from others, in other words, "different" as in the phrase "Think Different" by Apple.

> [kouta_hikichi](https://twitter.com/kouta_hikichi/status/1787986802030391476) I guess this ipad Pro itself is a great product. I like Apple, so I hope they will deliver another great advertisement.

> [kouta_hikichi](https://twitter.com/kouta_hikichi/status/1787994551648768346) Isn't this ad particularly difficult for Japanese to accept? Japan has a spirituality in which objects have life in them in an animistic worldview. It is easy to imagine that crushing it from above with a huge force (as seen in Apple, the tech giant) would cause considerable rejection.

> [kouta_hikichi](https://twitter.com/kouta_hikichi/status/1787995682487652371) How will Apple respond to this fire? I think it will be a very important action as a brand. This is where the true value of a brand is tested. Will they ignore it? Retract it? Apologize? Is it going to issue a statement? There are many ways to respond, but the key will be whether you can respond based on your brand philosophy.

> [kouta_hikichi](https://twitter.com/kouta_hikichi/status/1788002018101194777) As a creator, I can imagine to some extent, but perhaps the purpose of this project was to appeal to people's surprise at the "thinness of the product. I am sure that the purpose of this project was to appeal the surprise of "thinness of the product". Therefore, they gathered many bulky instruments and lined them up, and then pressed them to express the fact that they are extremely thin.

> [kouta_hikichi](https://twitter.com/kouta_hikichi/status/1788003015422791721) I think that the grotesque expressions such as ink popping out and eyeballs popping out of pictograms were intended to have a kaleidoscopic effect as images. I think that the grotesque expressions are intended to have a "kaleidoscopic" effect as images. Certainly, expressions such as "beauty of destruction" have been used for a long time, and I can understand that. (It is not so effective and beautiful because of the lack of a high-speed camera, though.) This also made the impression worse.

> [kouta_hikichi](https://twitter.com/kouta_hikichi/status/1788004154901979349) I imagine this project was aimed at the WOW feeling that the last destroyed items are gone and the remaining items are concentrated in the small and thin ipad Pro. I can imagine that this project was aimed at a "WOW" feeling. I think that the logic of the storyboard was probably well established, but when we actually shot the film, the expression was probably tougher than we had imagined.

> [kouta_hikichi](https://twitter.com/kouta_hikichi/status/1788004741198549435) If there had been someone in the planning process who was aware of the brand's philosophical perspective and the dangers of expression in staging, we would have been able to put a stop to it. I think it would have been possible to put a stop to it. I was a little concerned about how Apple's brand management is going right now and whether there is someone in charge of creativity who is aware of this area.
