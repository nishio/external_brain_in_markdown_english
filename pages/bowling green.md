[[Bowling Green]]
[[BG2050]]
    - Much like [[Shin Tokyo 2050 Broad Listening]], using AI for long-term visioning [[broad listening]].

Just a quick point 👇.
- What article?
    - Case study of Bowling Green, Kentucky (population approx. 75,000, projected to double in 25 years), where citizen feedback was collected by [[Polis]] and summarized and categorized by Jigsaw's AI tool [[Sensemaker]] for the "BG2050" long-term plan (published 4/15/2025). ([Medium [https://medium.com/jigsaw/how-one-of-the-fastest-growing-cities-in-kentucky-used-ai-to-plan-for-the-next-25-years-3b70c4fd](https://medium.com/jigsaw/how-one-of-the-fastest-growing-cities-in-kentucky-used-ai-to-plan-for-the-next-25-years-3b70c4fd) 1412])

- implementation method
    - Conducted a one-month online dialogue "What Could BG Be?" Approximately 8,000 people participated, voting for and against thousands of unique proposals over 1 million times. Input is open-ended design. ([Medium [https://medium.com/jigsaw/how-one-of-the-fastest-growing-cities-in-kentucky-used-ai-to-plan-for-the-next-25-years-3b70c4fd](https://medium.com/jigsaw/how-one-of-the-fastest-growing-cities-in-kentucky-used-ai-to-plan-for-the-next-25-years-3b70c4fd) 1412])

- Role of AI (Sensemaker)
    - Automatically clusters submissions into 12 topics and 72 subtopics to visualize support and polarization (mixed opinion). Generates reports in minutes, shortening analysis that would otherwise take days or weeks. ([Medium [https://medium.com/jigsaw/how-one-of-the-fastest-growing-cities-in-kentucky-used-ai-to-plan-for-the-next-25-years-3b70c4fd](https://medium.com/jigsaw/how-one-of-the-fastest-growing-cities-in-kentucky-used-ai-to-plan-for-the-next-25-years-3b70c4fd) 1412])

- Major Findings
    - A surprisingly wide agreement was found with the majority (2,370) having an agreement rate of over 80%. In addition to transportation and roads, nightlife/entertainment, art and festivals, green space, and community pride emerged as priorities. ([Medium [https://medium.com/jigsaw/how-one-of-the-fastest-growing-cities-in-kentucky-used-ai-to-plan-for-the-next-25-years-3b70c4fd](https://medium.com/jigsaw/how-one-of-the-fastest-growing-cities-in-kentucky-used-ai-to-plan-for-the-next-25-years-3b70c4fd) 1412])
    - Differentiation of interest between K-12 and higher education (practical skills education vs. economic impact of college). ([Medium [https://medium.com/jigsaw/how-one-of-the-fastest-growing-cities-in-kentucky-used-ai-to-plan-for-the-next-25-years-3b70c4fd](https://medium.com/jigsaw/how-one-of-the-fastest-growing-cities-in-kentucky-used-ai-to-plan-for-the-next-25-years-3b70c4fd) 1412])
    - Local context + human review is essential (e.g., understanding the background of riverfront development). ([Medium [https://medium.com/jigsaw/how-one-of-the-fastest-growing-cities-in-kentucky-used-ai-to-plan-for-the-next-25-years-3b70c4fd](https://medium.com/jigsaw/how-one-of-the-fastest-growing-cities-in-kentucky-used-ai-to-plan-for-the-next-25-years-3b70c4fd) 1412])

- Impact measurement (post-questionnaire)
    - Seventy percent of participants said that they felt more confident that their voices would be heard, and 83% said that they had a better understanding of different perspectives / better planning. Leaders rated the report as saving an average of 28 days of man-hours. ([Medium [https://medium.com/jigsaw/how-one-of-the-fastest-growing-cities-in-kentucky-used-ai-to-plan-for-the-next-25-years-3b70c4fd](https://medium.com/jigsaw/how-one-of-the-fastest-growing-cities-in-kentucky-used-ai-to-plan-for-the-next-25-years-3b70c4fd) 1412])

- Scale Effects
    - Enables incorporation of almost 80 times the number of citizens into a plan originally considered by 100 leaders. Suggests lateral expansion to other cities as a prototype for large-scale, continuous consensus building. ([Medium [https://medium.com/jigsaw/how-one-of-the-fastest-growing-cities-in-kentucky-used-ai-to-plan-for-the-next-25-years-3b70c4fd](https://medium.com/jigsaw/how-one-of-the-fastest-growing-cities-in-kentucky-used-ai-to-plan-for-the-next-25-years-3b70c4fd) 1412])

- Suggestion (if you want to put it into practice).
    1. design questions broadly and freely, and collect a large number of evaluations (pros and cons)
    2. quickly summarize, cluster, and map agreement and conflict with AI
    - 3) Interpret with local knowledge and take measures from high-consensus areas, and dig deeper in polarized areas.
    4. measuring psychological and administrative effects through post-event questionnaires - quantitatively demonstrating "a sense of having one's voice heard" and usefulness in decision-making (also effective in providing a budgetary basis)

If necessary, we will create prompt design and dashboard indicators (consensus rate, mixed opinion level, topic granularity, geographic tags, etc.) for this BG case study in a ready-to-use template for Japanese local governments/organizations.
