title: "reciprocity"
---

> Reciprocity is a concept used in cultural anthropology, economics and sociology. In anthropology, it refers to a relationship of obligatory gift-giving and mutual support. In Japanese, the term "reciprocity" is also used.
- > Reciprocity is characterized by group symmetry. The movement of goods and services between groups promotes give-and-take and creates interdependence.
- > [[Karl Polanyi]] identified reciprocity as one of the main patterns of social integration, along with redistribution and exchange. Marshall Sahlins added to the analysis by classifying reciprocity into three categories: generalized reciprocity, which is common among close relatives; balanced reciprocity, which is an equivalent exchange; and negative reciprocity, which is common in adversarial relationships.
