<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>Supermodularity ([[supermodularity]]) refers to a situation in which it is more efficient to provide a good or service en masse on a large scale than on an individual basis.

The main points are as follows
- With the development of technology, more and more goods and services are becoming super-modular. This leads to increased efficiency, but also carries the risk of monopolies and private enclosures.
- Super-modular goods go beyond the concept of [[public goods (i.e. goods or services such as parks or highways)]] to include [[private goods]] that are [[excludable]] but have [[economies of scale]].
- A combination of market mechanisms and public supply is necessary for the optimal supply of supermodular goods.
- [[Excludability]] and [[contestability]] can change continuously. The nature of goods depends on how they are owned and used.
- Supermodular goods often have [[anti-rival]] properties. The more users they have, the more valuable they become.
- Potential applications include AI, Internet governance, [[carbon markets]], etc.

In short, the authors argue that a collective knowledge approach combining public, private, and community-based decision-making mechanisms is promising for the efficient provision and democratic governance of supermodular goods.
