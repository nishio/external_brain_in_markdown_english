title: "attention vote"
---

- [[attention]] is [[limited resources]] and there are multiple ones competing for attention
- At this time, "which individual people direct their attention to" will determine "which will get the most resources.
- This composition is [[social decision-making]] of [[resource allocation]], a kind of [[voting]] (with the nuance that [[the market is a kind of voting]]).
