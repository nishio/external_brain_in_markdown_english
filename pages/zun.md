Let's see, discomfort-driven intellectual production is about valuing ideas, isn't it? If you work hard on a lot of ideas, you can make better ones. But why do ideas change in value? Creating ideas is like drawing or making crafts. But why is the same work sometimes not intellectual production? How do people come up with good ideas? It's very strange.

Um, this text is talking about the idea of "utilitarianism". They're talking about how utility and pleasure are related, and that there are many different kinds of pleasure, and not all of them are the same. But why is the word "pig" mentioned? Does "pig" mean something special? What do they mean by "quality of pleasure?" Why would human pleasure be compared to the pleasure of a pig? I don't know, but it means that humans can feel various kinds of pleasure. But it is important to understand that not all pleasures are the same. Why should we evaluate pleasure not only in terms of quantity but also in terms of quality?
