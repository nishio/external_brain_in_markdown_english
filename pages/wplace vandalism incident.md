- Wplace is a "world map x pixel" collaborative canvas to be opened on 7/21/2025. Rapid expansion in a short period of time has led to a normalized overcrowding of simultaneous connections and battles for position.
- The official rules prohibit "ruining other works with random colors or patterns," "multiple accounts," and "bots.

Organization of accounts claiming to be "trolls"
- Some accounts have appeared on X declaring and sharing the overwriting, such as "wplace troll Fatty branch".

- Distribution of automation tools (bot/user scripts)
    - Officially, bots are prohibited, but scripts for automatic drawing and leveling have appeared on GitHub and commentary sites to increase the "firepower" of destruction/defense (use of such scripts is a violation of the terms of use).
- Examples and cautions of "systematically erased by the anti
    - Specific examples (published claims)
        - The site in question reports: multiple large-scale vandalism by a clique, with prior "re-attack declarations".
            - [I want to vent my frustration about the vandalism in wplace. about 150x175... - Yahoo! Wisdom Bags](https://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q10318858325?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
            - > I want to air my grievances about vandalism in wplace: after 5 days of collaborating on a 150x175 or so illustration, several works, including our own, were vandalized 4 times by one clique on a massive scale.
            - >  It was a random dotting and other fills from a dozen or so accounts all at the same time. At the time, I had it banned by reporting it, but a short time later, there was a statement on Twitter from that group of vandals that they were going to vandalize again within 24 hours...
            - >  I don't have much experience with such online game events, so I don't know the mindset of the other party, but if I keep trying to repair the damage, will they give up someday?
        - Example of flames on X: A summary article claiming that a popular V work was vandalized by a **specific fan group (and name it)** and an introductory bot flame → apology and total removal. *Media quality is equivalent to a blog.

        - Note (Verifiability)
            - While "organization" is often claimed by the parties involved, there are only a limited number of cases in which a third party can verify the external coordination plan (instruction logs, etc.). While some raids are planned, it is highly likely that there is a mixture of "spontaneous and simultaneous" raids that occur as a result of large-scale diffusion and imitation.

> [hase_miya90011](https://x.com/hase_miya90011/status/1961785389674541530) Thanks for your help. There is something like fragility and sadness.

> [mymymyooon](https://x.com/mymymyooon/status/1961801368559387015) I guess the work of nature is impermanent.

> [moya4_Turkey](https://x.com/moya4_Turkey/status/1961376432027783231) void vandalism is a violation of Wplace's terms and conditions.

> [budoucha](https://x.com/budoucha/status/1962174335776641060) wplace's vandalism problem, there are a lot of people around who are willing to use the opportunity to draw, which recovers only one pixel every 30 seconds, to [[drag others down]]. The fact that this is the case is the scariest thing of all.

> [sakamuke0157](https://x.com/sakamuke0157/status/1961688681305313638) I thought for a moment that the vandalism that's been going on in WPLACE lately was bad.

>  "If people are free to take up such a huge width and write, then they should be [[free]] to erase it."
>  "If the first one to draw wins, then they have to reset everything after a certain period of time or something, or no one will be able to write new ones?"
>
>  I find myself unable to deny the opinion, except on an emotional level.
