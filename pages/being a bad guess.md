title: "being a bad guess"

A (I hope you know what I mean.)
B (They seem to want us to say it's a proposal from us, but I don't want to. Let's ignore it until explicitly requested.)

A (You're not very perceptive, are you?)
B (I guess he thinks it's not a good guess.)

A (You're really not very perceptive.)
B (I guess he doesn't realize he's being ignored after he guessed it, he's really not very perceptive)
