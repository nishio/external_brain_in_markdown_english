Twitter Bot that creates an image like this when you specify a Tweet

It's interesting to see Quote-style images generated in replies and quoted tweets, but there is no link to the original tweet, so spreading that image would take it out of context and lose the flow of the story.
- It's the perfect tool to catch a celebrity you don't like at the end of a word and flame them (no).
