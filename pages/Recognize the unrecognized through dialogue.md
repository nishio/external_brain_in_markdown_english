title: "Recognize the unrecognized through dialogue"

- [[Failure to recognize]] by [dialogue
- [/tkgshn/recognizing the unrecognized through dialogue](https://scrapbox.io/tkgshn/recognizing the unrecognized through dialogue).
In the Nishio way of writing, "by dialogue [[become aware of a blind spot]]."

I feel that it is common to "notice blind spots through dialogue".
- What is this "dialogue"?
    - It is not required to be voice
    - The other party does not have to be human (like [[Keichobot]]), but there is some kind of quality change.
    - It doesn't have to be one-on-one.
        - [[Learning through dialogue]]
        - > Condition 2: If you have faith that "the other person's reasoning is working correctly
        - Ah, this seems to be the basic premise.
    - > Mostly in face-to-face conversations ([[chatting]]), when someone uses a word I don't know, I often say, "I see..."
        - I don't have much sympathy for this.
            - In a recent specific example, I was impressed by a "word I thought I knew well" like "interesting" and found a surprising discrepancy when I carefully delved into what I thought about it with someone who is not me. I imagined the phenomenon of "I feel satisfied with the scenery from the other person's point of view.
                - What you get is not a "new word" but a "new perspective on an existing word."
            - When something like this happens, search for "interesting" in your past writings and look at them from a new perspective, and you may discover even more new things!
        - This is probably the kind of situation I'm talking about.

                - 1: Mr. A mentions X
                - 2: Mr. B, who was listening to it, mentions Y as relevant to it
                - 3: Mr. A does not know Y, so he asks a question
            - Mr. A is certainly getting a new Y in this situation.
                - But I think this is "get the top of the pyramid."
                        - [[Taking the top of the pyramid is not what I expected.]]
                - Mr. B stabilizes Y by building up
                - If you just keep getting the tops, they'll fall down, and Mr. A needs to take the time to acquire the boxes to fill in the spaces in between.

                    - What if I draw it in more detail?
                        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/cc64bdadc7333455bdac141dd27cc046/thumb/1000)
                        - First X and Y need to be connected, then other roots are needed to stabilize Y
                                - [[Needs 3 legs to stabilize.]] ？
        - Maybe "acquiring new words" makes me nervous because it still feels unconnected.
