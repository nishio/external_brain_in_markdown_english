- Speakers and themes
    - The panel will feature members related to [[Nouns DAO]]. The theme is "Nouns DAO and Realization of Public Goods (Public Goods)"

- NFT holders (Noun holders) have governance rights.
- Anyone can propose: send ideas to the Nouns DAO and if approved by a vote, funds will be awarded.

- Project to build cat shelters (in Hong Kong, China, Japan, etc.).
