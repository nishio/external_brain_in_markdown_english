>  The Tokyo gubernatorial election is over.
>  Mr. Anno, who came in 5th, was the topic of discussion.

For those of you who sympathize with Mr. Anno, rest assured that it is actually already implemented in society!
> [maronkouhou](https://x.com/maronkouhou/status/1810466552900460709) So, while I sympathize with some of the arguments, I wonder if technological efficiency can/should lead to time savings in the process itself, I watched with interest. The issues of democracy are not only the technology employed, but also how the process is designed, how much room there is for participation, and so on.
> [maronkouhou](https://x.com/maronkouhou/status/1810466554301288586) From a different perspective, do we make social implementation a political agenda through political activities and campaigns? Or will it be developed as a service and solemnly implemented as a business?
>  I would be lying if I said there was not a time when I was considering the former approach, but I am not taking that approach now. We will proceed solemnly with social implementation.
