title: "Easier to place an order for AI contracting than for acceptance inspection"
---

It is easier to [[place an order]] with [[AI contractor]] than to [[accept an order]].
- So if you place a flippant order, acceptance inspection becomes a bottleneck.

solution
- No new orders will be placed until acceptance inspection is completed.
    - →[[under-use]] issue
- Ensure that acceptance costs are low.
    - Maintenance of test cases, etc.
- Have them document information for training and leave it until needed.
    - It remains to be seen if this is valid.

- [[AI Agent]]
[[Commissioned]]
