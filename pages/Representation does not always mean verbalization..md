title: "Representation does not always mean verbalization."

- [[expression]] is not necessarily [verbalizing

> [shima__shima](https://twitter.com/shima__shima/status/1781347012967059690) When I heard about SECI about 20 years ago, the question was whether tacit knowledge could actually be converted into formal knowledge. It seems to me that this problem also comes down to that.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1781348332440572077) You either teach someone who is not good at verbalization or you teach someone who is good at it, so the time it takes to become a full-fledged person is a year or so, not to say 10 years becomes 3 months. I can kind of see how that would be.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1781354796647407731) To think of this "epitomization" as "verbalization" is narrowing the scope. I think that putting a [[thinklet]] on a craftsman and taking a [[first-person video]] or putting a marker on a craftsman and [[3D tracking]] his/her movement is also an expression, and watching a first-person video or overlaying a 3D model of a craftsman on yourself in a VR space and imitating it is also [[internalization]].

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This conversation relates to the SECI model of knowledge creation theory, with a particular focus on the process of transformation from tacit to formal (expressed) knowledge.

Tokoroten uses the SECI model to interpret Hollimon's opinion on the length of a sushi chef's apprenticeship. shima__shima points out that the crux of the issue is whether tacit knowledge can actually be converted into formal knowledge.

nishio argues that we should not think of "epitomization" as limited to "verbalization. He states that tacit knowledge can be expressed in non-verbal forms by using technologies such as first-person video and 3D tracking. He further suggests that watching first-person videos and imitating the actions of craftspeople in VR spaces are effective ways to internalize these expressed knowledge.

In the context of intellectual production techniques using LLM, this conversation suggests the following
- The transformation of tacit knowledge into formal knowledge (epiphenomena) is an important process in intellectual production.
- Representation should not be limited to verbalization, but can be done in a variety of formats, including video and 3D models.
- Technological advances are changing the process of tacit knowledge representation and internalization.
- The use of LLM has the potential to streamline the process of intellectual production by facilitating the manifestation and sharing of tacit knowledge.

This conversation suggests the importance of tacit knowledge representation and sharing in the art of intellectual production using LLM, and provides a useful perspective for exploring the new possibilities offered by technological advances.
