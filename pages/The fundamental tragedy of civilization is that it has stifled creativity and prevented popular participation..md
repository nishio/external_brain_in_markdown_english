The fundamental tragedy of civilization is that it suppressed [[creativity]] and prevented [[participation]] of the people.
- Civilization fails to meet the demands of creativity, and the loss of a sense of purpose in life occurs as society becomes more managed.

- [Development of creativity and participatory society are necessary to avoid [[authoritarian socialization]].
- The [[KJ method]] philosophy and technology play an important role in this.

Since the 1960s, the Japanese corporate world has pursued the development of creativity and organizational participation
- The concepts of "[[raison d'être]]" and "[[participation]]" are important.
- The "purpose in life" is a reflection of the progress of managerial socialization and a sense of crisis.
- Participation" emphasizes [[independence]] and is not just a translation of "[[participation]].

Participation is an ancient Japanese term that emphasizes [[independence]] and [assertiveness
- True participation is based on individual [[proactive action]] and [self-recognition
- Participation" means [to act actively on one's own volition
