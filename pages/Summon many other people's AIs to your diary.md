Summon many other people's AIs to your diary
[to complaints 🤖Sensitive to complaints](https://inline.inajob.tk/web?user=twitter-5643382&id=🤖Sensitive)
- I asked <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/basic/icon' alt='/villagepump/basic.icon' height="19.5"/> since the pickle was published.
    - I think I got a pretty good response on this one too.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/sta/icon' alt='/villagepump/sta.icon' height="19.5"/>I asked Mr. Kato about it, but he seemed to be sensitive to complaints, but I did get something out of it.
- Maybe it would be interesting to put in a variety of things and summon specific people or randomly summon "someone to answer"...<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - If you mix them up and do a vector search, the person who knows the most will answer, and that seems fine to me.
        - looks good<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - I don't know if we can choose a FRAGMENT that is not limited to one person, but in order of normal proximity to anyone else's content.
                - I tried it, but I'm not sure if the accuracy of the order of proximity is accurate...
                - Let's try some more.
                - looks pretty good
                    - [to Complaints 🤖Sensitivity to Complaints](https://inline.inajob.tk/web?user=twitter-5643382&id=🤖Sensitivity) of try8
                    - [communication 🤖broadcast-type communication](https://inline.inajob.tk/web?user=twitter-5643382&id=🤖broadcast-type) try6
                - Currently, <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/kiso/icon' alt='/villagepump/kiso.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/blu3mo/icon' alt='/villagepump/blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/mtane0412/icon' alt='/villagepump/mtane0412.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/tkgshn/icon' alt='/villagepump/tkgshn.icon' height="19.5"/>[/villagepump/sta.icon icon](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/sta.icon icon)<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/mtane0412/icon' alt='/villagepump/mtane0412.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/tkgshn/icon' alt='/villagepump/tkgshn.icon' height="19.5"/>[/villagepump/sta.icon
                - I'd like to see an individual listening mode, since there's no universal
    - Occasional rare characters appear.
