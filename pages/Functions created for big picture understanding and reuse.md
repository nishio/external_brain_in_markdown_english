    - [[It's not "writing in parts."]]
    - > "Write functionally" is closer, but the problem is that it's not a common metaphor at all
    - Not only was it not at all common, but it didn't really get through to the people here, and <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamedcamp/rashita/icon' alt='/unnamedcamp/rashita.icon' height="19.5"/> was so funny because he was so choked up!
            - I want to do [[Reverse Jenga reloading]].
            - When a metaphor is born, it doesn't have to be something that can be widely communicated to others, it's better to develop it and reveal its structure first.
    - This type of functional concept was already used at least in EDSAC in 1949, and is a familiar concept to those who can read and write programming languages
        - > As a program grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to grasp the big picture. Also, you may be tempted to use often similar processes over and over again.
        - >  Functions were created to solve this problem. By grouping semantically a piece of code together and giving it a name, it becomes easier to understand what it is doing. And by making the function usable by calling it from elsewhere, it can be reused. (Technology Supporting Coding, p. 56)
        - We can generalize the "program" part of this "as the program grows larger, it becomes harder to grasp the whole picture, and functions were created to solve this problem" to "described by a language".
        - Functional "jump" and "back" are now possible with Scrapbox "links" and "[[backlink]]" and "[[Scroll to link position]]".

I started writing it after titling it "Function Metaphor."
- Changed to "functions created for big picture understanding and reuse."

- [[function (e.g. math, programming, programming)]] born for [[big picture overview]] and [[reuse]]
