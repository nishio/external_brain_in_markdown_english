The "[[originality]]" is required before the "[[joint creation]]".
First, it is important to "think carefully alone," develop "your own vision," and discover your "unique strengths. Only through such a process of "originality" will we be able to achieve more fruitful "co-creation.
You may be right about the negative effects of easily recruiting friends. It tends to lead to [[lack of direction]] and [[ambiguity of responsibility]]. As the examples of "[[social cut corners]]" and "[[Brooks's Law]]" show, increasing the number of people is not always a good thing.
In particular, vaguely recruiting friends on social networking sites can be problematic. [The division of roles is also unclear. Co-creation" without "originality" may have a negative impact.
Therefore, I think it would be a good idea for you to work on your own first, and then, with a clear sense of purpose, recruit others to work on the issues that emerge from your efforts. From "originality" to "co-creation. I believe that such a process will lead to a more productive [[teamwork]].
By taking a more generalized view, I felt that this way of thinking can be applied to various [[cooperation]] situations, not limited to contest entries.

A theme that has been at the center of our conversations since 2017, and that is about "entering contests," and it got me thinking about this issue when I saw people on Twitter writing, "I want to enter ~ and I'm looking for friends!" and seeing people writing about it got us thinking about this issue. However, in the five years since then, I have come to think that perhaps this issue should not be limited to contest entries, but should be viewed from a more general perspective.

There is an old African proverb that says, "[If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together. However, we need to be careful in applying the lesson contained in this saying. More people do not necessarily increase the probability of success. The act of choosing people to walk with as part of a team can be counterproductive if they are not aligned in the direction they are aiming for. And that is especially true when "recruiting" people vaguely on a social networking site.

When it is difficult to proceed alone, recruiting others to help overcome that difficulty can be misleading. And it is also related to the phenomenon of "[[social cut corners]]. This is a phenomenon in which the amount of tasks performed per person decreases with the increase in the number of people in a group working together, indicating that the outcome of a group is not necessarily proportional to the number of its members.

Furthermore, according to "[[Brooks's Law]]," adding personnel to a software project that is lagging will only delay it further. This refers to the overall effort that is increased by adding personnel, including the effort expended in the reassignment itself, training of new personnel, and additional interactions.

From these considerations, we should consider that "originality" is first necessary before "co-creation. In other words, it is important to find one's own way forward, understand one's own strengths and weaknesses, and acquire the ability to do things on one's own based on this understanding. It is precisely because of this stage of originality that it is possible to move on to co-creation with others.

In conclusion, it is most efficient to "find a path to take alone and then find a group of people to share that path with. More meaningful co-creation will be possible by moving to the stage of co-creation after deepening one's self-understanding through the stage of self-creation. The first step in this process is to find the way forward alone.

I have seen Twitter posts about entering contests, etc. that say, "I want to enter ~ and I'm looking for friends! I'm looking for friends! Why not apply alone?

Is there a misconception that "more people increase the probability of success?" Is there a misconception that "two people can achieve twice as much as one?" These misconceptions overlook the cost of communication and the cost of setting a single direction for the team.

Often there is no compulsion to participate in this type of contest, unlike activities at school or a job at a company.
- In other words, if a team member is demotivated, he or she will naturally become inactive.
- The team leader is required to manage the team in a way that is quite difficult to maintain and inspire the members' motivation without the coercive force of graduation or salary.
- Think more members mean less responsibility? You are wrong.
    - It is the team leader's responsibility to keep team members motivated.

Do those who recruit their friends realize that they are trying to get their hands on such a difficult issue?
- If the direction is not consistent, it will be counterproductive, and the members who work together must be chosen carefully.
- I don't understand the point of vaguely "recruiting" friends on social networking sites.
    - Do you mean, "I'm looking for a slave to do for me what I don't want to do and am not good at?"
    - Is this a convenient "we are vocalist, band members wanted" type of situation?
- It would be easier if it was explicitly stated that "I am good at X but not so good at Y, or I am looking for someone who is good at Y."
    - But I'm not a big fan of these types of openings because I think it's better to have a broad perspective when you're young than to specialize in a narrow field of expertise.

Good knowledge to know before trying to add more members.
