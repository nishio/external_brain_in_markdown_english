- Often portray "[[want to do]]" as if it were a set

- This picture could be misleading.
    - Implicitly assumes "the existence of 'wanting to do' as a set of things".


- There is not a "set of things you want to do," but rather a "[[wantonness]] axis.

- The one you want to do the most is chosen from the [[Choice of Action]] that comes up in your consciousness.
- So [Expanding what you can do creates what you want to do.
- Given that, the question "[[What do you want to do?]]" may itself be misleading.
- Think about something you don't want to do."
    - Advice often given to people who "can't find what they want to do."
    - By verbalizing what you don't want to do, you can understand what you do want to do the other way around.

- Whether I want to do something or not, I'm doing something.
    - I may be a slacker, but I'm not a Twitter user.
    - The problem is that the "doing" isn't that much fun.
- Maybe "[[What is fun]]" would be a more useful question?
    - Or more specifically, "What did you do in the past when you felt like having fun?"

- People who say, "[I can't find what I want to do.
    - Cases with few options for action in the first place -> see and learn about various options

- It is misleading to think that "[[should do]]" (the set of things that others thought would be good to do) or "[[be made]]" (the set of things that can be done) is a set, but "want to do" is the same.
