> [@ringo](https://twitter.com/ringo/status/1656821637722030082): GPT-4 and the other insurmountable barriers, what is this?
> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1656823860518608896?s=46&t=gkSZtjGEtUZPO0JCzBxCBw): GPT-4 is made by GPT-5, which is smarter than humans, and the other ones are made by humans because GPT-4 is made by GPT-5, which is smarter than humans, and the others are made by humans (baseless rumor).

> [@teppeis](https://twitter.com/teppeis/status/1656151850046099458?s=20): people are being surprisingly harsh. I personally thought it was rather kind of them to terminate old models that have been 5 years since the last shipment with a 6-month grace period after the announcement.

> [@rokuzouhonda](https://twitter.com/rokuzouhonda/status/1656461627502501889?s=20): I mean, I know it was on sale right before, but I'm surprised that it's still on sale, even though the service discon was announced! （QRIO's first generation (link to Amazon)
- > [@rsensui](https://twitter.com/rsensui/status/1656467191263531011?s=20): @rokuzouhonda Ships from Amazon, but the seller is in a non-official state.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1656495611330560000) Hardware, unlike software services, can be "stocked", so the manufacturer can say, "It's been five years since the last shipment, you can end it. And the consumer says, "I bought it yesterday?!" I understood the situation to be that it's not particularly contradictory to say "I bought it yesterday!
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1656496455866261504) After this, the "bad guy" sells out to the "stupid people" by saying "how about a cheap smart lock", and the person who bought it says "something stopped working. The person who bought it complained to the manufacturer and said "No, you said you were going to end the service" and "I didn't listen to you".
