Nodal point of thought 2025-08-27

- [[Facilitation of Transformation Together]]
- Management in many organizations is vertical, and there is a movement toward "more horizontal" as a reaction against the excesses of vertical decision making.
- However, organizations that have made horizontal decisions and externally communicated those decisions as good ones are unable to make vertical decisions
    - For example, a person entrusted with decision-making avoids decision-making
        - If the leaders don't make decisions, then we have to use algorithms to make decisions.
        - The widely used algorithm is majority rule, and if you don't like majority rule, you need to propose another decision-making algorithm and get consensus.
        - We can't agree on anything because the conundrum of how to get this agreement will arise.
    - Both excesses are problematic.
- If one system can solve both problems, it's best, but if it can only solve one or the other, the focus should be on "more horizontally what is too vertical" for many users.
- What happens to organizations that are too horizontal?
    - I think it won't change until there is an emergency and a leader who demonstrates [[strong leadership]] in [[Contingency Management]] emerges and is acclaimed.
