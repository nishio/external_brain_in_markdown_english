Q: What is the difference between [[psychological safety]] and [[sense of security]]?
A:
- You can think of it as a sense of security.
- And what kind of "sense of security" is that?
- For example
    - No one will think you're stupid for asking questions.
    - You can't be offended if you have a different opinion than others.
- When individual team members have that sense of security, "there is psychological safety in the team.
    - Psychological safety is an attribute of the team, not the individual.
- When teams have psychological safety, it encourages learning within the team and ultimately enhances team outcomes
