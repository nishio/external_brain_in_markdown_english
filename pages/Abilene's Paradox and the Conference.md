title: "Abilene's Paradox and the Conference"

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Abilene's paradox" refers to the phenomenon in the context of [[meetings]] and [[decision-making]] where group members suppress their individual and [[dissenting opinions]], eventually leading to [[a decision that no one wants]]. This concept is associated with a course of action to avoid time-wasting and inefficiency in organizational and corporate meetings.

The Abilene paradox was proposed by management scholar [[Jerry B. Harvey]] in 1974. He used the story of an involuntary trip to Abilene, Texas, as an example to illustrate the psychological mechanism by which individuals agree to choices in group decision-making that they do not actually want. This happens because the individual avoids confrontation or [[mistakenly believes]] that the other members want it.

To avoid this paradox, it is important to foster a culture in which all participants express their opinions freely and respect [[dissenting opinion]] in meetings and decision-making processes. This improves [[quality of decision-making]] and increases the likelihood of better group outcomes.

Abilene's Paradox is an important concept to understand in order to promote a culture of healthy debate within an organization and avoid wasteful meetings and unwilling decisions.
