title: "Lean startup harm theory"

> [gdvonly](https://x.com/gdvonly/status/1820344788329075155) I think the biggest failure of Japanese startups is that they believed in "[[Lean startups]]".
>  There are several problems, but one is that even if you get an optimal solution through hypothesis testing in Japan, it is only an optimal solution for a small market. In other words, it is a tough fight when the starting point is Japan.
>  Another is that since the number of improvement cycles ≈ the amount of capital invested, there is no way to beat the U.S. and China in a game that is so winnable that a large number of improvement cycles are required.
>  Japan should have fought with more one-hit-kill kind of ideas instead of improvement cycles. (In the first place, KAIZEN is something the Japanese would have done even if they were left alone.)
>  If we can go back in time, it would be better to popularize a term like Samurai Startup instead of Lean Startup.
>  By the way, in Silicon Valley, it is said that startup ideas should be crazy, and Airby is the best example of this, but to be clear, Airby is not crazy at all. But to be clear, Airbnb is not crazy at all, it's just "Let's stay in the countryside! But to be clear, Airbnb is not crazy at all.
>  I think Vtubers are much crazier. If craziness is important, Japan is not inherently a country that can be beaten by the US.
>  The only thing they are crazy about is the amount of capital. Unfortunately, Japan has been duped and taken for a ride in that game.
>  I have never recommended Lean Startup to anyone more junior than myself.

> [ai_syacho](https://x.com/ai_syacho/status/1820344788329075155) Yes, Lean Startup is from overseas, and the trial-and-error route backed by capital power is a solid win.
>  If you don't have the capital, you have to take a gamble.

> [sarukun99](https://x.com/sarukun99/status/1820344788329075155) I think it's a different premise.
>  - I'm a service that goes to stay in a place where you might be shot or locked up.
>  - VTubers are an extension of comics, so they are ampai.
>  Many people say that small verification leaning is good in itself, but that they didn't make a mistake in selecting the theme in the first place.

> [kur](https://x.com/kur/status/1820344788329075155) This is all to a point, but when it comes down to it, who takes the risk and how much risk? How much risk is taken and how much return is expected? I think the best process depends on who is willing to take the risk and how much return is expected.
> [Hide_Kiwa](https://x.com/Hide_Kiwa/status/1820396495171911828) I don't think it's contradictory to commercialize a crazy idea into a lean business in the first place... sorry for missing the point.
> [kur](https://x.com/kur/status/1820398440851108125) Of course that's true, but in order to verify that customers have problerms, the issue needs to be relatively clear, like Airbnb. For example, but I don't think it's possible to build Twitter with a Lean Startup process (whether Twitter is crazy or not).
