title: 'Include yourself in the "should"?'
---

- It developed when we were talking about [[should not do]].
- Whether "[[must]]" is used for "a set that includes you" or not
    - Example
        - The case of the uncle who says, "Women should wear makeup."
        - A case of a woman in full make-up saying, "Women should wear make-up.
            - I make up" first, and then an explanation of the motive for doing so.

        - If a person who says "all people should continue to learn" does not learn [[inconsistency between one's words and actions]].
            - People who say "should" to subjects that don't include them are shirking their responsibility to act.
            - Like you're hitting people from a safe zone?
            - "A student's true duty is to study!" The uncle who insists

        - Poor people who insist that "rich people should donate more."
            - The rich person who argues that "rich people should donate more" and then donates himself will be like, "I see, [[carrying out one's words]] you're doing that."
