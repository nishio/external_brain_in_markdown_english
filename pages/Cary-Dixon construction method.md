> A method to give a series of multirings on a body formed by the whole real numbers, where each step of the multirings has twice the dimension of the previous one.
[Cary-Dixon's construct method - Wikipedia [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B1%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%EF%BC%9D%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%82%AF%E3](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B1%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%EF%BC%9D%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%82%AF%E3) %82%BD%E3%83%B3%E3%81%AE%E6%A7%8B%E6%88%90%E6%B3%95]

- [[real number]] → [[complex number]] → [[quaternion]] → [characteristic (of a ring or field in algebra)

Octal numbers are [[decoupled]] (not [[associative]])
- (pq)r=p(qr) does not hold in general
alternating
- x(xy) = (xx)y
- (yx)x = y(xx)

It is not even alternating after 16 yuan numbers.
- [[power connectivity]] is there.
- $s^n s^m = s^{n+m}$
