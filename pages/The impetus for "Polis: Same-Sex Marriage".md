- A [[same-sex marriage]] thread that could be a POLIS story.

    - That's a lot to sort through.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - [[Polis: same-sex marriage]]
        - I had GPT4 make most of it.
        - > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1648170401732911104?s=20): @takudj I've chewed up the debate on gay marriage and made it possible to vote individually! Vote and you'll see where your opinion falls in the distribution of everyone's opinions.

            - done
        - Isolated after more unsure.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Group C's opinion is interesting.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>

                - I'm split on where to put those who think the logic that "[[marriage to Hatsune Miku]] should be allowed" but "same-sex marriage should be allowed if it's allowed" is ridiculous.
                    - I see, so this is still "too complicated an opinion".<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
                        - (Hatsune Miku did not consent to the marriage! and that would complicate things.)
