title: "Those who don't need it don't need it."
---

There [[means]] talking about whether X is necessary or not.
Some people say "no" when it comes to whether or not a certain tool ([[tool]], [[methodology]], etc.) is necessary.
Means are paired with [[Objective.]], and different people have different objectives
Not being necessary for his/her purpose does not mean that he/she does not need it for his/her own.

Means bridge the gap between goals and the status quo ([[Gap between reality and ideal]])
People who don't have a gap don't need that means.
It is unclear from the lack of information whether the lack of gap is due to the person's current high ability or his/her low ideals
It's not useful to know that, so it's better to go through with "you don't need it.
