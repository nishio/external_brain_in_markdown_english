title: "Dialogue of Madamis Writers"
---

- Prolific Madamis Writer A
- Widespread Madamis writers b

- A
    - Art does it himself.
    - I have a scene I want to describe.
    - Observe cases where test play does not lead to that scene.
        - I'm struggling to get my head around the fix.

- B
    - Art is not me.
    - I consider it an interesting event when users behave unexpectedly in test play.

Maybe A expects the player to follow some storyline he has prepared and recognizes that when it doesn't happen, it's a "design error" that should be corrected.
- B doesn't think so, he thinks it's natural for people to behave in unexpected ways.
- We are testing to see if there is a fatal breakdown in the game due to that unexpected behavior.
    - Release if you haven't done a few test plays.
    - If usability can be improved with minor modifications, the decision to adopt is easy because it is less likely to affect others.
