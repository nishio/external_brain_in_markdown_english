title: "Cognitive dysfunction"
---

- Some people's cognitive abilities have gone haywire.
    - The sentence you cite as the basis for your claim is not the basis for your claim.
    - You're overlooking only the parts of what's written in the title, etc. that are inconvenient to your argument, which I would normally expect you to notice.
- It may seem malicious.
    - Do not assume malice.
- Whether it is due to temporary stress, fatigue, anger, etc. or chronic, just a malfunctioning device
- Pointing out a malfunctioning device to a device that is malfunctioning is pointless
    - Recognizing yourself is more advanced metacognition than recognizing anything other than yourself
    - There's no way you can do that with your cognitive function broken.
