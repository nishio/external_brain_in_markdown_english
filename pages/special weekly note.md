title: "special weekly note"
---

Since 2024-07-22~27 was a hot week that deserves special mention, I will organize it separately from the regular weekly journal. I tentatively titled it "Special Weekly Report," but I will change it to a better title later.
- 2024-09-07 I finally have time to organize, I'm going to proceed little by little.

        - Is it just a post to Twitter? I wonder why there is no note, did you write it elsewhere?
