- Buddhist theory [[prajna-paramita (perfection of wisdom)]],即非 [[prajna-paramita (perfection of wisdom)]],是名 [[prajna-paramita (perfection of wisdom)]].
        - [[Diamond Sutra]]
    - ... But it doesn't seem to say this directly.
    - The expression "Buddha preached enlightenment, it is not enlightenment, this is called enlightenment".

    - [[X is not X and therefore X]]

    - In a position that emphasizes [[personal experience]],
    - When you put the X word on an experience, it is no longer the same as the original experience itself.
    - X as a word" is different from "X as an experience."
    - Understand this not as words, but as an experience.
    - I will call this understanding as an experience "[[prajna-paramita (perfection of wisdom)]] ([[enlightenment]])".
    - Enlightenment as a word is different from enlightenment as an experience.
- and I think anyone can understand it if they chew on it, but it's abbreviated to "enlightenment is not enlightenment, this is enlightenment" or something like that, so for those who don't understand it, it makes no sense.
    - [[People appreciate things that don't make sense]], so do they circulate as they are?

relevance
    - [[All words are metaphors]]
    - [[Depth syndrome]]
