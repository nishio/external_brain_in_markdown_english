> This video's "don't change your attitude depending on the person you are talking to" reminded me that when I used to have a drink with Tony, the founder of Zappos, in San Francisco, he said, "I want to meet as many people from different worlds from mine as possible. And I want to be someone who can understand their values," he said humbly.
