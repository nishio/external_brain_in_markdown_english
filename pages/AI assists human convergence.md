title: "AI assists human convergence"

I don't know how people spend their second season.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamed-project/inajob/icon' alt='/unnamed-project/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
- All I do is reply to the AI!
- I feel like it would be a better experiment to have an AI present amidst all the human chatter, but I'm not sure what to talk about here.
- I feel like writing about AI-oriented topics in omoikane...
- Well, as far as that goes, I think it's a transitional phase where I was going to try the thing at the beginning of this page, but I haven't caught up with the implementation yet, and I put in what was working in omoikane and the same summary function started working, so it's "I don't know the difference".<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamed-project/nishio/icon' alt='/unnamed-project/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - An experiment to see if AI can organize the contents of this project?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamed-project/inajob/icon' alt='/unnamed-project/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - What happens? Is it better to experiment with
        - They may make a mess, but it may be significant, depending on how they make a mess.
            - Letting AI do the [[convergent move]]?
        - Ultimately, you could say that this is an experiment to see if AI can converge what humans have given up converging.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamed-project/nishio/icon' alt='/unnamed-project/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - My firsthand impression is that "even if AI only provides convergence results without evidence, humans will not be convinced," "even if it provides evidence, it would be enormous - hmmm," and "therefore, I think AI must be in the form of 'supporting convergence by humans'.
            - I also tried to include the word "the" and saw the phenomenon that occurred, and now that the question has been asked, the language has finally been put into words.
            - I think about everything while I'm running.
