title: "The hallucination of line space"

> [@lad_tripnote](https://twitter.com/lad_tripnote/status/1672225685002403840?s=20): I was having a drink with an Aspie junkie, and he started to say "You know those hallucinations that people who are stereotypically developed have, like 'between the lines'? I could only read what was written no matter what I was doing.

> [lad_tripnote](https://twitter.com/lad_tripnote/status/1672230526080671745) I feel that there are two kinds of systems: those that can be read with experience to some extent, and those that can only be memorized, such as the variant conjugations. I think there are two types. Aspies are weak at things that are not regular.

> [lad_tripnote](https://twitter.com/lad_tripnote/status/1672233655228579842) It's unforgivable that people read between the lines when all you wrote was what was written. But the most unforgivable thing is myself who gave them a chance to interpret. I want to be stronger. I was just saying that, when the dawn broke.

[[hallucination]] called [[between the lines]].
