title: "Team Mirai Cluster Density Sort"
---

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1957811070191698041) The 400 groups of about 10,000 issues awareness extracted from the proposals submitted to Team Mirai's policy repository are now displayed in order of opinion density, and a search function has been added with the proposal number. (There is also a display in order of approval/opposition ratio, but we have not yet implemented an approval/opposition vote).

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1957820810808197215) I added the search function because I thought it would be a good idea after a discussion with @tokoroten at a recent meetup, so I'll mention it instead of acknowledging it. .io
