- I've been doing recording transcription for a while.
- I don't feel much effect.
    - Would you lose it? NO
- Why?
- Dialogue is not interesting.
    - Where the output is not dialogue but tension and one-sided output.
    - would be interesting to read again later.
    - At first I thought, "where he's talking about his pet theory," but no.
        - Trigger a conversation to come up with something new and interesting
            - →I get excited.
            - →Output one-sidedly
        - Not the original one itself.
- The moment you're excited and talking to yourself is the moment you've caught the big one.
    - People are only interested in the fish they catch and the moment they hoist it.
    - Few people are interested in the interaction before fishing.

- Why did I take out my notebook? Because I was about to tell a complicated story and I wanted to clear my head.
- Organizations age if left alone.
