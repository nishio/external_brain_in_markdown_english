title: 'Solutions for "too many issues" problem'

When we got too many posts, I think the LLM could help us to digest and summarizing people's posts.

I have another idea to use market mechanism. When there are N voter, one post costs N.
So we require payment of N credits for posting an issue.
People can earn the credits by voting. Because voting is a kind of work for common goods.

If there are more submissions, I think LLM can help chew up everyone's submissions and put them together.

Another idea is to use the [[market principle]]. When there are N voters, each submission costs N.
Therefore, we require that N credits be paid when submitting a certain issue.
People can earn credits by [[voting]]. This is because voting is a kind of work for [[public goods (i.e. goods or services such as parks or highways)]].
