The [[poker]] parable
The question, "How much do I have to bet to win?" is a funny one.
- Before there is "how much to bet," there is "what kind of hand."
- It's not a good idea to bet a lot on a bad hand.
    - But the other party can get off.
- It's not a good idea to bet only a little on a good hand.
    - How much can I afford to lose?

Things that would be "obvious" in a poker game tend to be lost when the situation is different.

- [[betting]]
- [[investment]]
