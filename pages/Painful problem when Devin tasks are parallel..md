Painful problem when Devin tasks are parallel.

The initial issue of Devin's tasks being hard when they are in parallel, and the growing sense of skin regarding "scale" has prevented the number of tasks from increasing too much as they are now properly handled.
    - [[The scale of tasks that AI can perform]].
- When something old and long is done, there's a sense that it's getting heavier and heavier, and you want to get rid of it quickly.
- I can only list about three on one page, which is not good.
        - [[listing]]
- And it's not good to see features like "waiting for user response", "sleeping", "working", etc.
- I made sure to mark the done ones with a ✅ mark.
- Troublesome if it flows off the screen without being DONE.
- I've decided to put those things in [[bookmark]].
