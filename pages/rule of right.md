title: "rule of right"

This word is used inconsistently with the idiom "[[there are no shortcuts in learning]]" in Japanese today, isn't it?
The path chosen by the public at large is called the "King's Road". It is not the way of kings. It's like the hustle and bustle of a crowded main street.

There is no royal road to learning" means that even kings have no choice but to proceed steadily like the general public when it comes to learning.
