> [tsuyomiyakawa](https://x.com/tsuyomiyakawa/status/1814075499536416975) "Today there are only four types of high-income countries in the world: 1) English-speaking countries, 2) countries close to Britain, 3) countries rich in resources, and 4) Japan and its former colonies."
>  1-3 are well researched, but why 4? Data-driven research on why the Industrial Revolution spread first to Japan and not to other non-Western countries.

In 1910, technical books written in the top four Western European languages accounted for 66% of all technical books, and Japanese, the fourth language, accounted for 19% of technical books. What a surprise, at this point, Japanese technical books surpassed those written in English.

Thus, all members of the new government were expected to support the absorption of Western ideas to strengthen Japan."

The cost of studying abroad accounted for up to 0.20% of annual government spending."

> [tsuyomiyakawa](https://x.com/tsuyomiyakawa/status/1814083635387289757) "In addition to spending directly on technological policies, the Meiji government also developed educational policies. This is important, because providing technical knowledge in Japanese makes little sense unless entrepreneurs and managers have the human capital to absorb that technical knowledge."

> [tsuyomiyakawa](https://x.com/tsuyomiyakawa/status/1814083777163051438) "Compulsory education began in 1872, but according to an 1877 report by the Ministry of Education, "the people still do not consider education beneficial and parents are dissatisfied," so most Japanese parents refused to send their children to government schools."

The percentage of boys and girls attending school rose from 39.9% of eligible boys and 15.1% of eligible girls in 1874 to 58.2% of boys and 22.6% of girls in 1879; in 1890, 90.6% of boys and 71.7% of girls were enrolled in elementary school."
