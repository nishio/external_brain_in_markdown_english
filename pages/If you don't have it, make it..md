- > I would like to mention the "if you don't have it, make it" culture of programmers, but does anyone know of any sources that would provide evidence that such a culture is real in the first place?

- Sennett's "[Craftsman](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4480864458)"
    - Linux episodes are presented in the context of Craftsman
- Bricolage -- [Bricolage - Wikipedia](https://ja.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%96%E3%83%AA%E3%82%B3%E3%83%A9%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B8%E3%83%A5)
        - [[Claude Lévi-Strauss.]], in his book "Wild Thoughts" (1962) and elsewhere, called "bricolage" the use of scraps and leftover materials to create tools that serve an immediate need, regardless of their original use.
        - Wild Thought," an ancient way of knowledge possessed by humankind, is compared to manufacturing through bricolage, and this is contrasted with "Cultivated Thoughts," the thinking of engineering since the modern age, and bricolage is considered a universal way of knowledge that is also applicable to modern society. Cultivated Thoughts]" and contrasted it with post-modern engineering thinking.
    - In a discussion of constructionism in pedagogy, [[Seymour Papert]] described a method of problem solving and learning through challenge, trial, and play as the opposite of the analytical solution method, which he described as bricolage.
    - Sherry Turkle applies the concept of bricolage to program development and organizational theory in her 1995 book, "[[connected mind]] - Identity in the Age of the Internet" ("Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet"). She applies the concept of bricolage to program development and organizational theory in her 1995 book, "[[connected mind]] - Identity in the Age of the Internet.
        - She defends the "bricoleur style" in programming as valid against the traditionally constructed (as she calls it) "planner approach."
            - This is similar to the contrast between learning schools and traditional planning schools in business administration ([[strategic safari]]).
