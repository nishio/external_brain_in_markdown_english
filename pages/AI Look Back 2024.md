Identification of ideas that have been learned and can be applied in the future
- Have the AI read the actions and learnings and summarize what, in retrospect, led to the results and what they would like to further deepen in the future.
- The AI's reconstruction of what you have written will give you a new perspective.

Proposed goals for next year
- The AI will suggest specific advice, such as, "Based on this review, what points would be good to be aware of in the next year," or "Can we expand on these actions?

Clarify objectives
- If you decide in advance what you want the AI to read, for example, whether you want a summary, to manage motivation, or to get new ideas, prompts (instructions) to the AI will be more precise and produce better output.

It is presumed that because they were too busy to look back slowly, "insights" and "new information" would have drifted away even though they were there.

Re-evaluate" from your own perspective.
- Re-imagining from summary results
    - Read the text summarized by the AI, and if you find a point that you think, "I didn't go through it at the time, but this might actually be interesting," rewrite it down.
- Look back in chronological order
    - There are also some relevance that can only be discovered by looking at things from a different time frame, such as, "A realization from a few months ago seems to be connected to the current situation," or "I had this problem at this time, so a current solution may be useful."

Putting into action for next year
- Putting ideas into "ready-to-go" form
    - No matter how good the awareness or knowledge is, if it does not lead to action, it will be forgotten.
        - Try new tools."
        - I propose ____ for the next project."
        - Buy books and sign up for courses for continued learning."
    - It is easier to take advantage of the value that has been rediscovered when it is linked to concrete actions such as
