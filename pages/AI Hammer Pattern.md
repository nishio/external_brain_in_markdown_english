>  "I'm having compatibility problems with the latest library, and when I ask AI, they tell me to put in an older version of the library, but the version number they give me is too old and causes other problems."

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1857803208497967284) Putting in an older version makes the inconsistency problem worse and causes other problems, but not many people have had such inconsistencies in the past, so following the AI's instructions won't solve them. You get even more lost.
