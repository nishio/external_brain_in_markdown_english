In the case of "not starting until the very last minute," you're implicitly assuming that "it's not necessary to communicate with others to accomplish the task."<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- In reality, after starting a large task one pomodoro, you may discover something you need to check with others, such as "Oh, what should I do in this situation? and "what should I do in such a case?
- The time it takes to get a response to an inquiry from someone else will not be shortened, no matter how impatient we are at the deadline.
    - No time to check if it is discovered the day before the deadline.
- Maybe it doesn't happen so much with reports, but with work, if you work on something without checking what you should check, you get a "no, it's totally different, just throw it all out and redo it.
    - And they say it's the worker's fault for not checking.
        - If you had a week to work on it, they'd say, "You had plenty of time to check it out.
        - It's the worker's fault for not starting the inquiry because he procrastinated and didn't start until the day before.
    - Of course it's bad enough that the instructions weren't perfect, but it's impossible for a human being to "give perfect instructions in advance with no room for misunderstanding".
- Then I think, "I haven't received a response to my inquiry yet.
    - Since the deadline is still far away, I'm thinking "well, I'll just check back tomorrow", but if this was right before the deadline, it would be incredibly stressful!
    - Others don't react at the rate you expect them to react.
    - Well, this is a project that was due at the end of June [[Lazy procrastination only makes it harder]], so I set a tentative deadline for the following Friday, so if my counterparts are not on the same page, I can extend the deadline.

- 1: Long-term projects may have a tentative goal, but the path and goal are actually in the dark and not visible at all.
- 2: After a bit of progress, "No, there's a wall in the path I planned to take!" Often it becomes
- 3: Which way to go?
    - In the case of a project in the dark, if you ask someone else which way to go, they may not know either.
        - [If you can move to the red circle but not to the blue circle, it is reasonable to take the upper path.
- I expect these "unexpected disasters" to happen, and I know they will.
    - I'm thinking it will then be a time-consuming process of communicating with others.
    - So, proceed to the point where the obstacle is observed and put the other party in a state of waiting for a response.
- We don't always do this for every project.
    - When we started a project early, we asked ourselves, "Why did we start early?" and here's what I came up with.
