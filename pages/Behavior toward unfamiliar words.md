title: "Behavior toward unfamiliar words"

> hmori: Technicians use [[technical terms]], but if they hear a term they don't know, they always [[demand an explanation]]. That's not harassment. Please don't be offended.
- It seems that there are A's who ask for explanations for technical terms they don't know and B's who get angry when asked for explanations.
- When A uses his terminology, he assumes that B will ask questions if he doesn't understand it, and if there are no questions, he interprets that he understands.
- B uses a word he doesn't understand, interprets it to mean "don't ask for details," doesn't ask questions, and uses it himself.
