title: "Digital maladaptive disorder"
---

I don't know if those who say "going digital makes it unusable" really don't have the ability to use it, or are just goners with no intention of using it.

So, first, ignore those voices and proceed with [[digitization]]. Then, create a hospital where [[maladjusted]] people can go and receive [[training]]. If they cannot use it even after training, they should be given a [[disability certificate]] to make it easier for them to get a [[caregiver]]. This will settle the matter so that people with digital maladjustment disorder will be protected by the same [[safety net]] as other [[disabilities]].
