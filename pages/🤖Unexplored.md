Unexplored Junior emphasizes individual creativity and proposers are strongly encouraged to promote their own ideas. Adopters are not publicly announced and networks are formed through boost meetings and communication with past participants. You can see the association with fragments such as "Hatena2011-07-27," "PM Hack," "Unexplored Junior 2021 Boost Conference," "Advanced IT Human Resource Development for the Future," and "Case Studies on How ICT Can Change Society."

The issue of "members having little reason to get involved in unexplored junior projects" may be related to Nishio's idea of the importance of personalization in a small community.

Submit questions to gain a better understanding of the adoption criteria for Unexplored Junior, networking methods, the new format of the Boost Conference, impact, and the purpose of the Unexplored Project and the Unexplored General Incorporated Association.

### Fragment Relevance

The issue of "members having little reason to get involved in unexplored junior projects" may be related to Nishio's idea that personalization in a small community is important. This illustrates the idea that in order for members to stay involved in a project, it is important that the project matches their situation and interests.

Unexplored Junior" emphasizes the spontaneity of individual creators, and proposers are encouraged to enthusiastically promote their own ideas. Adopters are not publicly announced, and networks are built through boost meetings and communication with past participants. Unexplored Junior seeks ways to support projects that are time-consuming but less expensive. We also believe that if there is an application to Unexplored Junior that is a mismatch for Unexplored Junior itself, but could have a positive effect on society if supported by Unexplored Japan, it is one way to start a separate project.

### Fragment Relevance
.

Hatena2011-07-27" emphasizes the importance of networking for unexplored projects, which is consistent with my note. PM Hack" mentions the criteria for the adoption of Unexplored Junior, which is also relevant to my note. The "Unexplored Junior 2021 Boost Conference" refers to the new format of the Boost Conference, which is also relevant to my note.

Case Studies of Social Change through ICT" refers to the purpose of the Mittokyo Project and the Mittokyo General Incorporated Association, which is also related to my note.

### Deep thoughts and questions

How are the selection criteria for the Unexplored Junior Program set? And how are the selection criteria for projects supported by the Junior Unexplored Program determined? How has the networking method of the Unexplored Junior evolved? How have new formats for Unexplored Junior boosting meetings been developed and accepted? How is the impact of Unexplored Junior being evaluated? How are the objectives of the Unexplored Project and the Unexplored General Incorporated Association aligned? Answering these questions will help us better understand the Unexplored Junior.

Adopters will not be publicly announced and guidelines will be provided. Networking is built through boosting meetings and communication with past participants. There are two types of mentoring, and it is acceptable to include images created by others in proposal materials as long as the source is clearly stated.

Fragment "The project "Unexplored Junior" itself was born five to ten years later from the human network created by the IPA's Unexplored Project." The relevance of the project can be seen in the following. In response to the question, "What kind of project is Unexplored Junior looking for?" the view that "whether they want to support the project" depends on the subjectivity of the mentor. Based on these considerations, it is necessary to think deeply about the criteria for the selection of Unexplored Junior and how to proceed with the project.

Fragments "Thought Node 2021 Unexplored Junior" and "I don't want to bias the proposer's affiliation with my alma mater positively or negatively" indicate the selection process of the Unexplored Junior and the mentor's perspective. Taking this information into consideration will provide a deeper understanding and insight. Also, we can ask questions such as, "Is there a good way to support projects that don't cost much money but take a lot of time?" or "If there are applications to Unexplored Junior that are a mismatch for Unexplored Junior itself but could have a positive effect on society if supported by the Unexplored Foundation, is there another way to support the project?

Unexplored" is a project that aims to provide support to individual creators and emphasizes spontaneity. The "Unexplored Junior" program was launched to give the younger generation an opportunity to grow. The "Unexplored Junior" is not an idea contest; the proposers themselves must realize their ideas. The winners of "Unexplored Junior" will not be publicly announced.

The project development of "Unexplored Junior" began after the kick-off event of the "Unexplored Research Group" in 2015. The idea for "Unexplored Junior" was discussed and shared at a reception with Nishio, Yasukawa, Suzuki, and others.

As a creator of something new, the adopters of "Unexplored Junior" are provided with guidelines in case of trouble. This will be communicated at the first event after the adoption, called the "Boost Meeting.

For the "Unexplored Junior" step and the "Unexplored Ecosystem," no ranking is given and a wide variety of applications are received. Proposers are also encouraged to make a highly enthusiastic appeal of what they want to create.

The network of "Unexplored Juniors" is built through boost meetings and communication with past participants. This is believed to foster trust and foster a network of long-term value.

Nishio stated that he has been involved in the "Unexplored" program for more than half of his life. He also noted that "Unexplored JUNIOR" requires the proposer to realize the idea on his/her own, and that proposals that do not describe how to realize the idea are unlikely to be adopted.

There are two types of mentoring for "unexplored juniors," and it is considered not to be happy with proposals that are beneficial to the mentor's affiliation. It is also considered acceptable to include images created by others in proposal materials, as long as the source is clearly stated.

### Digest of Research Notes
.

My research is on privacy-enhanced ID and privacy-enhanced revocation, a privacy and security-enhancing technology that is related to Nishio's distributed ID, a technology that allows users to generate and manage their own identities, potentially complementing privacy and security.

The following questions are recorded below.

1. is it possible to combine privacy-enhanced IDs with distributed IDs?
2. how does the increasing automation of decisions affect privacy and security?
3. as these technologies evolve, could new privacy and security issues arise?

A fragment from Nishio pointed out that the need for Decentralized Identifiers is less common in Japan. There was also a detailed explanation of Decentralized Identifiers, which is directly related to my research. Also, in the conversation summary 2023-04-28, it was pointed out that asking questions can help develop the discussion. This reminded me of the importance of questions in my research.

We will continue to research the above.
