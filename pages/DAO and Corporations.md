When a new mechanism develops, it first gets adopted in areas where existing mechanisms are less suitable. Gradually, it spreads, leaving behind areas where the existing mechanisms are highly suitable.

[[DAO]]s and [[Corporations]] share common goals:
- Formation of [[Teamwork]]
- Formation and maintenance of [[Organizations]]
- [[Coordination]] and [[Collaboration]]
- [[Design to Elicit Contributions]]

In achieving these goals, DAOs are likely to be introduced and expand in areas where corporations were not very suitable.
