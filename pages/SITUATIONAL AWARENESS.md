[Introduction - SITUATIONAL AWARENESS: The Decade Ahead](https://situational-awareness.ai/)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This text discusses the possibility that advances in artificial intelligence (AI) will not stop at the human level, but will rapidly reach superhuman levels (superintelligence) through automated AI research. The main points are as follows
1. if AGI (human-level AI) becomes a reality, millions of AGIs could automate AI research and compress a decade's worth of algorithmic progress into less than a year.
2. automation of AI research could accelerate algorithmic advances, resulting in effective computational power gains of 5 orders of magnitude or more per year.
3. there are bottlenecks such as limited computational resources, complementarity with humans, and difficulty in advancing algorithms, but they will not significantly slow takeoff.
4. superintelligence will have tremendous power to dramatically accelerate scientific and technological progress, provide military superiority, and fundamentally alter economic growth.
5. the intelligence explosion and the period immediately following superintelligence will be one of the most unstable and dangerous periods in human history.

The authors stress the potential of superintelligence and the need to take seriously the major impacts and challenges it poses.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The authors cite the following specific rationale
1. given the current scale of GPUs, it is likely that millions of AGIs can be run in parallel by 2027. This would enable a research effort 100,000 times greater than that of a few hundred human researchers.
2. over the past decade, algorithmic efficiency has advanced at a rate of about 0.5 orders of magnitude per year. It seems feasible that automated AI researchers could compress 10 years of human progress into one year.
3. there are examples, such as AlphaGo, where AI has learned from human games and then reached a superhuman level through self-play.
4. many of the major breakthroughs in machine learning have come from relatively simple ideas (LayerNorm, residual connections, etc.).
5. historically, the pace of economic growth has accelerated each time civilization has moved into a new mode of growth, from hunting and farming to science and the industrial revolution. superintelligence may allow us to move into a new phase of growth.
6. there are historical examples of the conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires in the 16th century by a small number of Europeans, armed with technological superiority and strategic and diplomatic savvy.

Based on these facts, the author discusses the explosion of INTELLIGENCE and the possibility of SUPERINTELLIGENCE. Uncertainty is great, however, and the author admits that accurate predictions are difficult.
