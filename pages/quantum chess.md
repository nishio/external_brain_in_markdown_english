> Overview
>  Pieces are in the [[quantum state]]. That is, the pieces can be any kind of piece at the beginning, and each time they are moved, impossible pieces are eliminated and their types are determined. The distribution of the number of pieces is the same for both the first and second player. When a piece is taken, the possibility of that piece being the king is eliminated. If a piece is determined to be the king, the player wins. Leaving two steps and O-te are allowed.
