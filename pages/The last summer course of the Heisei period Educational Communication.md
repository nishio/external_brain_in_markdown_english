Summary (short)
Theme Outline
- Realistic and essential knowledge" such as social security and intergenerational disparities are not adequately covered in the field of education. Teachers themselves tend to be specialized idiots, and their curriculum is limited, resulting in students becoming adults without a proper understanding of social systems.

Main Issues
- Limitations of teachers/systems
    - Public school teachers are accustomed to teaching specialized subjects, but they do not have the luxury of teaching in depth content directly related to real life, such as social security and the tax system.
    - The "system that relies on the homeroom teacher" itself is reaching its limits and needs to be linked to outside resources, specialists, and alternative forms of learning.
- [[Generational Conflict]] and the Dilemma of Disclosure
    - When young people learn about the reality of the [[generational gap]], it may in fact create negative conflicts.
    - However, there is a strong opinion that showing the truth is preferable in the long run to hiding the facts.
- Direction of Educational Reform
    - Incorporate "hands-on" or "project-based learning" methods rather than classroom lectures that merely push in necessary knowledge.
    - The number and treatment of teachers should be reviewed to increase the number of highly qualified personnel, or a system should be established to facilitate the inclusion of learning opportunities outside of public education.
    - Increase the number of learning opportunities open to society by questioning the "nature of compulsory education" itself.

Suggested Action Examples
- Cooperation between school and community/specialist
    - Conduct regular classes and workshops with outside experts and social security-related practitioners.
- Utilization of diverse media
    - Video, online materials, and interaction tools, including overseas case studies, provide realistic learning while reducing the burden on teachers.
- Opportunities for students to be exposed to "[[real issues]]"
    - Intergenerational exchanges and tours at health and pension offices to make contact with people who actually use the system and make it their own.

In short, the argument is that it is essential to "create a system that complements school education (introducing outside expertise and diverse learning styles)" and to "be upfront about the facts.
