title: "Decisions that should not be made by consensus"
---

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Several points should be considered when thinking about [[decision-making]] that should not be [[collegial]]. Situations in which collegiality is not appropriate have the following characteristics

    - [[expertise]] is extremely high.
    - Expert opinion is important in matters where [[specialized knowledge]] or [[skill]] is required. For example, when specific knowledge is essential, such as medical or legal decisions or highly technical issues, the expert's sole decision is often required.
- When [[quick decision making]] is needed:.
    - In situations that are [[urgent]] and require a quick response, there may not be time to go through a council. For example, in disaster response and crisis management, commanders and leaders need to make decisions quickly.
- If [[responsibility]] should be clear:.
    - A collegial system may also be unsuitable in situations where responsibility must be clearly assigned in a decision. In some situations, such as corporate management decisions, where responsibility for the outcome must be taken later, it may be preferable for the leader or leaders to make the decision alone.
- If [[opinion dispersion]] is large:.
    - When there is a wide divergence of opinion among participants, [[a collegial system]] may [[not reach a decision]] or [[an overly compromised decision]] may be reached. In these situations, it may be useful to have some experts or a neutral third party make the decision.
    - [[information asymmetry]] :
    - If information is not shared equally among all, or [[there are]] differences in understanding, collegial decision-making may not yield appropriate results. Greater information asymmetry makes it harder to make well-informed decisions.

Considering these situations will help us determine when we should avoid collegiality and rely on individual or [[minority]] opinions.
