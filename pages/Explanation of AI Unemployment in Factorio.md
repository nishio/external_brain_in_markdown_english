Explanation of AI Unemployment in Factorio
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1723855066975617148) People who are doing [[0/1 thoughts]] like "[[AI will take your job.]]", you might want to do [[Understanding the System]] to improve [[Factorio]]. I think you should do [[Factorio]] to improve your [AI will take your job.)

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1723855951508181099) What happens when the production efficiency (output per raw material) of a production unit increases is that if there is enough demand downstream, the efficiency simply increases, but if there is not If there is not enough demand downstream, efficiency will simply increase, but if there is not, downstream inventories will build up, conveyor belts will fill up, and the utilization rate of that production equipment will decrease.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1723858745745395742) As a result, the demand for raw materials will drop, leading to dabbling in upstream networks, which will need to be diverted to other uses.
>
>  So this "raw material" is [[white-collar]] working hours.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1723866350437724632) The conversion of raw materials to products is connected like several loops in a chain, and the front loop is the conversion device that "pays [[labor costs]] and gets white-collar hours,
>  Depending on the game rules, it may or may not be possible to turn off a conversion device that is no longer needed.

    - > [yuiseki_](https://twitter.com/yuiseki_/status/1642143023248318464) If we put ourselves in the manager's shoes and think about it based on Japan's layoff regulations, unemployment due to AI will start with "I got fired all of a sudden! I think it will start with "decrease in employment demand", i.e. "deterioration of the job market"....

- > [otsune](https://twitter.com/otsune/status/1723879754854523052) [[Satisfactory]] In the phase of building a nuclear power plant at [otsune](https://twitter.com/otsune/status/1723879754854523052) [[Satisfactory]], it will be necessary to calculate the production volume of upstream material processing and intermediate assembly efficiency to prevent the warehouse inventory from accumulating. (because the HP will decrease due to the radioactivity of the large plutonium warehouse).
    - Since [[inventory cost]] is not zero, let's make as much as we need as quickly as we need it, rather than producing large quantities efficiently, [[pull system]], [[one piece of sink]], no [[inventory]] production, [[Drum Buffer Rope]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1724232072368390250/quick_promote_web/intro) I'm not sure if yesterday's "people who are thinking 0/1 like "AI will take our jobs away" should do Factorio to improve their understanding of the system. I'm not sure if you got my point about "I think we should do Factorio to (abruptly)", I was talking about the need to divert upstream resources to other purposes if there's not enough demand downstream. ......

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1724233172198830243) This leads me to this
>  >nishio: White-collar workers who have been underutilized have the option of agility in the form of going to [[pick up the ball]], [[voluntarily taking a concurrent position]], [[creating a new department]], etc., and I feel that if they are strongly bound by [[job description]], it will be a hindrance to this agility. Company-wide information sharing] that allows individual employees to move around the company may be important for agility in the age of AI.
