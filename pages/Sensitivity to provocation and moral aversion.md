[Provocation sensitivity
- Definition: Tendency to perceive the words and actions of others as provocation (insults and unfair treatment) and to rise to anger and aggressive impulses. Easily associated with reactive aggression and hostility attribution bias. ([SAGE Journals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1080/02134748.2017.1385241?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [PMC [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.) gov/articles/PMC4522743/?utm_source=chatgpt.com], [Frontiers [https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.) 2016.00795/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com])

    - NAS-PI（Novaco Anger Scale & Provocation Inventory）。([WPS Publish](https://www.wpspublish.com/nas-pi-novaco-anger-scale-and-provocation-inventory?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Related findings: higher provocation sensitivity is more likely to increase physical and verbal aggression/read ambiguous facial expressions as hostile (HAB). Also reported in a comparison of prisoners and general group. ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886908004029?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [[SpringerLink https:// link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11031-022-09972-z?utm_source=chatgpt.com]])

[moral disgust sensitivity
- Definition: a disposition in which aversion (disgust) tends to rise to the surface in response to violations of norms, such as lying, betrayal, and dishonesty. Functionally distinct from pathogen- or sex-derived aversion. ([PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19586243/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Measurement Representation:
    - Moral subscale of the Three-Domain Disgust Scale (TDDS) (21 total items: pathogen, sex, morality). ([PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19586243/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [scienceverse.github.io [https://scienceverse.github.io/](https://scienceverse.github.io/) varid/tdds.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com])
- Related findings (key points):
    - Moral aversion is related to avoidance/punishment orientation of norm violators, with some studies showing a link to **Moral Foundations (Purity/Authority/Unity)**. ([APA](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/ebs-ebs0000075.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    - On the other hand, some have reported inconsistent associations with [[moral decision making]] (e.g., [[utilitarian judgments]]), and their role is under debate. ([Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep45526?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Usage and proximate concepts
- Provocation sensitivity: perception that one has been attacked/neglected by an outside party → anger → (primarily) [[reactive aggression]]. ([Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00795/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Moral aversion sensitivity: observation of others' violation of norms → aversion → support for blame, distancing, and punishment. ([PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19586243/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [APA [https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/ebs-ebs](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/ebs-ebs) 0000075.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com])
- Like [[Justice Sensitivity]] (JS) and [[Rejection Sensitivity]] (RS), it can be viewed as a group of [[sensitivity traits]] that are "sensitive to what" and affect aggression and social judgment through different pathways. ([Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00795/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
