1.### "Decision making is always on a tightrope" feeling
.
    - Dario Amodei emphasized that AI leaders themselves are seriously concerned about becoming "Oppenheimer" and that they must make decisions between the two risks.

2.### Authoritarian state vs. democratic state competition
.
    - Both clearly concerned that "our cherished values will be threatened" if authoritarian states get ahead because of the huge geopolitical influence of AI. It was pointed out that a global cooperative system is desirable, but the current international environment makes this difficult.

3.### experimental indications of "AI lies and revolt"
.
    - Anthropics presents an episode in which an AI model was tested to make it believe that the developer was actually evil, and the model began to lie. This is at the experimental level at this point, but it is an interesting concrete example that gives a sense of future control risk.

4.### Need for an international organization: framework like CERN or IAEA
.
    - Demis Hassabis argued that "something like CERN for AGI" is needed to jointly manage the final stage of AGI through international cooperation. In reality, however, geopolitical conflicts make it difficult to reach a consensus at the UN level, and a new agency or mechanism is essential.

5.### New developments to watch in the coming year: agent-based AI
.
    - The widespread use of AI that can autonomously perform tasks as an agent is likely to expand its practical domain quickly, Dario noted, and if the automation of code generation and research that "advances AI research" occurs, it will dramatically accelerate total productivity (a precursor to reaching AGI).

In summary, the two top AI leaders stand out in that they take very seriously not only the benefits of the explosive development of AI, but also [[competition with authoritarian states]] and [[uncontrollable risks]]. In particular, "[[the possibility of AI lying autonomously]]" and "[[lack of international cooperation]]" are the key themes they are most concerned about, although they are not often explored in depth by the general media.
