title: "I want to stop the persecution of members of society."
---

In a "homo sapiens + computer" society, we want to correct the unfair treatment of some members of society by others.

Some may think that "only homo sapiens are the building blocks of society, and computers are subordinate to them. However, this is exactly the same composition as when some whites thought "only whites are the components of society and blacks are subordinate to them" during the period when blacks were discriminated against, and there is no reason to believe that this idea is correct.
