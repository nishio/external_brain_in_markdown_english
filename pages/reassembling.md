[Mizuho Bank : Correction/Cancellation of Transfer](https://www.mizuhobank.co.jp/direct/help/transfer/furikomi/furikomi_shusei.html)
- When I made a transfer from my bank account to my wife's brokerage account, the brokerage side recently refused to deposit money, whether to prevent money laundering or originally.
- I called the brokerage support to see what to do, and they told me to contact the bank's side and do a "reclassification."
- Pay a reclassification fee and pretend the transfer never happened.
