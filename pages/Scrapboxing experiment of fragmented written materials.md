title: "Scrapboxing experiment of fragmented written materials"
---

This note describes the process of translating and incorporating books into Scrapbox, a digital platform for note-taking and information management. The author experimented with translating copyright-free English classics into Japanese and adding them to Scrapbox. The author's subjective interpretation and commentary was added to the translation, creating a unique value proposition. The author also tried the incremental reading method. However, this process proved to be less efficient than expected and the project was terminated after one year.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/omni/icon' alt='omni.icon' height="19.5"/>

While the translation and reading of books through digital platforms offers the potential for personalization and interaction, it also requires careful planning and execution to ensure a smooth reading experience.

Scrapboxing experiment of fragmented written materials
2018-07-28 It would be interesting to import fragmented writing into Scrapbox one page at a time [[linking]].

- When I wrote this, I had a book translated into Japanese in my brain, but when I was translating The Art of Intellectual Production of Engineers, I started thinking that I could translate it myself from the English version, which is out of copyright.
    - Because you don't have to translate it exactly.

- supplementary explanation
    - In 2018, I had a "paper book of Japanese translations" first, which I would cut and scan, and then experiment with it in a private setting, or add to it to the extent that I could claim it was a citation.
    - In the process of translating "Intellectual Production Techniques for Engineers in 2022," it was decided that "I would like to explain the source of the word 'conducive,' but I don't have a Japanese book at hand, and Wikisource has the original source and its English translation, so if I use this English translation as a basis, it will be copyright-free.
- So here's what I mean.
    - Choose a classic whose English version is published copyright-free.
    - Machine translate it and put it in Scrapbox.
    - While reading it, write comments and give links.
- I tried it at [[The Art of Worldly Wisdom]].
    - I don't translate everything.
        - Even if the entire book survives the test of time for hundreds of years, that does not mean that every part of the book is equally valuable
        - Filters for the modern era according to Nishio's subjectivity.
            - Anyone who wants to read the full, unabridged text can read the published original.
            - If you want to read it in Japanese, just machine translate it.
            - In other words, the way I can add value is by adding my subjectivity, which is my differentiation and source of profit.
        - First time, a little too much (=20), seems better to add a little at a time
            - I thought about it, but then I reconsidered that there was no way I could do it that "steady and diligent", so it was more realistic to do it all at once and gradually process the searches and social triggers as they floated by.

- I translated ~49 at the last minute.
    - The neat thing is that it's ~50, but the page is split there.

2022-01-30
- I added another 50 for now.

2022-02-12
- I was thinking of Scrapboxing the table of contents of my books, but I'll do this one first.
- Last time xcix was last, so this time from c.
- First, paste the entire page into a text editor and modify the following
    - The pages are separated and inscribed in the middle of paragraphs.
    - The title is being reused as part of the text.
    - Numbering is confused with part of a word in a sentence, so put a line break immediately after the word break.
- Translate 5 to 7 articles at a time and post them on the Scrapbox source page.
    - I'm stretching for a few seconds while I translate.
    - I once tried to select the next translation item at this time, but I had to stop because I got confused about where to go back when I went over the word count.
    - I didn't measure it properly, but it took less than 15 minutes to get here.
- Scrapbox-like interesting titles and dangle them out on the page.
    - This will give you about 50 new articles on the top page.
    - This could have been a mistake.
        - It's a pain to open the page and look at it.
    - Uh, could this be a situation where [[Incremental Reading]] is appropriate but Scrapbox doesn't have the functionality to support it, so it's not being done?
- What's at stake.
    - When there are links from one page to many pages, choosing one of them to view requires "decision making".
        - However, in the case of Twitter, where content appears one after another, or in the case of books, where content appears one after another as you turn the pages in a one-dimensional array, humans dislike decision-making and prefer content to appear without having to make a decision.
    - I was thinking of Incremental Reading, that one also has fragments, but the decision of which one to read is not made by a human, it is determined by the interval repetition method.
    - Before adding 50 new ones, I had to assume that the 50 I added last time had already been processed, but halfway through I added more!
    - I ended up reading the previous additions today, from top to bottom.

- About preachiness
    - It's hard to make the connection between "do what, don't do what."

2023-03-01
- Ended after a year of not being able to continue.
