> There are some illegal recipients within the welfare system, and some very wealthy people within the elderly population.
>  Other examples include false accusation makers within molestation victims, and more recently, violent|executive men (or not even "within") within transgender people.
>  As one would expect, it is difficult to call this a Restoration-style approach.
