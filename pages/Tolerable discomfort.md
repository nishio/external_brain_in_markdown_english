title: "Tolerable discomfort"
---

I think "[[discomfort]]" is too strong a word, but I'll put it there tentatively.

- Staying in the [[comfort zone]] will hurt your learning opportunities, so you should get out.
It's [[uncomfortable]] because it's [[uncomfortable]].

However, since there is no single "outside" that is uncomfortable, there is a competition for [[comfort]] among multiple "outside".
Spontaneous visits "outside" are "tolerable discomfort."
So when I can't take it anymore, of course I [[withdraw]].
But there's actually a breakaway point further in front than that, due to the competition for comfort.

Maybe people with lots of options are more likely to be in the foreground.
