title: "I want to make a madamis that can be solved."

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1918706292862210389) When I think about making a MADAMIS, I am tempted to make one where the solution is logically fixed if all the information is disclosed, but then the approach would be "let's disclose all the information, and the person who is not cooperative in disclosing it is the culprit. On the other hand, if we increase the incentive for not disclosing the information to other people besides the culprit, the difficulty level becomes too high to be solved.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1918712985343959292) Ah, well, all we need is a non-publishable handout or some other information.

This means "noise in the communication path".
- If information is shared without noise, it can be solved, but it cannot be solved because of noise

Another bataan is "too much information, not enough bandwidth."
- Can be solved if enough time is spent and information is shared, but not due to lack of time.

Some people create a system of reasoning that gets thicker and thicker, not by logic, but by atmosphere.

There's also the "if you disclose everything, then logically you have two choices."

Subsequent Conversations
- If the culprit is determined by logic to be one person during the discussion time, there is nothing left to do for the rest of the time
- It would be more interesting if you could narrow it down to 2~3 people, but not be fixed on one person, and not know the result until you see the voting results.
- Since there is one culprit and the rest are N-1 people, it is better to find the culprit to improve the overall well-being.
    - I'm sorry for the killer.
    - A storefront madamis where the GM distributes characters can control who doesn't want to be the culprit and who doesn't want to be the culprit for the first time.
        - With GM-less, you can't do that.
- Give the culprit another purpose so that he can say, "I've been exposed as the culprit, but I've achieved my goal.
- The design around here is focused on player satisfaction.
