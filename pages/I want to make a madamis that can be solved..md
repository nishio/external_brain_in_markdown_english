title: "I want to make a madamis that can be solved."

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1918706292862210389) When I think about making a MADAMIS, I am tempted to make one where the solution is logically fixed if all the information is disclosed, but then the approach would be "let's disclose all the information, and the person who is not cooperative in disclosing it is the culprit. On the other hand, if we increase the incentive for not disclosing the information to other people besides the culprit, the difficulty level becomes too high to be solved.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1918712985343959292) Ah, well, all we need is a non-publishable handout or some other information.

This means "noise in the communication path".

Another bataan is "too much information, not enough bandwidth."

Some people create a system of reasoning that gets thicker and thicker, not by logic, but by atmosphere.

There's also the "if you disclose everything, then logically you have two choices."
