- The mental model that programmers and non-programmers can be clearly separated is a [[false dichotomy]].
- From an initiate programmer's point of view, arranging blocks on a browser may seem "not a real progamala," but in business, it is not the type of technology used that matters, but whether it can meet the needs of the customer.
- As programmer needs increase, [[gradation]] spreads to "places not previously considered programmers.
- The development of a programming learning highway has made it possible for non-programmers to solve business problems with programmatic things without months or years of training as programmers.
    - Google Apps Script allows you to write programs in your browser
        - Let people enter data in Google Forms, which goes into Google Spread Sheet, and then you can write programs for it.
    - Kintone can automate various operations on data stored on the web without writing programs.
        - Google Forms + Google Spread Sheet + Facebook" like functionality in a set.
        - You can also write programs in JavaScript as well as Google Apps Script
- In this day and age, isn't it instructive to think that there is a boundary between programmers and non-programmers?
