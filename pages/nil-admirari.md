>  Origin
>  Marcus Tullius [[Cicero]] cites the example of Anaxagoras, as true intelligence means being prepared for every possible event and not being surprised by anything. Anaxagoras, when informed of his son's death, is said to have responded, "I knew that I had been given a mortal (Sciebam me genuisse mortalem)." Horatius and Lucius Annaeus [[Seneca.]] (Minor Seneca) mention similar instances and praise the ethical toughness of such an attitude.
