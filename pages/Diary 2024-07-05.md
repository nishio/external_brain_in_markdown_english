[Update "Pledges" during the Tokyo gubernatorial election: "GitHub" is used to open discussion...Takahiro Anno's response is: Tokyo Shimbun TOKYO Web](https://www.tokyo-np.co.jp/article/337643)


> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1808685834717311131) A part on "Anticipated Budget and Measures to Secure Financial Resources" has been added to the manifesto.
>
>  Can you really carry out your manifesto?　We have been asked, "Can you really implement the manifesto?" However, by implementing the manifesto in the first two years of the Governor's term, all the policies can be realized within the budget increased by the increased tax revenue!


> [obscure_chinpan](https://x.com/obscure_chinpan/status/1808877736985047362) The theory is that the number of votes is actually exploding because there is a large segment of people who support Yasuno and are cool enough to just vote for who they believe in, rather than those who are calling out to those around them to get involved. The number of votes is actually increasing explosively.
>  #Takahiro Yasuno
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1809016226544562654) This is not only "the type that does not call around", but also "the type that cannot transmit because they are government employees, etc." and "the type that transmits on line or by word of mouth instead of to the general public (so they cannot be observed on the public Internet)" and so on. I think they are especially liked as "young people who don't persecute the elderly" by older people who don't transmit much on social networking sites.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1809019241099899070) People in their 70s and 80s support the policy of "enriching the country through technology" and they also like the idea of "we need to go digital so that people can vote even if they are crippled." However, people in this demographic vote on the day of the election at a nearby polling place, so we can't read how many tens of thousands of people are there because they are not visible in the early voting exit polls.
>  >nishio: "Support from older people is stronger than expected, and the argument of enriching the country with technology is also supported by people in their 80s, and I think the reason is that they have experienced it as their own.

> [shuzaibusoku7](https://x.com/shuzaibusoku7/status/1808641459303952690) Yes. That's why I wrote sense. I don't know.



> [hiyorimi14hiyo](https://x.com/hiyorimi14hiyo/status/1808796480641323177) Hey wait, too soon to respond!
>  Are there any other candidates advocating public funding of the RS vaccine?
>
>  I believe this is a vaccine that was approved in January of this year and will be available for vaccination in June.
>  I was going to have the RS virus inoculation at my own expense because I was afraid that the only treatment for RS virus was symptomatic,

Member of the House of Representatives, Liberal Democratic Party [[Mizuta Sugita]].
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1809004318860923363) This may be a turning point in history where the old era in which politics was driven by parties, organizational votes, and media reports is over, and a new era in which each person votes according to his or her own personal feelings is coming.
>  >[miosugita](https://x.com/miosugita/status/1808812686802833695) I like this illustration, the face reminds me of characters from 80's robot anime, especially around Elgeim to ZZ.
>  This gubernatorial election, the one closest to my thoughts and direction is Himasora Akane. x.com/himasoraakane/...


> [namidomero](https://x.com/namidomero/status/1808864622075916435) There are of course many pros and cons about Mr. Yasuno, but what makes me very happy is that most of the critical opinions focus on "policy".
>  I felt that Mr. Yasuno's honest and fair attitude has led to the spread of awareness of "policies, not politics" among supporters of other candidates.

>  # Make Takahiro Yasuno Governor of Tokyo
>  #Tokyo Gubernatorial Election 2024

> [hayakawagomi](https://x.com/hayakawagomi/status/1808870450711384466) When Takahiro Yasuno ran for Governor of Tokyo this time, for the first time in my life, I felt like voting for him because I thought "I like him! I think I voted for him because I thought "I like him!
>  Up until now, I used to choose the men who I thought were "who is still better" and I used to vote thinking "I have to make the young people present", but I thought it would be good if everyone could vote for the men in a positive way.



> [annotakahiro24](https://x.com/annotakahiro24/status/1808864395197624755) [[Toward #Election Transparency]] The election campaign is in its final stages. I have published the current version of the cost of election campaign and political activities on NOTE. We hope it will help to improve the election system and make it more transparent!

- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1808865538376093751) This is really interesting and I recommend it!

> [u1_i](https://x.com/u1_i/status/1809000342123864281) I had the impression that it would cost more than I expected. I see that Mr. Anno had less flashy activities compared to the incumbent candidate, so I guess he would need further budget if he is going to be so flashy. I wish you the best of luck.

> [charo0915](https://x.com/charo0915/status/1808873673761435758) Excellent!
>  Moreover, the point is that it is open to the public during the election period.

> [monqsalsa](https://x.com/monqsalsa/status/1808877069235098018) Thank you for publishing this. Have you incurred any advisory fees for an attorney who is familiar with election legal matters? Also, a question about donations to cover expenses, can they be accepted after the polls open?

> [dandori95](https://x.com/dandori95/status/1808874359731409142) I like the transparency of spending!
>  By the way, how about the breakdown of income? (All self-funded?)

> [canoncampus](https://x.com/canoncampus/status/1808965529195147767) Excellent "visualization"! A necessary quality for future "politicians". I would be happy if you could help us.

> [hitorikkoyui](https://x.com/hitorikkoyui/status/1808856175389397216) I voted for #Takahiro Yasuno at the polls before the deadline! I was also able to see his street speech once.
>
>  In the past, I have often voted "I don't want someone to be accepted, so I'll put him in the opposition" vote, but this time I I thought.
>
>  I look forward to the results to see how many people in Tokyo feel the same way!

> [adachiyasushi](https://x.com/adachiyasushi/status/1808698507685212364) Japanese media really likes to report on political affairs. Both inside and outside of the party. As a result, political parties and politicians also mistakenly believe that politics is politics. Power struggles are important, but not if they are far from the will of the people. We have no choice but to rally around a common goal. The Osaka Restoration Association has gained support for more than ten years because it has advocated and implemented a unified political administration for the prefecture and the city.

> [ksl_live](https://x.com/ksl_live/status/1808788775998476336) The old man from Boipa is performing Boipa at Renho's town campaign, but originally it's against the Public Choice Law if a paid professional singer sings in a campaign, but the old man can get money too. I think he's at the level of a professional singer, right?
>  By the way, when I checked with the Election Commission what would happen if Eriko Imai of the LDP provided music and dancing, the immediate answer was "violation.
> [koto_tsumu](https://x.com/koto_tsumu/status/1808884846716203364) I was at the site of Shuntaro Torigoe's Sugamo street advertising 8 years ago and was burned in the media the next morning when Shinichi Mori sang one verse of "Eri-ee-monoooooo".
>  >[koto_tsumu](https://x.com/koto_tsumu/status/1807233503593177546) #Tokyo gubernatorial election
>  Candidate Shuntaro Torigoe is the equivalent of Renho this time.
>  This is Togenuki Jizo in Sugamo. He arrived 20 minutes late, but his speech was 3 minutes long, and his supporter Shinichi Mori sang a verse of Cape Erimo and that was it (*causing a Public Election Law commotion). The supporters of the (then) Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), who had to wait under the blazing sun, were crowding around local resident Mr. Yosuke Suzuki @20161023yousuke.

- [[Daimine Climbing 2024]] I'm on the move away from my PC, so I won't be able to update the Twitter summary.
- I'm using the Chrome extension to do this.

Only bookmarks that might not make sense later.

Oh, that's good.
- They say it's dubious information from an unknown source, so if they open the box and it's not second place at all, it doesn't mean they lied.
- It's an effective strike for people who see this and really think they're in second place, and in fact there are many such people in the support base, so it's probably useful to inspire morale.
- This is not available to the Anno camp.
    - First of all, the policy of "no backbiting" makes it impossible to lie in the first place.
    - Furthermore, it's not even effective because a large portion of the support base will judge these types of transmissions to be lies and trust will drop.
    - Even processing the graphs of the fastest growing social networking posts into impressive looking graphs has a lot of opposition within the team.
        - I can't give you a fraud graph.
