title: "Affinity and Achievement Needs and Community"
---

- For me, as a low [[desire for affinity]] and high [[desire to achieve]] person, there is no such thing as [[community]], and the world is composed of [[project]].

therefore
- "We were active in the [[BMOT]] community as long as there was a concrete project, like a BMOT lecture, but when the project was no longer there, we were not aware of it at all.
- When introducing themselves, they tend to talk about the projects they are working on instead of [[their community affiliation]].
    - > [[When you introduce yourself, you always talk about the project you're working on and don't talk about your affiliation or anything like that.]]
    - Self is perceived as a "project" rather than a "community".
    - Self-identity is expressed by [[activity]] rather than [belong to
    - [[Murder Mysteries]] is identified as a separate "project" each time.
    - It is not recognized as a "community" called "Ginza Madamisukai.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/立川 智也/icon' alt='立川 智也.icon' height="19.5"/>I guess it's a project and a community in my mind.
        - We are a community where every time we do a project, we make it a time that everyone will be glad to have participated in today.
    - The feeling that when Madamis is no longer held, it is the difference [[world view]] between thinking "the community will remain" and feeling "the project is no longer occurring..."
- I thought of this when I looked at the Slack of an engineering community that used to hold development camps at an onsen ryokan (hot spring) for the first time in a long time.
    - I stopped going to that Slack because no projects were being done there.
- I go to [[Yasuno's Team]], [[Code for Japan]] and [[JAPAN CHOICE]] Slack.
    - This is because that's where the project is taking place.

I personally am not a [[nomad]] physically, but I am [[settled]] in Tokyo all the time.
- But by being less aware of [[Community]] and more aware of the world in terms of projects, they may be doing [[abstract nomadism]], "moving to where [[the project is]]".
- Low sense of [[belonging]] to [village
- Like [[hunters]] who go hunt bears when they see bears?
    - And this one, well, it's a project.
    - If you beat it [[the end]].
    - [[End of story.]]

next  [[Community as a bundle of projects]]
