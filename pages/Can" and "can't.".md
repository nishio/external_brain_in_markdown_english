title: 'Can" and "can''t."'
---

- Can" and "cannot" are interpretations, not facts.
    - The claim "I can't" implies "I can't think of a way to make it happen."
        - Even if it's an expert opinion, there are cases where the person simply can't think of a way to do it.
        - It has been repeatedly observed that there are cases where other experts say that it can be done
    - The claim "it can be done" is also an interpretation, meaning "I have an idea how to make it happen."
        - You don't know if you can actually do it until you do it and get the observed fact that you "did it".
- Comparison
    - It is very unlikely that someone who thinks "I can't" will ever reach "I could."
    - The probability that a person who thinks he or she "could" reach "could" depends on the person's ability to estimate.
    - Those who think they "can do it" experience the fact that they tried and "couldn't do it," and can improve their estimating ability and planning.
    - Those who think "I can't" don't get the opportunity to learn because they don't try.
    - Anything without significant risk should be knocked down to the "can do" side.
