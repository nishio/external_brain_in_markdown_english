>  ・If an article or thesis is entered, a summary with various levels of granularity is generated.
>  ・Scroll left and right to go back and forth between a general summary, a detailed summary, and the text.
>  ・Convenient to grasp the content at high speed while gaining deeper understanding as needed.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1784259454797770778) Okay, editing. If you want to disregard the cost, it seems like it could be done by propagating instructions to the upper layers when one layer is edited, telling the lower layers to "re-summarize because the lower layer has been updated" and the lower layers to "update the description based on this summary...".

> [windymelt](https://twitter.com/windymelt/status/1784341734367105410). Whether that is editing in the traditional sense is debatable, but I think it would be very interesting to have it rewritten, taking into account the hierarchical relationship rather than the existing back and forth relationship!

>  I have a feeling that if we further generalize "edits on the upper layers propagate to the lower layers", we can also "propagate edits in Language A to Language B", "propagate edits in Topic A to Topic B", etc.

- >  ・People on the left assume we are talking about coffee.
- >  ・People on the right assume we are talking about architecture.
- >  ・ Actually, GPT-4 is converting the topic in between.

- >  Something like "I'm going to take what I said about X as a statement about Y" happens.
- >  I still can't verbalize it well, but this feels so amazing!
