title: "Task Listing"
---

When I was unclear about how to proceed with a task or how to prioritize it, it was useful to try writing down everything that came to mind on a small sticky note to enhance [[listing]], but when the time available for task execution becomes a fragment of a day a week and the intervals are widely open, keywords on a small sticky note are not enough of a hook The keywords on the small sticky notes are not enough of a hook to recall them.

In other words, as long as a task can be adequately expressed in "one line of text" or "one sticky note".
- task list
- Write on sticky notes and arrange them.
It is beneficial to treat the "high listability" of the listings such as the following.

However, as tasks become more complex or work time becomes more spread out and contextual memory cannot be retained, it becomes impossible to express in "one line.

It is common at this point to change the treatment to "one line heading + multi-line description", the same concept that makes it a Kintone record or a Github issue.

At this time, "how many titles can be seen at once" is "listability", and in kintone, 40 titles are displayed by default as an application? However, sometimes they don't fit on the screen, and in the end there are 13 titles on the screen.
With Github issues, the default is 25? I have 13 issues here, too, because they don't fit on the screen.

Neither can take advantage of the horizontal screen size by being basically a one-dimensional listing.
Scrapbox is not a very good list, but it shows 35 or so on one screen.

In addition, Scrapbox has grouping by tags.
This is equivalent to creating a tag field in Kintone and then creating a filter view for the string entered there, but in Scrapbox, this is accomplished by simply enclosing ` [Keywords.]` in a long explanation.
