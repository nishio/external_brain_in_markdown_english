I am deeply moved by the difference between fantasy and reality.
Shinichi Hoshi (science fiction writer)
all
Although the mood was physically adventurous, it was as if a platform had been placed on top of the earth, and the satellite had been launched from it using the platform as a springboard. In this case, I have the impression that the moon was reached steadily by the power of everyone on the earth through the development of mankind, like climbing the Himalayas or Kenichi Horie's "Alone in the Pacific Ocean. It is as if a mixture of time and machines have pushed everything up to the moon, and the difference between fantasy and reality is a bit overwhelming.

In science fiction novels, etc., we unnecessarily go to other celestial bodies and expand into space, basically due in part to the development of television, but that's a little different than in movies and stories, which are basically sweaty hands and resemble the feeling of the Olympics. It's kind of like a natural outcome, and the moon as a celestial body has been fully integrated into humanity.

You didn't do a very good job with the OCR.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

> [awamikawa](https://x.com/awamikawa/status/1791720889350058437) In the short story by [[Shinichi Hoshi]], there is a story about a man who gave up his dream of becoming an astronaut and went to an engineering school to develop a "spacecraft that anyone can ride in". I think it's a story about a man who gave up his dream of becoming an astronaut and went to engineering school.
