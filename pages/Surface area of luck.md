>  It is not enough to work hard only when an opportunity comes along. It is important to train every day to fill the outer moat of luck.
>
>  If you shoot carelessly and without a plan, you will lose. Find a pattern by accumulating small wins.

> [kenn](https://x.com/kenn/status/1960109642949763442) Even in stock investing, the majority of returns come from a surge of just a few days. Just missing those few days can cost you a decade's worth of results.
>
>  Missing the best 40 days (only 0.5%) of the S&P 500's 20-year history would result in a negative investment performance.
>
>  Take luck not as a point, but as a surface.

> [kenn](https://x.com/kenn/status/1960111987511443586) There is a concept that goes by that name: luck surface area.
>
>  Those who work hard and silently and only make efforts are not rewarded, and of course those who only talk the talk are not good enough. These are worlds of multiplication.
>
>  A person with maximal execution and maximal appeal will not win in area over a person who has a quintile of both.
>
>  See luck not in terms of dots and lines, but in terms of planes.

> [kenn](https://x.com/kenn/status/1960118346256658527) I guess it's like the amount of effort (intensity x time). By the way, Telling is "the ability to move and involve people by telling a story", so it includes growing an organization by telling a vision.
