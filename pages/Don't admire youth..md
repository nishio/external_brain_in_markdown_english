Don't admire youth.

As a whole, "excellence" is inflated on a time scale as the intellectual highway is rapidly being rearranged. The "I'm amazing in spite of my age! is only a relative evaluation between generations, not a review based on an absolute evaluation that is beneficial to the individual.

> [tkgshn](https://twitter.com/tkgshn/status/1388756282513911811): To put it very crudely, reviewers who focus on youth are low resolution and poor feedback. I was just saying, "Is that all you have to say?"
