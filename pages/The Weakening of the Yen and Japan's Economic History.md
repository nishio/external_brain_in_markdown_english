[[Yen exchange rate (Forex market) at 154 yen per dollar after falling to 160 yen per dollar at one point.]]
> In the foreign exchange market on January 29, the yen further weakened, hitting the 160-yen per dollar level in the morning for the first time in 34 years, but in the afternoon (Japan Standard Time), the yen suddenly turned strong and rose to the 154-yen per dollar level.

1.[[Plaza Accord]] (1985): Agreement reached at a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from five industrialized nations to induce a sharp appreciation of the yen against the dollar. The subsequent monetary easing policy led to the later bubble economy.
2.[[Yen appreciation]] after [[bubble burst]] (1990s): After the bubble burst, the Japanese economy stagnated and the financial crisis caused the yen to appreciate sharply to the level of 79 yen to the dollar in 1995.
(3) [[Asian Currency Crisis]] (1997): The yen was temporarily bought and appreciated due to [[currency crisis]] in Asian countries.
4. yen appreciation after the Lehman shock (2008-): The dollar was sold off due to the [[global financial crisis]], and the yen appreciated to the level of 75 yen to the dollar. This was a major blow to Japanese exporters.
5. yen appreciation after the Great East Japan Earthquake (2011): The yen temporarily strengthened immediately after the earthquake, hitting a postwar high of 75 yen to the dollar.
6. yen depreciation due to "Abenomics" (2012-): The Abe administration's "monetary easing measures" have weakened the yen to around 125 yen to the dollar. This was a tailwind for exporters.
7. Sharp depreciation of the yen after 2022: The yen is rapidly depreciating to the level of 150 yen per dollar against the backdrop of widening [[interest rate differentials]] between the U.S. and Japan. There are concerns about the negative impact on people's lives due to rising prices.

Historically, the yen's appreciation since the Plaza Accord has had a significant impact on the Japanese economy. On the other hand, the yen has been weakening since Abenomics, but the sharp depreciation of the yen here has become a new risk factor. It is clear that the impact of the yen's depreciation on the Japanese economy varies depending on the historical background.
