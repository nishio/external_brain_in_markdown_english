title: "If you don't expect the unexpected, you'll have nothing to write about."

> The reason I haven't written much about Devin lately is not because I don't use it anymore, but because I use it on a regular, daily basis and there are no more events that I particularly want to write about anymore from [[Try Devin.ai 4/1~.]].

I thought the factor "[[As quality improves, it becomes invisible.]]" was "[[When you start doing a lot of AI work, you can't talk about AI]]," but it's not just that, it's that when you think, "If I do X, it will be Y," and you do it, and it actually becomes Y, he as a person, it's so obvious that there's no motivation to write about it.
- The technology itself [[The leaky hole of abstraction gets smaller.]], thereby reducing the variability of the results.
- As the user becomes more proficient in the technique, the estimate of what it can do becomes more accurate.
        - [[Expected value control]] works for me.

For example, when they first ride a bicycle, they will say, "I can ride a bicycle! And for a while, they will say, "Now I can ride a bike, I can go to places I couldn't go before! But eventually, the fact that I can ride a bike and that I can go there by riding a bike becomes [[natural]], and I don't feel like talking about it anymore.

Today's results of "[[the combination of Gemini 2.5 Pro and Cosense Export for AI]]" were surprising and [[more than expected]], so I Tweeted
- The 4o illustrations were also more than I initially expected.
- I use ChatGPT every day, and Devin almost every day, but I don't bother to write about that.
- Even when the AI does something unexpectedly stupid, [[unpredictability]] gives you an opportunity to write about it.
- Unexpectedness decreases as behavioral predictability increases.
- After this "signaling period of beginning use", the opportunity to know decreases
