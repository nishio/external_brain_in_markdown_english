Frequency of place updates differs from frequency of personal updates.
- I wrote to UnnamedCamp at my convenient pace and it was like a hijack.

        - A phenomenon that often occurs when new participants
- At this rate, within a week most of the top pages will be me.
    - I don't really mind that.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/kuuote/icon' alt='/villagepump/kuuote.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/issac/icon' alt='/villagepump/issac.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Is there any disadvantage?
- I've learned to be reserved and choose not to write over there.

Let's say there was some interesting article that inspired me to think about it, and I want to write this down.
- At that point, I think it would be good if you could write in a comment so the other person's page can come up.
    - Not the feeling that one person is writing, but the feeling that everyone is writing.
- But if you follow the "write atomically" rule, you should make a new page instead of hanging your comment
- I'm having trouble here, and I've stopped writing.
    - Well, they don't actually stop and write to the well.
    - Human [[writing energy]] is constant, and it erupts where it's easiest to write and not where it's hardest to write.
- I think you can hang your comment as is without cutting it out.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - The reason is simply that other unnamed camp members do it too.
    - Of course, there is the drawback that it will not be atomic
        - I have the impression that [/unnamedcamp](https://scrapbox.io/unnamedcamp)pages are pretty much like that.
        - I'd like to cut it out, but I'm hesitant to make any strange changes.

                - Probably so.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - It is an act of making a non-atomic page atomic, so it is likely to be praised but not condemned.
        - At the well [Drop the concept of hesitation in the well.
            - I know I've said it many times, but I love this messiness of the well.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/kuuote/icon' alt='/villagepump/kuuote.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - Less pressure to do this or that.
