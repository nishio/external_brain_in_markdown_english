> The "apologize or you will die disease" was originally used to make fun of celebrities, such as politicians and corporate executives, who refused to admit wrongdoing, but after the spread of SNS, it was discovered that many ordinary people were affected by the disease as well. The meaning of the phrase is "they think they will die if they apologize, or stubbornly refuse to apologize even in situations where they should apologize completely.
