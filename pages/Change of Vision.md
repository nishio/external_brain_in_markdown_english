title: "Change of Vision"
---

- In the process of changing [[vision]] from "[[World's Best in Groupware]]" to "[[A Society of Teamwork]]," [[Cybozu]] may have changed its focus from [[groupware]] (software, [[artifact]]) alone to [[teamwork]] (productivity of a system that works while multiple people [[interact]] with groupware). The focus may have changed from groupware (software, [[artifact]]) alone to [[teamwork]] (the [[productivity]] of a system that operates while multiple people [[interact]] with the groupware).

(The interaction that was recently discussed in the lab was connected in my mind with the teamwork.)
