- One of the key concepts explained in [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]]. [[(1.1) Learning Cycle]].

    - [[study]] is a repetition of [[information gathering]], [[modelling (e.g. a system, etc.)]], [verification
    - [[information gathering]] :
        - [[concrete]] Gathering information about the target
    - Including actually [[personal experience]] doing, etc.
    - [[modelling (e.g. a system, etc.)]] :
        - Creating [[model]] by [[abstraction]].
    - Discovering [[patterns]] from the specific information collected ([[Finding Patterns]] , [[Discovering Patterns]] )
        - [[Understanding]] feeling = [[Acquire a model]] feeling of being able to do it.
    - [[verification]] :
    - Understanding is a hypothesis.
    - To [[experiment]] is to [[practice]], to [[apply]] the hypothesis.
    - Seeing the results of doing it will validate whether your understanding was correct or not.

Fig: Learning process is a repetition of three phases: [[information gathering]], [[modeling]], [[verification]]

- [[具体]] = [[concrete]] phase
    - [[情報収集]] = [[information gathering]]
    - [[体験]] = [[experience]]
- [[抽象]] = [[abstract_2]] phase
    - [[抽象化]] = [[abstraction]]
    - [[モデル化]] = [[modeling]]
    - [[パターンの発見]] = [[pattern discovery]]
- [[応用]] = [[application]] phase
    - [[実践]] = [[practice]]
    - [[検証]] = [[verification]]
