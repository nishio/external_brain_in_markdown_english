The "[[first and fifteenth days of the ninth lunar month (corresponding to new moon and full moon)]]" is one of the key logical tools in the [[middle view]] philosophy. I will explain this concept in detail:

Basic Meaning:
- It is a way to consider two possibilities, "one" ([[same]]) and "different" ([[different]]), and to argue that both are not valid.

Objective:
- The purpose of this argument is to deny the fixed nature or substance of things and to show the reason of emptiness (śūnyatā).

Example of application:
- For example, it is used to examine the relationship between the ego (atman) and the five skandhas:
    - If the ego is identical (one) with the five skandhas, then the ego must be impermanent like the five skandhas.
    - If the ego were different (different) from the five skandhas, it would not have the characteristics of the five skandhas, and its existence could not be confirmed.
- see  [[contemplation (on a Buddhist statue)]]

Logical development:
- Examine the possibility of "one" (identical) and point out any inconsistencies.
- Examine the possibility of "different" (different) and point out inconsistencies as well.
- The negation of both possibilities denies the substantive existence of the object.

Relation to the Middle View philosophy:
- This method is used frequently in Ryuju's Chūron, and is a logical means of developing the idea of the Middle Way.

Relationship to other arguments:
- It is closely related to other middle-view arguments such as "[[four-phrase discrimination]]" and "[[how to find the five types]]."

Practical Significance:
- Through this argument, the goal is to break through [[attachment]] and [[stereotype]] and gain deeper insight and wisdom.

ICHIHIMONBUKU is a powerful thinking tool for deeply exploring the nature of things and transcending fixed perspectives. It allows one to better understand the interdependence of phenomena and the nature of the sky.

- This method usually involves the following logical development
    - If things are completely identical (one), they cannot account for change or diversity.
    - If things are completely different (dissimilar), then we cannot account for relationships and continuity.
    - Thus, things are ultimately neither "one" nor "different."

Example of application:
- For example, when considering the process of human development:
    - If one is always the same (one), then growth and change cannot be explained.
    - If one changes into a completely different (hetero)being, then one cannot explain the continuity of the individual.

[[On the "Chūron" Kampōshin]].
    - [[Buddhist sect originating in the seventh century]] / [[contemplation (on a Buddhist statue)]] / [[Kenzo Tahara]]
- > The chapter begins with a discussion of the "one-way problem" between the "five skandhas" and "atman," which was called "one-way gate-breaking" by Kichizo, and uses this as the basis for developing the conditions of [[selflessness]] (nirahamkara) and [[no-self]] (nirmana).
