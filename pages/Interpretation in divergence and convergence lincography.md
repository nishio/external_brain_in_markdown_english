title: "Interpretation in divergence and convergence lincography"
---

- Summary of an interesting definition of divergent and convergent thinking in the context of [[lincography]] ([[linkography]]).
- > That's the connection between what I talked about in my KJ method lecture about the importance of the relationship lines found between unrelated groups and lincography's "move with multiple backlinks is a convergent move"! (This post itself is a convergent move)
- see [[How Digital Tools Impact Convergent and Divergent Thinking in Design Ideation]]

move
- A word that corresponds to the "move" in chess.
- In cases where the conversation is verbal and physical, the transcription can be split up with reference to the video recording by hand.
- In the context of chat and groupware, it seems to me that one post is roughly equivalent to one move.
- Link" when there is a relationship between moves.

orphan move
- MOVE not linked to anywhere.

critical move
- This critical does not mean "critical."
- Simply "an important hand" or "a hand of great influence."
- Critical backlink move connects to two or more previous moves
- Critical forelink move to connect with two or more future moves.
    - Of course, at the stage when the utterance is made, we don't know if it will lead to the future.
    - When you look back on a series of conversations later, you will say, "This move was a critical forelink move.
- "critical forelink move is [[divergent thinking]] and critical backlink move is [[convergent thinking]]"
    - This is interesting. I have a better resolution on divergence and convergence.
    - For example, in a situation where you are brainstorming ideas about something, you might say, "I think A is a good idea! "I like B!" I like C!" and "I like C!
        - I had taken this vaguely as "divergent" or "divergent thinking," but based on this definition, this is just a collection of orphan moves
    - Let's say the conversation is, "I think we should do A," or "A has a problem called B," or "Why don't we twist A a little bit and do A2?" Suppose the conversation is like this
        - This is divergent thinking because the first A is referenced by the other two
    - I think we should do A." "A has a problem called B." "If we twist A a little bit and make it A2, that solves the problem of B!"
        - This would make A divergent and A2 convergent.

This original lincography analyzes conversations, so the moves are lined up one-dimensionally, but what happens when you expand the tree of associations, as in [[Fireworks to think about]] or [[mind-map]]?

- The "parent of a branch" is the divergence, and the link connecting the different branches is the convergence.
- It can be interpreted as "[[Note the line across the group boundary.]] The reason it is beneficial to do so is because it is convergent thinking.
    - [[Achievement of inclusiveness]] in [[Cumulative effect of ideas]] is convergent thinking

Many one-dimensional chat and groupware tree bulletin board systems have the ability to [[Permalink.]] to individual posts
- Why, because without it, it would be inconvenient to "point to a past post".
- So why is it necessary to "point to past posts"?
    - One could interpret that as "because that's convergent thinking."
- It would be interesting to have the ability to analyze this permalink in chat or groupware and highlight "divergent thinking posts" and "convergent thinking posts".
    - Or provide a priority view of convergent thinking posts for those who want to skim them after the discussion gets going.


Scrapbox
- Given that a page in Scrapbox is a tree structure of rows
    - Each line has a move
    - Parental line with multiple children in a bulleted list is divergent thinking.
    - Rows that use line links are convergent thinking.
- Scrapbox's "line links" are broken by cutting and other operations.
    - Converging statements are the first to break.
- And they don't like it, and they copy it in quotes.
    - The good thing about digital text is that it can be copied, unlike audio conversations.
    - But the problem with copying, however, is that it's a one-way street, and you can't trace the source of the copy back to the destination.
