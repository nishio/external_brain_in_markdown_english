- Another thread in [Obsolescence and Impatience

> [golden_lucky](https://twitter.com/golden_lucky/status/1644300241108340754) AI technology is evolving so rapidly that I have a sense of frustration that it will become obsolete no matter how much I study. I'm feeling frustrated because I'm afraid that even if I study it, it's going to be obsolete.
> [golden_lucky](https://twitter.com/golden_lucky/status/1644302778188337152) I think I get the general idea, but I don't think I can bridge the gap between that and "what is realized and in front of my eyes". I don't think I can bridge the gap between that and "what is realized and in front of my eyes. I don't think I can bridge the gap between the semiconductor principle and the CPU as a product, and I don't think individuals can reach it with a single hand.

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1644541403178094592?s=20): If I were to use an analogy, I could do $.ajax with jQuery and say, "Wow! I'm sure that's true" and "I'm just trying to catch up with the introduction of algorithms in C languages". and "I read an introduction to algorithms in C to catch up, but..." to "What? Isn't there something wrong with the layers?" I'm sure that's what you're thinking.

> [ajiyoshi](https://twitter.com/ajiyoshi/status/1644547188041867264) I understand, but I want to build models, tinker with them, break them, and play with them.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1644547965116354562) If you don't like the API, there's an approach to running it locally yourself.

> [ajiyoshi](https://twitter.com/ajiyoshi/status/1644548766211661825) I think even if you do that, you'll end up not understanding it well (= no matter how much you tweak it, it will look like a big NN), so I'm not going to dig into the internal structure. I think it's OK if I don't dig up the internal structure of the NN.
>  I should just focus on what I can do with it.
