[Please Try. — Melissa Perri](https://melissaperri.com/blog/2017/12/29/please-try)

> [iwashi86](https://twitter.com/iwashi86/status/1788920068631666750) I read the sentence "Please Try." It was very encouraging. Here is a brief note:
>
>  [[reform]] is accompanied by [[uncertainty]], which causes [[anxiety]].
>  ・When trying to offer advice on how to survive change, the phrase "[[I can't]]" is repeatedly used.
>  ・Every time the phrase is mentioned, the next question is asked
> > "What have you tried so far to remedy that situation?"
>
>  ・ A friend's story.
>  ・When I worked at the bank, I was told that this was a bad idea.
>  ・The friend asked, "Who told you no?" and if he didn't get an answer, he kept asking his boss's boss's boss.
>  ・Finally traced to the legal department,
>  "No, I don't mind doing it," was the response.
>  ・It means that no one is sure whether the constraint really exists or not.
>  ・Fear of asking questions of supervisors and executives in companies with hierarchy
>  ・So leaders should make sure that their subordinates feel comfortable approaching them.
>
>  ・As a coach, I can say:
>  ・That it is impossible to help those who will not try
>  ・ And [[people who don't try don't grow]].
>  ・I have witnessed that people who can try, even if they fail, become better team members and leaders.
>  ・ So, I want you to try. (Please Try in the title)

[[I can't do it - have you tried this before?]]
