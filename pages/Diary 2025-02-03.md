And that can only be experienced "now". You can enjoy the works even a few years later, but the "season" is only now. It would be a waste if you don't experience it now.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1886229229786005638) Ahh, I thought the ban on Gundam spoilers was already lifted since the official wrote about it in the ads on the Yamanote line (= it's now available for unspecified eyes), but writing about it in X I don't know if the US or Taiwan, where it hasn't been screened yet, will be affected... In a global information society, Yamanote Line is local scope, not global scope.



> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1886223703777980662) My immediate feeling is that o1 has a "broad knowledge" of world history, statements of past thinkers, myths of various regions, etc., which he draws from an unexpected drawer to suit the situation. I have the feeling that o3 is strong in thinking rationally with the logic of a researcher in the sciences.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1886224874039017613) I'm the type of person with high o3-like intelligence, and as a result, o3 doesn't seem so great by comparison, compared to how often o1 gives me something I don't have, I feel that o3 gives me what I don't have less often than o1 gives me what I don't have. o3 gives me the impression that it is fast but gives inferior answers to me.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1886227217249927581) For example, when I was talking about this, that there is a difference in thinking about whether the world was "born" or "created", I didn't have Indian mythology in my mind, and Japanese mythology I assigned it to the "born" side and overlooked the "nation-building" part: [[Create" and "Born."]]
