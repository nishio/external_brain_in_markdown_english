title: "People remember places not by latitude and longitude, but by paths."
---

One does not act by knowing a place in [[latitude and longitude]]. They act along [[the way (of proper conduct, etc.)]].
They remember their position in space as a chronological story: which way to go, what to turn right when they see it, and so on.

>  No one can ever remember the absolute coordinates (like latitude and longitude) of their house or workplace.
>  But I remember how to get there.
> ...
>  I don't know the latitude and longitude of where I am, but I'm confident I can get there if I start again from the same station.
