title: "corporeality"

There are those who think physicality is important and those who don't. <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> is the latter.
I don't argue with those who think physicality is important because I think that is a working hypothesis that is difficult to test.

It's possible that they're not interested and don't know enough about it to pinpoint it because they don't know it in depth.

Negative on the need for a physical [[body]], but [[interaction]] with the [[environment]] would certainly be useful

- [[cyclic world]]
[[interaction with the environment]].
