> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1381282245462220806): [[population pyramid]] shows that the number of elderly people per working population will increase in the next few decades. The amount of work required per person will increase, so some kind of efficiency improvement will take place. One way to do this is to "let those who can do it operate the machines themselves," as private supermarkets and convenience stores have introduced [[self-service cash registers]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1381285801447714823): sushi restaurants are private private businesses, so they can refuse customers who cannot operate the terminals themselves. Such customers criticize the restaurant one way or another and leave. On the other hand, public institutions such as government offices cannot refuse them, so they have to put up a manned counter for such people. Since the number of elderly people per working population will increase, there will naturally be a long queue at those counters.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1381288134713864194): While the elderly without [[IT literacy]] spend the few remaining hours of their lives waiting in line, the IT literate elderly can operate a tablet in the comfort of their own home and tablet in the comfort of their own home and accomplish their goals in a short amount of time. To avoid IT literacy now is to choose the former way of life. Either you keep running away from IT until you die, or you learn it now when you are the youngest.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1381289870341984257): Well, I just think that the former are unhappy, but the people who are the former may not be unhappy because they actually die without experiencing the latter way of life. I don't think so. For those who don't like to learn, is learning unhappy in the first place? I guess each person should live the way he or she wants to live. It was not for others to interfere.

> Look who's back has Hitler going to the supermarket and asking why he has to take the items off the shelves himself! I enjoyed the scene where he gets angry. No one questions the self-service there anymore to begin with.

Who finds McDonald's mobile ordering a hassle and who finds it useful?

I heard that after the earthquake, the trains were stopped and there was a long line of people waiting for cabs to get home, but when I called them with the app, they came right away and I was able to get in.
