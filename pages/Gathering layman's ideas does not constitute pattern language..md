> If pattern language is "an expression of the wisdom of the experts that can be used by the layman," then it's not a matter of summarizing the wisdom of the layman.

- Collecting [[layman's idea]] does not make [pattern language
- After collecting a lot of [[Specific Information]], what is found is [[pattern]].
- An [[amateur]] here is someone who lacks a stock of [[Specific Experience]] within him.
- A "layman's idea" interpreted based on little information is not [[concrete fact]] at that point, but [[Personal Interpretation]]. is not a [[concrete fact]] but a [[Personal Interpretation]] at that time.
- Collecting and organizing them doesn't result in useful patterns.
