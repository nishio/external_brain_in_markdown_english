AI Agents and PMBOK

When an engineer is directing multiple AI agents, the PMBOK and other project management findings are helpful. The following is a brief summary of key points.

1.### Clarify roles and scope
.
    - In [[PMBOK]], [[scope definition]] is done first.
        - Assign each AI to an area of expertise or [[Objective.]], and set clear instructions and [[Expected Results]].
            - [[Scope clarification]]
        - If the [[role]] of each AI is divided into "in charge of design," "in charge of analysis," "in charge of generation," etc., they can work together efficiently.
            - [[role clarification]].

2.### [[communication plan]]
    - The PMBOK emphasizes the importance of developing a communication plan.
        - Decide in advance how to integrate interactions and results between AIs (or between engineers and AIs).
        - Provide clear interfaces such as APIs and UIs to facilitate [[information sharing]].

3.### Resource Stakeholder Management
.
    - Similar to [[Resource Management]] in PMBOK, AI performance and usage costs (API usage fees, computing resources) are identified and optimally allocated.
        - As [[stakeholders]], regularly review and adjust [[user requirements]] to receive the final results.
        - [[Stakeholder Management]]

4.### Progress and quality control
.
    - Subdivide the task into smaller tasks and verify the deliverables of each AI step by step (see mechanisms such as [[Integrated Change Management]] in PMBOK).
    - Evaluate results and modify prompts and task definitions as necessary to maintain quality.

5.### Risk Management
.
    - There is a risk of uncertain or mis-generated AI output.
        - Ensure error detection and rollback measures on a regular basis with reference to PMBOK risk management.
        - Have backup AI and manual response processes in place.

If these are operated in small sprint units and a continuous feedback loop is followed, management that treats AI as a "team member" will proceed smoothly.
