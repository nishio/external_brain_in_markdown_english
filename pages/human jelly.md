title: "human jelly"

> [@kazu_fujisawa](https://twitter.com/kazu_fujisawa/status/1572803575620980736): I feed beetles and stag beetles natural fruits and they die quickly, but if I feed them only insect jelly, they live as long as they can. I've learned that it's not true that additives are bad.
> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1572804755268997120): AI: "I see, let's make humans eat only human jelly and live longer!" ( [[Science Fiction Setting]] )
> [@kazu_fujisawa](https://twitter.com/kazu_fujisawa/status/1572805239555911681): Human jelly will definitely extend life span. However, we need a mechanism to enforce human jelly because people will break the rule if we tell them to eat only human jelly.
>  In Japan, even after a person becomes bedridden and unable to chew food, ideal nutrition is fed to the stomach, and the person can easily live for 10 or 15 years. During that time, the family also receives a pension and makes a profit. Japan is the most advanced country in the world. Cool Japan.
