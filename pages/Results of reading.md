- [[reading]], the information in the book temporarily enters the brain.
What happens afterwards
- Type 1: Forget
    - If you're reading for entertainment, this is fine.
    - If the purpose of reading is to get something, it's not good because you're not getting anything.
- Type 2: Remembering
    - This was once considered a good
    - The value of books is decreasing because books are now electronic and can be [[searched (e.g., for someone using a search engine)]].
- Type 3: New knowledge is produced
    - Information that is already verbalized in books is less valuable because it can be [duplicated
            - [[Easily replicable content is of little value.]]
    - The new knowledge generated here has a different value
    - By creating knowledge, the ability to create is developed, which becomes a source of value.
    - Added 2023-03-31: [[Achievement of inclusiveness]].
