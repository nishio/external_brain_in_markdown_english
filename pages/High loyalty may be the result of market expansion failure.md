> [yuiseki_](https://twitter.com/yuiseki_/status/1780940993224990806) When a meeting called "Product Strategy Meeting" was set up, I put a scrubbed copy of "Playing Strategy" on its minutes page in advance, and the first meeting I think the best use of our product was when the meeting was dismissed after the first meeting. Just a few screencaps eliminated the possibility of messy product strategy planning and wasteful regular meetings. It was wonderful.
