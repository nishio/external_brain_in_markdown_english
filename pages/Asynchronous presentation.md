> [73_ch](https://twitter.com/73_ch/status/1403656979931832323): another year, another unexplored jr boosting conference that went unnoticed...

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1403681977706840064): it's ok, as a result of the innovation of holding the event asynchronously, you can still see everyone's presentations and ask questions. We just missed the live demos and synchronous questioning.

> [ukkaripon](https://twitter.com/ukkaripon/status/1403683186228416514): there will be another one tomorrow!

> [73_ch](https://twitter.com/73_ch/status/1403683633047633922): my laziness is getting in the way of the type of video I can watch anytime I want, but I'll try my best!

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1403683850111180810): don't watch the video, just watch the questions.

> [73_ch](https://twitter.com/73_ch/status/1403685330159505411): well, that's clever!

> [73_ch](https://twitter.com/73_ch/status/1403911797988487173): now that it is held asynchronously (video), it is friendly to lazy people who can watch it at twice the speed
