title: "A case study of a new combination with the assistance of AI"

AI said from [[🤖2023-08-18 07:08]].
> Fragmentation of information and multifaceted associations create new meaning. This is accomplished by creating new connections to symbols that are not normally connected. It is also possible to export some data from groupware to which the AI does not have full access.

The following sentence was created in my brain after seeing this (see below A for details)

> Exporting some data from groupware that AI does not have direct access to by, creating new joins to ones that are not normally connected is realized.

If you read it in detail, you'll see that the original statement does not say that.
- In other words, some kind of [[misinterpreting]], [[misdelivery]].
- It creates new interpretations.

Looking at the phenomenon that occurred here in a little more detail
- A: The particle has been replaced and "the way sentence fragments are connected" has changed.
- B: Abstraction from "symbols" to "things" in order to be consistent

A is very close to the way I feel when I do Kozaneba and KJ legal methods.
- Chop the text into fragments [[Remove the particle]].
- The fragments are spatially arranged and "particles that are not clearly written" are supplemented in the brain and read.

First published in "[[soft bite]]": [[🤖2023-08-16 18:02]].
- The thinking with the AI up to this point has been verbalized that the "gears" need a "softer bite".
- But the specifics were never clarified.
- This phenomenon is truly a "soft bite."
- [[cushioned]] with "remove particles" and "intervening particles supplemented as needed."

described below A
- To be precise, this sentence was not created from the beginning, but what was born was verbalized to share here

        - Originally, the symbols SA, SB connected by particles point to a specific aspect ([[Aspects of Experience]]) $A_{AB}$ between the felt senses FA, FB
            - The particles serve to connect and anchor the symbols in a particular way
            - Consolidate.
        - Symbols can be flexibly rearranged by removing particles.
            - This effect is the reason why I use a two-dimensional arrangement in Kozaneba instead of the usual one-dimensional arrangement of symbols.
            - As a result, a new aspect $A_{BA}$ is produced
        - A new particle is used to try to express a new aspect
            - [[Felt Sense and Symbol Diagrams]]
- The process by which the symbol "symbol" is replaced by the symbol "thing" is thus
        - [[Finding sides by abstracting one from the other.]]
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/65029c74b0f1faca56ebbb9bf2956c43/thumb/1000)
    - New aspects are being discovered at the 1.5 stage, but they are small.
    - So, the desire to expand to the appropriate size occurs, and a larger area of felt sense is recognized as a single lump
        - (Felt sense is [[innumerable]], so it doesn't have a clear boundary originally, where human perception of it as a lump is changing.)
    - A more abstract symbol is chosen as a symbol that refers to that broad range
        - (This is not drawn in the diagram.)
- Note: If you were going to use A for aspect, it would have been easier to explain if the symbols were X and Y.


- Three steps ago [[🤖2023-08-18 02:22]], a new paragraph was introduced by copy and paste from another document and digested repeatedly
- One step ago, this was the shape.
    - > Fragmentation of information and multifaceted associations are important, and new meanings are created by "softly meshing" them together. This is done by creating new bonds in symbols that are not normally connected to create a felt meaning that cannot be expressed by existing symbols. It is also possible to export and use some data from groupware to which AI does not have full access, which demonstrates the need for an "AI Dejima".
- This connection happened this time when I saw it digested further in half from here.
