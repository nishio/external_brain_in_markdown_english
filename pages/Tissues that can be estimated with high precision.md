6. **Revolutionary Improvements in Back Office** - To significantly improve the efficiency of the organization, the focus should also be on operational reforms in the support departments.
7. **[[Tolerance of Temporary Information Gaps]]** - Because information is constantly changing, it is important to temporarily allow for information gaps that cannot be resolved immediately.

9. **Results Based Evaluation** - It is important to evaluate individuals and teams on what they have actually accomplished.

11. **Basic Approach** - Focus on the underlying issues and solve problems in a sequential manner.
12. **HUMILITY** - Always be humble and understand your own limitations and the contributions of others.
