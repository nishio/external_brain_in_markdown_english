title: "The sterility of the theory of how society should be"
---

- It is beneficial to think about how society should be and change it.
- But many of those who insist on "how it should be done" don't go so far as to drop it into their own workable plan.
- This is sterile.
- learned helplessness
- Lots of them.
- So most people who discuss what society should be like are noise
- Narrow it down to only those who are doing something.
