- The canned phrase used in marriage activity, "I want to get married one of these days if I find the right person."
- This is a story about how "nice guy," "one of these days," and "I want to get married" are all [[vague]].
- In Nishio's common phrase, they are "[[abstract concepts]]" and lack [[concreteness]].
    - See: [[(6.2.3) Sense of body]]", p. 192 of "[[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]]".
        - This is a story about bringing [[abstract concept]] closer to [[somesthesis]].
    - Let's be more specific about this story itself.

What I think about when someone says, "I want to get married one of these days if I find the right person."
- The words "nice guy," "one of these days," and "I want to get married" are abstract concepts.
- We need to ask questions to flesh these out.
- Of the three, "I want to get married" is the closest to [[somesthesis]] in action, so focus on this.
    - Related: [[sensory, conceptual, symbolic]].
- Also, "I want to get married" is a [[remedy]] in the [[PRO Model]].
- So my next question is, "When you get married, will [what happens next." Right.
