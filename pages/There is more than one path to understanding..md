- There is more than one path to [understanding
This is because each person has a different starting position

Even if one person A comes to an understanding using knowledge of knowledge domain P, it is not necessarily appropriate to advise another person B, who has not yet come to an understanding, to "learn domain P".

Better to understand B's current position, identify the stone that is now an obstacle, and help him move beyond it

I was going to draw "Person C who used P in the early stage but immediately went out of P and reached the goal by another method" in this figure, but then the meaning of the enclosure of P is unclear.
