- There is a tradeoff between X and Y due to technical constraints at some point in time.
    - There is an X-oriented one, B, and a Y-oriented one, A, and they are considered separate.
- Technology changes the [[trade-off]] line.
        - [[feasibility frontier]] expands
    - At this time, a new C is possible, which combines the X of B and the Y of A.
    - In this case, there is no clear rule as to whether C is called A or B. Everyone reads it in whichever way they see fit.
        - So it is usually called by the "major one" that is easy to think of.
            - Let's say they call me A.
                - Attribute X has improved so much, Y is a keeper.
                - Suppose there is an attribute Z not depicted in this diagram, and A is high in it, but C is not.
                - A person who is used to the traditional A looks at the newly called A, C, and says, "No, Z is too low.
                        - [[People who focus on the lack of]]
                - Those who went from B to C didn't care about Z in the first place.
    - (I felt another diagram was needed for this "word change")
            - [[Drawing on past dichotomies]]
        - The case is a little different in that there was no dichotomy in this case.

concrete example
- A: Cartoon
- B: Content combining ASCII art with dialogue
    - The "Learning by Doing" series, etc.
- C: Content combining AI-generated pictures with dialogue
- A had the advantage of "a combination of pictures and text".
    - I wanted to get its advantages, but the cost of painting was too high.
    - So ASCII art was used as an inexpensive "picture substitute.
    - This is the birth of B
    - B has the advantage of "lower production costs" compared to A (X)
    - A has the advantage of a "cleaner picture" than B (Y)
- Advances in technology have made "AI-based image generation" possible.
    - The ability to generate beautiful pictures inexpensively created the C
- Calling C an A is uncomfortable for those who originally did A.
    - Because those people did not see the value in Axis X.
    - First you think "C is not A", then you try to reason with it and say "it's inferior on the Z axis".
        - In the case of cartoons, actions such as looking at C and pointing out that "the composition is one-patterned".
        - Evaluation axis Z "good composition" is introduced.
    - But those who did B don't appreciate Axis Z.
        - So I feel that it is off-topic, off-topic, and off-topic to talk about axis Z.
