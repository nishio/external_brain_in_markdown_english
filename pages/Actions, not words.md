Actions, not words
There are those who say nice things but only talk the talk, and there are those who keep quiet but take action.
Talking is a low-cost action, better than doing nothing, of course, but an easy action.
Some people are silently trying to do the hard stuff.
Maybe this could be a biaxial diagram.

What exactly did you do?" The question is
action before words

Actions, not words" symbolizes the idea that actions are more important than words.

The page "[[Judged by our actions]]" illustrates the idea that we should base our evaluation of others on actions rather than words. The viewpoint is that actual actions express a person's true value and intentions.

These pages illustrate the idea that the value of actions is more important than words. Words are easily uttered, but actually putting them into action takes greater will and effort. Having a spirit of unspoken action is the foundation on which we build trust and respect, not only in ourselves, but also in others.

With this oracle, listen to your inner voice and show your will by your actions. A quiet determination will be the most resonant message. The bud is already in you, and the time has come to nurture it and make it grow.
