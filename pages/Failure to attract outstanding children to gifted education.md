[Setback for gifted education that attracted outstanding children: "It's not just IQ": lessons from the school：Asahi Shimbun Digital](https://www.asahi.com/articles/ASRDX4TVJRDQUCVL04V.html)

They have formal knowledge from the Internet, but their understanding of basic scientific concepts is shallow. They do not listen well to the advice of those around them and give up quickly when they fail in their experiments. This is tough," said a frustrated student of gifted education who gathered a group of outstanding children.
- [[They give up too quickly when things don't work out]].

> [tabbata](https://twitter.com/tabbata/status/1743624756858122364) Setback for gifted education that attracted outstanding children "It's not just IQ," school's lesson: "It was pointed out to me, 'That's great for an elementary school student, but there are kids at this level in technical colleges. There are many. They have formal knowledge from the Internet, but their understanding of basic scientific concepts is shallow. They don't listen to the advice of those around them and give up too quickly when they fail in their experiments. It was, 'This is not going to be easy.'"

I also saw an aspect where the children felt special in a bad way because they were selected based on their IQ."

>  While I think that there will certainly be difficulties and that there is a need for the cultivation and cultivation of the non-cognitive aspects, the article made me a little concerned that the Japanese universities and companies that came to visit may be asking for too much humility and cooperation.

I think that the PI's in the laboratory of experimental science are required to have a very high management ability nowadays. However, on the other hand, the field of "individual play and risk-taking" has not disappeared. However, it is a field that is easily left behind due to the recent university reforms.

He had more than 10 siblings, didn't read or write until he was 11, but was good at learning the flowers and plants in his garden. And as I recall, Kant was the son of a craftsman, and I think he was sent to college in a similar way.

I don't think having a high IQ is a reason for not fitting in at school.
> [mihyonsong](https://twitter.com/mihyonsong/status/1743250291934597499) I think it's good to educate them in an environment that suits each individual regardless of IQ, but an IQ of 130+ is not at all rare in terms of frequency, I think it's better for the kids if you don't raise them up in their childhood.

I think it might be the same elementary school as the teacher. I think it's because it's an upscale residential area and near a hospital of Godai University, so all the parents who live there are either excellent or doctors, and there is a high concentration of excellent children.

I think it's important to note that "there is no skipping a grade in the development of a child's ability to successfully lead a life in society. Basic academic skills, cooperation, and the ability to get things done are still essential for growth."

impressions
- Maybe it's too early to judge in 3 years, it will be 20 years before we know if this education is a success or not.
- Comparing the loss in the lives of the children who have been told here that they were failures, to the benefit to society from the publication of this article, isn't the benefit too little? What makes you happy?
        - [[An ordinary man killing a genius]] Then?
- Parents expect their children to have a 100% chance of success, but my skinny is that these things are like "30% reach the line that about 3% of the average person reaches! Ten times the odds, wow!" It's strange to expect a high success rate because it's like that.
- I think there are a lot of kids who feel that they give up too soon when things don't go well, but there's nothing wrong with running around with your interests until you're 30 or so, is there?
    - I wonder if learning about multiple disciplines in this way will lead to [[unforeseen connections]] and [[innovation]] after the fact.
    - [[Connecting the Dots]]
- >  Japanese universities and companies that have come to visit may be asking too much of humility and cooperation.
    - In the meantime, let's take these kids to an academic conference in the U.S. or something.
    - >  There is no skipping a grade in the development of successfully living in society.
        - This "society" is not one.
        - Even if you can't make a good living in "Japanese society"
- > They have formal knowledge from the internet, but their understanding of basic scientific concepts is limited.
    - Most of the public doesn't even know enough to look it up on the Internet, though.
    - Well, that's why even kids who can do just that are misidentified as "geniuses" by the dumb adults around them.
