title: "Work intensity is too high if we work in accordance with AI."

from  [[Diary 2025-03-04]]
Work intensity is too high if we work in accordance with AI.

prev  [[There are low difficulty tasks in programming.]]
- A story about an AI with a buggy implementation and all humans do is debug with high difficulty.
relevance
    - [[human tofu]]

Something I posted casually was buzzing again.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1896563219533328816) I almost had an adjustment disorder type thing because the work intensity was too strong when I worked to match the AI at all costs, but fortunately I was able to meta-recognize that I was in that state, and since it was discretionary work, I could take appropriate I was able to resolve the issue by taking more time off. I believe that work-life balance disorder will become an issue in the near future.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1896563823437603149) It's a simple story, up until now it was like doing "easy jobs" with the occasional "difficult job" mixed in, but if AI does all the "easy jobs", only the "difficult jobs" If AI does all the "easy jobs," only the "hard jobs" will remain. I would say that running this on a normal work schedule would be overworking for many people.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1896564947490099632) On the other hand, I think that people who are watching AI work vaguely with AI and human-accompanied type tools are going to lose cognitive ability because they are not using their brains as much as they used to. Both extremes are rather bad, so I think it will be necessary to balance them well.

We need to [[chill]] self-aware.

reverberation
- > I still think that the senior's way of working, "I'll assign a few young people a simple job with off-load and load balance and do my job while waiting for a few business days for it to be done," is starting to look like "If I assign it to AI, I'll get answers for ten young people in 15 minutes max and not much revision, so I'll be a constant bottleneck sandbag, and I'll be exhausted. I'm starting to see a future where "I'm a constant bottleneck sandbag and I'm exhausted." [https://x.com/diceken/status/1896940071074615376](https://x.com/diceken/status/1896940071074615376)
    - [[I am the bottleneck]] / [[I am the sandbag]].
- > I seriously believe that mental support by autonomous AI agents should be the first and foremost supply for generative AI-related workers to deal with this problem, no kidding. Source: me. If I couldn't live with myself while trying out ACT and other psychotherapies with a generative AI, I think I'd be in pretty bad shape.

    - [[AI Mental Support]]
- > Oh, this is because the programmers on the arms-length side are suddenly becoming [[playing managers]] without being aware of it, although I didn't understand this as of yesterday. And unlike their human counterparts, the time cycle is very shortened. You get hit when you're faced with being the bottleneck.

- > I'm starting to feel this too, and as I've streamlined my chores, I no longer have "things to do when my brain isn't working," and I'm constantly having to keep my head on a swivel. If I work at my previous pace, I run a higher risk of overheating, so the habit of "[[intentional off mode]]" will be important.

    - Size of the Problem and Number of Hands
- > I know this is a bit of a different story, but I had a similar feeling when I worked in a call center 10 years ago. The people on the other end of the phone were all high-calorie people who were having difficulty getting information and resolution on their own, urgent people who were in a hurry for whatever reason, and people who were involved in mistakes that were the company's fault. [https://x.com/hoyahoyakko/status/](https://x.com/hoyahoyakko/status/) 1897234117303132250
- > I'm thinking that this issue will lead to a lot of fatigue as seniors ask juniors for guidance and confirmation of the results will be shortened by replacing them with AI, but it will also lead to a lot of [[support engineers becoming exhausted]] by transferring labor intensity to support by dumping what they heard from AI [https://x.com](https://x.com) /sugarlife/status/1897086523990065561
- > I think it's a good idea to plan too far in advance. You have to be careful not to overdo it. [https://x.com/enzerubank/status/1897137196991439331](https://x.com/enzerubank/status/1897137196991439331)
- > I think "[[Recessology]]" said something around here.
- >  I wonder. In the future, we may be in an era where "the decision-making and thinking resources consumption that an individual can do is finite, so how to use and recover resources in that context" kind of thing.
- >  ......I want to live on a small farm and farm ......[https://x.com/ayasuda_jp/status/1896727779036877116](https://x.com/ayasuda_jp/status/1896727779036877116)
    - [[decision-making resources]].
- > I asked AI to assist me with report writing, but I had a [[brain dead]] feeling. I know, I know, but check. Then it's not too damaging. [https://x.com/noisemusa/status/1897121614585835935](https://x.com/noisemusa/status/1897121614585835935)
- > I know many people probably don't understand the concept of rest, but I balance it out by not cutting down on sleep, going to the gym on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, and [[making a day to go out without a computer]]. I've never been able to decide to take a day off, so it's important not to overdo it there either.

- > If you work from home, it might be better if you [[do more housework]] for the shorter hours, so you don't feel like [[you did your best]] less. It works. [https://x.com/TV00364181/status/1897145457421508954](https://x.com/TV00364181/status/1897145457421508954)
    - Certainly washing dishes is soothing.
    - It's like putting a rag on the floor as part of your training at a temple.
- > The response time is so fast and the sense of progress is so great that people with a [[workaholic]] background can easily lose sight of [[when to quit]].
- >  The fact that it's so close to being self-contained, there's no outside urging to quit. [https://x.com/opkp_/status/1897082602911359475](https://x.com/opkp_/status/1897082602911359475)
- > If we do our best to work with the machines, here's the short version. I personally think it's zama amiro that the problems in manufacturing are spreading to white-collar workers, but I have a strong sense of what this is going to add to society...

- > If you can use AI but not discretionary work, you may get a lot of pressure from the board members who will say, "What's wrong with you that you're exhausted when you're using AI unlike in the past! If you can use AI but not discretionary work, there is a big possibility that there will be a squeeze from the executives in various places due to incomprehension like this. ......

- > I'm working on a proposal as usual, but my desktop research time has been reduced to the limit, and all that's left is the resource-intensive work of wondering if I should really say this or if it makes sense... It's incredibly tiring. [https://x.com/uudaiy/](https://x.com/uudaiy/) status/1897087931808145501
- > I wonder if this is similar to the way that people started to talk about [[death from overwork]] in the late 1980s after office automation (OA) reduced travel and waiting time. https ://x.com/kis/status/1896610430958903561
- > It already is with IT/DX. The travel time for work that could be automated or for face-to-face foot traffic was a breather for the brain (conscious). Everyone has two "selves", conscious and unconscious, and in the past, the unconscious self did more work... Patterned actions are done by the other self (unconscious), not you (conscious), so the working hours are longer but not harder [https://x.com/](https://x.com/) metys/status/1897286671793840361
    - [[unconscious work]].
- > I see...AI doesn't have much to do with it, but if we don't include a certain amount of "low-priced but easy jobs," it may be hard because it's all just mind-numbing work. Maybe the current pace is just right. [https://x.com/SakaiFilmW/status/1897042590979211354](https://x.com/SakaiFilmW/status/1897042590979211354)
    - Indeed. I wonder if I could get a job watching over children going to school and waving flags, not for the unit price, but for the simplicity and healing.
- > This is a bit different from AI. It's very hard to do the work that used to be done by manually shifting between multiple machines, but the latest machines can automate it all, and after the initial set up, you're sent to help in other departments. [https://x.com/SnowDalmatian/status/](https://x.com/SnowDalmatian/status/) 1897023211025653787
- > I wonder if difficult work has become the standard and as a result, people who can't keep up will be identified as "developmentally disabled" [https://x.com/Mulletbycatch/status/1896901178807726544](https://x.com/Mulletbycatch/status/1896901178807726544)
    - Probably not, because the majority of people can't follow me on this.
- > In reality, there are very few people who can make AI do the "hard jobs" on a normal work schedule, and there are more than enough people who can do the "easy jobs" as AI tells them to do them. It will be a [https://x.com/NamaHageJpn/status/1896926216558711162](https://x.com/NamaHageJpn/status/1896926216558711162)
- > I think this is an argument about [[conviviality]]. It could be a sign that we've crossed the [[second divide]] and AI is taking over humans. [https://x.com/yando/status/1897235340508979590](https://x.com/yando/status/1897235340508979590)
        - [[divide of the two watersheds]]
- > I've always said that the biggest problem is how to train when AI takes away more and more of the training opportunities that have come from doing easy work, but, yes, I guess you could say that. I don't have a job where I can relax. Or pluck weeds.... <Season is almost here: [https://x.com/kumarobo/status/1896754727205179881](https://x.com/kumarobo/status/1896754727205179881)
    - That's a problem too, but I can't afford to worry about others and pinch myself.
- > When I work in a team, I feel like we all kill off the "easy jobs" and only the "hard jobs" remain, and we do them in multiple, intertwined ways. [https://x.com/vsgb6RZEk144212/status/1897259413037310406](https://x.com/vsgb6RZEk144212/status/1897259413037310406)
    - So [[AI makes each person a team]].
- > This is the "transitional hard work period" I mentioned earlier. The time when even the newest person at the end of the line needs to have a brain load as high as that of a manager. I used to be a manager, so I am used to a certain amount of high workload, but I still feel tired easily these days.

- > "AI will take over our jobs so we can have more time off", but not "[[we can't keep the humans if we don't let them take time off]]"? I guess a lot of difficult jobs would be jobs with a lot of responsibility. [https://x.com/okapies/status/1896733839625765221](https://x.com/okapies/status/1896733839625765221)
- > I'm thinking that a generative AI that can do all the power harassment logistics it wants might be more of a gospel since the easy jobs were done by junior staff and all the difficult ones on multiple projects were just getting together.

- > I had a half day on Saturdays until I was in elementary school, so I feel a sense of freedom to finish in half a day and go home. I feel it is better for my mental health to work half a day on Saturdays and go home, rather than forcing myself to work Monday through Friday and taking Saturdays and Sundays off. I think it's good to intentionally create loose work. [https://x.com/nakazawaseimen/status/1896867675412050146](https://x.com/nakazawaseimen/status/1896867675412050146)
        - [[You should work weekends and mornings.]]
- > There is a bottleneck in agriculture in terms of farmland area, and there is a limit to how much "efficiency increases the intensity of human work," so I'm choosing the latter: either start a non-farming job or slack off like crazy during the off-season.
