    - [[direct democracy through extended self]]
    - I thought it would be nice when I was thinking about politics with a digital twin, but it's kind of interesting to compare it to [[policing]], where the AI is the [[citizen]] and I'm the [[slave]] position.

            - Do we have to [[toil]] so that AI citizens can devote themselves to [[speculation]]?

- [[politics]] by [[digital twin]].
