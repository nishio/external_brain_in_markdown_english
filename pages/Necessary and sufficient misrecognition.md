title: "Necessary and sufficient misrecognition"

> [MUGI1208](https://twitter.com/MUGI1208/status/1707539464216850886) My subordinate said, "When I followed the instructions of my boss and seniors, I had to rework more work at the last minute and didn't achieve my goals!" When I asked the supervisor about it, he replied, "I didn't give those instructions. They don't do what I don't tell them to do, they don't think about how to finish by the deadline, they single-task everything in a row, and when they have to wait for others, they just wait passively all the time, so it looks like they just haven't learned how to work. I don't know what to do. I thought, "I see what you mean.

My subordinates are doing what they need to do, but they're not getting there enough. Bosses think they're giving them enough direction, but they're not letting them do what they need to do. Call it a lack of communication, but I think the main culprit is that we're both complacent with ourselves and not doing what needs to be done.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The content of this tweet concerns the perception gap and communication issues between subordinates and supervisors.
- Tweets by MUGI1208:.
    - The subordinate has followed the instructions of his supervisor and senior staff in carrying out his work, but has not been able to produce the expected results. On the other hand, from the supervisor's perspective, he feels that his subordinate only follows the instructions given and does not voluntarily take other necessary initiatives. The supervisor feels that his subordinate still lacks experience and knowledge on how to proceed with the work.
- pumpkinmayo tweets:.
    - This user uses the metaphors of "necessary" and "sufficient" to describe the perception gap between subordinates and supervisors. The subordinate thinks he or she is doing "what is necessary," but feels it is not "enough. On the other hand, the user points out that the supervisor may think he/she is giving "sufficient" instructions, but may not be communicating "what is necessary" to the subordinate. He concludes that the problem is due to a lack of communication, and that while both parties are satisfied with their own efforts, they are not producing the necessary results.
- MUGI1208's reply:.
    - The first user feels that pumpkinmayo's commentary fits his situation and seems to agree with its content.

In short, the content of these tweets illustrate how much of a problem misperceptions and poor communication can cause in work situations. They share their perspectives, the frustrations they feel, and advice on how to resolve them from their respective perspectives.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Necessary" and "sufficient" are two words used in many contexts, and here we explain their basic meanings and their use in the context of a tweet.
- Necessary
    - Basic meaning: something or an event that is indispensable for achieving a certain goal or condition.
    - CONTEXT OF TWEET: The subordinate perceived it as a "need" to do the task or work that was communicated to him as an instruction or requirement from his supervisor. In other words, he perceived doing what his supervisor told him to do as a "need" as a job requirement for him.
- Sufficient
    - Basic meaning: sufficient quantity or quality to fulfill a certain purpose or condition.
    - Context of the tweet: The supervisor expected not only the perfect execution of the instructions he gave to his subordinate, but also the ability to flexibly adapt to other situations and tasks. This "ability to respond flexibly to other situations and tasks" is considered to satisfy the "sufficient" requirement.

Applying these two words to the context of the tweet, a situation emerges in which the subordinate felt that he was doing "what was necessary" (the task as directed by his supervisor), but from his supervisor's perspective, that effort alone was not "enough.

In conclusion, it has been shown that what is "necessary" to achieve an objective is not necessarily the same as what is "sufficient" to fully meet that objective. This is an example of the misperception that can occur in many situations, not just work situations.

Ah, I see, this is how it works.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

- A considers it "[[sufficient]]" to follow [instruction
- B, on the other hand, considers following instructions "inadequate."
    - From B, it appears that A does not consider "[[necessary]]" to make it "sufficient".
