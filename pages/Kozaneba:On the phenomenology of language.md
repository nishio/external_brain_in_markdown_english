- [[Edge labels are ternary relations]]

- [[I've read Merleau-Ponty's commentary on Husserl's phenomenology and want to see how well I can explain it without looking at it.]]
- It's not quite as exciting as it usually is, because the felt sense isn't forming.
- I couldn't remember the term "phrenology of language."
- Thought is a private phenomenon without language, it becomes an intersubjective value through language, and then it acquires an ideational real existence
- What is the difference between Merleau-Ponty and Hussar?
    - Merleau-Ponty, Husserl, The Difference." A commentary by Hajime Nakayama appeared! [[Read The Phenomenology of Perception]].
        - I feel lost reading this now.

- I just realized.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>You're talking about why I'm trying to understand Husserl, because Eugene Gendlin's ideas were very much in line with my practical purpose, which was to focus on how to put the unverbalized into language, so I was studying that, and I was studying the Merleau-Ponty text that he was introducing me to. I ordered and read the Merleau-Ponty text that he was referring to, and it was a commentary on Husserl and then a development of Husserl's commentary, so I decided to experiment with that as a test bed and try to use Kozaneba to go through the process of reading and understanding a difficult book.
- I think this is a very important thing to say.
    - I mean, I wanted to know the context of Merleau-Ponty's [[To express is to be aware]] that Eugene Gendlin quoted, so I bought the book.
    - I didn't want to know about Hussar.
    - I didn't read the introductory part of Husserl and feel "I don't get it", rather I "get it", which is why I tried to verify it with Keichobot.
    - However, the story did not expand, appropriate questions were not asked, and I could not speak well even in listen first mode, because I did not have the impetus in me to speak.
    - As soon as we get to talking about Eugene Gendlin, he's talkative, because there are so many hooks here.
    - By the way, I forgot about [[To express is to be aware]] until now.
        - For the subject who speaks, to express is to be aware. He does not express himself merely for the sake of others. He expresses in order to know for himself what he is aiming at.
        - This is precisely the difference between Husserl and Merleau-Ponty that was not answered when asked
            - Husserl believed that "the meaning of words comes first, and then we use them to express ourselves," rather than "we try to express ourselves with words, and thereby create meaning."
                - The purpose of expression at this time was to communicate to others.
                - Merleau-Ponty, however, said that it is the acquisition of meaning by us that is relied upon, not only when communicating to others
                - In this context comes "For the subject who speaks, to express is to be aware. p.119
                    - To express is not to transmit an idea to others.

So it's not that the felt sense hasn't been formed, but that the right questions haven't been asked.

By the way, I think it's probably [[Dimensions of tacit knowledge]] about how you know Merleau-Ponty everywhere.
- I know more than I can tell you."
- Possibly related.
