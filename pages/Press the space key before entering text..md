Tips for simultaneous multi-person editing in Scrapbox
- Press the space key and a circle appears to tell you "someone is about to write on this line".



from [/villagepump/using-scrapbox-in-class](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/using-scrapbox-in-class).
- That's where Scrapbox comes in!
    - I told him, "Press the space key before you type."
    - Then the indentation circle becomes a "I took its place" sign, and the other students move to a different line
    - The UI or ease of operation in this area is an attraction unique to Scrapbox.
        - It's very easy to get this instruction in "just one word" with junior high school students.
