title: "Those who can make it and those who can't."

> [manabuueno](https://x.com/manabuueno/status/1792742253406118304) I thought that after 100 rounds the world would be divided into [[those who can make it]] and [[those who can't]]. It is not a difference in skill, but a difference in which side you identified yourself as in the process of becoming an adult. To make it, above all, I need [[Belief that we can make it]], and those who can make it have it spread out without limiting their domain. It is this belief that Polanyi called tacit knowledge.

> [manabuueno](https://x.com/manabuueno/status/1792742254677008768) Kubler] wrote that a person is artistically active for about 60 years from the age of 15. The awareness that one is a creator is probably acquired by the age of 15. Those who can create come closer to creating by creating. Those who cannot create approach creation in ways other than creating. That is how I see it.

> [manabuueno](https://x.com/manabuueno/status/1792754071033749751) What is needed to make something is not the ability to make it, but the belief that it can be made. No matter how good your ability is, when you make something, you will face some kind of greater difficulty. Only the power of belief can overcome these difficulties. I think that those who cannot make something misunderstand whether they can make it or not as a matter of ability.
>  >manabuueno: Everyone is at a loss when something goes wrong when making something. Whether or not they give up there. Only those who believe that they can make it will go on down the [[thorny path]] and finally achieve a form. The repetition of this experience is what makes a [[maker]].
