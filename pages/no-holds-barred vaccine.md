no-holds-barred vaccine
- [[The desire to be underestimated]]
- Why do we want to be "fooled"?
- I think it's [[vaccination]] of being "underestimated."
- People who are not vaccinated and are first exposed to "ahagiri" at an older age will have severe symptoms.
- Feeling of non-existence [[Intention to insult]] or
        - [[Assumption that adults are superior to children]] and only return what they have done unconsciously.
- I think they want to avoid that, so they want to be underestimated early on.
