dentist
- I'd be careful with large periodontal pockets due to wisdom teeth involvement, and I'd have my dentist clean them out frequently.
- Dentist again next month

I want to eliminate duplicates and add up people who registered on Google Form and people who registered only on [[Team Mirai Action Board]].
- Different people prefer different entrances and want to maintain both.
- Asking people who have entered the action board to fill out the Google Form again is subtle.
    - The reverse is also subtle, but there's a limit to what Google Form can do.
