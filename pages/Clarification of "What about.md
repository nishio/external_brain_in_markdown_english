title: 'Clarification of "What about'
---

- What do you mean by "what about X?"
    - How about X?" kind of usage.
        - In short, I'm trying to say, "X is not good."
        - I'm not sure if it's really not good, and I can't say "not good".
        - Failure to provide evidence for the claim that "it's not good."
        - [[blurring]] it [[unaware or unmindful of]] and deceiving even himself.
    - How about adopting X?
        - This one honestly says "X is better."
    - An expression that can mean both good and bad is [[harmfulness]].
            - [[word used with harmful expressions]]
