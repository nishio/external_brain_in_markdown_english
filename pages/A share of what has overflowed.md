(OCR) I'm so happy but the demand is ..... LOL!
xxxx-kun
I've been drawing doujinshi for 34 years and I can tell you for sure
Demand is an afterthought.
Doujinshi is only viable if you have your own readers.
Distribution is a way of sharing it.
Excuse me! This is my fanzine, but it's overflowing, so if you want it, I'll give it away for 500 yen!" What!

- The private public Scrapbox may also be a share of what has overflowed<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - thankful<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/cak/icon' alt='/villagepump/cak.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/Hiro Aki/icon' alt='/villagepump/Hiro Aki.icon' height="19.5"/>
- This is the truth.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/cak/icon' alt='/villagepump/cak.icon' height="19.5"/>
- The distribution of perceptions is going to change from generation to generation because of the commercialization of electronic sales.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I think it's like this BASICALLY.
    - Yeah, I guess so.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - The time when printing costs were necessary for distribution, so it was distributed at actual cost.
        - digital age
        - If you just want to share electronically, just post it on social media.
        - Directly monetizable through FANBOX and other means without printing costs
        - What is the point of making a physical book in that era?
            - It seems that [[the desire to publish a book]] is greater than the weight of sharing
            - I've thought about this before, and I've been rereading my notes, and I've realized that I used to be[[読み手を直接観測]]できることを重要視していた<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - [/motoso/why do you participate in doujinshi auctions as a circle participant?](https://scrapbox.io/motoso/why do you participate in doujinshi auctions as a circle participant?)
                - good prospect (e.g. marriage, business)<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/cak/icon' alt='/villagepump/cak.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - Mandatory deadlines, very understandable.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/cak/icon' alt='/villagepump/cak.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - The book I draw is also the book I want, but [[it can't be completed without a deadline]], so I make the deadline by participating in events.
                - I'm glad readers come to the space, and I'm very happy when they're happy with a hotter passion than the painter.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/cak/icon' alt='/villagepump/cak.icon' height="19.5"/>
                    - I understand. That kind of reaction is completely unexpected.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Same thing with electronic boards.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>

- (Searching for original post)
    - There should have been some sort of chat log.
        - [[Doujinshi is sharing]]
        - [[Doujinshi]]
            - There it is.
        - [[sharing with others what has been given to you]]
        - [[Souce...]]

[[Demand is an afterthought.]]

- [[Doujinshi is sharing]]
[[Doujinshi]] is [[share]].
[[share the overflow]]
