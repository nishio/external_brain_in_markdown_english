There is a strong and weak "X is not Y" relationship.
- Weak: Negation of "X is Y
    - It merely says that "not 'every X element is a Y element'".
- Strong:
    - Claims that "not all X elements are 'Y elements.'"

- In addition, while not logically correct, humans also implicitly reason this way.
        - [[Implicit incorrect inference]]
