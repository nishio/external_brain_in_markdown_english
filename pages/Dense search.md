- Dense Retrieval is a search method that transforms queries and documents into **[[dense vectors]] ([[embedding]])** in a learned model, and finds similarities by [[vector similarity]] (cosine/inner product).
- It is more resistant to [[putting in other words]] and [[semantic proximity]] than [[sparse search]] (e.g., [[BM25]]), which focuses on keyword matching.
