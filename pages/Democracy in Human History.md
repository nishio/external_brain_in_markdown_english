<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>These tweets are a critical examination of American political scientist Stasavage's discussion of "democracy in human history." The point is that if you call "[[majority participation]]" "democracy" as it is, even the "[[people's democracy]]" held up by the socialist bloc becomes democratic, and the definition becomes ambiguous. The tweeter points out that if the ambiguity cannot be overcome, we should call it a history of "[[republicanism]]" instead of "democracy.

He further suggests that the background of these theories is influenced by the U.S. international political strategy, a view of history based on the dichotomy of democracy versus tyranny, and [[modernization theory]] (a theoretical framework developed by the U.S. during the Cold War in opposition to Marxism). In other words, he criticizes the movement to portray "democracy" as easily universal, which lacks academic rigor and is easily used for political agendas and national policies.

In sum, the author's argument is that a view of history that blurs the definition of "democracy" tends to pander to American political contexts and strategies, and is in danger of sacrificing academic quality.

First, the issue that if the definition of the concept of "democracy" is blurred and directly linked to majority participation = democracy, even the historically tyrannical "people's democracy" can be treated as a democracy is certainly a reasonable point to make. This criticism is a valid concern, since academic analysis requires rigor in terminology.

Second, it is a historical fact that the history of American political science is deeply connected to the national policy and international context of the Cold War period, and that theoretical frameworks (such as modernization theory) were influenced by political intentions. Therefore, there is an ideological background to the formation of the theories, and the criticisms that point this out are reasonable in themselves.

However, we cannot immediately conclude that Stasavage's research is a "fabrication for political purposes. Individual scholars have diverse motivations, and theories should be taken in their academic context. In this regard, criticisms can sound somewhat judgmental while still raising valid issues.

In summary, the ambiguity of the conceptual definition and the caution against the political use of academia are targeted criticisms, but we need to carefully consider whether they are material to the total denial of the value and motivation of the study as a whole.
