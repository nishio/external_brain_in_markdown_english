Four Phrases as a Guide to Action

- The explanation of [[four-phrase discrimination]] is expressed as if it were a logical truth, but I think it is a more [[practical]] [[action guideline]], not such [[head-in-the-sand]] thinking. [The Mahavairocana Sutra says (grattracted from the Semiotic Elucidation of the Emptiness View)
> When one practices prajna-paramita, one takes, does not take, does not take again, does not take again, does not take again, does not take again, does not take again, does not take again, does not take again, does not practice prajna-paramita

It represents the important teachings of the Bodhisattva in the practice of prajnaparamita (supreme wisdom). It is explained in more detail below:
- Basic Meaning:
    - It is the teaching that when [[bodhisattvas]] practice [[prajnaparamita]], they should not have the following attachments or conceptualizations of all things (all Dharma):
        - To cling to the existence (wakatori yu)
        - To cling to non-existence (wakatori non-existence)
        - To cling to the idea that something both exists and does not exist (若取亦有亦非有)
        - To be obsessed with non-existence or non-existence (wakatori non-existence or non-existence).
        - To be attached even to that which is not attached (wakatori fotori).

Deeper Meaning:
- This teaching emphasizes the importance of leaving attachment to any concept or idea. True wisdom ([[prajna]]) lies in transcending dualistic thinking and fixed views.
