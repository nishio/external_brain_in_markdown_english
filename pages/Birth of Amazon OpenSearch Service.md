<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>There have been significant events between Amazon and Elasticsearch in the context of [[open source software]] (OSS). This is particularly true since Amazon began offering a service based on the Elasticsearch software, Amazon Elasticsearch Service (now Amazon OpenSearch Service). The following is a brief history of this process.

- Launch of Amazon Elasticsearch Service: [[Amazon Web Services]] (AWS) began offering the Elasticsearch Service using a popular open source search engine called [[Elasticsearch]]. This service made it easy to deploy and run Elasticsearch in the cloud.
- License Change: Elasticsearch was originally distributed under the [[Apache 2.0]] license. In 2021, Elastic NV (the company developing Elasticsearch) changed the license to the [[Server Side Public License]] (SSPL) in order to compete with Amazon's commercial use of Elasticsearch in their services. The license change was intended to restrict large companies such as Amazon from using Elasticsearch code as-is to build their own products.
- The birth of Amazon OpenSearch Service: in response to the Elastic NV license change, Amazon has finally [[folk]] Elasticsearch 7.10 and Kibana 7.10 versions and a new project called "OpenSearch" It has launched a new project called "OpenSearch". It is being developed under the Apache 2.0 license and will serve as an open source version of Elasticsearch and Kibana.
- Market Impact and Industry Reaction: Elastic's license change and Amazon's fork have generated a lot of discussion within and outside the open source community. Some see it as a violation of the [[open source philosophy]], while others see it as a necessary step to protect the [[business model]] and ensure [[sustainability]].

These events shed light on the legal and economic challenges surrounding open source software and are important examples of how commercial companies use and contribute to open source projects.
