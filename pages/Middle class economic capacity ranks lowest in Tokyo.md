> The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism calculated the economic affluence of the middle class (top 40-60%) of working households of two or more people in 47 prefectures based on the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications' National Survey of Current Consumption. When the value of productive activities (opportunity cost) that would have been possible without food, housing, and commuting time was subtracted from disposable income, Mie Prefecture topped the list with about 239,000 yen per household per month that could be spent on entertainment, while Tokyo was at the bottom with about 135,000 yen.
