title: "authoritarian gradient"
---

A term created to describe the relationship between the captain and co-pilot of an airplane.
The gradient should not be too steep, but neither should it be too gradual.
If it is too sudden, it delays the transmission of information from the co-pilot to the captain.
If it is too loose, decisions will be delayed in situations where critical decisions need to be made.
