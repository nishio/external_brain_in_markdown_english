## plant metaphor
- [[Evergreen Notes]] compares a notebook that grows into a lush evergreen tree, and says that by taking care of it, we can enrich our knowledge.
- Scrapbox also allows topics to grow as they wish through bullet points and communication in the form of a tree diagram, and new pages can be created as if cutting out a single branch or flower.
- On another note, the expression "trees and forests" also fits well.
    - In Scrapbox, trees called pages are connected to each other to create a forest-like environment.
    - To follow the link is to explore the forest as an [[information gibbon (any small, long-armed ape of the family Hylobatidae)]], walking through the trees.
    - You can look closely at each individual tree or at the forest as a whole.
    - [[Donald Norman]] divided cognition into experiential and introspective cognition.
    - However, Scrapbox, which defends a simple display, seems to have a philosophy that places relatively heavy emphasis on the former.
    - One might say that when one scrolls down and sees the related page list column, one switches into an introspective cognitive mode.
    - Obsidian Canvas and other features that visualize the relationship between pages were very popular in the PKM community just prior to ChatGPT.
    - However, I would like to see a more overarching system of information in Scrapbox as well.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/arpla/nishio/icon' alt='/arpla/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Kozaneba] and [[Scrapbox ChatGPT Connector]] may play this role.
        - (That part is beyond the scope of <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/arpla/Haruhi/icon' alt='/arpla/Haruhi.icon' height="19.5"/>'s understanding, so I'll stop here).
