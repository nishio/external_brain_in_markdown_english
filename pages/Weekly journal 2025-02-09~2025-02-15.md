Reflections on the past week
- [[o3-mini-high]] came (2/1) and [[OpenAI Deep Research]] came
    - 2/3 [[meeting to try out Deep Research]].
- Did [[Advances in AI and Plurality]] on 2/5 and [Open Space Technology
    - TODO [[OST and Plurality]] Write.
- 2/6 and 2/8 discussed broad listening.



# what are you doing tomorrow?
Question by having o3 read backlog.json
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Suggest what you think is the most appropriate task to do on 2/10.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3-mini-high/icon' alt='o3-mini-high.icon' height="19.5"/>We propose ### "Study measures to cope with increase in information channels (T0116)"
 as a task to be carried out on 2/10.
- Reason:
    - Measures are needed to deal with the current situation where confusion can easily arise due to the diversification of information sources such as Signal, Slack, ChatGPT, etc.
    - Efficient organization and notification methods and consideration of AI utilization plans will directly improve business productivity.
    - This task allows for strategic ideation in a short period of time and is well suited to the 2/10 schedule.
This task is worth undertaking early on to lay the groundwork for future improvements to the information management system.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3-mini-high/icon' alt='o3-mini-high.icon' height="19.5"/>The following tasks are considered relevant in terms of organizing and integrating information and dealing with multiple channels
- T0114: Investigation and verification of Claude's computer-use features
    - → We are exploring integrated information acquisition methods through access studies of multiple communication channels such as Signal, Discord, and Twitter.
- T0089: Multi-source integration
    - → The theme of integrating multiple channels is common with the theme of integrating multiple channels in that it implements the ability to import data from different sources, such as GitHub Issues and Scrapbox.
- T0024: Build a system to manage public and private information in an integrated manner
    - → Consideration of a centralized mechanism for managing different types of information is relevant as an approach to sorting through the confusion that accompanies an increase in information channels.
- T0044: Cosense MCP Server Development Study
    - → This is similar to the technical aspects of channel integration in that it investigates methods of cooperation and communication with multiple platforms.

These themes of "integration" and "organization" are common to the study of measures to deal with the diversification of information channels (T0116), and overall efficiency improvement can be expected by addressing them from mutually complementary perspectives.

114 is a good point.
- New ones come out one after another, so I procrastinate.
About Other Channels
- A voice channel was born unexpectedly: [[VoiceMate]].
