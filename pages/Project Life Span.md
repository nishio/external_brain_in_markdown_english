title: "Project Life Span"
---

- Some projects have long [[life span]] and some have short [[life span]].
- Daily life is a mixture of projects of various lengths
- Ratio varies from person to person.
- Isn't the reason people say "having kids changes you" because it gives you the opportunity to have a [[long-term perspective]] as you take on the responsibility of executing a project that spans 20 years with a fair degree of importance?
