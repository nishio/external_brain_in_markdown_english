Combining my research notes and Mr. Nishio's fragment, I summarize as follows

Links help crystallize information, which is necessary to advance the process of reinforcing one's ideas; in the Scrapbox and Wiki systems, links are identified by color, with connected links being blue and unconnected links being red. These links serve as human-readable permalinks.

Links exist in two forms: predictive links and unforeseen missing links. Predictive links are confirmed when a page with that title is bracketed with the expectation that it exists and the link turns blue. An unforeseen missing link, on the other hand, is a situation where a page with that title is marketed with the expectation that it exists, but the link turns red.

In addition, links are weak information, recording information that "seems relevant" in a situation where one's thoughts have not yet crystallized. However, you then need to proceed with the process of having your ideas crystallized and turned into solid information.

In addition, the link affects knowledge production and learning. While students were able to spend much of their time learning, working adults spend much of their time at work and need to make time for their own learning. Therefore, it is important to use links to learn efficiently.

In light of the above, it can be said that links play an important role in the crystallization of information, the production of knowledge, and the efficiency of learning.
