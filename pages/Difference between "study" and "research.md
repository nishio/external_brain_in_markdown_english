title: 'Difference between "study" and "research'

>  Schoolwork is based on the assumption that "all statements in reference books are correct.
>  In other words, if "the book said A", then the problem doesn't arise if we make the decision that A is true.

> [genmeisui](https://x.com/genmeisui/status/1801939191112274292) So when we have information that "this product is patented" or "this inventor is an ambassador of the country", our studious judgment will say "A is true" without any corroboration.

> [genmeisui](https://x.com/genmeisui/status/1801939195113640445) If it is found out later that "it was bogus," the responsibility lies with "the person who created the wrong data" and nothing with "the person in charge who judged the bogus product to be true. The "person in charge who judged the bogus product to be true" will not be held responsible.

> [genmeisui](https://x.com/genmeisui/status/1801939197865160741) This is the same logic as in an exam question, "the question was wrong, so this question is correct for everyone"!
>  It is impossible to say that "it is the examinee's fault for not being able to detect this level of error in the questions.

> [genmeisui](https://x.com/genmeisui/status/1801939200507556238) But "research" doesn't mean you can trust prior studies.
>  Even if "the book says A," other books may advocate a theory of B or C, so we have to endlessly widen the circle of "confirmation" to follow up on A, the cited references of A, the cited papers of A, and so on.

> [genmeisui](https://x.com/genmeisui/status/1801939203317756243) So if the conclusion of a paper that cites "A of prior studies" is wrong, it should be the author who is held responsible for the citation, not the one who was cited!

> [genmeisui](https://x.com/genmeisui/status/1801939207205597556) I think the discrepancy in perception in this area is the reason for the eternal parallel between the scientists' "Why would you adopt such a bogus thing?" and the government's "It was evaluated elsewhere, so we adopted it" are the cause of the eternal parallel line.

> [genmeisui](https://x.com/genmeisui/status/1801939213061120401) For example, just the other day, when a magnetic active water heater came up for discussion in parliament, the ministry's response was.
>
>  "We are not aware of anything other than what is publicly announced by the company, and we are not in a position to reexamine the contents of that information.
>
>  and I was completely in the "study mindset"!
>  This will be a deception all around.

> [genmeisui](https://x.com/genmeisui/status/1801939217582555608) It's fine to be excellent at "[[study]]", but that's only an entry point, so I hope you judge things from a "[[research]]" perspective as well!
