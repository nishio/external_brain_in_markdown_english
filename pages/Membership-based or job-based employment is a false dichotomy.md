title: "Membership-based or job-based employment is a false dichotomy"

- Whether [[membership-based employment]] or [[job-based employment]] is [[False dichotomy]].

I was perplexed when one of my classmates commented, "We need to change from membership-based employment to job-based employment," because I never claimed such a thing.

What employees learn during work hours
- More and more companies are affirming this.
    - [The company provides a "place to learn" during work hours. Housewives with time constraints can now also be active as leaders | How to Work STORY | Recruit Jobs](https://www.recruitjobs.co.jp/voice/voice001104.html)
    - > For example, if there is an engineer who wants to study Rust, he/she can purchase a Rust book even if he/she does not use Rust in his/her assigned work. Technical books that are useful for work can be read during work hours, whether purchased with expenses or for personal use.

What justifies this?
- Under the job-based mental model of "workers provide labor to the company and the company pays for it," it would be strange for the company to pay for "learning" that is not labor.
- Because the company views its employees as "members," the company's investment in their growth is justified.
