>  I think [[groupware]] will be the [[social infrastructure]] of the second half of the 21st century. It's still in the early stages, and it's hard to know or predict which products will be used in the end; I have a feeling that Microsoft is strong, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if others will outpace them.

>  But right now, we are not talking about where to defeat, but rather, we are in a phase where we need to first educate the world about the importance of [[information sharing]].

>  No single company can monopolize a market as vast as social infrastructure. I believe that many different types of groupware will be used in the future. Cybozu would like to be a part of that.
