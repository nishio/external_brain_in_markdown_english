title: "Collecting quotes on Twitter"
---

- I thought it would be a good idea to collect the results of a Twitter search for "[[wise saying]]" to feed the [[chatbot]].
- The actual search.
    - Accounts that Tweet about things that are not good.
    - Accounts that can be used in a clean form as tweeted.
    - Accounts with trash on front and back.
- Need to filter by account and remove debris
- But it seems to make more sense to have a system that puts in books and converts them to data than to use such a garbage-laden input source.
- Even if you wanted to "feed on a multitude of quotes," it would be better to use a book of quotes, because it would have a better format and be easier to handle mechanically.

Relatively well-formatted accounts

I thought there might be a website, and there is.

    - Individual quote pages e.g.: [https://meigennavi.net/word/186/186400.htm](https://meigennavi.net/word/186/186400.htm)
        - Here's a link to 20 random entries.
        - There are key words for each quote.
