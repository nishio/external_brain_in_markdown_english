Q: Who read NAME Enemy
- nishio: taka raises his hand to not read with dignity
- tkgshn: I read half of it: ！！！！！

- [[Reconciliation with tkgshn's criticism of Ken Suzuki]]

> Ken: nishio is the only Japanese working in Plurality.
nishio:
- Not the only one.
- It was easy to get in because akinori was active first.
- That was also the start of a conversation at the Plurality Salon.
tkgshn: [[air current shack]]?
nishio:
- Not [[Plurality Tokyo Salon 2023-10-06]].

- At this time taka was busy talking about calling Glen, so he didn't hear the Plurality book side of the story.

> Ken: Plurality Book
nishio:
- The Japanese version is hot with both Glen and Audrey writing preface.
- Ken's commentary is also very good.
- I can't wait to give it to everyone.

tkgshn:
- Oh, sure. I'm not sure if it's a book, but personally, I'd recommend reading it on Scrapbox while reading everyone's interpretations. I don't feel like reading the text.
nishio:
- taka doesn't even read the lame enemies...()
- A stream of teasing all the way until you read it.
- Scrapbox will continue to be a wai-wai community with no permissions!
    - [/plurality-japanese/read first](https://scrapbox.io/plurality-japanese/read first).
- Nevertheless, there are many cases where it is better to have a book as a foundation

Mountainous:.
- Is this the video?

nishio:
- Mr. Hamada was hitting on me over and over again at the Namekura conference.
- The impetus for creating Plurality in the first place came about when "Vitalik introduced Glen to Audrey."
- I'm in line with Contributor on that Vitalik and Plurality book, which means it's a point of pride for me (see below).

> taka: the event couldn't have gone better, but the gap between reality and
Mountainous:.
- I guess I'm talking about what could have been done next to having an event...
nishio:
- The event couldn't have gone any better, but there's a gap between it and reality."
- We are working on a lot of things, but it's only been six months, so I don't think you're seeing it.
- It's great that it's given people from different genres a chance to connect with each other."
- "There was no place to think about public goods, and it was valuable to be able to go to a place where people from all over the world could come together."
- Ken: "It's not what's changed, it's what you do, because it's not someone else's problem."
Tokiwa Eisuke:
- Change happens exponentially, so it's hard to see at all at first.

    - tall tree


Tokiwa Eisuke:
- Are there a lot of Funding type activities related to digital democracy and plurality?
nishio:
- It's not like there's a lot of Funding.
- This diagram is easy to understand.
- > "Vitalik introduced Glen to Audrey," which led to the creation of Plurality in the first place.
    - Vitalik and Glen created Quadratic Funding in, so it is often mentioned, that

nishio:
- CN isn't so much great for its algorithm as it is for the fact that it was introduced to Twitter."
- Well, platformers are strong, that's true.

> taka: Gitcoin
nishio: "Spread the money around and people will come" www.

> Public Opinion Map
nishio:
- The poll map was released as one of the new features of JAPAN CHOICE, an election information website run by NPO Mielka, during the House of Representatives Election 2024.
    - [https://note.com/mielka/n/n54313c84a5e5](https://note.com/mielka/n/n54313c84a5e5)

Q: Wouldn't you prefer a more local theme, like the actual problems of the residents?
- nishio:
    - There seems to be a variation in whether people participate in "local government administration" or "national legislation".
- Mountainous:.
    - I would like to lower the cost of facilitation.
- A: It seems useful to improve on the deliberations that already exist.

Q: You mentioned fishermen earlier, but maybe digital democracy is too vague and broad (I failed to catch the second half).
A: Concept Japan
- [/tkgshn/ Conceptual Japan](https://scrapbox.io/tkgshn/ Conceptual Japan).
- nishio: these things are easy to PMF because there's already a market for them and they make it better.

Kobayu:.
- I want to stop calling it democracy because every time I use the term "digital democracy" I get into trouble.
- nishio: "digital totalitarianism" (no
- Kobayu: Digital anarchism (too hacker-ish)

nishio:
A: Voting isn't the only way to show your opinion.

Q: Age difference
A: Leave non-digital items behind.
A: Multiple channels are important.

akinori:
- (I envy the locals...)
- I'm wondering if civic portal, democracyNext, and others have a reference framework or taxonomy for discussions.

- west end

Kobayu: good and bad parts are not in a democracy but in a democracy

Tokiwa Eisuke:
- I would like to experience it in a QV workshop, or rather in a game,
- akinori: It would be interesting to have a QV like "which talk would you like to hear additionally?
- Tokiwa Eisuke: ＋🦀
    - It may be cruel, but lol.

Tokiwa Eisuke:
- I did a workshop on bank credit creation once, and it created a huge gap.
- akinori:
    - We may need to be given context and expertise before we vote.
    - If we can vote based on why inequality is a problem, or something like that, it might tilt it a bit... (Am I being naive...)


nuun:
- [https://quadraticvoting.jp/](https://quadraticvoting.jp/)
- QV=quadratic voting

Tokiwa Eisuke:
- Like an intervention experiment in an ultimatum game.
- Oh, this is properly 3x speed.

Mountainous:.
- Broad Listening!
- [How to use Talk to the City in the Tokyo Gubernatorial Election 2024｜NISHIO Hirokazu](https://note.com/nishiohirokazu/n/n0661204bda5b)

tkgshn:
- Even if you send this to Zoey, Nishio-san talks too fast to use machine translation.
- I don't think that's possible.

tkgshn:
- I'm pushing time at 3x speed.
- I'd appreciate it if a rapper could mix this up.
- Certainly there will be a re-engineering of the voting concept.

akinori:
- (I wanted to participate in the LT ...)
- I don't see any tweets complaining about the #2050Tokyo strategy, which also referred to the #ShinTokyo2050 opinion, but it would be interesting to see what actions people who expressed an opinion took after posting. We would like to provide a list of results that will trigger people to take subsequent actions, both for posts that were vague or only conveyed dissatisfaction, and for posts that were somewhat specific.
- I wanted to talk to you to see if you have any friends.
- There are about 245 posts that do not seem to fall under the main proposal of the #2050Tokyo Strategy, and that do not seem to be reflected in 03 Education from "Education Reform and Child Support". (I can't tally them well because I can only use weak LLMs.)
- I was wondering if anyone is interested in this area.
- Talk to the City, the part after the while
- T3C stands out in its ability to distill large-scale public input << while preserving the diversity of views represented.>>

tkgshn:
- I'm using the word "digital democracy" because it's catchy, but I'm talking about thinking about it properly.
- With Mr. Yasuno's intro being done by Mr. Nishio.
- I think I can ask Yasuno-san a lot of questions based on this.
- Not so much Mr. Anno's, but rather what position future politicians should take.

Mountainous:.

- [[unconference]] I love it!

- Introduction to [Digital Democracy 2030
- cheap field

Tokiwa Eisuke:
- I'm sure he's thinking about it, and it's his priority, and I'm like, "You're doing a great job in spite of all the hard work.

nishio:
- Taking TTTC to the next level.

Mountainous:.
- Maybe it's not political funding, but I remember a project like this.
    - [https://judgit.net/](https://judgit.net/)
- tkgshn: It's the one that [[Concept Japan]] is doing, which I mentioned slightly earlier!

nishio:
- Interesting timing 2025 with so much attention from politics.

hiragi_shima:.
- I think consensus-building can be roughly broken down into two elements: "deciding" and "agreeing to the decision.
- nishio:
    - Just deciding is out of the question, as it can be done at low cost by lottery, or gathering ideas before making a convincing or choice.

> Shin Tokyo 2050, unlike previous pubic comments, more opinions from 10~30s
- nishio:
    - It wasn't just 10~30s, it was a balanced spread (I would add that there may be some misunderstanding.

nishio:
- I found an agenda that I had overlooked." (I had overlooked youth support. Hey!)
- The fact that "youth support" has become a "education" that we thought we could do.
- This was made possible by gathering information from the parties and increasing resolution.
- Deep Cluster Extraction" algorithm was created for the Tokyo project.
- Specific needs of the Metropolis

nishio:
- It would be nice to have an opening to share from each SNS with the Share button > Integration with various SNS

tkgshn:
- Yasuno is too strong and I want to know how to beat Yasuno.
- nishio: run for office first
- tkgshn: are you getting it just from Yasuno's sales? I might want to clarify that. but what about Yasuno-san's forking?
- tkgshn: is it a runoff Moat?
    - NISHIO: Running for office and gaining name recognition is a resource.
    - tkgshn: on the other hand, there are still places worth exploring where you can't go by name recognition (not dropping from the top)

- Tokiwa Eisuke: why don't we simply consider the problems that cannot be solved by TTTC?
    - nishio: there are attacks like mobilizing on social networking sites and writing copy-and-paste pubic comments
        - tkgshn: I'm not sure if your "how to beat Yasuno" is...
        - nishio: this should be manageable with LLM
        - Tokiwa Eisuke: I feel like this area could be reduced from intensive access and such.
- Tokiwa Eisuke:
    - Someday Mr. Anno is going to be called a conspiracy theory > how to beat him.

- Kobayu: Strengthening the non-existing power
    - tkgshn: Team Kobayu
    - Kobayu: In my case, university (student)

nishio: I think [[the discussion needs to be in front of deciding the voting options]].

Yamanoku: GitHub was awesome!

akinori:
- I am concerned that the #2050Tokyo strategy is quiet.
- (In terms of the future, I think you are promoting a framework that will help deliberate in detail, but won't it arouse complaints like, "I thought you were supposed to listen to my opinions.")

nishio:
- Devin will update GitHub so humans can just talk to each other, that review is more of a problem.

nishio:
- Whoa, to what extent can we publish this?
- akinori: sounds fun...
- nishio: I think it's okay for people to come here, but I'll have to check with the office later to see if it's okay to write about it on social networking sites, or if it's okay to post it on YouTube, etc.

Tokiwa Eisuke:
- Oh, you mean genus.
nishio:
- I understand now w
- Audrey was so charismatic that when she left, the place was deserted.
Tokiwa Eisuke:
- But someone's got to do it someday... I mean, that's what happened with Iiri.
nishio:
- Why don't we make an AI an so that everyone can use it?
- Kobayu: I'll get stronger!
Mountainous:.
- It's going to take a follower like a naked dancing man to plow through.
nishio:
- Yasuno's acquired recognition is a resource, so it's important to first utilize it and run with it rather than reduce the genus, good story.

nishio
- Q: I can't hear you.
- A: Remove spam, slander, and duplication
- A: Don't interpret this as truth because of the number
    - (This story goes along with my "it's not majority rule.")
- A: Find useful signals and verify them in other channels
- A: Limit one person at a time with my number.
- A: Improvement by devising prompts

Tokiwa Eisuke:
- TTTC would be better used to strengthen the Democratic Party of the United States.
- akinori
    - The U.S. ... We'll need to do this area and others...
    - ( [https://x.com/emollick/status/1892202893165425071](https://x.com/emollick/status/1892202893165425071) )
    - Rather, I would be happy if we could also do something around Project Liberty / Free our feeds, which adjusts the browsing of social networking sites first.

nishio:
- OpenAI's Deep Research and X's Grok 3 both produce good quality reports.

> Anti-AI
nishio:
- In the first place, both the pictures and the text are legally learnable under copyright law.
Kobayu:.
- I thought anti-AI was a concern about authoritarian AI, but I was wrong.
nishio:
- Anti-AI, too, if they are concerned about authoritarian AI, or if they simply don't understand the law.

5. ​LT

nishio: I'd like to compile a list of names and titles of the LT people later though!
- (I'm not sure who spoke what because I don't have the data in advance.)

--- The God Protocol
Mountainous:.
- [https://nakamotoinstitute.org/library/the-god-protocols/](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/library/the-god-protocols/)

nishio:
- Is this a hypothetical concept rather than an implementation?
- The argument is, "If we can do this, we can do this."
- What Ethereum lacks is PRIVACY."
- It sounds like a good idea to improve Ethereum or apply for Gitcoin Grants.

--- Mr. Dohi
nishio:
- It takes 7~8 years to diagnose a rare disease if it has rare symptoms.
- Oooh, distribution of symptoms.
- Gathering the Narratives of the Parties
- interesting

Mami Sato: Mami Sato

    - Narrating Health and Illness

nishio:
- I'm sure TTTC should actually be able to do this for video, but I don't have good data to try.

akinori:
- [[Heal Michigan]] also displays a video, which conveys the feeling quite well.

Eisuke Dohi:
- Thank you 😸.
- I thought it would be fun (and also altruistic) to increase the sense of "can-do" of the people involved and those close to them, from collecting the narratives of the people involved.
- I have been thinking since I was a medical professional that we need to always keep in mind the people who are involved in the process. Through this experience, I had the opportunity to encounter the phrase, "Someone else's story leads to someone else's new story," and it was very clear to me.
- I would also like to thank you for your kind attention 😸.

Mountainous:.
- [https://www.instagram.com/millennium.nendo/](https://www.instagram.com/millennium.nendo/) I think this is it.

Kobayu:.
- Socialism.

--- bushio?
nishio:
- Predictive Markets.
- "It's not gambling." It's gambling, isn't it?
- What is the definition of gambling...
- Three billion yen traded per day.
- Forecasting market becomes a media for disaster, interesting.
- So there can be an economic incentive to get the right information out quickly?

nishio:
- [[Hexaco]]
- Ethics gets in the way of satisfying curiosity! School of thought （ （ ）
- [The dark triad.
- I guess I need to break it down and look at it in detail, instead of taking "evil" as a vague lump of something.

Tokiwa Eisuke

- Kobayu: Alcorn just now
- nishio: easily implementable algorithm that is not majority rule Foreshadowing recovered w

tkgshn: I remember when Concept Japan was doing random sampling at [[personalization meetings]].
nishio:
- Personally, I wonder if it is necessary to use a classic algorithm such as lottery at a time when new algorithms are now becoming feasible with LLM.
- Ah, the incentive to have a good discussion is created.
- Party lines, reducing diversity of opinion, is a problem.
- Interesting.

Kobayu:.
- The U.S., which was a lotocracy, "the lottery was manipulated."

--- 2nd party
nishio:
    - [[Plurality was coined as a colorless neologism]]
- An algorithm called "swap inside rows" was proposed for the "drinking seat swapping problem."
    - The problem in this case is that the side-by-side people don't change w
    - Kobayu: that it can only be used one more time


yukihoz:
- Thank you very much for your time today, ladies and gentlemen. My name is [[Yuki Hozumi]], and this is my first time participating in this meeting. I am a ward assembly member in Chuo-ku, Tokyo.
- This time, at the after-party table, we were told that in order to realize digital democracy, we must start from the feet up, so "Let's all run for municipal councilors!" I was asked to speak on the topic "Let's all run for municipal councilors!
- Many people think, "I can't run for office because I have to make speeches and stuff... However, I was able to win the election by trying various unusual election methods, such as making no speeches or using a campaign car.
- I am sharing this article because I do not like to be so forward myself, but I thought it might have some affinity with many of the engineers who participated in this event. If you are interested, please feel free to contact me!
