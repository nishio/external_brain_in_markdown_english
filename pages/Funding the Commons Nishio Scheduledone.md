>  @nishio
>  Quickly attended only Mr.'s session. The atmosphere of the two venues and the Coworking space was all over the place - it was a lot of fun! Thank you very much #FtCTokyo (T-shirts were not for sale)

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1816127490747949288) "The people who gathered under the name of Funding the Commons were not all originally from that community, but from Plurality, local development, web3, and so on. Plurality's worldview that the world is made up of intersecting groups" "Plurality is here now, literally here and now" #FtCTokyo


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1816111381260988435) mmmmmm
>  hmmm
> [blu3mo](https://x.com/blu3mo/status/1816114970624758094) I'm really confused about that, I'll probably go with Kanai-san.


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1816130193565896793) I know it's too late to say this, but in the main session, I didn't have to go through the mysterious effort of "making all the English scripts and then synthesizing the voices and memorizing everything by sound" to have simultaneous interpretation. I also told Yasuno-san today that there is no simultaneous interpretation in the workshop space.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1816134684163842136) Well, I'm saying this, but if you open the lid, you can have a normal conversation, because people who really can't speak English don't make video conference appointments with people they've never met before.

> [homata](https://x.com/homata/status/1815950000805093405) If social systems or laws are an obstacle to your new idea, you can consult the regulatory sandbox system of the Cabinet Secretariat. You can consult the possibility of doing this from the demonstration level.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1815946744548790618) Regulatory sandbox system, created in 2018. Regulators can't reform regulations without data, operators can't experiment and get data if there are regulations. Sandboxes allow us to "try first" and "formulate policy through demonstration and dialogue with the market" #FtCTokyo

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1815943777712050629) A future where algorithms are searched and used by AI will come, then returns should be made to those who publish good algorithms to the marketplace, researchers have DID, Researchers should have DID, issue VC when uploading, and mediate the value of use with tokens #FtCTokyo

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1815916358242296038) #FtCTokyo I was at Funding the Commons, my first time at the United Nations University. Simultaneous interpretation was available. I'm not good at inputting information through my ears, so I can't really pay attention in situations where I can hear both Japanese and English...

Will there be some sort of launch afterwards?
→Salon space in Harajuku?

I went to a place where there was some kind of loud music playing, but I felt like it was impeding my conversation even in Japanese, so I quickly left.
