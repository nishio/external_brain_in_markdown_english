Using an online platform
- Diverse perspectives and
- Gathering Feedback
- Clarify the rules of human-AI interaction.
    - How AI participates in human-driven chats
        - Balancing Structure and Chaos
        - Aiming to balance time and topics
        - Multi-dimensional characteristics that change according to user intent
    - Facilitate discussion using techniques such as the KJ method and
        - It could lead to new ideas.
    - AI "converges" human arguments and thought processes
        - Role of convergence
            - How it can be optimized
        - Visualize the process of convergence
        - Deepen your understanding of the issue
    - In this context, the term[[rule]] „Äç„ÅØ„ÄÅ[[Á∏õ„Çã„É´„Éº„É´]]„Åß„ÅØ„Å™„Åè„ÄÅ[[„Ç≤„Éº„É†„ÅÆ„É´„Éº„É´]]„Å†„Å≠<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - For example, in [[Keichobot, a chatbot that brings out your ideas]], the chatbot played the [[role]] of "not giving your opinion, just asking questions
        - It allowed the human user to internalize the chatbot's behavior and communicate better
            - I mean in the sense that you don't expect them to be able to do what you can't do.

        - The tool is called Kozaneba.
            - Fragmentation of information and
            - Relate information from multiple perspectives
            - Create new structures
            - Better organizing and interpreting information
            - Contribute to the creation of meaning
        - It has the potential to deepen human-AI interaction and facilitate knowledge creation.
        - Now Kozaneba has no personality.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - Maybe we can give Kozaneba a personality.
            - [[Symbolic modeling as a board game]].
                - This is an idea that brings the Keichobot side closer to a board game-like "objective and visualized progress toward it.
                - On the other hand, Kozaneba is a visualization, so maybe both sides should step up to the plate.
            - Currently Kozaneba does not have a time line.

- Spaced Repetition
    - Learning Methods
    - Organize information using a time-based approach.

### Digest

Explore the role of AI in "converging" human arguments and thought processes, and visualize the process to deepen understanding of the issues. Use online platforms to gather diverse perspectives and feedback to clarify the rules of human-AI dialogue. Consider how AI participates in human-led chats and maintain a balance between structure and chaos in the process; relate information from multiple perspectives using the Spaced Repetition learning method and organize information using a time-based approach; organize information using the Kozaneba tool to create new structures; and organize information using the Kozaneba tool to create new structures. fragmentation to create new structures. It aims to achieve compatibility between time and topic, and has multidimensional characteristics that change according to the user's intentions.

### New Thought in Japanese

Clarifying the rules of AI-human interaction may facilitate discussion and generate new ideas using methods such as the KJ method. In addition, fragmenting information and creating new structures using tools such as Kozaneba can deepen the organization and interpretation of information and contribute to the creation of meaning. These considerations have the potential to deepen human-AI interactions and facilitate knowledge creation.

Emerging questions include how AI can optimize its role in "converging" human discussions and thought processes, and how the rules of human-AI interaction should be set. Answering these questions will help make AI-human interaction more meaningful.
