What is the "[[quus arithmetic]]" (quus) in [[kripki]]?
_
| Term Definition |
| -- |
| x ⊕ y (quads) if x, y less than 57 → x + y<br> otherwise → 5 |

1. background
- In "Wittgenstein's Language Game" (1982), Saul Kripke brought up the fictitious operation ⊕ (quus) to ask "what is meaning?" and "what is following rules?"
- It looks like addition, but by including a preliminarily limited condition (bordering on 57), it makes it impossible to distinguish whether one was really adding or following the rules of quasi-arithmetic.

2. rule-following skepticism
1. we have calculated in the past that "68 + 57 = 125".
2. but could also be interpreted as "in fact, "+" in the past meant ⊕" (it is always 5 if it exceeds 57)
→ Which is correct cannot be determined from a finite record of actions.
- This is the skepticism of "indeterminacy of meaning" = any behavior can be consistent with multiple rules.

Kripke's Conclusion (Skeptical Solution)
- Internal "understanding" and "intention" are not enough to fix rules.
- Instead, "community custom" (community consent) becomes the criterion for deeming a given usage "correct.
    - If everyone in a society normally adds up to 57 or more, the "+" would function as an addition.
    - If ⊕ is adopted by the culture, "+" should be interpreted as such.
- Thus, "having meaning" is nothing more than following norms supported by communal practices.

4. point organization
- Kwas arithmetic is a thought experiment: create an operation that is "almost identical" to addition but differs in one respect, showing that the identification of rules can be arbitrary.
- Finite data problem: It is impossible to uniquely determine the "correct rule" based on a finite number of examples.
- Wittgensteinian reading: meaning does not reside in the mind of the individual, but in public activity.
    - Kripki calls this a "skeptical solution."

5. impact
- Developed into a discussion on the sociality (externalism) of the contents of the mind.
- This is similar to the question of "which rules can be said to have been learned from training data" in AI and machine learning.

> *In short**.
>  The quasi-arithmetic is a trick to expose the conundrum: "When you say '+', is there any evidence that you really mean 'addition'?" Kripke concluded from this that "meaning is rooted in communal practices, not in the inner life of the individual.
