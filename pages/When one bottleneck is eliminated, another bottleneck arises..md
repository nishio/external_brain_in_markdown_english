When the flow rate cannot be obtained because of a certain [[bottleneck]] B is too thin, making B thicker will increase the flow rate up to a certain point.
- At some point, however, making B thicker becomes ineffective.
- B is no longer the bottleneck, because other parts of the system have become bottlenecks.
- Overextended B gets to play.
- The process of making the bottleneck thicker will always lead to a situation where it makes no sense to make it any thicker.
    - If we repeat the same actions as in the past by following past successes and precedents without considering the implications of past actions, the costs incurred will be wasted.
