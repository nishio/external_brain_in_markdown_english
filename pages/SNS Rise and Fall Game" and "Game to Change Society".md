title: 'SNS Rise and Fall Game" and "Game to Change Society"'

> [fladdict](https://x.com/fladdict/status/1835510887647723976) I get the sense that many people don't distinguish between the rules of "[[the game of social networking success]]" and "[[the game of changing society]]".
>  The "social networking game" can be played by "tweeting dopamine into the brains of your peers" and still get a high score, but I think the core of the "game of changing society" is "how well you get along with people who are different from you in position or ideology".

> [fladdict](https://x.com/fladdict/status/1835516336564531455) Basically, "words and deeds that stick only to the group you belong to" limits you to being the face of the group. The basic rule is to increase "[[words and deeds that can be shared with outside the group]]". On the other hand, it is important to keep your distance from players of the same faction who specialize in "behaviors that stick only to your own group".
>  In society, the population ratio is basically "faction < the rest of society", so I recommend [[leaning with the outside of the community]] to move society.

The context is probably this: [Journalist on TBS Sanmoni calls LDP supporters "inferior race," Rikumin, Yoneyama "discriminatory" - Sankei News](https://www.sankei.com/article/20240917-EQ4JQNU7CRBQNO67YXH4RW25TQ/)

[[leaning in with the outside of the community]] is the opposite of [[staying inside]], it's kind of [[smoothing (e.g., numbers)]] kind of thing.
