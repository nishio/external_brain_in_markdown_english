title: "Deleted Japanese directory in git."
---

- I turned it off locally, but I was jittery because I couldn't staging it without it being staged.
- `$ git checkout .`
    - First, I put it back in a clean state.
- `$ git rm -r "Japanese file name"`
    - After making a selection using zsh's choice completion, the directory name is enclosed in quotation marks
- Now it's safely erased.
