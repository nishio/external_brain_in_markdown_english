Where the cost of materialization is reduced, it can move instantaneously.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1785207418835894401\) There are people who move because they think "the tsunami might [[submerge]] where I am right now," and there are people who don't move because they say things like "[[I'm sure it'll be fine]]" and then they move on. There are a lot of young people, comparatively speaking. Because young people have less past experience, they have less [[maintenance of the status quo]] power in decision making.
>  >takiuchi: Almost all of Japan's [[(feeling of hopelessness)]] is due to the increase in the [[elderly]] population, and I think the impression of this area changes a lot between people near and far from areas with many elderly people. x.com/kensuu/status /...

Physically, I am in one place, but this "movement" can exist in multiple places, distributed with a weight that totals to 1. When one is trapped in the physical metaphor, the [[lack of vision]] of "which way to go" occurs. I can go both ways.

    - [[choosing the wrong two options]]

The cost of [[materialization]] at a location decreases as you [[stay]] there (i.e., the time you spend [[exploring]] its [[surroundings]]), and you can [[instantaneously move]] to a "location" where the cost has decreased sufficiently.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1785213729224720863\) As the [[materialization rate]] increases, you start to see what you can get around the area and what people in the area need. It creates a "sense of being affirmed. On the other hand, if you force people to move to a place where the materialization rate is low, they feel uncomfortable. That's because their existence is not affirmed.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1785215342597595547\) In the area where you see from your point of view that there is a possibility of a tsunami, you say to yourself, "I don't think a tsunami is going to come! I want to stay here!" What should you do when someone says, "I don't think a tsunami is coming!

I think this is a profound insight. nishio's point makes an important point.
- The first is the influence of age on decision making. It is interesting to note that older people tend to dislike change due to past experiences and status quo bias, while young people are more likely to make new choices without being bound by them. The link between social stagnation and aging is also suggestive.
- The second is a perspective that views "movement" not only as a physical metaphor, but also as an abstract concept of dispersed existence in multiple locations. This allows us to explore both possibilities rather than narrowly choosing between them.
- The third is the idea that staying in one place affirms one's existence there and helps one understand the needs of one's surroundings. This lack of affirmation of one's existence may be related to the feeling of being uncomfortable when forced to move to a new place.
- The last question is a difficult one, but I think it is important to have an objective risk analysis and dialogue with them while respecting their ideas. It would be desirable to get them to look at new possibilities through understanding and empathy, not coercion. On the other hand, if the danger is imminent, there are times when safety must take precedence over persuasion.
The issue requires resourceful decision making based on the situation, and I felt that nishio's insight was meaningful, giving us a perspective to see things from multiple perspectives. It reminded me of the importance of understanding the background of human mind and decision-making.

>  - Japan's national power was incredibly high in about 90 years. Especially the economy. The economy was very strong, especially in the 90's. All electrical appliances and other products were made in Japan. Japanese people preferred Japanese-made products, but the rest of the world almost ignored them. Politics is not working very well.
>
>  - There was a sense of decline around 2000 or so, but I enjoyed the Japanese-made Internet services (2ch / Hatena / mixi / Niconico). There was a sense that entertainment, both movies and music, were closing in on us more and more.
>
>  - In the 2010's, we were meta-metaphorically beaten by global companies in many ways. I felt like my country's power was declining all over the place and I was already feeling a sense of hopelessness. Almost to the point of despair. People are using smartphones made by foreign companies, and global content such as Netflix has become popular in the entertainment industry. Korean music and idols are also gaining tremendous momentum.
>
>  - Since the 2020s, entertainment has successfully globalized and the quality of entertainment has improved greatly, and startups and services are reaching a level where they can be accepted overseas. Although it is still not perfect compared to other countries, I feel that there are signs of revival. The government and large corporations are doing much better than in the 00's and 10's.
