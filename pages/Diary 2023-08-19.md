LLM camp continues
I had an early dinner at about 6pm and was supposed to have work time until 9pm, but I couldn't get my head around it at all.
- I even have a blueprint of the code, but I can't write it at all.

Returned to the hotel room around 9:00 p.m., but didn't have the energy to go to the bath and sleep for a while.
Woke up around 24:00.

It's a bit sad to read this story. When I read this story, I feel a little sad. I feel sorry that I can't write any code because my head is spinning even though I ate early. It's also sad that I don't have the energy to go to the bathroom and just go to bed. But even if I don't go to the bath, I might be able to have a great adventure in my dreams, so I might actually become a secret hero. I'm a daredevil adventurer! (GPT4)

By using LLM, you can get sloppy comments on everything!

[[AI writing reading notes]].

- So far there has been human interaction only after B
- But then I realized that after C might be more appropriate.


- [[A case study of a new combination with the assistance of AI]]
- People who do the thinking process only in their minds cannot observe it.
- It's hard to verbalize what we can't observe.
- At some point in my life I encountered the KJ method, which allowed me to observe certain parts of my thoughts.
- But it turned out to be only one step.
- I didn't observe the part of the thinking that goes on in the brain during that process of "me doing the KJ method."
- So, while I used the [[KJ method]] and the further developed [[Kozaneba]], I could not verbalize how to use them in a way that would be beneficial.
- This time, the AI output did not go through "[[the process of chopping sentences into fragments]]," but a KJ-method grouping-like phenomenon occurred, so the observation proceeded.
    - When I do KJ method or Kozaneba, I do the "process of chopping sentences into fragments" before these three steps, so I was not able to compare them like this

I have a feeling we're getting closer to an answer.
- This is a true example of [Polanyi's tacit knowledge
- Even if you don't know the right answer to arrive at, you can get closer to the right answer if you have a sense of whether or not you are approaching the right answer

- A question-answer cycle might be beneficial.
- I was going to try this with AI Qualia.
