title: "Ideas that can change the world."
---

- A: I naively believe that we can change the world.
- B: "You can't change the world," an idea like "It's a delusion that people around middle school age tend to have" [[Chuunibyouji and Kouunibyouji]].
- C: Gain experience that your actions have actually changed a part of the world.
    - This begins to distinguish "[[world]]" not as one vague thing, but as "the world of [[the extent to which you can change yourself]]" and "the rest of the world.
- D: Begin to think that you can expand the "scope of what you can change"

- B2: Not doing [[Actions to change]] because they are stuck on the idea of B
        - [[action]], so it doesn't change.
    - Keeps us stuck in result B.

- C': Actions were taken to change, but results were not promising
    - I still think that there is no way to change things.
        - [[learned helplessness]]
    - Falling to B
