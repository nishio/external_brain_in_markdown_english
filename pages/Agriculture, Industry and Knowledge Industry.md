> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1639528607512166403) Can a medium-sized language speaker survive if the size of the same language speaker causes positive feedback on productivity? I'm starting to lose track.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1639529428563931137) I'm beginning to suspect that people who want to feel secure saying things like "machine translation will advance, so we'll be fine" are just fooling themselves to reassure themselves. It's getting there.

    - People were the bottleneck for productivity in [[agriculture]], and there was no significant difference in productivity.
    - The means to increase productivity was for the masses to do as they were told.
            - [[Brownian tissue]]
    - In the [[(manufacturing) industry]] era, the main body of production changed to mechanical equipment.
    - The cheap availability of human beings with the intelligence to operate machines became a source of international competitiveness.
            - [[equipment industry]]
    - Why can I use it cheaply, because moving to another country was prevented, both in a physical and linguistic sense.
    - The [[the knowledge industry]] has long been a [[household handicraft industry]] of individual craftsmen.
    - Then a "device" called GPT4 appeared.
    - The larger the size of the language speakers, the more productive this device is in that language.
            - [[Language Dynamics]]
