- tokoroten >I feel much differently about this, it is still Winner take all ([[WTA]]), and becoming a Winner involves luck, so you can get on stage when your utility is satiated, and from there on out you become a Winner by luck. It is like having many sachi axes, the combination of sachi axes will be evaluated by luck.
    - The model of luck after utility is satiated is seen in Oikonomia's "Economics: Is Life Luck or Effort?" in Oikonomia.
    - The bottom line is probably "Successful people make [[(by) chance]] their ally."
        - [Why do successful people make luck their friend? Economics Reveals the Importance of Luck](https://www.buzzfeed.com/jp/satoruishido/2017-0820?utm_term=.leNyApZ40#.choYeE0yL)
        - see  [[Successful people make chance their friend.]]

    - However, this graph is ambiguous in that the vertical axis is utility
    - I think there is an [[S-shape]] relationship between time invested and skills, with requirements such as WTA and cross-fertilization to price knowledge workers in the market.
