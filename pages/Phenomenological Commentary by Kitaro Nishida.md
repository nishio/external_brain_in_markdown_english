- Position."
    - Einstellung
    - When people see things, they see things from some position.
        - Physicists from the standpoint of physics, artists from the standpoint of art.
    - Phenomenology wants to get rid of this position.
        - ausschalten Elimination
        - reines Bewusstein Pure Consciousness
        - Schauen what appears as it appears
        - What we see then is the essence of the Wesen phenomenon
- Husserl's argument
    - Consciousness is always oriented
    - Oriented to a given object by intuition.
    - The truth is that its orientation action is enhanced
- fertile, productive field
    - He's a bit of a copyist, but you could say he's the one who revived the theory of clear evidence.
    - [[Heidegger]], who wrote [[Sein und Zeit]], was his pupil

- [[copy theory]]
- When an object is oriented toward some object, the meaning may or may not coincide with the oriented object, and when it does, it is "true".
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>For example, if we compare it to drawing a picture by copying a real-life chicken, a picture in which four legs are drawn by mistake is "false" because it does not match reality
        - I think "true or false" is a false dichotomy, and in reality it's a gradient with "degrees of successful replication."
    - Nishida points out that "the idea of the mimetic theory that truth is the unity of thought and the reality of the external world cannot determine the truth of thought without a correct knowledge of the reality of the external world."
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>True or false" is a false dichotomy, and since no one knows the reality of the external world correctly, we must implement it in society and observe whether it behaves as we expect it to.
                - [It comes down to [Ideas without implementation are no longer needed.
            - Personally, I share this idea, this is the idea of [pragmatism

- [[corroborative explanation]]
- Chanted by Descartes and passed down to Spinoza and Leibniz
- Forgotten for a while by Kant's criticalism.
- Revived by Husserl's phenomenology
- Truth is something that "compels us to think so".
    - [[Empirical knowledge gained from the senses is confused and unclear knowledge]].
- Cannot explain accidental truths without "logical necessity that it must be so" such as historical facts.
    - Leibniz distinguished between "[[The Truth of Reason]]" (truth of reason) and "[[Truth of the Facts]]" (truth of facts) for this discussion
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>At that time in the 17th century, the Christian mindset was still strong, and they would say, "There is no such thing as coincidence, and God's will has made the choice. Therefore, it is the will of choice that underlies the truth of fact.
        - About 100 years later, Kant started talking about [[Minor status]] and [[Critique of Pure Reason (Kritik der reinen Vernunft) (Kant)]].
