title: "Excellence resides in quality, not quantity"
---

The first half is "[Play on quality, not quantity.
- [[Quantity does not transcend mediocrity.]] 。
The second half, "[[The misery of trying to fit in everywhere and not fitting in anywhere...]]" is from a slightly different angle. The misery of trying to fit in everywhere and not fitting in anywhere." is a slightly different perspective: trying to increase the number of people who will accept you will lead to the misfortune of not being accepted by anyone, so instead of trying to increase your acquaintances, befriend a few. It is similar to "Stop [[a flunky]]" or "[Pleasing the masses is evil.

from [[The Art of Worldly Wisdom]]
Excellence resides in quality, not quantity
xxvii
Praise strength over breadth.

Excellence resides in quality, not quantity. The best are always few and scarce; the more, the less valuable. It is often the case that even the giants among men are really dwarfs. Some people value books by their thickness, as if they were written to test brawn rather than brains. Breadth alone does not transcend mediocrity. The misfortune of universal genius is that it tries too hard to fit in everywhere. Intensity brings height and elevates one to heroic heights in sublime matters.
