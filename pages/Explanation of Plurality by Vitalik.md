title: "Explanation of Plurality by Vitalik"
---

[[Vitalik Buterin]], in "[[Plurality philosophy in an incredibly oversized nutshell]]" (2024-08-21), explains plurality in one sentence and then breaks it down into four sections

How would I define Plurality in one sentence?
> How would you define plurality in one sentence?
> In his 2022 essay "Why I Am A Pluralist," Glenn Weil defines pluralism most succinctly as
- > I understand Plurality to be a social philosophy that recognizes and promotes the flourishing and cooperation of diverse socio-cultural groups/systems.

> If I had to expand it a bit and define the "plurality" of this book in four bullet points, I would say
- > [[Glen's Megapolitics]] is the idea that today's world is stuck in a narrow corridor between conflict and centralization and needs a new, upgraded, high-performance form of [[digital democracy]] to replace both.
- > [[Plurality as Vibe]]: the general theme is that (i) we should understand the world through a patchwork combination of models [[and not try to stretch any single model beyond its natural applicability]] and (ii) we should really take the connections between individuals seriously and work to expand and that we should work to strengthen them.
- > [[Plurality-inspired mechanism design]]: there is a set of principled mathematical methods that can design social, political, and economic mechanisms that treat not only individuals [[but also]] connections among individuals as first-class objects. This can create new forms of markets and democracies that solve problems common to markets and democracies today, especially those surrounding bridging tribal divisions and polarization.
- > [[Audrey's work experience in Taiwan]]: Audrey has already incorporated many ideas along the lines of pluralism while serving as Digital Minister in Taiwan, and this is a starting point from which we can learn and build.

The following "What are the megapolitics of Plurality?" ### What are the megapolitics of Plurality?
 section summarizes Glen's megapolitics in Vitalik's words
- > Digital Democracy/Purality: Using Internet-enabled technologies, create much [[higher bandwidth]] democratic mechanisms that can aggregate preferences from very broad groups of people, and use these mechanisms to create a much more powerful and effective "[[third sector]]" or "[[civil society]]" and can make much better decisions.
