title: "Fact-checking with AI"
---

All I have to do is show the Japanese tweet text and say "[[fact-checking]] shite" and GPT4 will search in English, read four sites, and tell me that this is based on facts, showing me the sources. I, as a human, can do the same thing if I take my time, but AI allows me to do it many times faster.
- Some people say "AI halucinates," but humans are uncertain too. Until now, the cost of verification has been high when written without showing sources, but human "verification" can also be accelerated by LLM

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The following tweet was found. Is this true? Fact check this.
>  In 1919, when the League of Nations was established, Japan proposed that the text "no racial discrimination" be included. It was the first time that an international conference called for the elimination of racial discrimination. Despite the majority in favor of the proposal, it was rejected due to opposition from the presidency of the United States and the United Kingdom. --- [@llloss7](https://x.com/llloss7/status/1789832437184237967?s=46&t=gkSZtjGEtUZPO0JCzBxCBw)

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>As for the content of the tweet, it is largely factual: at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, Japan proposed the abolition of racial discrimination in establishing the League of Nations.

Although the proposal received a large majority of the votes cast (11 out of 17 in favor), it was ultimately not accepted because President Wilson, who was the chairman, declared that unanimity was needed on this important issue. The main opposing countries were the United States and the United Kingdom, which were concerned about the implications for immigration and racial policies. In particular, it is believed that the British opposed it due to pressure from Australia.

The rejection of this proposal affected subsequent international relations and was one of the factors influencing Japan's diplomatic and military policies with Western nations.

    - > The [[Proposal for the Elimination of Racial Equality]] (Hepburnian: Racial Discrimination Proposal) was an amendment to the [[Treaty of Versailles]] that was considered at the [[Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919. The Japanese proposal was not intended to have universal implications, but it was accompanied and controversial anyway. In June 1919, Japanese Foreign Minister [[Uchida Hironishi]] stated that the proposal was not intended to demand [[racial equality]] for all [[colored]] people, but only for members of the League of Nations.... The proposal was widely supported but did not become part of the treaty, mainly due to opposition from the autonomous territories of the United States and the British Empire delegation, namely Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.

    - > One of the most memorable of Japan's attempts to influence the establishment of the League of Nations was the Japanese-led effort to insert language prohibiting racial discrimination in the preamble of the Covenant. Australia feared unrestricted Japanese [[immigration]], and senators from southern U.S. states were unwilling to allow a challenge to their race relations with Australia. The U.S. and Britain orchestrated the defeat of the Japanese proposal despite the support of France, Italy, and China.
