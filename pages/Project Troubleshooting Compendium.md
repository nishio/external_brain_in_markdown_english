Project Troubleshooting Compendium
> [yuiseki_](https://twitter.com/yuiseki_/status/1785569560550064461/photo/1) I am convinced by this page that if you are going to install SaaS to measure and improve your Four Keys and look at some incomprehensible productivity chart, you should first read this book, "The Complete Guide to Solving Project Troubles". I think you should first read this book "Project Troubleshooting Compendium" if you don't have time to look at some chart or other to visualize the productivity of your project.
