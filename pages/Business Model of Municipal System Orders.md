title: "Business Model of Municipal System Orders"

Kawaguchi's response is interesting.
- The business model of the order taker unexpectedly fell apart."
    - >  Originally, the purchasing power of municipalities was weak, so the strategy (which I personally have mixed feelings about) was to earn thin and stable profits by reducing their own costs, while keeping municipalities alive in terms of the business model of the contractor,
    - >  The current situation is that this business model is failing as a result of the faster-than-expected decline in purchasing power of local governments, as well as government policy (standardization of municipal systems) that has forced unexpected development costs.

>  Why is the Japanese administrative system so difficult to use?
>  Behind the creation of such a system is the "ordering mechanism.
>
>  When the national or local government builds a system, the company that offers the lowest price in a "competitive bidding" process (usually a large IT company) receives the order.
>  Just asking here, it seems efficient.
>  But the problem is then.
>
>  For example, we win contracts at extremely low prices in the first year (in the past there have been cases where the price was 1 yen).
>  However, the situation changes drastically after the second year, when specifications are added or changed.
>  After that, it becomes a "negotiated contract," and in some cases, billions of yen worth of costs accumulate one after another.
>  At this stage, we can no longer compete with other companies.
>
>  Even more problematic is the site of its development.
>  For more information, please watch YouTube, but the big companies only put together the specifications, and the actual programming is thrown to subcontractors and sub-subcontractors.
>  Such a development environment cannot possibly produce anything useful and easy to use. This is not what Microsoft, Apple, Google, or OpenAI are doing.
>
>  In this YouTube video, we explained the backstage of this "dark side of Japanese" digital administration and the waste of taxpayer money that continues to this day.
>
>  ◆[[Waste of Taxpayer Money]] Receiving an order for 1 yen and billing billions of yen for the following year... This is the dark side of Japan where such a scheme is allowed to flourish [but I have high hopes for Team Mirai Yasuno!
>
>  As I mentioned in the video, I have high expectations for Mr. Takahiro Yasuno, who was recently elected to the House of Councillors.
>  Mr. Anno and Team Mirai are trying to change the structure to be more transparent and competitive. I strongly hope that these issues will be taken up in the Diet and that a breakthrough will be made to change the structure.
>
>  And for this to happen, it is important that as many citizens as possible become aware of the "dark side of digital administration. I believe that this will support Mr. Anno and his team and give them the power to promote reform.

>  I don't deny that there has been this trend, but it has been in the news in the past, and the situation is different now because the bidding system reform in the country has regulated low bids, so this assumption would be misleading.
>
>  In fact, it's just that there are no longer any blatant violations of regulations, and the order takers are free to have their own ideas about attacking the edge, and we do not deny that.
>
>  Of course, some client companies are not leaving it at that, but are taking measures such as rearrangement of rights and separation of processes, which are factors for negotiated contracts.
