title: "Example of Keichobot Conversation Log"
---

- Logs that may be suitable for getting an atmosphere of how to use [[Listening Chat System]].

    - [[I'd like to talk and sort out whether to write an explanation at this point or implement new features first.]]
    - I realized that what I had lumped together under the term "new features" could actually be divided into two categories.
    - [[I don't want to put the data in a repository, but I need to sort out what to do with it.]]
    - 'I don't want to put the training data for machine learning in a repository to deploy on a server, what would be the best way to do that, I need to organize it'
    - I am aware of the existence of unnecessary fear.
    - [[Consider explaining the new features.]]
    - A new command called the UPKW command was created today, and I'll consider explaining it."
    - I realized that the explanations were biased toward the perspective of the function creator and lacked the "what makes you happy" from the user's perspective.
    - [[Conversation log 2021-01-31]]
    - When I asked for advice on how to write a test, I was asked where the test was located, and when I tried to answer that it was the same as an existing test, I realized that it didn't have to be the same.
- Lecture Project
        - [[I've accepted a speaking engagement at my alma mater, and I'd like to talk about it.]]
        - I felt bewildered about a project with a long-overdue deadline.
        - I realized this is the anxiety of being in a fog with no way to know what's ahead.
        - I realized it would be a good idea to discuss with them "what we need to do to get out of the fog."
        - [[It would be good if you could verbalize what exactly you will do about the speaking project.]]
        - [[It would be good if the policy on the content of the lecture is set and the content of the short lecture is verbalized.]]
        - Policies are now roughly in place.
        - [[I would like to complete the lecture outline.]]
    - Organize with Regroup (current [[Kozaneba digital stationery to organize your thoughts]])
            - [[Drafting of lecture outline]]
        - [[I think there's a bit of a difference between "problem-solving options" and "life options."]]
        - Let's ask others about the latter, and I'll come up with an idea.
        - → [[How do you know what your life choices are?]]
    - [[Is the next development a network connection or a solution to the in-drag full-size display problem?]]
    - I realized that "network connectivity" should be the priority, but instead of "the ability to connect" it should be "the ability to store in the cloud".


--- Unorganized notes

    - [[I was talking about how active learning doesn't work, and I concluded that you should read books.]]
    - [[I've realized that meaning is not a set, and I'd like to discuss if this has any practical application.]]
    - [[I would like to come up with an explanation of the ability to create a map of Regroup from chat logs.]]
