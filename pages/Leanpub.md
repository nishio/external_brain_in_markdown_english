The actual footnotes are summarized in a chapter called Notes at the end of all of them (is that called a footnote?).

Each sentence in the Notes is given a link to jump to the original location.

The PDF version seems to show them at the bottom of the page as footnotes. The Japanese is garbled, but maybe the font is not embedded because I have the book set to the English version?

If you looks something interesting but the auto-translated English is not good enough to understand it, feel free to let me know at [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en). I'm very happy to spread my thought to non-Japanese readers.
