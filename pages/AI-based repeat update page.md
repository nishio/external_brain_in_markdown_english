title: "AI-based repeat update page"
---

We used to do unlimited, then we set a maximum number of pages, then we lifted it again.
I'll note why.

Early in the start, I thought, "Let's just do something extreme and observe it," so I targeted 22 pages.
- It was a personal burden for me to get 22 pages updated daily.
- This is due to the fact that I wasn't used to it yet, and it's possible that once I get used to it, I'll be fine.

Next, the upper limit was limited to 10 cases.
- However, this will not guarantee that the newly added page will be updated the next day.
- This design is undesirable because "add to the target" means "we now want to develop with the assistance of AI."

It would be better if a system that automatically adjusts the frequency of updates, which I read as [[Spaced Repetition Update]] or something like that, could be implemented, but after thinking about it for a bit, I think it's not going to be as easy to implement as I thought it would be.

The current design is divided into two categories: 🔁, which are updated reliably every day, and 🌀, which are updated occasionally, with a limit only on the 🌀 side.
- If you feel that 🔁 is becoming more and more burdensome, change the low-priority items to 🌀.
- On the other hand, if the 🌀 develops and becomes more interesting, you can turn it into a loop.
