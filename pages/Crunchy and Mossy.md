When creating a new UI, whether it is "[[dry and crumbly]] or [[crunchy]]" may have more impact on the user than the idea of the UI itself.

The technology to make crispy crispy is unobtrusive but important.
However, the user appreciates that 500msec becomes 50msec, but not 5msec.
As the performance of the machine itself increases, the crispness will eventually produce no user value.

Crunchy is [[of quality commonplace]].
