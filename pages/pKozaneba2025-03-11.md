I want to improve this. First, create DEVIN_MEMO.md, then run this source code in your environment, and write your thoughts in DEVIN_MEMO.md in the process.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Devin/icon' alt='Devin.icon' height="19.5"/>The application started successfully and the tutorial mode was displayed; I added a note to DEVIN_MEMO.md about the environment building procedure and what I noticed, and recorded that the README needs to be enriched and the dependency conflicts need to be resolved.
