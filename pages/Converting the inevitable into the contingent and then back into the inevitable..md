from  [[Toward Relative Art & Technology]]
Converting the inevitable into the contingent and then back into the inevitable.
The idea of "transforming the inevitable into the contingent and then back into the inevitable" is related to the idea of reinterpreting and reconstructing the relationship between chance and necessity in philosophy, aesthetics, and even historical theory. This talk often refers to the process of how events and phenomena find their laws and inevitability in chance.

Below is a step-by-step explanation of this concept.

1. definition of contingency and inevitability
Contingency (coincidence)
Contingent refers to events or conditions that have no clear cause or purpose and are unpredictable.
Examples: sudden encounters, unexpected inventions, social changes.
inevitability
Inevitable refers to that which is determined by causes or laws and cannot be avoided.
Examples: events based on natural laws or causal relationships.
2. the idea of deriving the inevitable from coincidence
This process is an idea often found in philosophy, science, and history.

(1) Converting the inevitable into the contingent
The stage of understanding that phenomena that at first glance appear to have law and order are in fact merely coincidental events.
Examples: discoveries and inventions in science.
For example, the discovery of penicillin was by chance (observation of molds), but the inevitability was later scientifically elucidated.
(2) Constructing necessity again from contingency
A stage in which meaning and laws are later found in chance events and situations and reinterpreted as inevitable.
Examples: social changes or historical events.
Even when revolutions and major technological innovations initially appear to have occurred by accident, they are later evaluated as having been due to inevitable social backgrounds and factors.
3. philosophical background
This idea is particularly relevant to the arguments of the following philosophers

(1) Hegel's dialectic
Hegel believed that history and phenomena unfold themselves through chance and necessity.
For him, coincidence appears to be a temporary confusion that is ultimately integrated into inevitable truth in a dialectical process.
Example: a major historical event appears coincidental at the time, but is later understood to have been part of an inevitable evolution.
(2) Aristotle's Theory of Causation
Aristotle argued that things have four causes (material cause, form cause, action cause, and object cause), and that chance may also be interpreted as part of these causes.
(3) Nietzsche's "[[Fateful Love]] ([[Amor Fati]])"
Nietzsche taught an attitude of accepting chance as it is and loving it as inevitable.
In other words, he rethinks what appears to be contingent as part of his life and sees it as his inevitable destiny.
4. interpretation in art and creativity
In the arts and creative fields, this process manifests itself as

(1) Creation that incorporates coincidence
Artists incorporate accidental elements (inspiration and improvisation) into their work and make them part of their creative process.
Example: in [[Jackson Pollock's]] action paintings, accidental movements make sense as part of the work.
(2) Finding the inevitable in coincidence
When looking at the finished work, choices and expressions that seemed accidental are interpreted as having inevitable significance in the overall work.
5. application in science and history
(1) Chance and necessity in science
In scientific progress, there are many accidental discoveries that reveal that there is an inevitable mechanism or law behind them.
Example: natural selection in evolutionary theory.
The process by which mutation (chance) gives rise to environmental adaptation (necessity).
(2) Chance and necessity in history
In historiography, contingent events (wars, revolutions, disasters) are reinterpreted in the long run as elements that shape the inevitable course of events.
Example: The French Revolution appears to be a series of coincidental events, but in hindsight, the social, economic, and cultural context makes it inevitable.
6. contemporary significance
In today's society, this process is important for the following themes

AI and Data Analysis:.
Chance patterns (anomalies in big data) create new laws and predictive models (inevitability).
Creative Problem Solving:.
An approach that accepts an accidental idea or situation and turns it into a structured and inevitable solution.
7. conclusion
The idea of "transforming the inevitable into the contingent and then back again into the inevitable" represents an understanding that chance and necessity are not simply opposites, but rather interact with each other to shape phenomena and events. This process is the basis for new interpretations and reconstructions of the world and events, not only in philosophical speculation, but also in science, history, art, and creative thinking.
