- Research on "[[air]]"

- > In Japan, "air" holds a kind of absolute power.... Forty years have passed since the author made his point. Today, we are more and more busy "reading the situation" and "surmise (about somebody's feelings)" this specter, which is stronger than anybody else. This is a famous book that is still quoted and discussed in numerous media. This is the starting point and definitive edition of the theory of the Japanese.
