> [@hrjn](https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1567681816374693889?s=21&t=zBcjdG2WILWOPNvDPpTDtw): when it comes to management, everyone wants to manage, but the higher the management, the more accountability I personally think it's better to focus on accountability.
> The reason is that the more we deal with global matters, the lower the resolution of the story.
> If it's five people or something, you can look at specific events, but if it's a hundred people, you can't look at specifics. Can you explain this?

- [[Dealing with global matters reduces the resolution of the story.]]
    - [[global]]
    - [[Cognitive Resolution]]
    - [[I can't see a hundred specifics.]]

- [[control]] and [[accountability]]
