title: 'Misconception that "making DM public increases the amount of information."'
---

I was thinking about the opinion that "taking [[private communication]] to [[public channel]] increases the amount of information and prevents it from being passed around" #DM

- It's the system's inability to distinguish between [I don't mind seeing it." and "I want you to see it."
    - Whether the lack of distinction is due to software specifications or the way the work is run is irrelevant.

- Making information public increases the amount of information that can be "seen".
    - If the information you "want" to see is properly [[Mentioned.]], then that's all you need to see.
    - Failure to distinguish between "may see" and "want to see" information leads to "want to see" information being mixed in with "may see" information.
        - →I end up having to watch the whole thing.

- Responsibility to Mention" Culture
    - If the sender did not mentions the information he/she wants the receiver to see,
    - The sender is responsible for any problems caused by the recipient's failure to read it.
- If this culture is established.
    - The sender mentions what they want you to see.
    - Recipients see preferentially what is mentions.
    - → No amount of other "look good" information will be a burden.

- The burden on the reader and the burden on the writer
    - If the information is publicly written and pointed to by permalinks, it's less work for the writer.
        - Just point to it and say, "Look at this."
    - If the information is only in the DM or other places where it cannot be pointed to, there will be copy and paste and other hassles.
        - [[Disadvantages of e-mail-based communication]]
