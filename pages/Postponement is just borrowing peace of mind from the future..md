title: "Postponement is just borrowing peace of mind from the future."
---

From the reading notes of the book "[[Introduction to the Pomodoro Technique]]".

from  [[Leverage Memo: Introduction to the Pomodoro Technique]]
    - Why does [[postpone]] happen?
- Stress.
    - Sense of being made to do things by others
    - Pressure to be perfect
    - Fear of failure or criticism
- Postponement temporarily relieves these stresses.
    - The behavior of "putting off" is reinforced because of the mental rewards this provides.
    - But this is just [[Borrowing peace of mind from the future]].
    - The more you borrow, the more you suffer with interest.
- Stress comes from within you.


- [[peace of mind]]   [[peace (esp. public peace)]]   [[stress-free]]   [[stressless]]
