Audrey Tang clearly defines d/acc as "decentralized and democratized 'defensive acceleration,'" and it is being promoted nationally and internationally as a central concept in the Plurality strategy.

About [[d/acc]] - Summary of key statements by [[Audrey Tang]] (key points)
- 2025-03-03 Nikkei BP interview
    - Now that offensive capabilities have been decentralized, defensive technologies must also be decentralized. We call this "d/acc" (Defense-Decentralization-Democracy/Acceleration). Opening up these areas will not increase the risk of weaponization--criminals already have the equivalent tools."
        - → Definitive comment that defense, decentralization, and democratization should be accelerated simultaneously.
- 2025-04 Delivery "The Great Simplification" Podcast
    - Vitalik Buterin calls this 'Defensive Democratic Decentralization Acceleration. Vitalik Buterin calls it 'Defensive Democratic Decentralization Acceleration.
        - → [[Singularity vs. Plurality]] contrast and position d/acc as "[[lateral acceleration]]".
- d/acc Day @ ETHTaipei（2025）
    - As a program speaker, he will be speaking on the philosophy of "d/acc" crossed with "Plurality."
        - → Latest event with Audrey Tang as a key speaker on the d/acc community side

Key Points (summarized in Japanese)
1. definition
    - d/acc = Defense + Decentralization + Democracy / Acceleration
    - The idea is that in an age when attackers are already using distributed and democratized tools, defenders should accelerate open and distributed security technologies.
2. why is it "safe to disclose"?
    - Since attackers already have equivalent AI/automated means, closing the defensive technology does not eliminate the asymmetry. Rather, the logic is "it is safer to distribute to all."
3. continuity with Plurality
    - Audrey criticizes the vertically accelerated ([[e/acc]]) vision of Singularity and advocates [[Plurality]], which "horizontally" strengthens human cooperation. The guiding principle for its implementation is d/acc -- "the horizontal diffusion of [[democratized security]].
4. specific examples
    - "ROOST" to run CSAM detection model locally at each terminal
    - Mandatory fraudulent ad blocking (requires each platform to be digitally signed)
    - Both employ "decentralized defense" rather than "centralized censorship".
5. community building
    - Vitalik Buterin and others in the Web3 community have become a common language, and "d/acc days" have been held consecutively at DevconSEA → ETHSF → ETHTaipei, and Audrey Tang has been a keynote speaker at each event. Audrey Tang has been a keynote speaker at every event.

### In short: d/acc is an applied version of "differential acceleration"
.
- Nick Bostrom's [[Nick Bostrom]] "[[differential technological development]]" ([[DTD]]), which is to "advance technologies that contribute to security, defense, and democracy faster than those that are dangerous," is being implemented in the context of defense, decentralization, and democracy by Audrey Tang and Vitalik Buterin are attempting to implement this "differential technological development" ([[DTD]]) in the context of defense, decentralization, and democracy.

## 1. what is "[[differential]]"
- Differential Technological Development (DTD)
    - Proposed by Nick Bostrom in 2002.
    - A strategy to increase the safety margin for mankind by creating a relative speed gap by delaying hazardous technologies and moving ahead with risk-reducing technologies.

## 2. d/acc naming and "differential"
.
- Vitalik Buterin has d in d/acc
- >  *defense, democracy, decentralization, or differential technological development*
- and explicitly stated.
* i.e., a declaration that d/acc ≈ ### "DTD that preferentially differentially accelerates defense"
.

## 3. Audrey Tang talks d/acc
.
- Audrey stated [* "If the attacker is already distributed, let's make the defense distributed and open,
    - Local AI to run CSAM detection on the terminal side
    - Distributed execution of fraudulent ad blocking with digital signatures
    - --Examples include: "* This is the practice of specializing in DTD as "protection + distribution + public". This is the practice of specializing in DTD as "protection + decentralization + publicity".


## 4. Diagram the relationship
.
- Bostrom DTD
    - Design the speed difference to be "harmful ＜ beneficial
- General principle of differential acceleration
- d/acc (Buterin)
    - Accelerate defense / democracy / decentralization as a priority
- Audrey Tang's d/acc
    - Implementation of pluralistic and horizontally coordinated safety technology through international collaboration.


- Summary
- "differential" = "differential acceleration that puts safety ahead of danger".
- d/acc = differential A defensive, decentralized, democratized version of acceleration.
- Audrey Tang promotes d/acc as Plurality Implementation Strategy, and specifically proposes securing with local AI and distributed verification infrastructure.
- Therefore, it is clearer to understand the relationship between d/acc and differential as "theory (DTD) and implementation guidelines (d/acc)".
