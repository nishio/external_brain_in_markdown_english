- A new illustration was created based on the understanding from December 2, 2025.
- In the diagram of [[Broad Listening]] drawn in 2023, it was depicted like this:
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/12ffc7bda4394f006e2c0e9d84a4a1b1/thumb/1000)
        - The understanding of the left diagram (E) and the right diagram (F) has deepened over the past two years, leading to a new illustration.
- A:
    - When many people express their opinions, the recipient gets overwhelmed.
    - This is represented by E.
    - Issues like the [[Public Comment Overload Problem]] reflect this state.
- B:
    - To avoid the situation in A, there is a practice of "listening only to a select few."
    - This leads to dissatisfaction among those not included in the "select few."
- C:
    - Consequently, it leads to demands like "Listen to us too!"
    - However, doing this results in the state of A, making it an impossible choice.
    - An unexpected realization over the past two years is that some people think "Broad Listening" is about "turning B into C."

        - There is a lack of imagination regarding how "information receivers" or "listeners" are suffering from an [[Information Flood]].

    - The "Listening" in Broad Listening is about "hearing," and the subject of hearing is the "listener."
- D: The form that has emerged as of December 2025
    - The diagram F has become more comprehensible in detail.

    - A system where [[AI Listens and Organizes Thoughts]] is emerging by 2025.
    - In the February 2025 lecture [[Scaling Digital Democracy]], a diagram of [[AI-Mediated Communication]] was drawn.
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/e0cbca9528fb418c1248e823bbcfbba9/thumb/1000)
        - At that time, it was expressed as "various forms are possible."
    - In March 2025, [[Idobata System v1]] was created.

    - After repeated experiments, by June, it evolved into "[[Manifesto That Can Speak]]" by Team Mirai.
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/8895469b72bec05cf3f6f064546d490d/thumb/1000)
    - By November, a structure called [[Mirai AI Interview]] emerged, where an [[AI Interviewer]] conducts one-on-one dialogues with people about what Team Mirai wants to know.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/892e6c7ff1af235e2b64edbea9b46ab1/thumb/1000)
        - The arrows in this D diagram being bidirectional is significant.
        - In 2023, only a unidirectional view was apparent.
        - In the current Mirai AI Interview:
            - There is short-term "bidirectional communication" between people and the AI Interviewer.
            - However, how Team Mirai utilizes the reports submitted as a result of these dialogues is not very visible.
                - There is a lack of [[Traceability of Where It Went]].
            - The bidirectionality between the listener and AI is quite weak.
                - The listener inputs what they want to hear into a prompt.
                - After running for a while and gathering opinions, they analyze and get reactions to "what they want to hear."
                - Although it is technically bidirectional, one round trip takes 1-2 weeks.

While writing the explanation, I remembered writing about three types of stakeholders, not just two.
- [[Three Types of Stakeholders in Broad Listening]]
- It is often the case that citizens do not understand that the data analysts in the middle are overwhelmed by the information flood.
