# Ver.1 [[Bitcoin]]
- Abstract: Bitcoin is the first [[cryptocurrency]] using blockchain, [[a distributed ledger technology]], which is used to [[record transactions]] and confirm them, allowing money to be sent and received [[P2P]] without the need for a third party.
- Difference: At this stage, blockchain technology was primarily limited to recording monetary transactions.

# Ver.2 [[Ethereum]]
- Abstract: Ethereum is a platform that allows for [[smart contracts]] in addition to the basic blockchain functionality of Bitcoin. This allows for the development of [[contracts]] and applications that go beyond simply sending and receiving currency and are executed automatically.
- Difference: the main evolution of Ethereum is the introduction of smart contracts. This has enabled the development of [[decentralized applications]] ([[DApps]]) and greatly expanded the range of applications of blockchain technology.

# Ver.3 [[Designated Verifier Signature]]
- Abstract: Designated Verifier Signature is a digital signature technology that allows only a specific verifier to verify the validity of a signature. When this concept is combined with blockchain, it can be viewed as a security technology that allows private transactions and messages to be exchanged on the blockchain.
- Difference: the emphasis is on [[privacy]] and security, so that only certain recipients can verify the content and legitimacy of a transaction. This contributes to the [[confidentiality]] of communications using blockchain technology.

# Ver. 3.1
- Ver. 3.1 is based on the concepts of the Designed Verifier Signature (Ver. 3), but with further improvements and applications. Specifically, the following evolutions are possible
- Improvements: Further enhancements to privacy protection techniques, e.g., combining [[zero-knowledge proof]] to prove the existence and legitimacy of a transaction while completely concealing its contents.
- Applications: [[distributed ID systems]], [[voting systems]], [[secret data exchange]], and any other areas requiring privacy.
