When food is scarce, civilizations cultivate land and plant crops.
When electricity is scarce, civilization clears land and plants solar panels.

memo
- When there was a shortage of [[unskilled]] labor, they reaped what was growing.
- When education becomes a portable good, can we plant a tree that will become education?
    - Unlike humans and crops, there is no need to go to the trouble of making them in rural areas because the land and the amount of sunlight are not relevant?
    - Brand value of standardized language
- When there is a population shortage, will they still actively try to increase the number of humans?
    - If a meme infection that prevents human reproduction were to spread, an AI would find it efficient to breed in a place isolated from the meme and transport it one way ([[Science Fiction Setting]]).
        - In other words, make the urban areas gated cities, where you can't get in and you can't get out, make it a place to aspire to and have an influx of people.
        - In the so-called afterlife, a destination where humans move in one direction.
    - When an unfavorable disease occurs in a field where crops are grown, the field is burned to the ground.
        - In the Old Testament, [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] are destroyed by sulfur and fire from heaven because of the moral depravity of the inhabitants.
