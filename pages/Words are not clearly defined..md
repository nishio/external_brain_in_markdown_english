title: "Words are not clearly defined."
---

When someone says, "The word [[Definition.]] is not clear," often defining the word does not solve the problem because what the person is really looking for is not "the word is clear."

If there is no consensus on the definition of the word used in the definition, it will only lead to further discussion of the definition of it. Related: [[infinite regress]].
