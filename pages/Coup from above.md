Coup from above

The issue of "[[surveillance capitalism]]" raised by [[Shoshana Zubov]] is precisely a warning that the invisible manipulation of human behavior and emotions by technology threatens democracy. She argued that Google, Facebook, and others are using accumulated personal data to predict and guide people's behavior, and that their economic principles are eroding [[human autonomy]] (and thus [[democracy]]). Zubov likens surveillance capitalism to a "coup d'etat from above," criticizing it as a system in which people's preferences and emotions are manipulated without their knowledge. For example, in the [Cambridge Analytica case data to create psychological profiles and deliver political advertisements that target individual voters' anxieties and desires in an attempt to change their voting behavior. The scandal made a huge impact by showing that data and AI can be used to precisely deliver messages that appeal to people's emotions. According to Zubov, the goal of surveillance capitalism is not to directly oppress users but to "[[quietly induce them]] to behave predictably," and in that respect it is more subtle and dangerous than [[1984-style totalitarianism]]. To counter this less visible form of emotional manipulation, she urges that increased literacy on the part of citizens and transparency through regulation are essential.
