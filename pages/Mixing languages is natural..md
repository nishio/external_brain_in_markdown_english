    - from  [[The development of LLM moves the bottleneck of intellectual production to output efficiency in the native language.]]
- It's just that I've been doing 100% Japanese for a while and the mode to output in Japanese is stuck.

        - The natural state of "mixed" as engineers write mixed source code, bilinguals speak mixed bilinguals, and I write mixed illustrations
