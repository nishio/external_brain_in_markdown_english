title: "Abbreviation survey needed"

- [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]] p.22  [[(1.3.3.2) Read source code step by step]]
> Abbreviations are abbreviations because they are concepts that occur frequently and are tedious to write every time. And it is implicitly assumed that the person using the abbreviation understands the meaning of the abbreviation when writing it and that the reader also understands it. For example, they think, "If I write GC, everyone will know that it stands for Garbage Collection. If they thought that someone might not know, they would simply write one line somewhere in the document, "GC stands for Garbage Collection. If you put an explanation at every occurrence, there is no point in abbreviating it. If you don't understand it, then you and the person who wrote it have different assumptions. That's why it's important to research abbreviations.

Not only abbreviations, but [[Words you don't understand]] in other people's statements need to be investigated.
