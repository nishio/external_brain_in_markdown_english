[[It's easier to evaluate after the results are in.]]

I tried it for a bit, but it became a pain in the ass.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1677607371730993153) We started to think that "[[double thinking]]" of "[[1984]]" is related to "[[one's real intention and one's hidden motives]]" and "[[the end justifies the means]]" in Japanese. motives]" and "[[the end justifies the means]]" in Japanese, and it was suggested that we must first affirm both in order to [[pick up]], and that this is [[Plural Thinking]]. Then, "[[lickspittle]]" "[[obsession with personal consistency]]" stuck in my mind.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1677608523545587714) The meme of "[[consistent individual]]" in the West is actually a [[harmful meme]], not [[one vote per person]] voting It's a form of [[Quadratic Voting]] where you spread out a lot of votes, or [[trust propagation]] to multiple people with different opinions, or something like that...

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1677613314317389824) There are people in the world who want to be seen by others as "smarter" than they really are, and they make [[word salad]] with a bunch of borrowed, cool, smart words.

I was disappointed when I looked back at my own comments and thought, "That's word salad.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1677614596293808128) Well, "I'm not intelligent enough, so I'll keep quiet" is zero, and "I'm not intelligent enough, but I'll verbalize as much as I can" is positive, so the latter is Is the latter better?
