title: "Choose from nearly equal priorities"
---

[If you do tasks in order of priority, you will eventually find yourself in a situation where you have to choose which one to do among multiple tasks that have almost the same priority.
- [[the cost of making a decision on which to do]].
- I wouldn't say that's logically true, as long as there's a clear enough priority order sorting.
- Realistically, it's not sorted that way.
    - Sorting is difficult or too labor intensive
            - [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]]  p.55~
    - In [[GTD]], "[[put everything in a box for now]]" and then "[[process from the top of the box]]" is regarded as a sorted priority and the decision-making cost is erased.

If you're doing "choose by priority," you won't be able to choose when this situation arises.
- It's not a good way to go about it.
    - After all, if this is going to be the decision-making tool in the future, why not just do "the one with the closest deadline" in advance?

Don't make "do what's closest to the deadline" a top priority rule.
- Because critical tasks with no deadlines are relegated to daily, detailed, deadline-driven tasks that don't need to be done right now.
- Select tasks according to their importance, and if they are of equal importance (i.e., it is not clear which is more important), do them in the order of their deadlines.
- Uh, that's [[Urgent/Important Matrix]].
