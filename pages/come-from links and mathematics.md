title: "come-from links and mathematics"
---

Scrapbox does not have [[come-from link]], so when I try to express something like mathematics, where the definition is in one place and the other place is the use of the definition, I have to make the definition side a page title instead of a link, which makes the page more divided than necessary and makes it less visually appealing. I wonder if [[page embedding]] could be done...

A come-from link is a way to declare, "If a link for this keyword is pressed on another page, it will come here.
- Opposite to "goto" which is "go where you are going".
- This makes it easy to express, as in mathematics, when you have a definition in one place and want to jump to that definition in another place.

- Illustration. Blue line means link.

If you naively use the appearance of the keyword "XX sex" in Scrapbox as a link
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/2fef695d8db6339a16cfb0d995b820ca/thumb/1000)
- A virtual "XX sex" page would be created, and pages that use "XX sex" would be lined up on it.
    - No distinction is made between the definition and use of the concept.
    - I don't know where to look when I want to see a definition.

Solution 1
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/4e5bcb7c9fd22164939761c7141989ab/thumb/1000)
- Move the content that was in part B
- This would break the state of A and B being adjacent to each other.
- Would it be nice to have "[[page embedding]]" to solve this divide? I thought

Solution 2
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/12d8c97456e38bb172798f4095a596ed/thumb/1000)
- Row links point to the definition position
- Can be realized with little effort
- Content fragmentation will not occur.
- One click more, but you can get to the definition.
        - [[If only we could finally find it.]]
    - The first method will become buried and unreachable as the use of the concept grows, so it would be better to point to a definition before it is born.
