title: "How can the ability to abstract be taught?"
---

In the process of planning [[Technology Supporting Coding]] in 2013, we discussed how [[ability to abstract]] could be taught.

It is not good to devote too many pages to "[[How important it is to learn]]."
- You're an "[[I want to learn]]" person when you pick up a book like that and try to read it in the first place.
- People who don't want to learn when I devote pages to explain it to them don't read it in the first place,
    - On the off chance that I do read it, I have no desire to learn.
- So the reader should assume that you are trying to learn and speak to you and say, "That's the right choice.
- The problem to be solved is "I want to learn, but [[I don't have time.]] or [[unmotivated]]."
- Then, we will touch on [[Time Reduction]] ([[making efficient]]) and [[Motivation Management]].

The downside of not learning is that [you won't be able to notice the changes.
- Learning to prevent this is [[broaden one's horizons]] the second axis.
    - Learning for [[making efficient]] is the first axis.
    - [[Accelerated learning]] of new things by reaching [[Abstract Understanding]].

- From one end, from the big picture, from where it needs to be.
- The latter is easier to learn by comparison or from history.
- Learn by making, [[Confirmation of understanding]].
    - It's important to know what you don't know.
    - But what to make?
    - So [[Adherence to information within the organization]]. [[Problems that need to be solved]].
        - If you avoid [[adherence to specific cases]] and collect only abstract information, it will not become knowledge that is rooted in you.
    - Cut flowers will eventually wilt. It is important to [[spread one's roots (of a tree, etc.)]].

- Primary target is new employees who want or need to learn a programming language
    - How to learn a programming language?
    - You learn from history, you learn from comparison, only after you've reached a level where you can create and learn at least one language.
    - Axis 1 might be better for the axis of widening horizons.
        - broaden one's horizons
        - cultivate a better understanding
            - [Close to application

- Maximizing Surprises

- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/tokoroten/icon' alt='tokoroten.icon' height="19.5"/> Our understanding is that by learning, we acquire the ability to abstract
    - But you can't reach people because you can't bridge the gap between knowledge gained by learning and [[ability to abstract]].
    - So why do we acquire the ability to abstract when we learn?
    - I wonder if it would be a good idea to write pertinent information about why there is no point in studying only knowledge without acquiring the ability to abstract it....
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Tokoroten Nakayama Why do we acquire the ability to abstract by learning?
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> How can we develop the ability to abstract?
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Has the ability to abstract been acquired, or have people with the ability to abstract experienced success in gaining abstracted knowledge as a result of their studies, and have they begun to devote more resources to learning?
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> What makes you happy about abstraction?
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Abstraction can be applied to new problems. Learning the answer to a specific math problem will only answer that problem. If you learn the "solution" that led to that answer, you can solve other problems.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> How can we teach the ability to abstract to someone who does not have the ability to abstract at this point in time?
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Can the ability to abstract be taught?
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> What exactly do you mean by abstraction?
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> The topic of abstraction may not be answered right away.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/tokoroten/icon' alt='tokoroten.icon' height="19.5"/> For the amount of knowledge, do we acquire abstractions by [[induction]]?
- In my experience, buying two books in the same field is a successful abstraction.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>  By [[Comparison of several things]], can we determine that commonly formed things are "[[universal]]" (likely)? Surely that is an abstraction.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> I suspect that you have an innate ability to abstract by induction, and that you don't abstract because you don't do the "read multiple books in the same field" behavior, but then that's easier than teaching the ability because you simply have to teach the behavior.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>  [[Questioning Textbooks]] Is there an idea?
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> So you can say that we compare programming languages or learn from history, suspecting that the current language is not perfectly correct and abstracting by comparing similar ones?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/tokoroten/icon' alt='tokoroten.icon' height="19.5"/> The rest.
    - [[Understanding by Metaphor]]
    - [[Graph Structure of Knowledge]]
    - [[Linking History and Invention.]]
- The acquisition of knowledge graph structures becomes [[Graph Patterns]] and [[Abstraction by Pattern Matching]].
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/tokoroten/icon' alt='tokoroten.icon' height="19.5"/> So I would say that what you learn is not useful, but the results of chewing on what you have learned is useful.
    - How to bridge the gap here is what leads to how important it is to learn.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/tokoroten/icon' alt='tokoroten.icon' height="19.5"/> I wonder if I should use [[structuralism]] and [[deconstruction (as in the term coined by Jacques Derrida)]], which is the name of the philosophy behind the series of flows.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> What exactly is deconstruction? It is difficult to answer.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/tokoroten/icon' alt='tokoroten.icon' height="19.5"/> I wonder if we understand structure through abstraction and create new creations by transforming and destroying the structure.
                - It may be easier to understand if you think about it from [[deconstructed architecture]].
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> In the context of how we learn, does this mean that we should move away from the idea that "there is a [[correct]] (of [[structure]]) and we learn to get it"?
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/tokoroten/icon' alt='tokoroten.icon' height="19.5"/>  It is like a complement of [[deconstruction (as in the term coined by Jacques Derrida)]] and [[structuralism]], so it is different depending on who says it.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Are we back to constructionism here when we say something like "each individual needs to create their own structure of understanding"?
            - I thought it was called [[constructivism]]. That's confusing.
