title: "Motivation switch is in the shape of bicycle pedals"

- [[motivator]] is a form of [[Bicycle pedals]] # even if
> Yoichi Takigawa I once heard that a motivation switch is shaped like a bicycle pedal. I was impressed by the expression, "It's heavy at first, but as the speed picks up, it doesn't stop.

Talk about the motivation switch being a volume rather than a 0/1 toggle switch.

    - I thought it was [[false dichotomy]] to think 0/1, but the analogy "bicycle pedals = heavy at first" is even more brilliant!
