- > After the kick-off event for the "Unexplored Study Group" that we launched in the summer of 2015, there was a get-together that served as a launch party. There, we talked about our idea of "Unexplored Junior" to create a place to give the younger generation opportunities for growth like Unexplored. At the same table were Mr. Nishio, Mr. Yasukawa, and Mr. Suzuki, and I remember that we shared the ideas that each of us had and had a lot of fun.
