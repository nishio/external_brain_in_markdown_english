Derrida's "différance, [[différance]]" means
The meaning is coined by Derrida to refer to the function of a "difference" that rises up and is never fixed in its final form, but is always "delayed" to another sign. The French word différance, which is the same sound as différence, embodies a critique of phonocentrism in that it is indistinguishable in pronunciation, and only the scribe can distinguish it.

Core Idea (in formula)
Difference = difference + deferral + espacement
    - [[difference]]: following Saussure, the meaning of a word can only come from its difference from another word.
    - → [[value based on difference]]
    - [[delay]]: meaning is postponed to the next word in the lexical chain, and the final definite point (transcendental symbolic content) is not reached.
- [[Spacing]]: The **intervals (spaces)** between segments create structure and shift meaning in time and space.
- [[trace]] (trace): no meaning leaves traces of other symbols, and there is no complete "[[present]]".

Aim (point of criticism)
- The **"metaphysics of the present "** of Western metaphysics (the idea of privileging origin, center, and pure meaning) and the dismantling of logocentrism/phonocentrism.
- It shakes up the myth of the origin of meaning, subject and text, and encourages reading practices (deconstruction).

Mini Example
- The meaning of "cat" is established by the difference between "not a dog, mammal, pet..." and other words, and the explanation continues to extend to other words.
- différance and différence are the same in voice. Only the letters show the difference - this reversal is Derrida's point.

Common Misconceptions
- Not an exemption from relativism: a principle to read strictly in line with the web of differences and delays, not to say that everything is OK.
- Not a fixed "concept": rather a "quasi-concept/operation". A position that is doubtful of being tightly defined and closed itself.
