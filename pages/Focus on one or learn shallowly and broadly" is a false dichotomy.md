He also discusses the physical challenges of a second job.
Respondents noted that the question is not a simple choice between two options, "narrowing it down to one or learning shallowly and broadly," but rather, "how far to broaden the scope of your concentration. He also points out that the optimal scope depends on one's objectives. For example, he concludes that there is value in being able to complete a service on one's own by being able to do both engineering and design, and that such skill specialization is effective.

> Actually, I don't think it is a choice between "should I focus on a specific area or should I focus on a shallow and broad area? And here, the optimal solution depends on the objective.
