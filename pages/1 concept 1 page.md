title: "1 concept 1 page"
---

When summarizing what you have read in a paper, we do not include a "one page per paper" constraint.
Rather, it should be "one concept, one page".
But in the early stages of the survey, the brain doesn't have enough information to properly isolate the concept.
So I have no choice but to write one page, one paper.

Image of "I can't output in an organized way from the beginning, so I'm going to use a rustic method first."

A "single paper" is too large a conceptual unit, so we cut out more and more pages to create smaller and smaller units.
