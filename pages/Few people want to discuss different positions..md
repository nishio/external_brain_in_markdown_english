title: "Few people want to discuss different positions."
---

Consider the sentence, "Few people want to discuss different positions."

This is a mixture of two elements.
- 'Whether or not they're willing to talk to someone from a different position.'
- Whether or not they want to discuss it with others."

Write down anything that pops into your head in a messy way.
- A: Listen to people in different positions
    - I'm sure many people would find this interesting.
        - Viewer Submission
        - Experiences of people with special jobs
    - There are a rather large number of people who want to listen but don't want to talk themselves out of it.
- B: People who want you to listen to them
    - I have something I want to talk about, but I'm not usually in an environment where I can be heard.
        - There are several patterns to this as well.
    - I thought, "If you want to send out information, why don't you just write as much as you want on your blog or social networking sites?" I thought.
        - but it seems that they don't want to disseminate information, they want other people's "[[nod]]"
            - Related: [[What's missing from Broad Listening is a sense of acceptance.]]
- C: People who want to win over others
    - Self-esteem is impaired and wants to restore self-esteem by beating others up
    - When A and C are mixed, they all look like C.
