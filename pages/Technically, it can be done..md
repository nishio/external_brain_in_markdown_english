If you have a problem that a flesh-and-blood person perceives as "complex," and you wonder if you can solve it with some amazing algorithm, a computer can work many orders of magnitude faster than [[a flesh-and-blood person]] is able to do right now, so often a naive implementation is fast enough. It's often fast enough even with a simple implementation.

The problem is to clarify what it is that humans are doing and what we want them to do, and to keep the data that humans are collecting by manipulating browsers and looking with their eyes collected and up-to-date in a form that computers can collect and handle. This is by far the more difficult task.

- A naive implementation is, for example, to run 100 patterns with code that runs 200 times faster than a human, and pick the best one out of them.
