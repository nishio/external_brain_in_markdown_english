Objective correctness isn't what ensures legitimacy.

You asked me how QV works, and I answered, but it's not the objective correctness of the QV system that ensures its legitimacy, but the number of people who subjectively think QV is "better" that ensures it.
99% of those people don't even read the level of what is written in the paper.
