title: "I have to → I want to"

If you are not careful, you may inadvertently write "shall".
Do we really have to? All of them?
I have to be careful." Really? Dig deeper and you'll see that it's merely a matter of "I've got to be careful"
Sometimes "shall" is "I think it's a good thing to do, but I don't think everyone should do it."
Japanese language is prone to "[[the subject is large]]" because it is possible to make statements in which the subject is unclear.

    - [[must]]
