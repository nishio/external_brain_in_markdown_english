It refers to the idea of linking one concept, idea, or thing with another in your mind. For example, when you think of Japan, you might immediately associate it with sushi, cherry blossoms, or samurai. This is a kind of 連想. It's a common word in Japanese.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Discovering Japan/icon' alt='Discovering Japan.icon' height="19.5"/> Certainly! The Japanese word "連想" is made up of two characters: "連" and "想". Each character has its own meaning:
- [[連]] (Ren): This character often means "[[to connect]]," "[[to link]]," or "[[to join together]]." It is used in various contexts to indicate [[connection]] or [[continuity]], like in a [[chain]] or [[series]].
- [[想]] (Sō): This character generally refers to "[[thought]]s," "[[idea]]s," or "[[imagination]]." It is used in words that deal with thinking, imagining, or conceptualizing.

When combined into "連想" (Ren-Sō), the two characters collectively convey the idea of [[linking thoughts]] or ideas together. It's like how one thought leads to another in a chain of associations.
