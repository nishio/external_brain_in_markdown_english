title: "Age of Racing, Age of Games"
---

I read something about it a long time ago and remembered only the keywords "[[The Age of Racing]] and [[The Age of Games]]," but had not been able to find the source for a long time.
I vaguely remember finding a book on [[Lanchester strategy]] on my father's bookshelf, so I probably read it on my own when I was in middle school.

>  In his writings in the 1980s, [[Nobuo Taoka]], the founder of [[Lanchester Sales Strategy]], mentioned that the era of "[[Racetrack Competition]]" had already ended and the era of "[[game-type competition]]" had arrived.

>  "Racing competition" refers to competition in growing markets, as in [[period of rapid growth (especially Japan's period of rapid economic growth after WWII)]].
>  There, the order is determined as first, second, and third place.
>  The competition is to get a share of the prize money, like this: first prize: 10,000 yen, second prize: 5,000 yen, third prize: 3,000 yen, and so on.
>
>  In contrast, "game-type competition" does not determine rankings, but rather winners and losers.
>  Winners: 100,000 yen, losers: 0 yen, and so on.
>  If you don't win, you don't get a share.
>
>  In other words, "[[Hard work always pays off.]]" is "race-type competition" and "[[Hard work doesn't always pay off.]]" is "game-type competition.

- My brain was thinking "[[competition and exploration]]," but then I read it again, they're both [[competition]].
    - Not "[[competition]] or [[search]]."
        - [[Goal is clear]] Not competition.
