title: "Sense of defining work"
---

- On defining [What is work?
    - [[Definition of work]]
- As a matter of social convention, most people don't have a sense of style.
    - So I'll define it and pass it on.
    - The style of the company's business is becoming more common.
- What is this "lack of sense"?
    - I'd like to verbalize it in more detail.
- Work of poor taste
    - Claim to have made positive progress by doing something that seems to have zero value.
    - This ignores absolute quantities, the idea that if it's not zero, it's good.
    - Short-term perspective, values of others
    - Does not scale.
- Work with good taste
    - If you do this now, at this time, you can expect big changes in the future.
    - An engine of exponential growth is being built.
    - That change matches individual values.
- I get angry when I'm about to be consumed as a resource for bad taste work.
- I don't mind at all being involved in work that has good taste.
    - I'd rather be actively involved and put my resources out there.
- From the point of view of someone without sense discernment, it's hard to tell the difference.
- I don't feel like I have to assume the existence of absolute sense in this one.
    - Mr. P thinks A is a good job and B is a barren task.
    - Mr. Q thinks that A and B are equal jobs.
    - When Mr. Q tries to involve Mr. P in B, Mr. P doesn't like it.
    - From the fact that Mr. P was happy to do A, Mr. Q thought he would be happy to do B as well.
    - Well, but if Mr. P distinguishes what Mr. Q does not distinguish, then there is a "difference that Mr. P feels and Mr. Q does not feel".
        - I don't think it's strange to call this ability to sense "difference" a "sense."
- summary
    - In this case, "work sense" means "the ability to infer the value that a job will produce over the long term."
