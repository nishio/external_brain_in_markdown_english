title: "Rough technology"

> [HomeiMiyashita](https://twitter.com/HomeiMiyashita/status/1772215914714333583/history) In the world, there are people who [[imagine the future]] and [[add points]] even for [[rough]] [[technology]]. On the other hand, there are those who go out of their way to [[subtract]] by pointing out [[obvious shortcomings]] and indulge in the [[sense of superiority]]. If all mankind were only the latter, for example, the visual media would have been crushed in the era of black-and-white silence. In other words, our civilization exists today thanks to the former.

I have recently come to understand firsthand that there are certain people (or rather, people who want to do just that) who, when a [[new technology]] comes out, just look at it with a groan and say "this or that" for the rest of their life and then say "oh well...".

You don't understand anything at all, do you? And when they are told, "No, you don't understand anything at all, do you? I don't want to get involved as much as possible.

    - [[People who see the future and say it's great.]]
    - [[addition method]] / [[subtraction method]]
    - [[People who focus on the lack of]]
    - [[People who build the future]] / [[People who build the civilization]]
    - [[critic]]
