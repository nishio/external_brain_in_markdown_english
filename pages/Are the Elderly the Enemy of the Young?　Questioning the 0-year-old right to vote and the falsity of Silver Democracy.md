[Are the elderly the enemy of the young?　Questioning the 0-year-old voting right and the falsity of silver democracy：Asahi Shimbun Digital](https://www.asahi.com/articles/ASS7012TZS70UPQJ00TM.html)
> The "[[domain voting system]]" proposed by the American demographer Paul Domain and the current "[[0-year-old child voting right]]" by Governor Yoshimura assume that parents exercise the right to vote by proxy. Although this has provoked protests, as it effectively means that parents have multiple votes, it does not necessarily violate the "[[one person, one vote]]" principle, as it is only a proxy for the number of people entitled to vote. The current [[guardianship]] system, for example, does not necessarily mean that the idea of acting on behalf of the rights of others is wrong.
