title: "Decisions should be based on conflicting views"
---

> Decisions of the kind the executive has to make are not made well by acclamation. They are made well only if based on the clash of conflicting views, the dialogue between different points of view, the choice between different judgements. The first rule in decision-making is that one does not make a decision unless there is disagreement.
[[The Effective Executive]] [[Peter Drucker]]

> Those who achieve results intentionally create disagreement. By doing so, they prevent themselves from being deceived by plausible but erroneous or incomplete opinions.
