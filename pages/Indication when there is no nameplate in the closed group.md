Indication when there is no nameplate in the closed group
- What should happen when a group "folds" without a nameplate?
- Proposal to use the top leftmost sticky as a nameplate
    - If you can change the placement within a group, it is KJ-legal natural to use the top left corner as the nameplate.
- Proposal to make it a thumbnail
    - Thumbnail -> unreadable
    - Thumbnail, I was thinking of an image rendering, but maybe it could simply be a scaled-down version of the image.
- What about when folding illustrated items?
    - If you fold a set of paths, without sticky notes, it is a natural thumbnail
- Can there be more than one way to digest?
    - If you can switch after the fact.
    - The rules for which way to default need not be clear now.
    - If you try it and it doesn't feel right, just fix it.
- Thumbnail for paths only, top left for stickies only
