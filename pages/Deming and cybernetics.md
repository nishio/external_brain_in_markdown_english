    - Lessons learned from [[Deming]] = AI can become "[[infrastructure for collaboration]]" by leveraging people's [[independence]] + [[feedback]].
- Subject: In response to Morozov's criticism of AI, he argues that AI should be viewed as a "tool to support collaboration" rather than a "substitute for human capabilities.
    - As exemplars, he cites 20th century cybernetics (Licklider and Deming) and Deweyan pragmatism.
    - Specific examples:.
        - Personal Computing: "[[Human-computer symbiosis]]"
        - Internet: Packet Switching + Open Standard
        - The miracle of Japanese manufacturing (kaizen (Japanese business philosophy of continuous improvement)): [[Deming]] method
    - Crisis: The Internet and PCs are falling into the "cogs" of a centralized AI platform.
    - Countermeasure: Decentralized, participatory technologies should be extended, taking cues from the "[[collaborative digital public infrastructure]]" found in Taiwan, Japan, and India.

> “…the miracle of the Japanese kaizen method was built on Deming’s insight that empowering line workers to understand full production processes would both enable them to continuously improve quality and avoid replacing them with or transforming them into machines.”
- Key Quote: Deming achieved both quality and humanity by "letting the shop floor workers understand the whole process and entrusting them with improvements.
- Explanation: In the AI era as well, "[[continuous human-centered improvement]]" is the key, and the path to avoid simple replacement by machines.

> “Its achievements arguably owe much more to the duller work of scholar-bureaucrats like J. C. R. Licklider … and W. Edwards Deming, who moved seamlessly across business, government, and the academy—a network Morozov would surely label the ‘military-industrial complex.’”
- Key Quote: The success of cybernetics owes more to "[[humble coordinators]]" like [[Licklider]] and [[Deming]] across government, industry, and academia than to flashy revolutionaries.
- Explanation: Suggests a model in which the ideal use of the "[[military-industrial-academic]] complex" is to increase the autonomy of the private sector while laying the groundwork with public investment.

> “Deming brought participatory production to the core of the lives of millions of people in Japan…”
- Key Quote: Deming rooted "participatory production" in Japanese society.
- Commentary: A system that makes use of the voice of the field is directly related to Taiwan's digital democracy and decentralized AI design.
