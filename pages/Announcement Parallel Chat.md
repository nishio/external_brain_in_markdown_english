title: "Announcement Parallel Chat"
---

A format in which the chat exists in parallel in time when the presenter is giving a presentation.
Allow audience members to chat with you during your presentation

- The author first experienced it at a programming symposium in 2003.
    - It was on IRC.
- They're doing it at WISS too.
- Disadvantages of IRC
    - Majority of people no longer use IRC clients on a regular basis
- When [[Lingr]] appeared (circa 2006), Prosin tried to migrate from IRC to Lingr.
    - but the chat became unavailable due to a problem with the coupling from the venue to the outside network.
    - Comet, the communication technology used by Lingr, keeps a grip on HTTP requests without the server returning a response
    - Was this incompatible with the venue hotel's poor internet connection?
    - Prosin to set up an IRC chat server in the venue with RasPi.
- At Prosin in the summer of 2017, we set up a chat on Slack before the event started.
- On the other hand, the unexplored [[Boost Conference]] and [[interim camps]] have migrated to Facebook
    - Advantages
        - Presenters should be able to immediately see the log of their presentation in progress
        - Ability to add information, etc., even after the event is over.
        - Support for networking
    - treatment
        - Post the presenter and title of the presentation in advance and hang topics related to that presentation in the form of replies to it.

    - Facebook has gone downhill due to the fact that it is no longer updated in real time, making it difficult to use it in a chat-like manner.
    - > As of 2019, Facebook is being used, but issues such as the lack of automatic updates when opened from a PC have led to discussions about whether there is another way --- [[Boost Conference]].
- At the 2017 Unexplored Junior, a channel was created for each project on Slack for discussion during the presentation and communication during the project
    - The final results briefing was held on Facebook.
- Since it is against the rules to allow 11-year-old adopters to use Slack at Unexplored Junior, we tried Microsoft Teams for a year and then took the form of using [[Mattermost]].
- Scrapbox was then introduced in [2021 Unexplored Junior
    - The following year, Unexplored IT also adopted Scrapbox
    - Junior Unexplored also adopts [[reverse learning]], and the presentation videos are posted on the presentation page in advance.
        - In addition, because a Scrapbox project can be used continuously across fiscal years, this project has become a collection of [[practical knowledge]] about [[promoting projects]].
    - The Unexplored IT side is currently creating a Scrapbox project for each event.
    - [[Baton passed from ACT-I to ACT-X]]



- There was a page with similar content " [[Conference Chat]]"
    - I think the essence is not "being at the conference" but "having a chat parallel to the presentation," so let's focus on this one.
    - I copied and pasted it below.
    - Conference Chat
        - A style of conference presentation in which a chat screen is placed separately from the presenter's screen
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>was experienced at the Programming Symposium. It was already there, at least in 2002.
            - I find it very beneficial.
        - Apparently WISS started even earlier.

    - As of 2019 [[Cybozu]] has a "generic actual space" in the internal groupware [[kintone]].
        - A thread is created for each event, where the actual situation is discussed.
            - The expression [live thread
                - [[live thread]]
    - Some say it looks like a Twitter hashtag.
            - [[push through (e.g. a crowd, vegetation, etc.)]]
            - It's very detailed: [What is Tsudaaru? Word article - Niconico Encyclopedia](https://dic.nicovideo.jp/a/tsuda%E3%82%8B)
        - By having participants post about the event with a defined hashtag, the event was able to kill two birds with one stone: it functioned as a parallel chat for participants, and it also attracted [[attention]] to the event via social networks, helping to attract more visitors in the future.
            - Prosin and the Society of Young Scientists in Information Science operated a bot that relayed Twitter posts to IRC.



- There is a difference in the "style of placing a chat screen separately from the presenter's screen at conference presentations," which I had somehow taken to be common.
    - The stage where there is a chat (or Facebook group) parallel to the presentation, and the stage where it is projected next to the presenter on a projector.
    - The former step also has the advantage that "the presenter gets far more feedback than in a situation where the presenter is limited to verbal feedback.
        - Projector projection on a single channel, such as IRC, limits the "chat of interest" to a single point for participants
        - On the other hand, one of the disadvantages of a type with a thread for each announcement, such as Facebook, is that there is no single point of focus
            - At unexplored events, the operation of creating a thread in advance for each presenter & this is communicated to alumni/alumnae in advance, so as for individual presentations, it is smooth, but for irregular guest lectures, people write in the "chat" thread without realizing there is a "guest lecture" thread & while they are writing, they are not aware of the Not being aware of that division, it happens.
            - Some people continue discussing the last presentation when the next one has started.
                - This is a disadvantage for the next presenter, but may be an advantage in that it allows for deeper discussion of the previous presenter's presentation without being tied to time
