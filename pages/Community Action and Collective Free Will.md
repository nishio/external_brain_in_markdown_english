- [[Community Activities]] and [[collective free will]]

from [/nishio/🤖2023-08-11-6](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/🤖2023-08-11-6)
Are hackathons and community activities associated with collective free will?
- Of course I think so.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon' alt='/nishio/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - It's a system that uses [[attention]] and [[praise]] as [[currency]], which is different from the [[collective will]] of the [[economic system]].
