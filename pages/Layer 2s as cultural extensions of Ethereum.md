[Layer 2s as cultural extensions of Ethereum](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/05/29/l2culture.html)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The article argues that Ethereum's [[Layer 2 solution]] serves to promote the diversity of Ethereum, not only technically but also culturally.

The main points are as follows
1. there are not only technical differences in blockchains, but also cultural differences. Culture affects protocol changes, openness, quality of developers, user acquisition, [[legitimacy]], etc.
2. there are various subcultures of etherealists: crypto-punks, regenerativeists, speculators, etc.
3. layer 2 provides a place for subcultures to have resources and to operate effectively in the real world. Each Layer 2 has unique cultural characteristics in terms of user acquisition, technology development, and community building.
4. this layer 2-centric approach aims to strike a balance between diversity and cooperation. It also creates healthy competition.
5. challenges include echo chambering, convergence to a single culture, and competition in the wrong direction.
6. these challenges require ecosystem-wide efforts, including designing incentives for collaboration.

The author stresses the need to further develop these ideas in order to capitalize on Ethereum's strengths as a multidimensional ecosystem.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>According to the article, there are three main subcultures of ethereum.

1. cypherpunk ([[Cypherpunk]])
- Emphasize open source development and a DIY attitude
- Build the infrastructure and tools of Ethereum, but remain neutral on their use
- Historically [[privacy]] has been a priority, but not so much in Ethereum
- Recently, a new crypto-punk movement "[[Lunapunk]]" has emerged that emphasizes privacy

2. regenerationalist (Regens)
- Emphasis on building technology with a regenerative approach
- Rooted in Vitalik Buterin's interest in political science and social science
- Engage in [[governance experiments]] to reinvigorate, improve, and replace contemporary institutions
- Characterized by experimental nature and interest in [public goods (i.e. goods or services such as parks or highways)

3. speculator (Degens)
- Users who pursue only speculation and wealth accumulation
- To escape the framework of contemporary neoliberal capitalism, we use fads and buzz to get rich.
- Sarcastic, supercilious, and often take very big risks

Each of these groups has its own area of activity, taking advantage of Ethereum's flexibility. Crypto-punks participate in ethereum's core R&D and privacy software, regenerativeists participate in [[Gitcoin]] grant rounds and [[post-funding]] for public goods, and speculators trade meme coins, NFTs, and game.
