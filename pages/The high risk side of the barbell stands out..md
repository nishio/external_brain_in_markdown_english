title: "The high risk side of the barbell stands out."
---

- I said at the [[2024-12-26 Mystery meeting]] that "the high risk side of the [[Barbell Strategy]] is [[easier]] to observe," but I can't say that's generally the case.

- [[2024-12-26 Mystery meeting]], which is a more specific description of what we talked about elsewhere in the [[2024-12-26 Mystery meeting]].
- Talking about what you think about the company's interests with people outside the company is not in the joint interest of the company.
- Talks about thinking about the public good provide an opportunity to collaborate with people in the organization.
    - [[supermodular]] [[social production]]
- So this simply means that "activities that do not benefit the company" are more easily observed by people outside the company.

This summary is a bit oversimplified.
- In fact, "not in the interest of the company" is [[boundary indistinctness]] or [[only known after the fact]].
- I can develop this kind of logic.
    - When society is going through major changes, it's important to know how to acquire information that will be beneficial to the company."
    - "We should actively go about building private relationships with individuals, as they will become increasingly important as a channel for information inflow."
    - This is one of the tasks of the research department."
- By this logic, my personal networking with people outside the company became "action for the benefit of the company.
    - This is explicitly verbalized and communicated to my boss as of the end of 2022.
    - Two years later, it is a concrete fact [[hapun]] that Audrey Tan's book will be published by the company's publishing department, that Audrey Tan was invited to the headquarters office for an interview, that she was involved in the strategy formulation process of the capital in partnership with Mr. Yasuno, and that Ken Suzuki's commentary will be included in the book to be published by the company.
    - You predicted it, and then proved it with facts after the fact.
        - The fact of this prophecy fulfillment itself is also a corollary to the accuracy of the prophecy.
