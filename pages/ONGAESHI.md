> [@toyotaka_sakai](https://twitter.com/toyotaka_sakai/status/1621031512304123905): Finally released, a large blockchain project, ONGAESHI. It's a serious web3 project by an adult, and I've put all my skills into it. I've designed and applied for patents on some parts of it, and in the end, web3 or not, the most important thing is to create value in the real world. I am taking on this challenge with a strong team that can do so.

[[Income Share Agreement]] was talked about when the topic was discussed, but it has not been confirmed if this is an ISA or not.
