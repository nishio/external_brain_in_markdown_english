title: "Boredom and overlearning"
---

- Neural nets are often treated inhumanly, being forced to [[learn]] the same data over and over again, regardless of their intentions.
        - [[Neural Net Abuse]]
- For humans, [[boredom]] is, I'm bored, and I'm going to lower the weights.
        - Are you avoiding [[overlearning]] by [[getting tired of]]?
- Conversely, when something unfamiliar or an unexpected phenomenon occurs, interest and concentration are high [[curiosity]].
    - Automatically decrease the learning factor for data with high [[predictability]] and increase the learning factor when a different phenomenon occurs than predicted.
        - It may be related to [[acclimation]] described on p.84 and [[adaptive boosting]] described on p.88 in [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]].
