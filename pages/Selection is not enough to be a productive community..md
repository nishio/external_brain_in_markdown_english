title: "Selection is not enough to be a productive community."
---

- Having [[selection]] is not enough to be a [productive community
- Because the selection is not done in terms of "can I behave [[productively]] in this [[Community]]?"

The university's alumni community goes through a selection process called admissions.
- but it is a selection based on academic ability and other factors that determine whether or not a person is admitted to college.
- There is no selection process to make the alumni community productive.
