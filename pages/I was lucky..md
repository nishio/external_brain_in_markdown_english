title: "I was lucky."
---

There are two interpretations.

I was lucky.
- Next time it won't work so well.
- Avoid similar situations
- Hold on to what you happen to have gained so that you don't lose it.

I was lucky.
- [[I'm lucky]]
- Prefer similar situations
- Thinking, "I could get another one."
    - In contrast to "holding on to what you happen to have gained so that you don't lose it," it's "even if you let go, you can gain it again," but this is not how it really feels.
    - There are 2~3 results of acting on the thought, "I can get another one."
        - So again, we think "we can get another one" and act on it.
        - If three things increase to four, it doesn't hurt to give one away.
        - This is [[Dependence on more than one reduces dependence on one.]]

- [[fortune]]
