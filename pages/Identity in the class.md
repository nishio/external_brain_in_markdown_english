title: "Identity in the class"

> [@philosopium](https://twitter.com/philosopium/status/1649354815015899136?s=46&t=gkSZtjGEtUZPO0JCzBxCBw): An art student came to buy me a drink and said, "I realized that I don't like painting. I asked him about it in detail, and he told me that he went to art school thinking that painting was the only thing in life, but it was only because his "painting character" became his [[identity]] in the class, and that he became [[nihilistic]] when he came to a place where painting was a matter of course.

Because [[junior high and high school students]] still have a narrow [[observation range]], they tend to overestimate the weight of their class in the world as a whole, but they usually experience drastic changes when they graduate from high school and enter college.
