Seems to be a granddaughter's introduction to the log data analysis.
I'm wondering where I can get the log data.
- ruffian
    - If it's a two-person game, the genshu route is too slow.
- harbor
    - Sustained draw and purchase, strong in combo or stero
- governor
    - It's a strong card when you collect it, so you probably need to buy it to keep it from being occupied on one side.
- Border Village
    - [[joust]]
    - Reward card, what?
- European magpie (Pica pica)
    - It's a cantrip, so I don't mind having it, and I don't like it when people collect them.
    - [[Mobile Zoo: Bounty Hunter]]
    - Increase purchasing power while compressing
- silk merchant
    - Accident prevention by villagers with financial resources
        - [[Renaissance: Silk Merchants]] 4 +2 draw +1 when buying/acquiring or discarding, +1 treasure +1 villager
- Adventure: Farmer
    - Two-person games tend to be long games because it's hard to end up with a dead genus state, and when that happens, the teacher's token effect is significant.
- Adventure: Knight Apprentice
    - Champion action infinite attack disabled
    - Warrior's [[Handes.]] is also disgusting.
