> [@tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1570320953758089216): [[factorio]], because after 3000 hours of work, they will produce the very best in [[production control]], I feel like we should just let them do it until they get bored.

> [@yskmerlion](https://twitter.com/yskmerlion/status/1570331142930444288): @tokoroten factorio and [[overcooked]] should be mandatory,!

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1570638931515035650?s=21&t=dDnBm_U2ClhBaRvyhytVyg): there are three types of people in the world: those who enjoy Factorio and complete it ( The type of people the original tweet called excellent people), people who can't play Factorio for 3000 hours because they don't enjoy it, and people who can't clear Factorio because they can't have fun "[[toil]]" on it and meet the exponentially increasing demand.

- I'll add an additional point since some people may not understand what I mean.
    - Overcooked is a game where many tasks come in parallel and humans work hard to handle them.
    - Factorio is a game about creating industrial processes and automated production.
        - We need to get our heads in the right place to increase the size and efficiency of our factories to meet the exponentially growing demand.
            - Games that [reproduction on an enlarged or expanded scale
    - tokoroten is on the side of being smart and subconsciously assuming that everyone who plays Factorio
        - So I figure 3,000 hours of playtime will make me a good candidate.
        - I'm of the opinion that there are a rather large percentage of people who do work they don't have to do or waste resources.
            - They upgrade conveyor belts that are not bottlenecks, try to keep production equipment running all the time, and carry unnecessary inventory.
                    - [[Drum Buffer Rope]]
                    - [[constraint theory]]
                - [[Incompetent hard worker]]
        - He thinks he is using his head
            - By not using our brains for higher-order design, we just get into trouble more often and are forced to deal with that whack-a-mole type of situation.
            - So I can't judge by whether it's fun or not or whether I enjoy it or not.
            - So we'll see if it's clear or not.
