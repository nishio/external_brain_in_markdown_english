> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1923905817302139045) Some people misunderstand me as if I am promoting Mr. Anno's Team Mirai, but I am a "[[Plurality box-pusher]]" and I support Plurality's development. I told them that I support the development of Plurality, and I will support other parties if they develop Plurality, but so far, Team Mirai has contributed the largest amount by far.
