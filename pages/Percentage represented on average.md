title: "Percentage represented on average"
---

When you have a percentage represented by an average, some people can't figure it out and it bugs them.

- For example, if the choice is 0 or 1, the average of the answers and the "percentage of those who are 1" are equal.

Examples of Bugs
- If the mean is p
    - My case is bigger than p."
        - You don't understand that we're talking about percentages, not "all people are p



- [[human bug]]
