title: "Koban Jizo"
---

Physically speaking, it's about a man who brought gold coins to walk a steep mountain trail and died of exhaustion.
Spiritually speaking, the story goes that on the path of rigorous practice toward [[the Paradise]], wealth does not satisfy hunger, but becomes a burden that prevents one from moving on and ultimately [[one dies before achieving one's goal]].
- [Wealth does not satisfy hunger.

> This Koban Jizo was dedicated to the memory of a pilgrim who collapsed here with a koban in his mouth due to hunger and fatigue. The name "Doyu Zenjikumon" is carved on the jizo, indicating that the deceased was from Arima County in Bungo Province (Oita Prefecture). He died on July 18, 1854 (Kaei 7), probably on his way to Kimiidera after visiting Ise and Kumano.

I only took a picture of the sign.

A member who saw this got into a conversation about whether [[(the) market (as a concept)]].
We usually live in a situation where "[[there is]] a market.
    - To use [[Yukito Emaya's]] own words, he lives his life in such a way that [[exchange style C]] is overwhelming.
- That's why I believe in the magical power "[[currency's]] purchasing power" that accompanies exchange style C.
    - [[You can't buy what you can't distribute.]]


- [[Toganoki Teahouse, Prince Tsugakura]]
- They offered us cold barley tea at no charge.
- Under the conception of [[Exchange Form C]], "Since it was given to me free of charge, no particular payment is necessary," but under the conception of reciprocity of [[Exchange Form A]], "Since I received it, I should return it to you in compensation.
    - C's idea is that "the method of payment should be provided in advance by the giver."
    - A's idea is that "the method of payment should be presented after the fact by the one who received it."
