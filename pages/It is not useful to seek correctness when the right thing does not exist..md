It is not [[useful]] to ask for [[correctness]] when the right thing does not exist.

We tend to think of the "act of seeking what is right" as implicitly "a good thing."
- But is there a "right one"?
- It is a waste of effort and unhelpful to seek rightness in a situation where there is no rightness.
