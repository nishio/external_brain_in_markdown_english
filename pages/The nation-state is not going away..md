>  >[[The nation-state]] will not disappear while I'm alive.
>  ・ "[[Velvety]] technology" will not be accepted by the masses, but it will not disappear either.
>  ・What you really want to do is not "this side" but "that side" [[effective altruism]] /[[Fabian strategy]] is right for you.
>  ・Even if there is a dead body on "the other side", that doesn't have to be a reason to stop the exposition.
>  ・We must carefully select what to put in "this side" in the short term so that "that side" will be enriched in the long term as a result.
>  ・It is clearer to [[gemeinschaft]] if [[the inside and outside of the membrane is explicit]], but [[society]] likes it better if [[the boundaries of the membrane are vague]]. Personally, I don't care either way as long as it is used.
