Words uttered by association feel shallow.

        - [[Cases that do not require knowledge building]]

        - [[a]] [[grounded]] [[pyramid]] and from there [[a lightly spread net]].

- concept
    - Associative Networks
        - Connected to a number of things.
        - There are many [[sides]].

        - A person P, to whom a concept X is connected to many concepts, asks "What is X?" and then discards and shapes the surrounding elements according to the implicit "current context".
        - However, person Q, whose concept X is connected to only one concept, C, quickly responds to the question, "What is X?" is quickly answered, "C!" is "C!
        - R, who X is not connected to anything, feels "intelligent" when he sees Q's statement.
            - Because they quickly present "connections" we didn't know existed.
        - On the other hand, from P's point of view, Q appears "shallow"
            - P also knows the "X and C connection" because
            - P can see that Q is simply remembering the combination of X and C that he experienced in the past and saying it out loud without thinking about it.
            - It appears to be just a [[vector search]] engine, not a thinking one.
