[AI generates about 30% of Microsoft's new source code, Nadella reveals | TECH+ (Tech Plus)](https://news.mynavi.jp/techplus/article/20250507-3271749/)

> [kis](https://x.com/kis/status/1920172008350101726) "While new code generation is at a fairly practical level, it has not yet been effective enough to rewrite existing code."
>  I guess this is the place.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1920293410591621232) I guess startups are taking on companies with existing software assets, accelerated by AI.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1920307174154158325) Wait, is it stronger for companies with existing software assets to create AI-accelerated peripheral services that connect to them?

> [JP_sansan](https://x.com/JP_sansan/status/1920389909866582408) software assets, a while ago we were discussing how the moment you write code, it becomes a liability, so I'm not sure if that's really an asset.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1920393232174694680) It's possible that software assets will be mainly "knowledge gained from operating the software" instead of "source code".
> [ringo](https://x.com/ringo/status/1920395812611268940) I wonder if the data obtained from operating the software is included in the assets in this case.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1920396709307511072) Many people think it's an asset, but in reality it's like "red soil with aluminum in it" and it's not useful unless it goes through a process to extract something useful, like I guess.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1920397909461512561) And whether the cost of extracting something useful is more or less than the benefit gained depends on the situation.
