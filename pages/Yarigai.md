Here's an explanation for those unfamiliar with Japanese culture:

- Sense of Fulfillment: Yarigai refers to the feeling of fulfillment or satisfaction one gets from doing something. It's about the intrinsic reward or sense of accomplishment that comes from engaging in a task or activity.

- Motivation in Work: In the context of the workplace, yarigai is often used to describe the rewarding feeling employees get from their work. It could be due to various factors like the challenge it presents, the impact or contribution to society or the organization, personal growth, or the pleasure of mastering a skill.

- Personal and Professional Development: Yarigai is closely linked with personal growth and development. Activities or jobs with high yarigai are those that not only provide a sense of accomplishment but also contribute to an individual's growth and skill development.

- Cultural Significance: In Japanese culture, where dedication and commitment to one's work or duties are highly valued, yarigai plays a significant role. It's a concept that emphasizes finding personal meaning and satisfaction in one's work or tasks.

- Balance with Other Aspects of Life: While yarigai is often associated with professional life, it's not limited to it. Japanese culture also values finding yarigai in various aspects of life, including hobbies, volunteering, and family responsibilities.

- Contrast with External Rewards: Unlike external rewards like salary or status, yarigai is more about the internal satisfaction and motivation that comes from the activity itself.

In summary, yarigai is a term that captures the essence of what makes an activity or job worthwhile and fulfilling from an intrinsic perspective. It's a key concept in understanding what drives motivation and satisfaction in Japanese culture, both in professional and personal contexts.
