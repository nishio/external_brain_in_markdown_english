A: To me this is important!
OTHERS: Oh yeah, that's important to you.
- [[so what]]

Even if you claim that it is important in your [[values]], it is an act of ignoring the way others feel in their values, so it will be ignored by others as well.
- Mr. A is unaware that other people have things that are equally important to them, and he thinks that other people should respect X that he considers important.
- By that very same logic, others do not respect Mr. A's emphasis on X
- Rare is the person who is open-minded enough to focus on what the person who ignores what you focus on focuses on.

- [[boomerang-like structure]]
