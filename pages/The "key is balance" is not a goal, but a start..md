Suppose you have two options, A and B, and you are wondering which is better.
This is [[choosing the wrong two options]], where neither A nor B is a better possibility.

The idea that "the key is balance" is a step forward from assuming there are only two options, but it's not the goal.
- Is it possible to achieve balance?
- How do we know the proper balance?

- In [[Resolution Stage]], the first step is where the choice changes from two options to [[The Third Option]].

Implicit in "balancing" is the assumption of [[trade-off between two attributes]].

The point is balance.
- [[balance]]
