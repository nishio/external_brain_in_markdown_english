title: "Birds and carts"
---

- [[Birds]] can fly high, have a [[wide viewpoint]], and move [quickly
[[carts]] have a narrow view, [[late (e.g., "late at night")]], but it is the carts that [[carry many loads]], not the birds

Birds: [[abstract thought]].
- [[Abstract]]
- [[Abstract concepts have a wide coupling range]].
    - High [[abstraction]] is related to a wide range
    - Good at [[seeing]], [[understanding]], [[knowing where to go]], [recognizing threats ahead
- Heavy lifting is not my forte.
    - Moving large numbers of people is not my forte.
    - Changing systems involving large numbers of people is not my forte.

Birds not only have to fly in the sky, they have to come down to the cart and show the driver the way.
