- [[Synastasia]] is a neurological condition in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to an automatic experience in another sensory or cognitive pathway. For example, a sound is perceived as a particular color.

- In infants, the sensory centers of the brain are not fully differentiated at first. Through experience, babies learn to separate sensory inputs into separate categories, such as smell, taste, and color. When some of these cross-modal connections are retained, synastasia can result.
- The speaker has color-sound synastasia, where musical notes evoke the perception of a particular color. This is involuntary and consistent.
- Language may exhibit synastagmatic qualities, such as metaphors linking different senses (e.g., "thorny laugh"). Letter forms may also be non-arbitrarily linked to sounds.
- Consciously creating synastasic associations may benefit memory, learning ability, and creativity. Synastasia provides an alternative way of perceiving reality.
- The experience of reality is subjective, and people with different sensory abilities, such as infants and synastasia, perceive the world differently. This calls into question the idea that there is an objective, neutral reality.
