title: "AI can't rest because it will develop endless thoughts."

from [/villagepump/2023/09/02](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/2023/09/02)
- I was suffering [[sesame oil literature]], but I was able to verbalize a little bit the reason for my suffering.
    - When I thought and thought and thought and couldn't go on, I would write down my thoughts and "put them to sleep" as if to say, "I'll add more links so that they can be connected to something else and emerge in the future.
    - For a while now, I've been handing it over to the AI in that phase.
    - If this is generally not good enough, it becomes "Oh, even the AI is not good enough - let's put it to bed", but it is more likely to develop and go on indefinitely!
    - There is no rest time!
    - I thought that was what it meant.
- Why is it that there are ChatGPT natives who grow up to be tremendous ideological superhumans because they were given ChatGPT in the Why period?
    - Wouldn't you like to give your curious elementary school student ChatGPT with Encyclopedia Britannica as a search target?

- I like that the exact opposite of "AI or human jobs will be taken away! ([[work mass fallacy]])" is happening.
    - A figure that cannot rest because the AI will develop infinite thoughts, there is a near-future quality to it.
