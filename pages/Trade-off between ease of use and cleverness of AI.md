Trade-off between ease of use and cleverness of AI

- Things that are hard to use tend to be smart. It is human policy constraints that create the difficulty of use.
- There are players with and without policy constraints, and the more constrained means are used because they are better. Sometimes, as a result of optimization within the constraints, a lesser performing one is chosen, but sometimes it is sufficient.
- There are paid-for barriers, external cloud service use policy barriers, border barriers, and risk avoidance barriers.
- When policy constraints result in poor performance using inferior systems, there can be a perception gap between the technology side and the demand side.
- It would be a good idea to aim to lift policy constraints by avoiding them, achieving high performance, and visualizing the possibilities in the absence of constraints.
