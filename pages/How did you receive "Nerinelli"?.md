title: 'How did you receive "Nerinelli"?'

The note in my hand said "AI Ideathon [[kozaneba]] -> [[nerineri]]".

- [[AI Dejima]]
- [/omoikane/AI Dejima](https://scrapbox.io/omoikane/AI Dejima) 8/4
    - > The new AI he developed, Sirius, has unprecedented capabilities. If Sirius was allowed to access [[all of the company's information]], it was expected to be able to [[improve operational efficiency]], [[discover new business opportunities]], and [[solve unexpected problems]] through its analytical capabilities.
    - > However, Kazuya's boss, Ito, expressed great concern about allowing Sirius access to all the information. There are "[[privacy violations]], improper use of data, and even [[security risks]]," he said.
- Ultimately, I think it would be beneficial to allow AI access to all data, but at least for the time being, most clients would say it's "risky."
- If that happens, use cases in the form of humans exporting some data from groupware and explicitly giving it to AI will come first.
- That "AI given data" will twist the data.
    - Another way to describe it might be "[[creating]] new knowledge that fits the current context."
        - [[context]] is important
