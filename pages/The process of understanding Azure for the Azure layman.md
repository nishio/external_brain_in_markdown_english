title: "The process of understanding Azure for the Azure layman"

- First, let the raw experience sink in.
    - Sometimes we don't have time to think about anything else at this time.
    - Over time, the [[repeated patterns]] and overlaps [[with past experiences]] in the experience [[become]] clauses and [[parts of thoughts]].
        - see  [[Story intersections become atoms.]]
    - Whether it's [[AI-generated procedures]] or [[tutorial]], it's the same there.
- AI-generated procedures were too complex to complete.
    - So we delete the environment and do a new, simpler procedure.
    - More time to think about it because it was done once.
- We do the same thing with slightly different procedures so you can see the difference.
    - I thought it would be easier to have Azure Container Registry.

Before AI, I probably would have had to find a tutorial in the official documentation and go through that.


[[AI generates procedures]].
- [[AI generates TODOs]].
