[Criticism of the criticism that "Bitcoin is a joint illusion

> [BitcoinRevo0](https://x.com/BitcoinRevo0/status/1828575535909556362) [[bitcoin]] is a joint illusion, sure, but everything that exists in the world in the first place is a joint illusion, including a single chopstick, so that ultimately says nothing. That's not saying much, is it?

>  As for Bitcoin, it is strong because it is the [[universal language]] of logic and mathematics.

Even the dollar has no backing other than the full faith and credit of the US. Even gold is nothing more than a rock without the illusion of community.
