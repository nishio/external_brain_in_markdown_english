[Evidence for a competitive relationship between executive functions and statistical learning | npj Science of Learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41539-024-00243-9)
In this paper, we investigated the relationship between potential statistical learning as measured by the Alternating Serial Reaction Time (ASRT) task and executive function as measured by multiple neuropsychological tests in two independent experiments (NStudy1 = 186, NStudy2 = 157) . The main results are as follows.
1. both studies found modest but consistent negative correlations between potential statistical learning and most executive function measures.
2. factor analysis results indicate that factors representing [[verbal fluency]] and [[complex working memory]] appear to be the driving force behind these negative correlations.
3. meta-analysis results showed a significant negative relationship between common executive functioning ability and potential statistical learning across the two studies.

Thus, the antagonistic relationship between potential statistical learning and executive function may be specifically mediated by the updating component of executive function and access to long-term memory. This study suggests the importance of exploring relationships between cognitive functions in large samples.
