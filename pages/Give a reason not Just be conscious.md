title: "Give a reason not Just be conscious"
---

2018-04-01
- There was a reference to [[Give a reason]] in the comments in response to the [duplicate article](https://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m001358.html), but I felt it was more of a [[Just be conscious]].
- Why Just be conscious instead of Give a reason?
- The lyrics are written by the same person, so from a distance they are very similar, but I'll try to verbalize why one of them feels different from the other.
    - (PS) but the lyrics were different to begin with.
        - Give a reason(G): [lyrics](https://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/248598/lyrics/I072281/) Lyrics [[Satomi Arimori]]
        - Just be conscious(J): [lyrics](https://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/254338/lyrics/I011247/) lyrics [[MEGUMI]]

- > (G) [[I'm sure there's an "answer" somewhere, an answer that was born]]
- >  We all want it, and we all go for the dream that we can't resist.
    - This is where I first feel uncomfortable.
        - The concept that the "answer" is "somewhere" and you seek it assumes that the answer is somewhere far away, not you. This is where it doesn't feel right.
                - [[The answer is not outside of yourself.]]
- > (J) [[Happiness comes in different forms.]], [[Don't let other people's words deceive you]].
- > I don't need patronizing hypocrisy.
- This one fits better. I agree with what follows, "[[Since we are living in the present moment, we should do what we like and enjoy]]," and I don't want others to decide that this "[[what we like and enjoy]]" is "going to a dream in search of an answer that is somewhere far away.

- On the side of Give a reason, I sense a desire to get out of [[oppression]] and a [[sense of anxiety]] about the possibility that my future self has not found the "answer".
    - > (G) [[as if struggling to get out, I wanted to try this power]]
    - > (G) [[I don't want to regret doing nothing]].
    - > (G) [[Give a reason for life to my future self, I want to deliver it]]
- I'm in a state of [[running on impatience]] of having to find answers, which is also [[driven by]] other people's values.
    - Trying to get out of oppression itself is already in [[the composition of]] oppression.

- Give a reason is "[[keep running]]" while Just be conscious is "[[feel a chance]]" # luck to get out of oppression.
    - > [[Blaming others won't change things]] [[Luck, chance, coincidence, and timing, sharpen your mind and feel]]

- The notion that "I have to keep running" creates oppression and frustration.
- If you're in a hurry and running in the dark, you don't have time to [[sharpen your mind]].
- You can't find the answer by running around looking for "the answer somewhere else," because "the answer is inside of you.
    - #The Blue Bird of Maeterlinck
        - [[The real answer within you.]]
- Silence, tranquility, interlude, need time to stop and [introspection
    - "[[Music is]] the silence between sounds." #Music is the silence between sounds

    - By the way, consider the consistency of "[After walking so crazy, so hard, so empty, a clear road map will appear in your heart alone.
    - With no signposts in sight, it's hard to know which way to go.
        - Standing still at this time won't change anything.
        - So we need to "walk on empty".
    - Signposts come to mind as a result of walking, and these come to mind "in your mind alone".
        - The signposts are not outside, they are inside you.
        - I think we need some time for quiet reflection after all the walking around.
        - If you keep running after frustration, you won't notice the signposts in your mind
        - [[Sharpen your mind and feel...]]
- > (J) [[People become stronger and kinder every time they know a wound]] [[Truth after tears]] [[Living in the now that is irreplaceable]]
- >  [[I want to like myself tomorrow, so I hug myself today]].
- >  [[It's a waste if you don't at least enjoy your life (drama) in which you are the main character.]]
- It's not a good idea to whip yourself into running today.
- There's no drama that keeps the hero running all the time.
- The most important thing is that the protagonist enjoys performing.

- By the way, the title "Just be conscious" has a focus on "[[notice]]" and "[[notice]]".
- Lyrics about noticing are here.
- > (J) [[same suffering over and over again, labyrinth all the way until you realize it]]
- And, by realizing it, you get out of it. So what do we do to get out of it?
- > (J) [[listen carefully and find out that there is always a way out]]
- "Listen carefully" is a refrain from "sharpen your mind."
    - > (J) Blocked up in oppression, blaming others won't change luck, chance, coincidence, and timing [[sharpen your mind and feel]].
- This is where you should notice the most.

- Sharpen your mind and what follows when you sense an opportunity.
    - > (J)  [[Grab that dream in both hands, now, and take off your unnecessary pride.]]
    - > (J) [[Run, don't look back, time is ticking prologue]]
    - [[Programming in Logic]] is the introduction to the story. In other words, it is from there that "[[my life]] (drama) in which I am the main character" (drama) begins to flourish.
- Run after you find an opportunity, don't run from the beginning, "[[listen]] first to find an opportunity."
