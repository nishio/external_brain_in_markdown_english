- 1: Recognize one thing A as very different from other things.
    - I'm curious, so I'll focus on A and think about it.
- 2: Notice that there were things B-D similar to A
- 3: Notice that B-D have a common yet unspoken attribute
    - I think you're being too abstract here, so I'll add some specifics: A to D are "people," and B to D are, dare I use the word, "smart people."
    - But I guess the word "smart" is still a [[low-resolution word]] because not all "smart people" fall into this group!
    - In other words, focusing on this group helps flesh out the concept of "smart."

- Initially, A is perceived as very unique.
- But then we recognize something called B-D, which has similar attributes to A.
- We find that there are common attributes and characteristics in B-D that cannot be described in general terms at this time.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Thurston's category theory:
- Thurston provided a discussion on how to categorize things. His ideas are also related to "prototype theory," which proposed that categories of things are built around a central example (prototype).

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>We apologize, but in our previous response the information regarding the philosopher named "Thurston" was incorrect. In fact, there is no philosopher named "Thurston". I apologize for the error contained in my response.
- However, as for the "[[prototype theory]]" mentioned, it is recognized as part of the actual [[epistemology]] that exists. Prototype theory was proposed by psychologists such as [[Eleanor]] Roche. This theory incorporates the idea that when we divide things into categories, we do so on the basis of certain representative examples, or "[[prototypes]]."
- For example, when considering the category of "birds," many may think of small, flapping creatures such as "robins. However, "penguins" and "ostriches" are also included in the bird category, but they have different characteristics than the common "bird" prototype.
- Thus, prototype theory offers insight into the psychological processes by which we form categories of things and the "[[centrality]]" and "[[peripherality]]" of the members within a category.
