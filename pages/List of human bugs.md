- As part of the collection of [human bug
- I was going to refer you to [[List of Fallacies]], but first a few tidbits.
- The bug that when given a long list, thinks that's all there is.
- The bug that makes you think that when you and others use the same word, they mean exactly the same thing as you do.
- Bugs that make you think you are thinking normally.
