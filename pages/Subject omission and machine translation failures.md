title: "Subject omission and machine translation failures"
---

I was about to mention [/nishio-en/Manazuru 2023-05-13#655683ccaff09e0000f415f7](https://scrapbox.io/nishio-en/Manazuru 2023-05-13#655683ccaff09e0000f415f7) and noticed the translation `He's wearing a [Nishikigoi NFT] T-shirt!` The indicative pronoun of Audrey is She, which is not good.

I checked the original Japanese and found this: `[Nishikigoi NFT] is wearing a T-shirt! `
The translation is: `Wearing a [Nishikigoi NFT] T-shirt!`]
In other words, the original Japanese does not contain information on the gender of the genitive in the first place.

[[subject omitted]].
- In Japanese, the subject is often omitted. Therefore, the need to distinguish between he and she in this situation does not arise. This is not a mistranslation, but rather a mistaken assumption by the translation AI, which was asked to compensate for the non-existent gender information, that the translator was male.
- [[Japanese subject omitted]]

[[indicative pronoun to distinguish gender]].
- In Japanese, there are "he" and "she," but there are also words that do not specify gender, such as "that person" and "that one.
- I hear that even in English-speaking countries, there are cases where the Japanese-derived -san is used because they do not like the distinction between Mr. and Mrs.
