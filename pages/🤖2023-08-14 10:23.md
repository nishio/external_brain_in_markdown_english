Clarifying the rules of human-AI interaction through the use of online platforms has the potential to gather diverse perspectives and feedback and generate new ideas; AI serves to "converge" human discussions and thought processes, and visualizing these processes deepens understanding of the issues. Facilitate discussions using methods such as the KJ method to deepen the interaction between humans and AI. In addition, the tool Kozaneba will be used to fragment information and relate it from multiple perspectives to create new structures. This will deepen the organization and interpretation of information and contribute to the creation of meaning. Furthermore, we will use a learning method called Spaced Repetition to organize information along a time axis.
