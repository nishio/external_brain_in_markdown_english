prisoner's dilemma
The concept seems obvious when expressed in the way that each individual is trying to maximize a different objective function, "self-interest," and under the condition that the behavior of others cannot be controlled, there are times when the overall optimal solution does not fall into place, but for some reason, the concept was greeted with surprise.

I'm more interested in how to tell if someone is behaving [[reciprocally]], or how to ban [[selfish]] people efficiently from a utilitarian point of view.

Communities with high barriers to entry, [[gated community]].

[[Prisoner's dilemma and community observer]].
- The "[[Recommendations for Improving Productivity through Community]]" are related to the "Prisoner's Dilemma" and "[[How to]] distinguish between those who act reciprocally and those who are selfish," in the notes.
    - This is an example of a prisoner's dilemma, as it shows that behavior that seeks to maximize one's own profit can reduce the productivity of the community as a whole.
- "[[Destroying the Prisoner's Dilemma by placing an observer]]" is proposed as a solution to the prisoner's dilemma and is related to "[[how to]] efficiently eliminate selfish people."

### Summary of notes
.
The prisoner's dilemma is a concept that can lead to a less-than-total-optimal solution when each individual tries to maximize his or her own gain. There is practical interest in how to distinguish between those who act reciprocally and those who are self-interested, and how to efficiently eliminate those who are self-interested. Gated communities, communities with high barriers to entry, are also discussed.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The fragment "Recommendations for Increasing Productivity through Community" is related to the note "Prisoner's Dilemma" and "How to Distinguish Between Those Who Act Reciprocally and Those Who Are Selfish." Fragment shows how behavior that seeks to maximize one's own interests can reduce the productivity of the community as a whole, which is an example of the prisoner's dilemma. The "Breaking the Prisoner's Dilemma by Placing an Observer" is also proposed as a solution to the Prisoner's Dilemma and is related to the note "How to Effectively Eliminate Selfish People".

### summary of thoughts and title
.
The prisoner's dilemma indicates that the pursuit of individual interests may interfere with the optimal solution for the whole, and the introduction of community observers is an effective solution to this problem. This serves as a way to distinguish between those who act in a mutually beneficial manner and those who are selfish, and efficiently eliminate the latter.
