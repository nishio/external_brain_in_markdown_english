title: "Möbius function"
---

There are three ways in which they are often mentioned

- [[classical Möbius function]]
- $\displaystyle \mu (n)=\left\{ \begin{array}{l}(-1)^k & (product of k distinct primes where n is k)\\0 &(otherwize)\end{array}\right.$
- When n=1, it is the "product of 0 distinct primes", so it is 1
- When n=4, it is not a "product of different prime numbers", so it is 0

The "[[bias relation]]" ($a \prec b, a | b$) in which a divides b is [[semi-sequential (e.g. equations)]].
The abstraction that we focus on here is [[adjacent algebra]].
The adjoint algebra [[zeta function]] is a function such that ζ(a,b) = 1 for all nonempty intervals $[a, b$], and the Mobius function is the multiplicative inverse of the zeta function.

With a concrete example of this adjacency algebra,
- 1: A whole positive integer with integer-divisibility relations
    - → attributed to classical Möbius function
- 2: The set ([[power set]]) formed by the entire subset of a finite set with inclusion relations
    - → Möbius function defined by the difference in set size
        - [[principle of inclusion]] leads to
- 3: Entering a greater-than or less-than relationship for the whole set of natural numbers
    - →0,0,…,0,-1,1
    - The zeta function corresponds to the cumulative sum, and the Möbius function corresponds to its inverse. [[difference operator]].

[[fast zeta transformation]] in [[Sum over Subsets]] is 2, and the approximate version of the fast zeta transformation O(N log(log(N))) - noshi91's note [https://noshi91.hatenablog.com/entry/2018/12/](https://noshi91.hatenablog.com/entry/2018/12/) 27/121649] is 1
