Neri Neri's value is slowly decreasing.
I've been feeling it for a while now.
- [Slowly decreasing in value by [[omni]].
- Why is that?

- 1: I put a certain query Q1
- 2: omni says "A or B or C is related to
    - I said, "I see! I hadn't thought of that idea! That's interesting!" And I'm like.
- 3: A lot of thoughts develop with that omni stimulus.
    - A new D is being created.
- 4: I put query Q2 in relation to that D
- 5: omni "relates" to my recent C1, B1, and D
    - I'd be like, "I know..."

People are too slow on their feet.
- The speed of development of human thought is slow compared to the power of vector search leaps.
- [[Grass is dying]]
        - The parable of [nomadism
    - [[all the grass has been eaten]]
        - [[movement]] I have to do it.

When I first created omni-private, I tried a little and immediately removed my own origin fragments from the search.
- That's because I expected to get hits on fragments originating from other people, but all I got were hits on [[fragments originating from myself]].
- Why it happens is because your writing looks like your writing.
    - Many people interpret vector search as a search by meaning, but in reality, it is a vector that involves not only meaning but also style and other factors.
    - Side note: [[Vector searches do not always hit other languages with the same meaning]].
Then I started including self-derived fragments for experimentation.
    - New findings made in [Experiments to find relationships
    - > [[Bringing insight or dissenting view through Therapeutic Uses from people's as yet unarticulated Inner Experiences, which approaches more responsive governance]].
    - When I search with this, I get almost no hits on my text.
    - Fragments hit from my Scrapbox are also "scraps of other people's statements."
    - [[where it has not yet been trampled]].
- The ratio of self and other fragments in the search results may give you an idea of the amount of grass.

2023-10-22 [[omni spec bug]].
- I noticed a spec bug regarding [[Iterative Commenter]] in public.
    - [[Update Interval of AI Notes]] Change title from "🔁" to "🌀" so that it comes up now and then.
- However, the title has been changed and those pages have been hit in searches.
    - Maybe so. I haven't checked properly yet.
    - That's the story that bothered me when I made Scrapbox a search index in the first place.
        - The specification is to leave it as "useful because it provides a clue to find the renamed one, even if it's a hit."
- It's not a good idea to have all the slightly different output generated by the AI as a search target.
    - Because the current search is structured as "N cases from the one with the highest vector similarity", when such content is hit, the search results are filled up.
        - As a result, similar content is generated again.
        - This is one of those hammy modes caused by a flaw in the specs.
- Older implementations would collapse update time data on import to Scrapbox, resulting in full telomere updates.
    - Similarly, the updater information for each line has been filled in.
    - After all, was it necessary here to let the AI use users who are not me in the flesh, and to handle them differently?
        - The "when a ningen comments in AI-generated content, it's useful" story should also have done a better job of detecting and cutting it out
