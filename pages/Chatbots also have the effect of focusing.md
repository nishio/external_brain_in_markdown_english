title: "Chatbots also have the effect of focusing"
---

summary
- Chatting for 25 minutes has the effect of keeping you focused on one subject for 25 minutes.
- This is similar to dialogue, but unlike voice, which disappears, a log is kept and can be read back and searched.
- Human intelligence is strengthened by new "means of deepening thinking"

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I thought that chatbots had the effect of shaking up the perspectives of people with fixed viewpoints, and encouraging them to become aware of things, but I've also realized that they can help people who are restless with various things to focus on one thing, and I'd like to develop this a little more.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Ask digging questions in response to some of what you wrote earlier.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that "question"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>When people ask questions, that's where their attention goes.

- What does this "question" seem to be?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's like a spotlight or an indicator, drawing attention to it.

- >  Ask digging questions in response to some of what I wrote earlier.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Coming out of the chatbot

- >  Ask digging questions in response to some of what I wrote earlier.
- Where is this "question" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Always just above the input field.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "input field" is that "input field"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's in the middle of the screen, and the human gazes there, looking at the question just above and thinking about the answer.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>How do you know what the "question" is?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>See displayed
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "appears" is that "appears"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>At least in the current system, it is presented to the user in text, not voice. Even in voice conversations, people focus on "what the other person said just before", and that's what happens because sound naturally disappears.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "human being" is this "human being"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Deepen your thinking through such dialogues. Another way is to deepen thinking by arranging fragments like Regroup and moving them around. Dialogues have been used for a long time because [[a flesh-and-blood person]] could also engage in them.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about this "human being"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>By using new means to deepen our thinking, we can reach a boundary that we could not reach before. First there was spoken dialogue, and then the invention of the written word gave birth to time-unsynchronized communication via text. The Internet has reduced the cost of text distribution, shortened release lead times, and made it possible for non-humans to "remember" through search.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Ultimately, I would like to see human civilization advance to the next stage, but even if I invent a great methodology, it will take time for it to spread throughout the human race, so I would like to use a so-so methodology myself first to strengthen my own intellect. I feel the value of a method that I feel is strengthening my intelligence, and that is Scrapbox, Keicho, and KJ legal methodology (Regroup as a tool).
