### Summary
.
Diary 2023-09-03 and the ability to read oracles and the note that abstract concepts have a wide range of applications suggest that abstract information may be more useful than concrete facts. Abstract concepts can be used in a wide variety of situations because of their wide range of application.

### Relevance
.
Some of Nishio's research notes, "The Intellectual Production of Engineers: A Reaction Summary," "How Can Abstraction Skills Be Taught?" and "Concrete and Abstract," are closely related to my notes. These emphasize the importance of abstract concepts and their wide range of applications. In addition, "How Can Abstraction Skills Be Taught?" provides insight into how to acquire abstraction skills.

### deep thinking
Abstract concepts can be used in a wide variety of situations because of their wide range of applications. However, their understanding and acquisition are not easy. This is because abstract concepts are difficult to understand unless they are based on concrete examples and experiences. Therefore, in order to learn abstract concepts effectively, it is important to relate them to concrete experiences and examples.

### summary of thoughts
'The understanding and application of abstract concepts depends on their relevance to concrete experience.'

### Title
.
"Understanding and applying abstract concepts: their relevance to concrete experience."
