Maybe if I don't write it down at least once a week, I'll have a lot of garbage in my head.

When party A is active 3 times, party B is active 1 time, and party C is active 0 times with respect to a characteristic X, the entity that wants to mention characteristic X will of course mention party A 3 times and not party C
- Does this lack [[party independence]]?
- Is equality a constant number or a constant coefficient?
- It's not right to set the number of mentions to zero to match party C.
        - [[misconceived equality]]
- Given [[independence]] in the mathematical sense, the parties and property X are not independent in the first place.
    - If you put it that way, there are few things in the world that are independent.
