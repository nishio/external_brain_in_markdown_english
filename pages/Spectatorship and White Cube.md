**"Spectatorship" and "White Cube "** are important concepts surrounding the way art is viewed, primarily in museums and galleries. They provide a framework for thinking about art exhibition formats, the position of the spectator, and how these affect the art experience.

Below is an explanation of the meaning of each and how they relate to each other.

What is Spectatorship?
Spectatorship is a concept that refers to the role of the spectator in art appreciation and the relationship between art and spectator.

(1) Viewer's position
- The spectator, as the "viewer" of an artwork, plays an important role in the distance and relationship with the artwork.
- Spectatorship poses the following questions
    - Are viewers just passively looking at art?
    - Or are they active participants in the art experience and meaning makers?

(2) Main features
- Passivity and active:.
    - In traditional art appreciation, the viewer has tended to be considered a passive entity.
    - Contemporary art and installations often require the viewer to be actively involved in the work.
- Distance
    - How close can the viewer get physically and mentally to the work?
    - This distance is determined by the exhibition space and the format of the work.

What is White Cube?
White cube refers to an exhibition format that has become common in museums and galleries since modernism. This format aims to highlight the artwork itself by placing it in a neutral, pure space.

(1) Characteristics
Space Neutrality:.
- White walls, uniform lighting, closed space with no outside influence.
- This allows the work to be viewed as a purely visual experience, detached from its background and context.
Silence and Concentration:.
- The design allows the viewer to concentrate on the work itself without being interrupted by extraneous information or environmental sounds.
- Time non-temporal:.
The white cube presents the exhibition space as permanent and unchanging.
(2) Influence of Modernism
The White Cube reflects the philosophy of modernist art that one should concentrate on the form itself.
Example: a painting or sculpture is detached from its historical background and social context and presented as pure aesthetics.

3. spectatorship and white cube relationship
The white cube exhibition format has a significant impact on spectatorship.

(1) Passivity of viewers
White cubes tend to position the viewer as a passive "witness.
The white walls and enclosed space emphasize "distance" to the viewer, formalizing the act of looking at the work.
The viewer acts as an "observer" of the work, and active participation and intervention are discouraged.
(2) Segregation of viewers and artworks
In a white cube, the work may be detached from its context, diminishing its interactive relationship with the viewer.
This makes it easy for the viewer to view the work as a mere "object.
(3) Changes since Modernism
Contemporary art is increasingly critical of the white cube format, and there is a search for exhibition formats that involve the viewer as part of the work, rather than leaving him or her as a passive presence.
Example: Installation art and performance art require the viewer to physically and sensually interact with the work.

Criticisms of the White Cube
The White Cube has been criticized for its purity.

(1) Exclusion of social and political context
White Cube tends to present artwork as a "neutral aesthetic experience," divorced from its historical, social, and political context.
This may diminish the social critical power and contextual meaning of art.
(2) Sense of exclusion of spectators
The White Cube implicitly assumes a "privileged audience" with specific artistic knowledge and sensibilities, and the general public may feel intimidated.
(3) Discrepancy with the diversity of contemporary art
Contemporary art increasingly emphasizes social context and interactive experiences, for which the white cube format may not be suitable.

5. contemporary art and new spectatorship
(1) Interactive experience
Contemporary art tends to transform the viewer from a passive spectator to an active participant.
Example: In digital art and installations, the viewer becomes part of the work, reconstructing space and meaning.
(2) Trial of new space
Beyond the white cube format, art is increasingly being presented in a variety of contexts, including outdoor and urban spaces and online platforms.
Examples: Street art and virtual reality art position the viewer as a more active presence.

6. conclusion
Spectatorship and the white cube are important elements that shape the art viewing experience. While white cubes emphasize the purity and concentration of the work, they tend to treat the viewer as a passive presence and may be inadequate to reflect the diversity and social context of contemporary art. From a spectatorship perspective, art appreciation should be more than just the act of looking; it should be a process in which the viewer interacts with the work and the space to create new meaning. This discussion is very important for the future of contemporary art and exhibition spaces.
