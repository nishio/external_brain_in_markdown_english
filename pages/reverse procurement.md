reverse procurement

> So we've got more than 100 different applications for mask availability in just seven days. And that also speaks to a very different approach when it comes to working with the people, right? It's not about procurement, where only one vendor gets to create a map, but [[reverse procurement]] where everybody gets to create based on the same common [[open API]] or open [[machine-readable standard]].

And that tells you that this is a very different approach when it comes to working with people - it's not [[procurement]] where only one vendor makes the map, it's reverse procurement where everyone can make it based on the same common open API and open machine-readable standards! ...and that's what we're trying to do.
