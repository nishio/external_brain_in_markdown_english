- Copy previous work to your personal project
    - I'm afraid in the future I'll be like, "Where did I write that?"
- Create a test case that reproduces the bug
    - I'd fix it if I could afford it, but I don't know, I have a lot of meetings on Fridays.

    - Okay, I see what you mean. You are looking at the direction of the vectors of the "midpoint" and the "intersection" when calculating the direction of the arrow, but when one is larger than the other, the midpoint can be inside the other ‚úÖ.

    - Another issue
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/a8addf0eb36bc6649ba5c40a7da65e98/thumb/1000)
        - The titled group is longer on top by the height of the title, but it is mishandled and misaligned.
        - The algorithm for determining the intersection of the bounding box and the line segment assumes that "the line segment must be out of the center of the bounding box," and that was certainly fine in the past, but now the group gets a heading and extends a little higher.

    - Only one of the four directions is buggy‚úÖ.

        - fixed!
    - For some reason the border is not included in the bounding box... ‚úÖ

    - For some reason, by not including the border in the bounding box, the tip of the arrow is cutting into the inside 5px more than expected, but I have no idea why.
        - Maybe I'm just tired.

    - It's not that the bounding box doesn't reflect the border, it's that the arrow is stuck in the border because the subsequent drawing "draws the border outside the bounding box" whether the border is included or not.
    - Or this: [box-sizing - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing)

    - I have an extra 15 minutes to wash the next task.
    - [[FaviconAPI]] support

        - Which z-index is better?

- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>üçÖ17:14-17:39 Favicon appearance improvements.
    - Is it because of the baseline that the bottom line is not aligned with the image and the icon?
    - [vertical-align - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/vertical-align)
    - vertical-align: text-bottom
    - The z-index is larger than the text and more likely to make sense even if it's partially hidden, so I decided to put it behind.

    - 16 extra minutes to find out about the tutorial's multilingual support.
        - [Navigator.language - Web APIs | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/language)
js

```javascript
> window.navigator.language
< 'en-US'
```

        - When in Japanese, it becomes ja.
        - Data structure can complicate TypeScript types if you try to do it messy, so you have to think about it properly.
