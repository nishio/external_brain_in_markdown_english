title: "Figure Extraction"
---

- I thought it would be something interesting to make a program to extract only the figure parts from the book PDF
- But as far as the ePub is concerned, the image data was there when I unzipped it.
- Mainly [[scanning (e.g. with a scanner)]] PDF
- I want it to feel [[interesting]], not dead data.
