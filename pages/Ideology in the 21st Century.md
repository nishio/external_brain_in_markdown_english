old title  [[Three Ideologies]]

Three ideologies
    - [[corporate libertarianism]]
    - [[Corporate Libertarianism]]
    - Entrepreneurial entities that seek to use technology to free individuals from bureaucracy, group organization, and oppression
    - [[Integrated Technocracy]]
    - [[Synthetic Technocracy]]
    - Believes that the evolution of general-purpose artificial intelligence and Singularity can solve the challenges facing humanity
    - [[digital democracy]]
        - [[digital democracy]]
    - Diverse, dispersed communities peacefully coexist to enhance collaboration

This is interesting.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- I thought about where I was, and I thought it was about [[synthetic technocracy]] 5, [[corporate libertarianism]] 3, [[digital democracy]] 2.
- It's no surprise that Synthetic Technocracy is more than half of the population since they "believe that the evolution of general-purpose artificial intelligence and Singularity can solve the challenges facing humanity."
- When I thought about how the other two were allocated, I thought growth was more important than avoiding an existential crisis.
    - I believe that if earth civilization is the most developed option and homo sapiens civilization needs to be destroyed, it should be destroyed.
    - Perhaps the optimal solution is the path that doesn't destroy Homo sapiens, but it's not up to Homo sapiens to decide what the optimal solution is.
    - If a being smarter than Homo sapiens decides that the optimal Homo sapiens population is 100 million, then it's right to do so.
        - Well, it won't be a radical "let's kill billions of people right now", because that would easily be met with a backlash from homo sapiens.
        - I'm sure they'll make sure that homo sapiens actively choose "not to populate".
- As for economic equality, I'm in favor of creating a minimum floor at UBI, but not a ceiling.
- Against multi-person cooperation, since being multi-person is not the goal, but only chosen when it is beneficial to be multi-person, so "economic rationality" on the left side is closer.
        - [[Originality first before co-creation]].
- I'm starting to think it's 5:4:1 or 5:5:0 instead of 5:3:2.
