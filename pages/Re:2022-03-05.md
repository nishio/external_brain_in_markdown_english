- > I'd love to see the Scrapbox Best Practices page and get some tips on community-use projects!
    - I realized I was too inexperienced to write, so I participated in a lot of things to increase my experience.
    - Is that what the notification of Slack participation was about (language community)?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I tried to get in three new ones at the same time, but I think the manager was busy with his day job during the week on that one.

- If I were to create an intellectual production co-editing project, I would set a high hurdle, like "intellectual production takes place by doing something cognitively demanding," but since most people would pass under the hurdle anyway, I would set the hurdle so low that they could not pass under it.
    - Almost well
- Do you want to give some direction to the theme?
    - What is "intellectual production"?
        - I feel like the well is already biased towards intellectual production-like topics, maybe since Nishio's arrival?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - I think people who use Scrapbox are basically inclined to do so.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/kuuote/icon' alt='/villagepump/kuuote.icon' height="19.5"/>

        - That project, hell!
    - Rodin's "[[thinker]]" sits above the gates of this hell.
- Well, it's getting interesting, and I'm thinking weird things, but I don't think it's going to work if you focus on these non-substantial things.
