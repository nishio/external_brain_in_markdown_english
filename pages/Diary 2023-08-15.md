> Once in all the years I've worked at Drasto, a mother brought a kindergartner 👦🏻 to the cashier who had opened a food toy and paid for it, saying, "I'm sorry I opened it before the checkout. When I taped it and tried to give it to her, she said, "I'm sorry, but could you please dispose of that there? I don't want my child to think that if she opens it, I will buy it for her.
>  👦🏻 was also crying and apologizing to me for opening the door... 🥺. Mom, you were always a polite, classy, God-fearing customer when you came to the store...
>  I don't know if he's moved since then or not, but I'm sure that 👦🏻 is a nice young man.

> [@hodokosoalame](https://twitter.com/hodokosoalame/status/1687372233701036032): it's been a while since Comiket has sold same-day admission tickets, so I'll threaten you!
> Comic Market is not a festival but a battlefield, so if you are in a leisurely mood, turn right and take the Rinkai Line to Odaiba!
> I'm going to say this twice because it's important, okay?
> Comiket is a battlefield. Let go of your naivety.

> [@comiketofficial](https://twitter.com/comiketofficial/status/1690277209335009280):[Attention! Here is today's report from the first aid room. Most of the injured and sick are heat stroke. As expected, young people in their teens and twenties who are either participating for the first time or have not participated in the event for a long time are the most noticeable. Firefighters have also pointed out that many people are not wearing hats and are wearing black clothes that absorb heat easily. Please pay close attention to what you are wearing. Also, be sure to carry water with you.

> Young people: "When are you talking about, you old people who make events into training without permission?"
> ↓
> Heat stroke in teens and 20s continues
> This is already a fairy tale.

> [@namchan_koushi](https://twitter.com/namchan_koushi/status/1690215818083360768): The toilet cleaning robot is doing its job quite well. Fully-automated robot cleaning is proposed as a manpower-saving measure for the cleaning industry, which has a high turnover rate and is considered difficult to secure stable human resources. It can be introduced for about 1.5 million yen/month and performs cleaning every day. It could also be applied to simpler cleaning and catering operations.

> [@tomoyaman](https://twitter.com/tomoyaman/status/1689894878531170304): to someone who says "Think objectively~", "Whose subjectivity is that?" the other person will shut up. You will lose friends.

> [HiroTHamadaJP](https://twitter.com/HiroTHamadaJP/status/1688088668953841664) As a point of whether or not to take it because of various stories,
>  1. do you believe the hypothesis is correct for me too?
>  2. even if the results are not good, is the process of hypothesis testing itself beneficial?
>  3. is a long-term relationship likely to continue?
>  I value these three things.
> [HiroTHamadaJP](https://twitter.com/HiroTHamadaJP/status/1688090267856121856) As a more meta idea, it's all about having a broadly shared vision about the world.
>
>  Emotionally speaking, whether or not to accept a story is a matter of "whether or not I can commit to the other person's well-being.
>
>  I can't do it if it's not what I think I can propose for the other party. It is a long term risk.
> [HiroTHamadaJP](https://twitter.com/HiroTHamadaJP/status/1688092099475042304) Of course, since it is my job, I am not completely risk-free in these areas and have work to do as requested.

>  It may be difficult to find the right salt here, but I would like to reduce the ratio.

> [atrzdflw](https://twitter.com/atrzdflw/status/1690663701035229184) I was talking to a group of members about a business issue and I asked one of them, "What do you think about what I think about this?" one of the members suddenly opened his mouth and said
>
>  "...Mr. Wada, you always say that with your mouth, but I don't think you can judge more correctly than Mr. Wada, both in terms of your position and the amount of information you have."
>  "If you really want to hear our opinions, at least give us the same amount of information beforehand, or at least try to focus your opinions on the areas where we have information (expertise, business knowledge, etc.)," he replied, which was very enlightening.
>
>  Certainly when I look back at my communication.
>  1) I should have made my own decisions on matters concerning the company as a whole, instead of asking the members of the company to do so, and 2) I should have made my own decisions,
>  If they wanted to get input from the members, they should have limited themselves to that and then asked the question.
>
>  There is so much to learn in talking to members these days...

> [@ShinHori1](https://twitter.com/ShinHori1/status/1687611451878584323): if it were true (as an objective phenomenon, not a good or bad one) that "girls' education lowers the birth rate," then you can't be mad at the discourse itself. [[@ShinHori1]].
> Reverse your thinking.
> "The once high birth rate was supported by excluding girls from educational opportunities."
>  Just to paraphrase.
