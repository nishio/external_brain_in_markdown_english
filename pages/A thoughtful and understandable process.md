- Nishio's image of what is happening in this "thinking" process

        - Related: [[Story intersections become atoms...]].
    - As the thought paths, experience processes, overlap, "dense areas" ([[intersection]]) are formed, and "Oh, this is the meaning of 'open set'" (ah, this is the meaning of 'open set').
    - Symbols and "felt meaning" are connected, this is called "having a concept".
- It is not limited to philosophy or mathematics. For example, you can go from "I don't really understand the concept of classes even though I read a book about it" to "I can understand it after I write a few programs that use classes just by watching and learning.
