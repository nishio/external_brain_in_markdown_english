Offline and online diaries

I chose not to write in Scrapbox where the signal was sluggish, so I'm separating my offline diary from my online diary.
- (I wrote about this story in my offline Day 0 journal)
    - [[Choosing a tool to write down your thoughts]]

What should we do in the future?
- Retroactive additions to past diaries
- Write in a new diary
- Create "Kumano Kodo Diary" page
    - event page style
    - Case Study: [[Unexplored Junior Shenzhen Tour 2019]].
- The correct theory is that it is inscribed in fragments in the first place.
    - (I wrote this in my offline journal.) (The reason I'm not putting it up now is because it's a pain to edit multiple lines when dealing with Scrapbox on my phone.)
    - Added: [[Processing information from events]].
