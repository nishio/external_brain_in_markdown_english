For young people who are now 20 years old, Twitter has been around for as long as they can remember, so they may feel that it is "the collapse of the established [[existing order]]", but for middle-aged people, it is just an example of the repeated "It will decline in 10 to 20 years, won't it"!
    - [[Drinking party for "Folks who have been discovering the Internet for about 20 years]]
    - [[rise and fall of services]]
- [[Social Media is Broken]]
