title: "I sense malice."
---

I'm not going to link to that discussion because it's irrelevant to the original topic and I'm not interested in that discussion, but what is the best thing to do when someone says they "feel malicious" for something they said? My natural response would be "it's subjective to this person to feel malice, and if there is no malice in the original statement, then this person simply has a mistaken belief".

There is a choice between correcting the wrong belief and not correcting it, and there are cases where one simply thinks, "Someone is making a wrong assumption," and goes through with it, and other cases where one kindly points out, "That is a wrong assumption you are making. In the latter case, however, it is expected that the person will be offended, so what should we do then?

I came up with the response, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean any offense," but in that case, I'm not sure "sorry" about what?" I'm not sure. If someone asked me that and I answered honestly, "No, I didn't have any deep meaning, but I thought it would make you feel better if I apologized anyway," you would be angry, right?

After much thought, I feel it is appropriate to go through with it without thinking about correcting it in a kind way because it has become a pain in the ass.

I'm sorry for the shaky interpretation of my statement, which could be misinterpreted as malicious intent. But then again, it is also possible to feel maliciousness in the post itself.

It is possible to feel malice by interpreting the statement, "I feel malice," as an attempt to impress upon those around me that the other party is a bad person by claiming that the other party has said the statement with malice."
