Certain communication methods (including tools)
Those who think, "We don't need to do it that way," may be saying, "We haven't been able to get into a community that communicates that way."

I thought as I sent the message on line.

A year ago I was on the "I don't use LINE because I don't need it" side.
Now I'm on the side of "frequent users" of Discord, but there are many people close to me who don't use Discord at all.
- It just so happens that I use Discord.
- That's because the Namekai and Plurality use it.
I'm not a big fan of using Teams, but that said, there are some communities that you can't communicate with without Teams.
When I was a freshman in college, you used Yahoo Messenger to communicate with your friends.
If you don't join a community that uses Cosense as a means of communication, you may not even recognize Cosense as a means of communication.
