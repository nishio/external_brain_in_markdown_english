title: "Group Title"
---

- 1: Require front cover title input when creating a group
    - →A pain in the ass.
- 2: The sticky in the top-left corner of the group is the nameplate.
    - → Not always there is an appropriate sticky note as a front cover in the group when you want to fold it after grouping,
        - To add a sticky, you have to dismantle the group, create a sticky, and re-group it, which is tedious!
        - The result is a lot of groups left open.
- 3: When the title of a (planned) group is not yet set, the title will be the title of the connected sticky text inside the group.
    - Titles can be updated as many times as needed, unlike stickies.
