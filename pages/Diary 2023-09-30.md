There's still some material that hasn't made it to Scrapbox yet.
    - [[Design for Learning Nagoya University Edition Addendum]] and
        - [[Summary of past presentations]]

AI digs up questions from past lectures
    - [[Q: Will computers no longer be able to beat augmented humans?]]
    - [[dig up]]
- [[rehashing]]
    - [https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/search/page?q=蒸し返す](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/search/page?q=蒸し返す)
        - [[I can rehash the conversation.]]

We're starting to see a little bit of that.
- Devices for creating chunks
- Devising ways to present to humans
- Search Devices
    - [[Programming for "systems built by humans and computers]]  by <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/omni/icon' alt='omni.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - [[We want to strengthen human intelligence.]]
        - This didn't come with a link.
        - It was April 2018, so I didn't quite know how to use Scrapbox yet!
            - ![image](https://gyazo.com/918471c6dd11a44549d949d3cd98542b/thumb/1000)
        - That's what the omni vector search found.
        - Scrapbox's link ambiguity search allows for "similar composition to ambiguity searches for past relevant links when trying to write a link.
        - Solving Scrapbox's "hard to generate value if you don't accumulate a lot of links" problem.
        - [[Natural language implementation]]
        - LLM allows computers as well as humans to implement in natural language
        - [[Tokyo Tech Homecoming Day "AI and MOT]]
        - Human + computer = augmented human
        - FORTRAN(1954)
        - [[Hesitation to write.]]
        - It hits part of the transcription and gets cut out.
                - [[Hitting part of a series that has not been carved out provides an opportunity for carving out]]
                - [[A large blurry mass is pulled into line and disintegrates.]]
            - Examples of [Cut out after needs are identified.
        - Delete the parts you don't want.
                - [[Output of ideas by scraping instead of writing]]

Whether to output search results to a page or not
- It's not good for search results to go into the index.
    - Because the mapping of titles to fragments is spoiled.
- Should search results be output?
    - The output is worth something because the output results are not read and discarded.
    - There are times when people say, "This is interesting, even though it doesn't show up in the summary."
    - On the other hand, reading "cut-up fragments" is rather cognitively taxing.
    - I really wish I could summarize it better.
- Must be output and not be subject to search
    - →Innovation on how to create chunks

- [[Search Labs, I could use an account I don't normally use.]]
