title: "Businessization of Methodology"
---

Suppose there is a method Y to achieve some objective X.
- Suppose there is a Mr. Z who teaches method Y.
- For some reason, the phenomenon "Mr. Z has never achieved objective X" may occur.

Mr. Z's objective is not "to achieve objective X" but "to teach method Y".
- Mr. Z. [[People whose purpose is to teach.]]
    - Mr. Z has never achieved objective X, and neither has the person who taught him to achieve it, but Mr. Z's objective has been achieved.
- In many cases, they are compensated for teaching.
- Sometimes they do not receive monetary compensation, in which case they gain the self-esteem of being in a position to teach.

- Similar to [[making the means into the end]], but different.
The means to an end is,
- There is a method Y to achieve some objective X,
- There is a Mr. do Z who do method Y,
- For some reason, "Mr. Z is not interested in achieving [[_]] objective X."
This phenomenon is caused by Mr. Z finding value in "doing method Y itself" or gaining self-esteem as "me doing method Y".
In the case of the "business of methods," Mr. Z does not [[_do_]] method Y himself, but only [[_teaches_]] it.
