title: "Do not classify."
---

Some people explain the KJ method as "categorizing post-its".
- I guess you have not read the commentary by Jiro Kawakita himself.
>  One person with a good head suggested that since these materials are all related to management, they should be classified in this or that category. Several others agreed, and a classification [[waku (unit of volume, approx. 1.8 ml)]] was determined in advance. And accordingly, they were in the process of handing out the paper scraps. As I have already mentioned, this is a problem of arbitrariness that men, especially intellectuals, are prone to. So, I also broke up the papers in this room.
>  As in this case, there are many people who think they know what they are doing in theory, but when it comes time to do it, they take the wrong path. We are so much obsessed with [[wakumi (species of edible brown seaweed, Undaria pinnatifida)]] in the [[dogmatic classification]] that we have developed a bad habit of not listening to the facts and the information that they tell us. They have developed a bad habit of not listening to the facts and their information.

Even though we know in our heads that we should not classify, we tend to classify dogmatically. But that is an evil way, and we must avoid it.
This concept is difficult to convey no matter how much we emphasize it, so it needs to be taught repeatedly.
When someone explains that "the KJ method classifies Post-its," which is the exact opposite of the KJ method, I feel like, "Did this person even read the source material?" I feel "Did this person read the original? I hear that some people are taught the KJ method by such lecturers and end up thinking it is boring.

> It is totally unwise to go from a large division to a small division. [One of the critical problems with this method (see Figure 7) is that it is not a good way to go from large to small. This is one of the critical problems with this method (see Figure 7).
> ...
> In his mind, he has an arbitrary principle of grouping, such as, "In my opinion, it is correct to divide the contents of this many paper materials into three major categories: market research, quality control, and labor management. The company simply applies this dogmatic classification scheme and fits paper scraps of data into the ready-made framework. In this way, the conceptual significance of the KJ method is completely lost.
