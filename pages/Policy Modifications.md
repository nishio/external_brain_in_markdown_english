Assume that those who support the policy A are a minority compared to those who do not support it not A
- The idea of trying to turn a NOT A person into an A person at this time tends to arise

However, is it appropriate for A to be fixed in the first place?
    - [[correctability]]
- Consider A1, A2, A3 with a slight modification of A
- As for A1, all A's support it and more support it.
    - No reason not to change A to A1.
- As for A3, more people support it, but there is a minority of support among A
    - This is unacceptable.
    - Ultimately, replacing A with not A would increase the number of supporters, but there is no way A would accept that, is there?
    - In other words, the number of supporters is not the single axis of evaluation, but the percentage of support within the A
- So what about A2, the case of a modification that is supported by a majority of the A's and increasing support among the A's?
    - I am now thinking that A should accept the amendment to A2, but I am not yet convinced
    - I'm curious what happens to person B (A and not A2) who is truncated from the minority of A's as part of the update to A2.
        - Nevertheless, if A2 is a minority, then this truncated person B would be part of the majority.
