title: "People with large subject matter are insecure."
---

- [[the subject is large]] It occurred to me that the person making the claim might be [[anxious]] about his or her life.

Example
- Every person should learn tech X!"
    - I chose to learn Technology X, but I'm not sure if I made the right choice, so I'm trying to find supporters and reassurance by making claims like this
    - To put it a little more relativistically, when you learn X and think "this is useful, others should learn it too", you should feel that you must find and learn Y as soon as possible because someone who has learned Y that you have not learned yet must be thinking the same thing!
    - I feel like there's a pathological narrowing of vision happening where that idea doesn't occur.
- People should all take Problem X seriously!"
    - I'm working to solve problem X, but I'm worried that I don't have anyone who agrees with me.
    - Wouldn't it be inefficient if everyone considered the same problem?

When you say, "I'm worried that no one agrees with me," do you mean that you want someone to say, "That's a good policy"?
- I am not confident in my proactive choices.
- They want someone else to decide for them.
    - [[Lack of initiative]]
