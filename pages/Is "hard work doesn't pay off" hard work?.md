title: 'Is "hard work doesn''t pay off" hard work?'
---

I think it's True that "hard work doesn't always pay off."
In the first place, many people who say that they tried hard but it didn't pay off.
I just assumed that "what others said 'this is effort'" was effort and did it,
It may be untested whether the act is really an effort.
What is effort in the first place?
What can we say we "tried" to do?
