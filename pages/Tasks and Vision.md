Do not confuse task and vision
We engage in a variety of tasks in our daily lives. However, some of those tasks may have greater meaning than a mere "to-do" list. That is "vision.

What is Vision?
Vision is the vision of the future we aspire to. It is something that guides our actions, although we cannot directly implement it. However, if the vision is not clear, we may not know how to implement it and it may remain uninitiated.

Tasks performed in a task-neutral state
On the other hand, there are tasks that are not determined by needs from the outside world, but are performed spontaneously. There may be a small piece of vision hidden in these tasks. It may not be verbalized, but thinking about "why are we doing this?" should help us see it.

Doing what you do because you are told to do it and doing it because you want to do it.
There are two types of tasks: tasks that you do because you are told to do them and tasks that you do because you want to do them. The former may not be given enough clues to understand, while the latter comes from within you and you can understand why by talking to yourself.

Connecting Tasks and Vision
By connecting our tasks to our vision, we can understand the meaning of our actions and live more fulfilling lives. It is important to see tasks not as mere "things to do," but as steps toward the future we aspire to.

Tasks and Vision
It gets mixed up in the "to do list."
Vision cannot be directly implemented.
They don't know how to implement it, so it remains uninitiated.

Tasks performed in a task-neutral state
Voluntary tasks, not tasks determined by external needs
There is a small piece of vision in this task.
It may not be verbalized.
Why are we doing this?"

Doing what you do because you are told to do it and doing it because you want to do it.
The latter has a "want to" and understanding why they want to do it is beneficial
- The former is also beneficial to understand, but may not be given enough clues to understand
- The latter comes from within me, and I can tell by talking to myself.
