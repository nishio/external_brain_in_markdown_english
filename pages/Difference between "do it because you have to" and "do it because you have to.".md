title: 'Difference between "do it because you have to" and "do it because you have to."'
---

In Japanese, it's just one letter difference.

Some people only say the first half without specifying the second half.
- I need it, so do it."
    - A case of simply not recognizing the difference between the two.
    - Cases where there are psychological hurdles to making demands explicit

Others take it literally.
- A "I need it," B "Yes, [[it's]] better to have it."
- This is not to say that B will do it.
    - Among the many and varied "[[good things to do]]," when a person's priority among individuals is at the top of the list, he or she will do it.
    - If it is not a priority, it will not be initiated.
- C "I'll do it because I need it" B "Thanks for the help!"
