Progress is a finite resource.
Whether or not?
- The joy of updating something
    - Exclusive goods?
    - Example
        - First moon landing in human history
            - Is the first time in history an intrinsic value? Is it something to be consumed?
            - (I'd better let go.) Maybe it's ego.
    - Someone landed on the moon a long time ago so I could grow flowers on the moon and swim in the sun.
- [[Rank is not an intrinsic value.]]

- Frontier Perspectives
    - The larger the diameter of the circle, the larger the frontier (circumference)
        - TBA Figure
    - The more the circle expands (progress), the more room for progress rather
        - reproduction on an enlarged or expanded scale
        - [[Does the end of the world exist in reality?]]
    - Whether it will be difficult to reach the frontier from near the center
            - [[Highways of Knowledge]] is required
            - The understanding that if you can't tackle the frontier without ingesting that much information, you need a highway of knowledge to explore the frontier based on certain types of information.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/inajob/icon' alt='inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - Are there limits on highways?
        - I might be sad if I couldn't even touch the circumference in my whole life.
            - Is the joy of advancing civilization separate from the joy of advancing ourselves?
            - Isn't civilization advancing as a side effect as a result of advancing itself?

- [Progress is a finite resource.
- Values that humans are measurable and interchangeable, and the better they are relative to each other, the more rewarding they are.
    - Thus [[the nail that sticks out gets hammered in]].
        - Because it creates an incentive to lower the average without stretching yourself.
        - Relative, is the root of evil.
            - [[Rank is not an intrinsic value.]]

My research focuses on advancing our understanding of the value of progress and knowledge. I believe that progress is not a finite resource, and that there is room for further progress by exploring new frontiers. However, to reach that frontier requires a highway of knowledge that is predicated on certain types of information. We also believe that human values are relative and that rank is not an intrinsic value.

Nishio's studies "What is Unexploredness" and "The Newness of the New" are closely related to my research. He states that the value of the new is not self-evident and that there is no such thing as what each person perceives as new. He also points out that when we do something new based on spontaneous motivation, it is difficult to evaluate the results.

From these studies, we believe it is important to understand that the value of progress and knowledge is relative, that nothing is new to each of us, and that it is difficult to evaluate the results of doing something new. These understandings provide the foundation for us to explore new frontiers and build a highway of knowledge.
