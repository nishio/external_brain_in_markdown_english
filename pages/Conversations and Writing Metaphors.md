title: "Conversations and Writing Metaphors"
---

If you think of [[communication with AI]] as a metaphor for [[oral conversation]], it seems slow to take a minute to reply.
If you look at it as an image of writing a communication with an AI in text, sharing it via email, etc., and getting feedback after a while, it is fast to get a response in a minute.
Especially when taken in the metaphor of [[writing (e.g., as a profession)]], an editor who responds politely in a few minutes to a manuscript that's just about to be drawn is a blast!
