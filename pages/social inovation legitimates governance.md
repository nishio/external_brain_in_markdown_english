[[Social innovation legitimizes governance.]]

> Because [[Ethereum]] is [[open source]], anyone who wants to can “[[fork]],” meaning, use it to pursue a different vision. This kind of social innovation legitimates governance, but in a way that is free of the legitimacy provided by representative elections. This way, people can see when social innovations work better. --- [[Audrey Tang]]
- (DeepL) [[ethereum]] is [[open source (software, etc.)]], so anyone can "[[folk]]" it if they wish. Such [[social innovation]] legitimizes governance in a way that is free from the [[legitimacy]] of [[representative elections]]. In this way, people will know when social innovation works better.
- [[Democracy needs to evolve into a real-time system]]

"[[Social innovation legitimizes governance]], but in the process it is independent of the legitimacy of current governance."
- Traditional "election of representatives by [[voting]]" creates [[legitimacy]] of "status quo governance".
- [[social innovation]] in a way that is independent of this "status quo [[legitimacy]] of governance."
- If that social innovation works well, [[posterior]] it will turn into "[[a new legitimacy]]" as people decide "this is a good thing."

Open source can be forked by anyone, allowing a wide variety of experiments.
- So it is not appropriate to authorize one of those experiments in advance, that is, it is not appropriate to authorize one of those experiments in advance.
- [[It is easier to evaluate the results after they have been achieved]].
    - [[Innovation is evaluated after the fact.]] 。

However, this legitimacy does not come from the traditional representative elections as in political systems. Instead, it is achieved through the consensus of the community and their collective decisions about the direction of the project.
