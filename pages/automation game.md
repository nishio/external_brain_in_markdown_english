[The Formation and Transition of the Game Genre of Automation | Watsushirogu](http://tatamo.81.la/blog/2019/12/10/automation-games/)
Nice summary
> Formation and Transition of Automated Gaming
- [[Minecraft]]
- Minecraft 1.2.5 + industrialization mod
- [[Factorio]]
- [[Factory Town]]
- [[Autonauts]]

We were talking about [[the Dyson Sphere Program]].
- Is it similar to the Mycla industrialization mod?" This article appeared in the "<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I think the flow of history is "Mycla industrialization mod" -> Factorio -> birth of many Factorio-type games (including [[Satisfactory]]) -> [[Dyson Sphere Program]]".

- [[Factorio was created to get around the limitations of the Minecraft industrialization mod]]
Other games discussed
- [[Mindustry]]
- [[Oxygen not included]]([[ONI]])
- [[shapez.io]]
- [[No Man's Sky]]
- [[SpaceChem]]([[Zachtronics]])
    - [[Infinifactory]]
- [[SHENZHEN I/O]]
    - [[TIS-100]]
    - [[Opus Magnum]]

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>[[Dyson Sphere Program]] is more like [[Satisfactory]] than [ONI
- ONI doesn't have a character of its own.


Notation shaking: [[factory game]].
- You often [[automate]] [[factories]].
    - Games like [[Autonauts]] or [[? a game that looks like a Pokemon parody]]] automate agents that move around instead of automating fixed factory facilities.
        - Fixed equipment and agents that move around between them.
    - Factorio has no agents to move around (until there are transport drones).
    - [[Oxygen Not Included]] and [[Ratopia]] are both present.
