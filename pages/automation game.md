Nice summary
> Formation and Transition of Automated Gaming

- Is it similar to the Mycla industrialization mod?" This article appeared in the "<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I think the flow of history is "Mycla industrialization mod" -> Factorio -> birth of many Factorio-type games (including [[Satisfactory]]) -> [[Dyson Sphere Program]]".

- [[Factorio was created to get around the limitations of the Minecraft industrialization mod]]
Other games discussed
- [[Mindustry]]
- [[Oxygen not included]]([[ONI]])
- [[shapez.io]]
- [[No Man's Sky]]
- [[SpaceChem]]([[Zachtronics]])
    - [[Infinifactory]]
- [[SHENZHEN I/O]]
    - [[TIS-100]]
    - [[Opus Magnum]]

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>[[Dyson Sphere Program]] is more like [[Satisfactory]] than [ONI
- ONI doesn't have a character of its own.
