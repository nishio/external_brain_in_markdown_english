2018/1~
It's a hassle to look up links every time you want to introduce someone to something you use, so we've put together a page to make it easier for you in the future.

bag
    - [[Ortlieb 24L]]
    - [[Ortlieb 30L]]

Shoes: [[Vibram]].

Vitamins: [New Neovitamin EX "Kunihiro"](http://amzn.to/2iSQ3XP)
- Same ingredients as Alinamin, famous in commercials
- I feel subjectively more tired when I drink before bed, but I'm not blind to it.

[[Chocola BB]]

Eye mask [TEMPUR](http://amzn.to/2iQHBIJ) and [[earplug (for protection against noise or water)]] [MOLDEX](http://amzn.to/2iRwhfp)
- I use an eye mask every day.
- Combined use of earplugs when sleep rhythm is about to be disrupted, such as at a training camp or on a business trip, or when sleep is in short supply
- Sleep deeper and feel like you can recover in a shorter period of time
- Also, I think the [[autosuggestion]] of "I'm going to sleep now" and "I'm going to recover efficiently" by wearing this is also significant.
- Replaced because it was old.

Notepad: [[RHODIA]].
Note: [[iPad Pro]].
- I no longer do the KJ method on paper using [[tag]], I use [[Kozaneba]].

The ballpoint pen I carry is [[LAMY]], but the contents are [refill adapter [https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B00R2HP79I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=sl1&tag=](https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B00R2HP79I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=sl1&tag=) nishiohirokaz-22&linkId=a037692597a3a314551188295454b71f&language=en_JP] and it is Jetstream SXR-89-07.
