- There are several people who want to/do organize Scrapbox cards in Kozaneba.
    - [[Scrapbox Best Practices 2022 manuscript v1]] also organized a multi-person discussion on Scrapbox in Kozaneba
- Let's increase our affinity with Scrapbox!
    - It would require a Scrapbox project name.
        - Iconic Notation in Image
        - Anything written in link notation is actually a link.
    - We've known this for a long time.
        - was hesitant to move in this direction, thinking, "Wouldn't it be a bad idea to include features that are tightly coupled with other services?" and hesitated to move in this direction.
- Dr. Jun Murai's talk at the Unexplored Conference 2022
    - > The Internet was created as an overlay network to telephone lines.
    - >  Then the lower layer was replaced after its usefulness became widely known and widely used.
    - This story certainly makes me think that maybe that's a good idea.
- In other words, Scrapbox should be the infrastructure, and Kozaneba can be used as an overlay to it.
    - This will allow the lower layer to be replaced once its usefulness is understood and it is used.
    - The concept of "infrastructure" is ambiguous.
        - First of all, I feel like we should lower the cost of "getting data from Scrapbox and organizing it" and "reflecting the organized data in Scrapbox" to make it easier to use.


- Create a "Scrapbox project name" field in the map
- If this is not an empty string, parse Kozane's text as Scrapbox notation
    - Links and icons.
    - Iconic notation is embedded in Kozane as an icon
    - Image notation should become an image kozane
    - The Scrapbox notation link is
            - Open in a new tab
            - add as a scapegoat
        - Would you like to be able to select the
            - add as a scapegoat
                - If I do this, I can open from Scrapbox Kozane, so that might be fine.
    - You can add more and more Scrapbox pages to Kozaneba by following the links.

- I changed it because link suggestions are determined faster if they start with Kozaneba than if they start with Scrapbox.

        - Links and icons.
        - Iconic notation is embedded in Kozane as an icon
