- [[nous]] , reason
> Nous (nous, rare: νους, nous) is a Greek word meaning intellect, reason, spirit, or soul.
>  Anaxagoras believed that the world was governed by nous and that man could grasp nous. Plotinus also held that all things are due to the workings of nous, which flowed from the One. In the Stoics, it is used almost synonymously with logos.
>  In Immanuel Kant's philosophy, the word "[[gnomeenon]]" ([[noumenon]], thought), derived from this word, is used synonymously with "thing itself".

νόησις ([[noesis]]), also
>  [[Noesis]] - a term used in the phenomenology of Etmund Husserl to refer to the mental action of "thinking," as opposed to noema, which refers to "what is thought" by it
- [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ノエシス](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ノエシス)
> Husserl used the Greek terms "noesis," which refers to the action of thought, and "noema," which refers to the object thought, and called the movement of the conscious ego to capture the sense-giving "noesis" and the object as far as it is captured by consciousness "noema.

- Etymology of [NORSPHERE
> The noosphere is a philosophical concept created and popularized by the Soviet biogeochemist [[Vladimir Vernadsky]] and the French philosopher and Jesuit priest [[Théard de Chardin]]. Vernadsky defined the nousphere as a new stage of the biosphere and described the earth as a "sphere of reason. The noosphere represents the highest stage in the development of the biosphere, and its defining factor is the development of mankind's rational activity.
>
>  The word is derived from the Greek words νοῦς (nous, spirit, reason) and σφαῖρα (sphere, space); lexical analogues include atmosphere and biosphere.... A second generation of authors has further developed the concept by Vernadsky, mainly of Russian origin, creating related concepts (noocenosis and noocenology).
>  ... Although the theory is currently scientifically rejected and not even proven, in recent years it is often used as a metaphor for "knowledge accumulation" on the Internet. Open source activist [[Eric Raymond]] has published a book entitled "[[Cultivation of the Nowhere Sphere]]" ("Homesteading the Noosphere").
