> [@maslow_design](https://twitter.com/maslow_design/status/1650983021254787073?s=20): The diagram of [[Haruaki Deguchi]] who founded [[Lifenet Insurance]] at the age of 60 and took it public in 4 years is [[ Management]] is so bad because it captures the essence of [[ management]] too much.
> I was impressed that when you are a reader of more than 10,000 books and an author of more than 40 books, your ability to express the essence in a simple way is refined to the extreme.
> No longer, beautiful.

- A "strong organization" can be built if the sharp edges are left intact.
- Strong organization: large area
    - Each and every one of us is "sharp as a tack."
    - The role of the supervisor (manager) is to fill in the gaps
- Weak tissue: small area
    - Each one is "rounded" and shaved.

> There is no such thing as "all-rounders.
>  People who are good at offense are not good at defense, and people who are good at defense are not good at offense.
> People's personalities don't change that easily.
> / Even if you give a weak person time to train and "go stronger," you can't expect a big change.
> It's like a puzzle piece.

> Japanese people tend to be homogenized, but I think managers will be increasingly required to correctly identify the individuality (strengths) of people and how to combine the sharpest human resources to maximize the capability of the organization.
> Good article & good book.
