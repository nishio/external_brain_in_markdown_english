    - [[I don't want to live.]] が口癖になっているのをいい加減どうにかしたい<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/Mijinko_SD/icon' alt='/villagepump/Mijinko_SD.icon' height="19.5"/> from [/villagepump/2023/01/14](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/2023/01/14)
    - 「 [[I want to die.]] 」ではないのがミソ？<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - [[False dichotomy]]?
        - I often imagine people saying that they don't feel like actively taking the action of "death" and just want to quietly disappear.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - So "I want to live" and "I want to die" doesn't sound right.
                - I think this diagram matches.
                        - [[False dichotomy]]
                - Apart from the conflict between "I want to live" and "I want to die," there is the conflict between "I want to be active" and "I don't want to be active."
