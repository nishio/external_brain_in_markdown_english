> In "[[Wiki as a living text]]", we discuss the concept of [[Agile Development]], where the [[make up (one's face, etc.)]] phase and the [[use (a person, animal, puppet, etc.)]] phase are not separated but are developed in parallel and gradually. Development] approach, where the [[make up (one's face, etc.)]] phase and the [[use (a person, animal, puppet, etc.)]] phase are not separated.
>  "[[speak with verbs]]" points out the importance of using "verbs" rather than "nouns" when discussing [[The World We Aim For]] in the design of [[personal experience]].
This lineup is interesting.
- When we call it by a noun, we implicitly recognize it as unchanging
    - [[Scheme of things]]
- When we speak in verbs, we see it as something that changes.
- A wiki is a living text because it behaves as a changing text, not as a collection of fixed articles
        - [[Growing Vegetatively Wiki]]
        - As a form of human-AI interaction
            - [[Botanical Metaphors]]

            - I thought about it, but the idea of camp/kindergarten is a bit shaky, so a more appropriate metaphor seems like a good idea.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamed-project/inajob/icon' alt='/unnamed-project/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>

                - The branches grow on their own [[and]] I pick the flowers when I feel like it.

        - Maybe one way for AI's to participate in the Scrapbox is to "link to it or mention it with a link"!<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamed-project/nishio/icon' alt='/unnamed-project/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

            - Finding red links and creating a summary page would be easy to implement.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamed-project/inajob/icon' alt='/unnamed-project/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>

                - Indeed. I can write red links on my own, or in cases where links are placed on several pages but the hub page is empty, I can look around where the links appear and fill in the blanks.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamed-project/nishio/icon' alt='/unnamed-project/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
                    - It's like a plant when the red link gets written on its own.
