I overheard a friend discussing how to nurture [[subordinates]], and it intrigued me, so I decided to reflect on it.

Assumptions as prerequisites:
- The current abilities of the subordinates are generally inferior to mine, creating a situation where "[[I can do it faster myself]]".
- The strengths of the subordinates differ from my own strengths.
- I have some degree of control over what the subordinates learn.

There are three strategies for what to teach:

- A: Help them [[overcome weaknesses]]
- B: Teach them [[what I am good at]]
- C: Enhance their [[strengths]]

- A: Help them overcome weaknesses
    - Focus on improving their weakest areas to elevate their overall capabilities.
    - This approach develops generalists. See #Specialists and Generalists.
    - Once their general abilities surpass mine, I can focus on my strengths and delegate other tasks to them.
    - Drawbacks:
        - The time cost to become a useful resource is quite high.
        - It can be challenging to maintain motivation when they are constantly doing tasks they are not good at.
- B: Teach them what I am good at
    - By teaching what I know best, I can educate them efficiently.
        - Although the diagram shows C higher, B might actually be higher.
    - Useful when my resources are limited, and I need a clone to act in my place.
    - Drawbacks:
        - Since it involves my strongest area, the time cost is high until they reach a level where they can replace me.
- C: Enhance their strengths
    - Focus on improving areas where they are already strong.
        - From the perspective of [[comparative advantage]], it is justified to assign tasks in their strong areas.
    - If no clear strengths exist, create a situation where they are relatively more knowledgeable in a specific type of work by skewing the types of tasks they handle, and then enhance that as a strength.
    - Easier to boost motivation.
    - Can create a situation where they outperform me in their area of expertise at a low cost.
    - Delegation leads to [[productivity improvement]].
    - Drawbacks:
        - The area to be enhanced is determined by their strengths, so it may not align with what is convenient for me.

My friend argued that C, "enhancing strengths," is the correct approach. I summarized the three methods and their respective pros and cons for comparison. I also lean towards C > B > A.
