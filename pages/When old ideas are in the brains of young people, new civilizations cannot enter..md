title: "When old ideas are in the brains of young people, new civilizations cannot enter."

from  [[Fukuzawa Yukichi]]
When [[old ideas]] are in the brain of [[young man]], [[new civilization]] cannot enter.
> The reason why I was so hostile to Chinese studies was because I believed, without a doubt, that Western [[civilization]] would never be able to enter the country at this time of opening to the outside world if old, corrupt Chinese theories were still in the minds of the young students who had come up through the ranks. In all seriousness, I was determined that all the Chinese scholars in Japan should come and I alone would be their partner.
[Fukuzawa Yukichi - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/福澤諭吉)

In [[times of change]], it is [[harmfulness]] to [[educate]] young people with conventional [[thought]] because it was [[once beneficial]], because it prevents them from [[catch-up]] and [[adaptation]] to [[change]]. The activities of individuals who seek to spread harmful [[Bad Memes.]] infections must be stopped.
