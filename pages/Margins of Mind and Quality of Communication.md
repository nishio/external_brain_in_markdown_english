[[Margins of Mind]] and [[Quality of Communication]]
- Summary: Words beyond [[the capacity of the mind]] are unacceptable and often wasted.
    - Information from the outside as well as from the inside can be overwhelming.
    - The desire to help may also be self-fulfilling.

No matter what words you say to someone who is not mentally ready, all you can do is pour water into a vessel that is about to overflow.
We need to communicate to reduce, but we can only communicate to increase.
Quiet room?
Even if you block out information from the outside, it can still get loud from the inside.
The desire to do something about it is not in itself a good intention, but one's own desire.
There may be nothing we can do.
