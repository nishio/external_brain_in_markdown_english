title: "It's so obvious, and you say it like it's a really good story."

> [philomyu](https://x.com/philomyu/status/1811993123905523902) When I used to drink with my friends, we had a mysterious game of "saying amazingly obvious things in a very nice way" and I said, "No matter what direction you're facing, Whatever direction you're headed is the one in front of you." "Try learning any unknown thing once. The next moment it's already your knowledge" are still my favorite to this day, to be honest.

I also like "the first time is not the first time once you've been through it."
