title: "Cybozu Culture"

- [[Cybozu]] as [[culture]] on [workstyle | Cybozu, Inc.](https://cybozu.co.jp/company/work-style/) as of September 2019.

> Culture
> Even if a system is established, it is meaningless unless there is an atmosphere that facilitates its utilization. Cybozu is committed to creating a comfortable working environment that embraces the opinions of its employees by respecting "Sympathy for ideals," "[[Respect for diverse personalities]]," and the following culture, and by instilling the concept of "accountability and question responsibility.
- > Culture of "[[fairness]]"
    - > "To be able to say out loud that something is right even if it comes to light in public. We define this as the basic code of conduct at Cybozu for diverse employees to work in the same team.
- > Culture of Independence and Discussion
    - > With an emphasis on diversity, there is no single answer, so we need a means for employees to constructively discuss and solve problems with each other. We repeatedly conduct in-house training on the "[[problem-solving]] method" and familiarize employees with the concept of "[[accountability]] and [[answerability]].
- > Culture of "Purpose over rules
    - > No matter what kind of system is used, if it is used without understanding its purpose, it is difficult to achieve the desired effect. In addition, it is important to share and sympathize with the objectives because it costs a great deal to create and operate a strict system.

- > It is important to share and sympathize with the objectives because it is very costly to create and operate a strict system.
- I think some people might interpret this expression as "Since it costs a great deal to create and operate a rigorous system, the objectives should be shared and sympathized with, and each individual should bear the great cost of operating such a rigorous system".
- But I think what he means is, "It is important to share and sympathize with the objectives and flexibly allow deviations from the rules or change the rules as long as they are in line with the objectives, rather than trying to create strict rules because it is very costly to create and implement a strict system.
- The title says "purpose over rules."
- For those accustomed to the Cybozu culture, it is easy to take the latter interpretation for granted, but there are those in the world who would interpret the former

[[Diverse personalities]].
