- [[Walter Benjamin]] ([[Walter Benjamin]]) discussed the value of a work of art and the uniqueness of its experience through the concept of "[[aura]]". The following is a brief summary of the main points.

Definition of aura
- An aura is a kind of "unique presence" or "sense of distance" that a work of art possesses.
- The sense of "only here" or "something special for this moment" when looking at a natural landscape or a work of art hits the aura.

Relationship to Reproduction Technology
- Benjamin's famous article, "[[Works of Art in the Age of Reproduction Technology]]" (1936), states that the development of reproduction techniques such as photography and film has resulted in the loss of aura.
- We believed that with reproduction technology, works of art lose their "[[uniqueness]]" because they are mass-produced and detached from their spatial and temporal context.

Effects of aura loss
- Collapse of traditional values
    - The loss of the aura makes the work of art independent of its ritual or religious context and facilitates direct contact with the audience.

- Possibility of politicization
    - As the public gains access to works of art through reproduction techniques, art is more likely to be used as a vehicle for political [[propaganda]] and [[enlightenment]].

- Creating new experiences
    - New art forms such as film, Benjamin suggests, have the potential for "[[collective experience]]" and "[[social critique]]" that differ from the traditional aura.

Benjamin's aura theory provides an important perspective on the relationship between art and technology, and it also provides a clue to the state of art in today's digital culture.
