>  The point here is that he is a subtle taker without realizing it, so he doesn't realize he is a taker, but rather thinks he is a giver...

This is the reason for the sense of exhaustion and exhaustion. This leads to a sense of exhaustion and futility, and the child begins to vaguely believe that "giving involves a one-sided sacrifice.
