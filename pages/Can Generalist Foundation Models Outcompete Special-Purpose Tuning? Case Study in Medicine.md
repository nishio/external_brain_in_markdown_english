Can Generalist Foundation Models Outcompete Special-Purpose Tuning? Case Study in Medicine

It is not necessarily correct to say that it is strong because it is specialized for Japanese or medical care. Of course, the computational cost falls, and it is not affected by the rules and biases of the operator, so it may be better in that respect.

>  Article Summary
>  General-purpose foundational models such as the GPT-4 have shown remarkable ability in a variety of tasks without domain-specific training. However, there is a general consensus that domain-specific competence requires training in models using specialized knowledge. In this study, we conducted an exploratory study of prompt engineering for the GPT-4 using medically relevant benchmarks and showed that it is possible to demonstrate superior expertise competence without domain-specific fine-tuning.

>  In general, the larger the model, the more training data is needed, so I think there is a non-zero possibility that GPT-4 has already been trained.

> [y_matsuwitter](https://twitter.com/y_matsuwitter/status/1731309738657526014) There are multiple points of contention.
>  ・Is GPT-4 more powerful than specialized types?
>  ・Can a generic model achieve high accuracy through inference capability?
>  ・Does the general-purpose model enhance over the specialized model by using inference ability and knowledge of each domain for learning?
>  So, this paper is about the first, the second is as you say, and if the third is possible, it seems possible that each large-scale infrastructure model will gain high capability in each domain in the future.

I agree. This is a problem before the contamination of the training data, and it is a bad paper.
