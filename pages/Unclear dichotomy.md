A concept A and a concept B are considered to be "opposing concepts.
But cannot clearly explain the boundaries of A and B = [[Unclear concept]].

The use of this type of concept is a catalyst for vacillation in the discussion.

- We may agree on a few straightforward examples
    - But agreement on cases is not agreement on boundaries.

- Let's clarify boundaries to improve, you might think.
    - There may be no clear boundaries to begin with: [[False dichotomy]].
        - Maybe we should define the [[axis]] and discuss the [[continuous value]] of "strong/weak characteristics" in that axis direction.

- [[indistinctness]]
