This paper discusses the concept of a "[[technological singularity]]" in which rapid advances in technology will produce beings with [[intelligence beyond that of humans]] within 30 years. The main points are as follows.
- The development of AI, computer networks, and close human-computer interfaces could produce intelligence beyond that of humans.
- This "singularity" will come very rapidly and will go beyond human comprehension.
- The arrival of the singularity is inevitable and cannot be prevented even by government regulation.
- The post-singularity world will be so different that it cannot be captured within the framework of human values.
- [[Intelligence Amplification]] (IA) is another path to the Singularity and should be pursued through human-machine collaboration.
- The best we can do is to continue our research now so that we can make the singularity better.

The author states that he does not know what the post-singularity world will look like, but that it will be positioned within a long tradition of change and cooperation, and he also stresses the need for careful preparation for the singularity.
