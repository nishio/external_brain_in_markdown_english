title: "Digitization made it visible."

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1658620182984790017?s=20): I think I saw something about how what appears to be "[[digitization]] caused a problem" may actually be "originally there was a problem but it wasn't visible, [[[digitization]] made it visible"... I think I've seen a story that what appears to be "[[digitization]] caused a problem" is actually "a problem that was originally there but was not visible, but became visible after [[digitization]]", but I don't know where I saw it...

> [@takiuchi](https://twitter.com/takiuchi/status/1658633719119511553?s=20): I think it's a universal problem, regardless of digitization or anything else, that [[problem visualization]] tends to be perceived negatively.
