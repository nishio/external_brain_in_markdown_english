- > As well as belonging to a certain region, individuals belong to a global "[[region]]" in terms of interest systems and other phases. The [[NAM]] is a [[rhizomatic association]] composed of such [[pluralism]] "regions"...(p.21)
        - [A concept similar to the "network structure of a small dense community" that I wrote about in [[Unexplored as a network formation system]].
        - I hadn't thought of the term "[[lysozyme]]-like association."
        - I read the geographical [[geographical]] abstraction as a hooked bracketed [["region"]].
            - [[global "region"]].
            - Would [[Community]] be a better word for people today?

p.24
- The idea of making volunteer work a [[reciprocal exchange]] rather than just a one-way gift by paying in [[LETS]] currency is discussed.
    - [[Local Exchange Trading System]]
        - [[local currency]]
