title: "Make three kinds of works."
---

By creating three pieces of work, the artist's ability as an artist as well as the quality of a single piece will be evaluated. With three pieces of production results, "what can be created" will become clear, increasing the chances of orders and project consultations.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>

    - [[Version 3 will be decent.]]

    - [[What we made]] and [[what we can make]]

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/875726101133139969) [[media art]] I often tell people who want to do it,
>  If you want to be an artist, make three different kinds of works.
>
>  With one piece of work, you can only evaluate it in terms of dots, but with two pieces, it becomes a line, [[and]] with three pieces, it becomes a plane evaluation. You need a plane of how you see the world.
>
>  Many students only make one and it disappears while they are still students.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/875729218990096384) If there is only one work, though, it is only evaluated by the quality of that work,
>  Three pieces of work will be evaluated for [[capability]] to produce that work.
>  Switch from the subtractive point method of work evaluation to the additive point method of ability evaluation.
>
>  This switches the thinking to, "Can we order work from this guy?" This switches the thinking to "Can we order work from this guy?
>  So make three pieces of artwork.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/875732458427129856) No one wants what you made, though,
>  There are lots of people who want what you can make.
>
>  What can be made can be expressed as a connected surface with three production achievements.
>  If the aspect there includes what I want, I'll order it,
>  Even if it is a little out of the plane, the consultation on the case will come.
