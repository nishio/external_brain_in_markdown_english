title: "Negative feedback"
---

    - Some people are afraid of [[negative]] [[feedback]].
- I think there are many things to be afraid of, about some of them.
- Says, "What if negative feedback comes in?" [[fear]].
- It's coming, it's coming, it's definitely coming.
    - [[Nothing exists that all admire.]] 。
- No matter what you make, there will always be people who are unhappy with it.
    - It's as natural as [[Cicadas chirp in summer]].
- On the other hand, just because a cicada chirps in the summer does not mean your life is taken.
    - [[No one has ever died from a cicada attack.]]
- It's not a big problem.
