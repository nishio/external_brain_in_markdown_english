- [Strengths of weak ties" by [[granovetter]] means that information with [[novelty (patentability)]] often comes through [[weak connections (e.g., in a relationship)]] such as a friend of a friend or someone you haven't seen in a while, rather than strong connections such as family or co-workers. In this case, the information is often obtained through [[weak connection (e.g., in a relationship)]], such as a friend of a friend or someone you haven't seen in a while, rather than strong connections such as family or colleagues.
It is because [[homogenization of knowledge]] is advanced, which we have because we frequently exchange information with those with whom we have strong connections.

If you look for [[Strengths of weak ties]] and similar structures between concepts and symbols, it means that in discovering "[[New Connections]]" there is more that happens via weak connections rather than strong connections such as well-known textbook structures.
The well-known "connections" described in textbooks have already been [[commoditized]] and have no new value. If you want to create something new and rare, you have to find it yourself by tracing weak connections. [The Serendipity of Random Reading.
