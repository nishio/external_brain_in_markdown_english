title: "Appeal to Strength"
---

- Appeal to strength, the act of showing others that you are superior to them
- In an era when life and death depended on strength, it was probably important to be perceived as "strong."
    - [[The parable of the frightened cat]] 　 [[Mounting is born of insecurity.]]
- Cats make threats and try to make their bodies look bigger to be perceived as "strong".
- It looks funny from the side that doesn't want to establish a pecking order based on strength.
