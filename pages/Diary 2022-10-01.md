In the spring, I took a bunch of pictures and said, "I'll post one a day," but I ended up doing that [[You can't say, "I'll do it later."]] So I put it on my diary page the next day right now.
    - [[rape (seed oil plant, Brassica campestris)]]

I woke up at 10pm after falling asleep after dinner because I was tired, then I was sleepy and it's already 27:00, not good.
- If I don't walk by 10:00 tomorrow, I'll be flooded with STEPN energy.

I didn't end up writing a program that I should have written as soon as possible.
- Input to Thompson sampling is buggy.
- Because "images that have not yet been reviewed" are treated as "images that have been reviewed and determined to be bad", they're generating more and more images with keywords that look good and deeming more and more as "bad" and getting lost.

I got up at 9:00 so I could walk.
- They say 10:15 pace per kilometer.

> [@you629](https://twitter.com/you629/status/1575716421866164225?s=21&t=UeO03fOfR8_-IcTRpJrNug): I think it's mostly luck that things work out, but you have to roll the dice a lot to get a good I think it takes effort to get a good roll and effort to be able to hold on to it when you get a good roll, so I think effort is important.
- Even if the essence is dice.
    - Don't worry before you roll the dice, roll quickly."
    - If you get a bad roll, don't dither, roll the dice again right away."
    - When I get a good eye, I grab it right away before someone else takes it."
    - I'm sure you've got the skills to do that.

- [[Difficulty in verifying the usefulness of means and bias in perceptions]]

What I learned from Palmy's free course
- I recognized that what I was trying to learn wasn't learned because I wasn't trying hard enough, but it was surprisingly beneficial.
    - I tried to record the current status on the [[draw-in]] page.
    - But I don't want to post a picture of my naked belly, and nobody wants to see it.
    - I realized, "Why don't I just use the layer function in Crysta to trace and hide the photo layer?"
    - I knew I could change pens, so I went with the one with no pressure.
    - I knew I could change the color of the lines after I drew them, so I googled how to do it.
    - I knew I could adjust the transparency of the layers.
    - I studied for one objective X, and in the process of doing that objective X, I saw a method Y that I didn't really focus on, but when I tried to do another objective Z, I remembered that I had a method Y.


I never knew YouTube had member registration in addition to channel registration.

I was sleeping again after lunch and it was night.
- You shouldn't feel guilty about not doing what you set out to do on your day off.
- It's right to "rest" on your days off.

I saw that if you want to avoid getting sleepy after eating, you should do 10 slow squats right after eating.
- True or not, it seems like it would be beneficial to create an exercise routine that ties in with your eating habits.
- I'm sure I'll be getting more and more limp in the future.

Work to take a long bath with plenty of water
- I got a haircut, shaved my hair, and washed my scalp with persimmon soap.

- [[Fehlerraben]] I got a new one.
