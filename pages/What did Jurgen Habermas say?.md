Jürgen Habermas (Jürgen Habermas) proposed "[[a]] theory of communicative action" in deliberation and developed a unique perspective on [[social consensus]] and [[legitimacy]]. Central to his ideas are the following points.

- [[communication rationale]].
    - Habermas emphasized communicative rationality, which aims to reach consensus through rational discussion. This emphasizes the process of reaching common agreement through mutual understanding, rather than mere [[instrumental rationality]] ([[means to an end]]).

- Importance of the Public Sphere
    - Using the concept of the "public sphere," he emphasized the importance of a place where people can freely debate each other. He believed that the basis of democracy is for people to reach a mutually acceptable consensus through dialogue in this public sphere.

- [[ideal dialogue situation]].
    - Habermas also proposed the concept of an "ideal speech situation. The ideal situation is one in which all participants are on an equal footing and can freely express their opinions, and it is necessary to have an open dialogue that is not influenced by oppression or power. It is believed that dialogue in this situation enhances the quality of deliberation.

- Legitimacy and Democracy
    - Habermas believed that legitimacy in a democratic society comes through [[free and open deliberation]]. Therefore, he viewed deliberation itself, not merely the process of voting and decision-making, as an important element of political and social legitimacy.

Through these ideas, Habermas systematized the importance of deliberation and its methods in a democracy, and greatly influenced modern theories of [[deliberation democracy]].
