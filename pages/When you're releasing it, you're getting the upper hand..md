title: "When you're releasing it, you're getting the upper hand."

> [kaityo256](https://twitter.com/kaityo256/status/1725491578775753106) At the end of the Git/GitHub exercise, I asked the students to make a simple game to experience how hard it is to [[complete]] something. The feedback was, "From now on, I'll try not to call [[a shitty game]] a [[shitty]] game. A shitty game is only [[the best part]] when it makes it to [[release]]. The real bad projects don't make it to release.

> [kaityo256](https://twitter.com/kaityo256/status/1725494182515798224) I would like to see students become [[value producers]], not just value consumers. I hope they will at least have a minimum of respect for the producers of value.
