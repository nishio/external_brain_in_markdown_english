title: "Discord Katakana Tsu Incident"
---

Incident in which the katakana character "ts" was changed to a character form between "shi" and "ts".
- 2022-12-03 Corrected.
- Emoticons ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ for appearance in the (interpretation)
- Made by a designer who does not understand that there are "ts" and "shi" in Japanese (interpretation).

> [@geo_vitya](https://twitter.com/geo_vitya/status/1598517035902078977?s=20&t=dbE7u24hUFIHD1SvusDF4Q): Hey @discord, gg sans contains ツ and No but they are not only for "¯\_(ツ)_/¯". They are Japanese characters.
> Currently, gg sans breaks Japanese sentences' visual.
> Could you revert the design of this?
> tbh, I'm sad cuz my mother tongue's characters are consumed as just symbols
