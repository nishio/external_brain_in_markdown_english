- 1: Starting from a point S, one attempts to reach a goal G but encounters an [[obstacle]], leading to a [[change of course]] and settling for a different goal G'.
- 2: Instead of changing course after hitting the obstacle, one thinks it would be smoother to change course from the start.
- 3: Even when the obstacle disappears over time, without realizing it, one continues to believe that the "smooth path to the compromised goal" is correct and repeats it.

In a situation where those who experienced (1) are gone and (2) is repeated, such a conversation occurs:
- Conversation
    - New Person: "Why don't we go straight to G? Why choose G' instead of G?"
    - Old Person: "We've always done it this way!"
- When the new person tries their own approach,
    - They easily proceed straight to G and wonder, "What was that all about?" (3)
    - Or, the obstacle is still there, and they hit it just like in (1), thinking, "I see."
- Those who are convinced by "we've always done it this way" and choose to repeat it continue the extension of (2).

[[Seen in a Dream]]

This was thought to be the [[Principle of the Emergence of Old Habits]], but it is more about how an organization clings to inefficient methods rather than individual behavior.
- [[Organizational Stubbornness]]
- [[Organizational Inertia]]

Among what is called [[technical debt]], there are cases where, given the circumstances at the time of creation, it was necessary to bend the ideal G and implement G', or there was no straightforward implementation. However, changes in circumstances later may render such code unnecessary.
