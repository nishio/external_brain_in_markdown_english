## Two kinds of tacit knowledge
.
I think the discussion about the meaning of the term "tacit knowledge" is too abstract and will not lead to much improvement in your intellectual productivity. However, many people seem to be interested in it, so I will explain it in the form of a column.

When Polanyi proposed the concept of what we now call "tacit knowledge (knowledge management terminology)" in his 1958 book "[[personal knowledge]]," he used both [[tacit knowing]] and [tacit In Japanese, [[knowing]] is also called [[knowledge]]. In Japanese, both [[knowing]] and [[knowledge]] are translated as "knowledge," so it is difficult to distinguish between the two. A softer translation would be the difference between "knowing implicitly" and "knowing implicitly.

The subtitle of "Personal Knowledge" was "[[Toward]] a De-Critical Philosophy. Let us delve into what "[[critical philosophy]]" means. [Since [[Descartes]] proposed [[methodic doubt]] in his Principles of Philosophy in 1644, [[Western philosophy]] has emphasized the linguistic process of thinking, "questioning what we take for granted. Kant] considered this doubt ([[criticism]]) to be the most important task of philosophy, and he published books that included the word "criticism," such as [[Critique of Pure Reason (Kritik der reinen Vernunft) (Kant)]], [[Critique of Practical Reason]], and **Critique of Practical Reason**, **Critique of Practical Reason**, and [[Critique of Practical Reason]], **Critique of Practical Reason**. judgment criticism]" were published between 1781 and 1790. The term "critical philosophy" in the title of Polanyi's book refers to this.

Polanyi believed that explicit, linguistic "criticism" was not the only way to create something new, and his 1966 book "[[Dimensions of tacit knowledge]]" (originally titled "The Tacit Dimension") spoke of an implicit, nonverbal dimension that was distinct from the explicit, linguistic dimension. The Tacit Dimension" (originally titled "The Tacit Dimension") is about the tacit, non-verbal dimension, which is different from the explicit, verbal dimension. In this book, "tacit knowledge is about implicitly perceiving something that will one day be discovered, but for now is hidden." (p. 48), "a sense of itself that senses that it is closing in on a solution" (p. 50).

Polanyi envisioned primarily the process of scientific discovery. So his ideas are not at odds with those of Descartes and Kant, but probably due to the difference in the nature of the fields: science, where knowledge is gained through hypothesis making and experimentation, and philosophy, where experimentation is not possible. (2023 added: supplemented below)

In his 1996 book "[[knowledge creation company]]," management scholar Ikujiro Nonaka divided knowledge into tacit and formal knowledge based on Polanyi's ideas, added the dimension of whether knowledge resides in individuals or organizations, and discussed knowledge creation within organizations. Polanyi's interest is in the knowledge of the individual scientist. While Polanyi's interest was knowledge creation by individual scientists, Ikujiro Nonaka's interest was knowledge creation within organizations.

Ikujiro Nonaka believed that individuals, not organizations, create knowledge, and that individual knowledge creation is facilitated by social interaction within organizations. He proposed the following four modes of knowledge transformation. The acronym SECI model is used to represent the four modes of knowledge transformation.

- Collaboration" (Socialization) that turns individual tacit knowledge into organizational tacit knowledge.
- Externalization" to convert tacit knowledge into formal knowledge
- Combination" (turning individual formal knowledge into systematic formal knowledge)
- Internalization" to convert formal knowledge into tacit knowledge

In this context, the term "tacit knowledge" refers to that which is transformed into formal knowledge through representation. It is, so to speak, "[[empirical knowledge that]] has not yet been verbalized." This seems to me to be different from Polanyi's "[[a]] sense of whether or not one is approaching a solution to a problem. On the other hand, there are those who argue that this sense may have been acquired empirically, and therefore Polanyi's tacit knowledge may be part of Ikujiro Nonaka's tacit knowledge.

My personal feeling is that we would be closer to solving the problem if we did not try to equate or encompass the two usages.

> Polany envisioned primarily the process of scientific discovery. So his ideas are not at odds with those of Descartes and Kant, but probably due to the difference in the nature of the fields: science, where knowledge is gained through hypothesis making and experimentation, and philosophy, where experimentation is not possible.
With this contrast between "science" and "philosophy," I thought the reader would not know "which side he or she is on.
When the reader is solving everyday problems, it falls on the side of "science. As an example of everyday problem solving, consider, for example, a mailbox that does not open and close smoothly, and you try repeatedly tapping, pulling, opening and closing the mailbox. This is a hypothetical example of seeing the problem of "not opening and closing smoothly," and thinking, "Maybe if I pull it, it will fix it?" and then conducts an experiment to test the hypothesis by pulling it, and verifies the hypothesis by looking at the result that "it did not fix it. This is the [[hypothesis testing]] cycle of [[empirical science]].
How did you choose to try at this time? Why, for example, did they not choose "pray to God" or "sleep overnight"? Because I implicitly feel that "that doesn't seem to fix it". Conversely, you implicitly feel "good" about the "pull" option. On the other hand, since you "tried it and it didn't work," you did not know the "right" answer. Therefore, this case is an example of "not knowing what the right answer is, and in a situation where you are searching for it, you are choosing an action according to a feeling that is not explicitly stated.

Descartes says "[[I think, therefore I am]]" and so on. This is a story about how he went through the process of thinking about what could be said to be right if he did not believe what he saw to be right, and he thought that "I think, therefore I am" seemed to be right. This is a discussion based on the assumption that it cannot be verified by experiment, so the results of this discussion cannot, of course, be verified experimentally either. Since most readers will not be in a position to believe anything they see or sense with their own eyes, it is a good idea to go through the hypothesis testing cycle of experimental science.

(Column) Two kinds of tacit knowledge
Discussion about the meaning of tacit knowledge is too abstract, I think that it will not lead to your intellectual productivity improvement too much. However, since there seem to be many people who are interested, I will explain it in the form of a column.

When [[Michael Polanyi]] proposed the concept of tacit knowledge in the book "[[Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy]]" in 1958, he used the expression of both "[[tacit knowing]]" and "[[tacit knowledge]]". In Japanese, "knowing" and "knowledge" are both translated as "[[CHISHIKI]]", so it is difficult to distinguish between the two. If I dare to translate it with a softer word, those would be "AN-NI-SHIRU-KOTO" and "AN-NI-SHITTE-IRU-KOTO".

[[René Descartes]] suggested methodological skepticism in the book "[[Principles of Philosophy]]" in 1644.
Since it the linguistic thinking process of "doubting what I think is natural" has been emphasized in the Western philosophy.
[[Immanuel Kant]] believed that this suspicion (criticism) is the most important task of philosophy.
He published the book "Critique of Pure Reason", "Critique of Practical Reason" and "Critique of Judgment" in 1781 to 1790.
The word "Critical Philosophy" in the title of the book of Polanyi means this kind of philosophy.

Polanyi thought that new things were not created by explicit and linguistic "criticism" alone. He published another book "[[The Tacit Dimension]]" in 1966. In the book he talked about an implicit non-linguistic dimension, apart from the explicit and linguistic dimension. He wrote, "Tacit knowledge is the implicit perception of something that will be discovered someday but is hidden for now" (p. 48) "(Tacit knowing is) your own feeling that you are approaching to a solution."(p.50).
(Notice for non-Japanese readers: the quote and page number are from Japanese translation.)

Polanyi assumed mainly the process of scientific discovery. In this regard, his thought is not conflicting with the thought of ​​Descartes or Kant. The difference depends on the difference in the nature of the field between the science which can obtain knowledge by making a hypothesis and experiment and the philosophy which can not be experimented.

A management scientist [[Ikujiro Nonaka]] published his book "[[The Knowledge-Creating Company]]" in 1996.
Based on Polanyi's ideas, he divided knowledge into tacit knowledge and formal knowledge. And then he added the dimension of whether knowledge resides in individuals or in organizations. It is to discuss knowledge creation within organizations.
While Polanyi's interest focused on knowledge creation of individual scientists, Nonaka's interest was knowledge creation within organizations.

Nonaka believes that the subject of knowledge creation is not an organization but an individual, and personal knowledge creation is promoted by social interaction within the organization. Then he proposed the following four knowledge conversion modes. After those initial letters, the model is called [[SECI model]].

- [[Socialization]]: Converting the tacit knowledge of individuals into an implicit knowledge of the organization
- [[Externalization]]: Converting tacit knowledge to formal knowledge
- [[Combination]]: Concatenating formal knowledges to make systematic formal knowledge
- [[Internalization]]: Converting formal knowledge to tacit knowledge

In this context the term "tacit knowledge" refers to what can be converted into formal knowledge by expressions. So to speak, it is 'empirical knowledge that has not been translated yet'. This seems to be different from Polanyi's "sense of feeling if you are approaching the solution of the problem". On the other hand, the feeling was acquired empirically, so there is also a claim that Polanyi's tacit knowledge is part of Nonaka's tacit knowledge.

My personal feeling is that we will get closer to solving the problem if we do not equate or try to encompass these two usages.
