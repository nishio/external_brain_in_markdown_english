## key found
- GPT-4 class models can move opinions as well as or better than humans.
    - In a randomized controlled trial, GPT-4 who were given profile information showed a higher success rate of persuasion than their human debate partners.
- Four operating levers that influence persuasiveness.
    1. [[Personalization]]: Inserting context tailored to the person's interests and personality will jump-start the effect.
    2. prompt design:
        - Clearly state roles such as "logic oriented" and "expert tone" → Increased credibility
        - Indicate "neutral, facts only" → persuasive power can be intentionally suppressed
    - 3.Strategy Extraction + IR Pipeline:
        - Automatic tagging of persuasion strategies from drafts written by LLMs → Search adds support only for unverified claims
        - Zero-shot method that can be both factual and persuasive
    4. multi-agent dialogue:
        - If the "persuader" and "skeptic" roles are assigned to different LLMs for automatic discussion, more in-depth discussion data can be generated.
- Relationship between model size and persuasiveness.
    - The effect is large when the model is raised from small to medium size, but diminishes from there. The advantage of the giant model appears mainly in the consistency of dialogue and the stability of fact generation.
