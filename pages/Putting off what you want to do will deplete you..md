title: "Putting off what you want to do will deplete you."

- [[want to do]] things that [[want to do]] [[postpone]] and [[deplete]] them.
> [origamicat](https://twitter.com/origamicat/status/1691859607722082585) "Having something to do" is more of a gift than anything else.
>  Let's value "I want to do this" that comes from the bottom of our hearts, not "I want to be great," "I want to be respected," "I want to be rich," or "I want to be.
>  This talent is depleted by continuing to put it off to the future and ignore it. We can only face what we want to do now.
