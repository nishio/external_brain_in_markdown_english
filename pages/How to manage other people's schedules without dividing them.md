    - [[Tomoya Tachikawa]] > Even if we outsource the work, we need to be responsible for [[Schedule Management]].
- nishio>Please let me know if you find a solution to the problem of "I'm not even good at managing my own schedule, can I even [[Manage others' schedules]]?
- Tachikawa> The current hypothesis is that "it is effective to manage your tasks and others' tasks in parallel and on the same calendar, without separating them.
- nishio> I see what you mean, "multiple cores to execute but one scheduler".

        - [[One pocket principle]]
    - → We could call it the [[Scheduler One Principle]].
- Tachikawa> [[How not to "divide" is important.]]
