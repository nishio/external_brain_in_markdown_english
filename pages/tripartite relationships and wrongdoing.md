[[tripartite relationship]] and [[iniquity]].
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>A tripartite relationship refers to the social dynamic that occurs when a third party is added to a relationship between two people. This relationship can take many forms, including cooperation, competition, and arbitration. Wrongdoing refers to behavior that violates social expectations or obligations and can be an obstacle in building trust and mutual understanding. When wrongdoing occurs in the context of a tripartite relationship, it can upset the balance of the relationship and lead to loss of trust and social exclusion.

- [[SOC]]
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Social capital refers to the value and resources obtained through relationships and networks. This concept shows how social connections and interactions generate economic and social benefits. Social capital manifests itself in the form of trust, mutual understanding, information sharing, and the promotion of cooperation.
    - [[Expanded reproduction in social capital]]
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The extended reproduction of social capital refers to the process by which social networks and relationships create additional value and resources over time. This is accomplished by expanding connections and strengthening trust. Individuals and groups甔 can create new opportunities and secure competitive advantages by effectively leveraging social capital.

            - The perspective that [[Connections are not how many people you know, but how many people know you...]] highlights an important aspect of social capital.
        - This shows that it is more important how many people [[trust]] you and how many valuable relationships you are able to build than simply knowing a lot of people.
        - This understanding underscores the importance of building deep relationships and creating mutual value through them in business and social activities.
    - What is dishonesty?
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The term "dishonor" refers to acts that violate social commitments, expectations, and obligations. In Japanese culture and society, dishonor is considered a serious problem that undermines trust and integrity in relationships. Specifically, dishonor includes breaking a promise, failing to be courteous to the other party, or failing to meet expectations. This is true not only in personal relationships, but also in business dealings and social interactions. Being dishonest can lead to a loss of trust, which in turn can lead to a deterioration of the relationship.
    - [[Trust comes from making promises and keeping them.]]

        - What is the mechanism?
            - Become a source of [future predictability
            - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - [Exchange of Promises: The first step in building trust is the exchange of promises. This may include formal agreements, but also occurs at the level of informal promises and expectations.
                - [Fulfillment of Promises: Keeping promises forms the foundation of trust. Trust is strengthened when the other party is seen to keep their promises.
                - [Time passage: Trust is built over time. Repeated promises kept strengthen the relationship and increase trust.
        - Trust is considered a form of social capital and plays an important role in promoting cooperation and efficient interaction.

I see [[illusory capital]] triggered and then converted into [[SOC]] through a series of [[fulfilled promises]].
