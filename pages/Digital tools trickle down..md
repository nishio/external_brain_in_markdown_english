- [[Digital Tools]] [trickle down

- This is an interesting angle.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

- Capital does not trickle down because it can be stored indefinitely.
- Capitalists' [[capital investment]] to increase productive forces increases capitalists' earnings in the short term.
    - but competition among capitalists will allow consumers to obtain goods at lower prices in the long run.
    - This causes trickle down.
- Digital tools have a very low cost of production, so the investment is not in "increasing production capacity" but in "producing higher quality
    - Lower human cost to provide high quality products to everyone than to produce high quality products and low quality products
    - So trickle down occurs.
        - Really?
            - Why not just offer it only to those who pay enough?
            - Ah, so when competition arises between capitalists, the side with the trust that "what they offer is of higher quality" wins, so it is advantageous to offer advanced products in [[freemium]].
                - DeepL was able to win customers because it showed freemium that it could do more advanced translations than Google Translate.
