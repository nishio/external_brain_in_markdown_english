- I don't hear [[Work BGM]] anymore.
    - [[High-speed playback]]
- Often [[young people's ability to process information is higher than the median of society]].
    - [Because as you get older, your cognitive ability goes down.
- The science museum's [[audio commentary is sluggish]].
    - More muddled than the museum's.
    - There's no in-depth story because of the volume issue.
- [[A network of knowledge allows for fast travel]].
        - Not satisfied with speed for those without [Knowledge Network
