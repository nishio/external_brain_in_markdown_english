title: "QV is a meaningful mechanism for not voting"
---

[[Quadratic Voting]] is about the importance of a mechanism that makes sense for not voting.


Summary from [/plurality-japanese/Glen in Japan Panel DiscussionTranscript machine translation#6599f369aff09e00008f2282
- > [[Glen Weyl]]: as [[Hannah Arendt.]] said, [[freedom from politics is one of the greatest freedoms]]. Democracy, misperceived or falsely pursued, is the violence of politics. It is a mistake that people have to think about something very far from their experience. It is not [[democracy]] but [[diversity]]. There are many different technologies and many different scales of interaction at the same time, and I don't think the image of [[one vote per person]] or the image of political quality is appropriate.
    - I see, so "people have to think about things that are very far from their experience" is a problem.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - So we use mechanisms like [[Quadratic Voting]], where it makes sense not to vote.
- [[Freedom not to be forced to vote on subjects in which you have no interest]]
- 2024-01-11I noticed the above and posted that I see what you mean.

- [[Quadratic Voting]] gives you an incentive not to vote for things you're not interested in.
- QV does not mandate a statement of intent for all agenda items
- Therefore, it can reflect your own preferences more.
    - People who are seriously affected by an agenda vote more on that agenda.
        - People who don't get affected much don't vote/vote less.
- Q: Could not voting lead to the collapse of democracy?
    - People don't vote because they are not clear on how their voting decisions will affect them.
    - Abstention happens because the current democracy is a system where people are "asked to vote for something they can't see the effect on them," and this is a problem with the system.
        - [["Not voting is a bad thing" is an unfounded assumption]].
    - They will vote for topics that they can see the impact on them and that are of individual interest to them.
        - You like to talk about subjects that are familiar to you.
        - The problem is that the agenda setting for the vote is not familiar.
            - And the reason why is because the cost of running [[paper and box polls]] is so high.
            - Frequency and bandwidth are insufficient: [[Digital natives don't think that once-every-four-years upload bandwidth is enough.]]
    - QV is "not voting" is a meaningful action in the system
        - Do not force people to vote for things they are not interested in
        - You can vote for as many things as you are interested in.
        - This allows for a "strength of interest" statement
        - Better than the current "[One vote per person, whether interested or not.


- [[radical market]] p.137-138 [[Quadratic Voting]].
- > "Like saving money to buy a car or a house [[to save up to vote]].
- > One person casts one vote and the majority wins. We are used to such a political system.
- >  But Kentaro can cast more than one vote. If he is willing to give up the right to exercise influence on issues that are not that important to him, he can exercise greater influence on issues that are important to him than he could under a one-person, one-vote system. Kentaro has the same right to participate as everyone else, and he accumulates the same rate of voting credits as everyone else, but he chooses to use his vote only on the issues that are most important to him.
- > This chapter will show that the ability to store voting power and the square root function are two factors that are more necessary than anything else to cure the pathologies of the traditional voting system used in democracy.
Save your vote: another expression regarding [QV assumes continuing value of voice credit


- [[QV solves the problem of compromise.]]
