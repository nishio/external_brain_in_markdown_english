    - In [[China]], the demand for donkey skins as a material for traditional medicines is growing rapidly, and this has led to increased imports of donkey skins from [[Africa]]. According to a South African institute, out of only about 50 million [[donkeys]] in the world, Chinese producers consume the skins of about 5 million a year(1)
- This increased demand has led to widespread poaching and black market trade in Africa, resulting in a sharp decline in the donkey population (5).
- The export of donkey skins to China may also spread dangerous infectious diseases (4).
- The issue of donkey skin between China and Africa is being addressed and a sustainable solution is needed.
