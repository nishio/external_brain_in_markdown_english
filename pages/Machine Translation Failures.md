title: "Machine Translation Failures"
---

I was about to mention [/nishio-en/Manazuru 2023-05-13#655683ccaff09e0000f415f7](https://scrapbox.io/nishio-en/Manazuru 2023-05-13#655683ccaff09e0000f415f7) and noticed the translation `He's wearing a [Nishikigoi NFT] T-shirt!` The indicative pronoun of Audrey is She, which is not good.

I checked the original Japanese and found this: `[Nishikigoi NFT] is wearing a T-shirt! `
The translation is: `Wearing a [Nishikigoi NFT] T-shirt!`]
In other words, the original Japanese does not contain information on the gender of the subject in the first place. In Japanese, the subject is often omitted. Therefore, the need to distinguish whether it is he or she in this situation does not arise. This is not a mistranslation, but rather a mistaken assumption by the translation AI, which was asked to fill in the missing gender information, that the subject was male.

This is an interesting case study.
