I sometimes go around and tell them that it's not true, but they tend to think that I am an abnormal person. It's so bad that I get emotional about it, but it's still strange.

I really want you to quit talking about things that have nothing to do with professional racing while claiming to be the origin of "current" professional racing. I really wish people who don't care about the origins of professional racing would quit talking about it, especially if it has nothing to do with the current professional racing.
