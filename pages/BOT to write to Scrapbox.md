[[Scrapbox's writing API]] is in demand, but it's being turned down.
[I want to create and update pages with API - Request to Scrapbox [https://scrapbox.io/forum-jp/API%E3%81%A7%E3%83%9A%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B8%E3%82%92%E4%BD%9C%E6%88%90%E3%](https://scrapbox.io/forum-jp/API%E3%81%A7%E3%83%9A%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B8%E3%82%92%E4%BD%9C%E6%88%90%E3%) 83%BB%E6%9B%B4%E6%96%B0%E3%81%97%E3%81%9F%E3%81%84]

> A lot of automated posts by bots [[making a house into a garbage dump]] where humans are making page links and engaging in intelligent activity.
> The pages that are thrown in are not maintained with any links, etc.

Logically:.
- If you have a project where the bot writes separately from where the humans are active, why is that a problem?
- Why don't the BOT just maintain the link?

> [@blu3mo](https://twitter.com/blu3mo/status/1627843388132278273?s=20): Looking at all the things you can do with large language models in combination with [[external brain]]-like tools, I'm starting to wish Scrapbox would grow an API to make bots, etc. I'm starting to want to see Scrapbox grow up.
> The point that "Bot activity makes a garbage dump" seems to be based on the premise that bots are incapable of intelligent activity, but looking at GPT3 and others, that premise is falling apart, isn't it?

- [[Write Only Member]] is a [[Write Only]] issue
- If it's a bot that reads and React, there's a chance it won't be a problem.
- The WOM article was written in 2019, when ChatGPT was not yet a hot topic and programs to understand natural language were not readily available
