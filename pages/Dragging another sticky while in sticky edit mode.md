from  [[Implement adding stickies on Paper.js]]
Dragging another sticky while in sticky edit mode
If you drag another sticky while in sticky edit mode
The last sticky touched should be highlighted and editable.
...no matter what you touch, the "Editing Highlight" should remain the same and it should be able to be edited.
I wonder which one.

relevance
- Text to be updated now: Sticky note at the end
    - I thought if I added a sticky, that would be fine since it's definitely at the end of the STATE.
- (If you drag or draw a path while changing the text of a sticky, complications may arise, but is that necessary in the first place?)
    - (after neg. verb stem) seeming necessary
