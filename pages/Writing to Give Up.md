title: "Writing to Give Up"
---

[[Kinta Nakayama]] said at the reception at [[CUMOT2018]].
It's an interesting phrase and makes a lot of sense to me, but the listeners were surprised, so it would be beneficial to get it straightened out.

My own interpretation
- Having an idea without making it public makes it feel important.
- If you don't take action, you'll be holding on to that idea forever.
    - But I'm busy with a lot of things and don't act on them = low priority in my mind.
- If there is no response from the public, they can give up on the idea.
- If there is a response from the public, you can act with confidence = higher priority for you.
