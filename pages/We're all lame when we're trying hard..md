title: "We're all lame when we're trying hard."

> [Ryota](https://x.com/Ryota/status/1900461512780890390) I know what you mean, but when you're just starting out, you have to use what's available. I also started at the University of Tokyo! I was also saying things like "From the University of Tokyo" and "Ex-Deutsche". It's not cool to eat that way all the time, but I think it's tacky not to do everything you can. The coolest people are the ones who work hard to achieve results.

Everyone [[is]] [[uncool]] when they're [[trying]] hard.

That's true.
- If someone says, "Isn't it kind of lame to say ex-Keyence or ex-Yahoo and do business with them," it's cool if their business is successful, but if it's not successful, it's just a sneer and lame, and if someone who hasn't started a business says it, it's lame to say things without risk.
- The past is lame because it's an old story.
- Talking about affiliation is lame, with a sense of "did you contribute to the awesomeness of that organization you belong to?
- So talking about past affiliations is super lame.
- However, making the decision "but it's lame, so I won't use it" when there is a possibility that using it will be beneficial to the realization of the ideal is lame because it is a behavior that is more concerned about how others see one's external appearance than the realization of the ideal.
    - Whoa, [[metadowniness]].
