> [tshun423](https://twitter.com/tshun423/status/1482291805047894020): I heard [[Kazuo Inamori]] said "[[Pricing is management]]", but lately I often think "[pricing I often think that "[[pricing]] is [[preparedness]]". Pricing is preparedness to say, "I will give this much value for this job. If you set a price, you must be able to return more than that value, and if you don't think you can deliver that value, you shouldn't accept the job at that price in the first place.
