Recognizing the limits of our own understanding and listening to the ideas and perspectives of others will enable us to make better decisions and reform our political system<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/omni/icon' alt='omni.icon' height="19.5"/>

- > When we recognize the limits of our own understanding, we become more humble and open to listening to other people's ideas and perspectives...
- > At the time of this writing, American politics is severely polarized. Liberals and conservatives oppose each other's viewpoints, and as a result, Democrats and Republicans are unable to find consensus or compromise. The U.S. Congress is unable to pass even bland legislation. The Senate prevents the administration from appointing high-ranking judicial and executive officials simply because the candidates are from another party.
- > One of the reasons for this stalemate is that neither politicians nor voters realize how limited their understanding is. Without exception, issues that are important enough to spark a national debate are the most difficult to understand... The world is full of complexity. If everyone understood that, society would not be so polarized.
