title: "The problem is that we are stuck in a model based on population growth."

> [hbkr](https://x.com/hbkr/status/1802044282435743777) The problem is not that [[population decline]] is a problem, but that we are still stuck in a model based on [[population growth]] and [[economic growth]]. Japan has achieved affluence since the end of World War II, but as a nation, we are sinking without being able to design a model for the future.
