title: "I'm too good at Japanese."

Since I am good at Japanese, I can make sentences that somehow make sense even if I don't understand them.
As a result, they lose the opportunity to realize the fact that they don't "get it".

I have been trying to express sentences written in Japanese into English without using difficult vocabulary as much as possible for a little over three months.
    - [[Engineers' Intellectual Production Methods English Project]]
- As a result, I realized
- The Japanese language we normally use uses too much difficult vocabulary.

Example
    - [[Not changing jobs does not mean maintaining the status quo.]] In [["Whether or not you can relate to the "changing the company and yourself" part is the difference between the two."]] I wrote.
    - What is this "divide"?
        - I don't understand it well. I can't explain it in other words or simple English.
        - In other words, the meaning is not clear.

    - What is [[uncomfortable feeling]]`? Can you explain this in simple words?`

There is a misconception that the meaning of the verbalization is clarified when it is done.
- However, there are sentences in which a word has been placed in a sitting without clarification of meaning.
- He is too good at Japanese, i.e., he has a large number of Japanese example sentences in his brain, which allows him to choose words that sit appropriately by pattern matching.

I'm too good at Japanese.
