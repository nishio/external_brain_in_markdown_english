title: "Do not spoil the manufacturing mindset."
---

- Someone tried programming in a way that I didn't really understand.
- I worked hard to get it to about 90% completion, but some parts are not working right.
- In fact, to achieve our goal, we could have written a one-line import statement without that effort
- Q: Is it OK to say, "To achieve that objective, you need only write this one line of import statement
- Opinion of Nishio
    - not good
    - It's like telling a fisherman, "If you want fish, you can buy it at the supermarket" [[The Parable of the Fish and the Fishing]].
    - Spoil the feeling of having progressed to 90% completion.
        - That kind of experience will make them less likely to "make it on their own" in the future.
        - You start to think, "All I have to do is find the right stuff and import it."
            - In reality, it's unlikely you'll find one that really fits your purpose.
            - Because people's needs are so diverse
            - Look for it, don't find it, and blame others who don't provide it.
            - And what's being offered is also created by someone else.
        - [[No one can make something perfect from the start.]]
        - All artifacts started out as imperfect things by people who were enthusiastic about making them
        - Everyone who uses artifacts is a [[beneficiary]] of the [[Manufacturing Mindset]].
        - Therefore, we must place importance on [[protecting and nurturing the manufacturing mindset]].
        - Do not spoil the manufacturing mindset.
        - Those [[who have the enthusiasm to create]], those [[who have created something imperfect]], are [future treasures
        - Do not undermine their motivation.
