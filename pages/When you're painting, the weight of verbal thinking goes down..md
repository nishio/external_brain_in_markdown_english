When you're painting, the weight of verbal thinking goes down.
This [[design decoupled from use cases]], this [[when drawing]], [[linguistic turn of mind]] had been weighted down.

- Interesting what's going on.

[[draw, then look and observe]]
- And discover
    - If we ignore the pathway that ABC was originally from the same organization at stage 1, then there is no difference between 2 and 3?

Often no linguistic description is included in the illustration
- This is because I tried to translate the Engineer's Intellectual Production Techniques into English myself, and I thought it would be troublesome to translate if the Japanese was written directly on the illustrations.
- I'll draw a diagram on Cosense that doesn't include Japanese, and the style I'm explaining below can be understood by machine translating the explanation below.
- Having done this style for a while, when I'm drawing a diagram, I feel like "I'll write the explanation in text later.
    - Different intellectual production conditions than when writing descriptions in direct language.
    - Expression of thoughts in non-verbal constraining
    - Non-verbal feedback cycle to see and correct output expressed in non-verbal form

relevance
    - [[Diagrams for Communicating and Thinking]]
        - [[Figure to communicate]]
            - [[There are three types of diagrams]]
    - [[Words to express" and "words to communicate to the world at large" are two different things, and after expressing with the former, we organize them and make them into the latter.]]

Past self describes Kozaneba as "a diagram for thinking, not for telling"
- Sure, sometimes I'm a little out of my linguistic mind when I'm arranging sticky notes.
- But I don't feel like I'm free from the language, because the label generally has the language on it.
