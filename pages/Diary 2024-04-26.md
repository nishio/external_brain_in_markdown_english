It's like a fishmonger who gets mad at his customers and says, "Why can't you catch fish by yourself? It's like a fishmonger saying to a customer, "Why can't you catch the fish yourself? I thought, "If anything, I should be thankful to them...".

I would like to value the attitude of "thank you" for the room for improvement that is the source of the work! I personally think it's important to have an attitude that says, "Hey, I can't do it!

>
>  Specifically, we asked three teachers in their 20s to hold a counter in their hands in one class per day for about a month and count the number of times they praised a child.
>
>  In addition, we observed and recorded the extent to which the children engaged in behaviors such as looking at the designated pages of the textbook and working on the indicated problems, tasks, and activities in the class as "children's class participation behavior" (we observed the children for 2 seconds at each specific timing and quantitatively indexed whether such behavior was observed or not).
>
>  As a result, teacher praising behavior increased significantly (about +10 times per class on average) during the self-recorded period compared to the baseline period.
>  In addition, there was an increase (roughly 5%) in the average classroom participation behavior. In particular, most of the children whose class participation behavior was originally lower than average increased their participation behavior. However, children with developmental disabilities, children with intellectual disabilities, and others in the class did not show an increase in class participation behavior (or need different support).
>
>  Thus, it was suggested that having teachers self-record their own praising behavior would increase their attention to praise and increase their actual behavior, thereby increasing children's classroom participation behavior.

It is similar to the situation where "outside directors and consultants who don't understand the situation well come to me from the outside with only good arguments," and the employees on the front line say, "I understand, but it doesn't lead to evaluation, and even if it does, it takes a lot of coordination, persuasion, and cost, and it's very difficult.

He said that relationships and harassment are not the direct cause, but that it is the lack of progress at work that is a factor. Looking back, most of the difficult times were "when work was not progressing.

> [bombombomb2017](https://twitter.com/bombombomb2017/status/1779675513713578336) That's why it's easy to get mentally ill if you get involved in work outside of your field of expertise, and IT jobs are often not the best way to get work done. That it's easy to get mentally ill because there's so much to do.

> [noooooooorth](https://twitter.com/noooooooorth/status/1780007275849240727) Japan is a country that has had the extremely rare experience of a country improving as a result of losing a war (among other things), so I think it is possible that the perception of the "defeated country being occupied" situation is skewed. I think there is a possibility that the perception of the situation of "defeated country being occupied" is not correct.

> [PTIOnlinePk1](https://twitter.com/PTIOnlinePk1/status/1780285387803406748) There is no country that still exists after the defeat of the war, maintaining the national identity. I think it can be said that many Japanese people do not understand the essence of losing a war.

> [sumireRobot](https://twitter.com/sumireRobot/status/1780141259262501272) There is no country that still exists as a national body after the defeat. I think it can be said that many Japanese people do not understand the essence of losing a war.

> [PTIOnlinePk1](https://twitter.com/PTIOnlinePk1/status/1780285602161688874) In fact, there is also an aspect that has instilled in the US a strong success story that the country that defeated us will be a strong ally.

> [PTIOnlinePk1](https://twitter.com/PTIOnlinePk1/status/1780285496163197127) That, on the flip side, is a strong success story for the US. The U.S.-Japan relationship is an incredibly rare and extreme one in the history of the world. It's time for both countries to understand that the US-Japan relationship is one of the rarest in the history of the world.

> [Ishita_Sharma42](https://twitter.com/Ishita_Sharma42/status/1780149280550121547) Indeed, it is a rare experience that a country is better off as a result of Japan's postwar defeat. This experience may change perceptions of the post-war occupation after the defeat. It is natural that different cultural and historical experiences from other countries would create different perspectives and perceptions.


> [kenn](https://twitter.com/kenn/status/1777876286779904374) Looking at LLM trends since the beginning of this year, I think that we are still in a lull in terms of performance that can be improved by scaling laws, and that once GPT-5 is released, we are not talking about the arrival of AGI all at once. I think we are in a lull in the performance of LLM since the beginning of this year, and it is not as if AGI will arrive at once when GPT-5 is released.
>
>  To understand this, we have to go back to the definition of what LLM performance is.
>
>  To measure the performance of anything, you need a benchmark, and there are many benchmarks for LLM, but the question of what people perceive as intelligence has never been defined. There are many benchmarks for LLM, but until now there has been no definition for the question "What does a human perceive as intelligence?
>
>  However, as more and more members of the public began to use LLMs such as ChatGPT, it became clear that halucination (the practice of weaving in a few plain lies, like a con artist) is a rather serious problem, a point that discourages users and causes them to leave the site.
>
>  Halcination, however, is not a "bug" for AI, but a feature. Halcination is what makes it possible to output probabilistic and creative images, music, and poems, rather than completely logically unique and deterministic output.
>
>  It is widely known that if the randomness parameter (temperature), which can be specified during LLM inference, is set to 0, the model cannot demonstrate its true value. This is the same as when there is no margin of error in the logic connections and "fluctuations" are not allowed, the model becomes stuck in the same thought pattern like a depressed person and cannot get out.
>
>  So, the current generation of generative AI is better suited for tasks such as creative creation, drafting, etc., rather than reasoned intelligence. This is closer to what we call "sensitivity" than what we call "intelligence".
>
>  Halcination can be utilized as a characteristic quirk in images and speech. However, in the world of language, where the weight of a single token can turn the whole meaning upside down with Yes and No. Once an accidental logic error occurs, it is dragged to the end by that one.
>
>  And there is a bottleneck in performance. The bottleneck is that "the strength of the chain is determined by the weakest wheel. The bottleneck of LLM is halcination.
>
>  If the parameter size of the model is increased, the overall level can be raised. However, the key issue of halcination, which is an essential "feature" of LLM, is not improved at an essential level, but is only tweaked by post-processing such as RLHF. And because RLHF is human-mediated, it does not scale with more GPUs.
>
>  Personally, I think the problem with LLMs is that they are too confident. There are many modifying phrases in human speech space that signal the level of confidence, such as "well, I don't know, maybe" or "I don't know," but they don't go into those areas. For example, a sales agent bot could be tuned to say, "I'm not sure about your question, so I'll talk to my team about it (at this point, it taps the back-end API). However, the current function calling only invokes the function on its own from the AI side, and there is no way to know the internal state of the AI model. Therefore, the user has to devise a question to get the tool to call.
>
>  What we want to do is not to give the model a list of available tools in advance and leave the decision making to the model, but to take it one step further and receive the model's state variables as "confidence (float)", "topic (enum)", etc. at the end of each sentence, and then give the model tools based on these variables, The model is then used to control the direction of the output.
>
>  If an API like the one described above that can control model output in real time during LLM speech streaming were to emerge, we would be able to expand what we can do at once. The future of innovation should be in this direction, and the phase of cost-ineffective competition, in which performance can be infinitely improved by simply piling up GPUs, should have ended long ago.
>
>  In fact, OpenAI is focusing on the TURBO model. It is likely that user behavior has made them realize that they should not sacrifice one of the important indicators of performance: output speed. For this purpose, the models can be smaller.
>
>  In this way, the overall performance will continue to improve as it gets bigger and smaller. For the time being, the phase will continue to explore approaches to problems that cannot be solved by enlarging the model.
>
>  If there is one thing that good management and good engineering have in common, it is identifying and focusing on bottlenecks. Those who have not identified bottlenecks are not qualified to talk about solutions. We should keep that in mind.

However, if you introduce a "mysteriously large polygonal shape" that doesn't have any sharp points, the only thing you can say is "I don't know what he's doing, but he seems to be an amazing person".

According to the IMF, Taiwan's GDP per capita in 2023 will be US$32,340 (compared to US$33,950 in Japan). According to the IMF, Taiwan's GDP per capita in 2023 will be US$32,340 (Japan: US$33,950), and its PPP GDP per capita will be US$72,485 (Japan: US$52,120).

I think it is a hidden psychology to look down on others. Even if "condescending" is an exaggeration, it is probably someone who can only measure things in terms of "above/below", even if it is a relationship between people.

> [AB36738602](https://twitter.com/AB36738602/status/1776274111565836653) To be honest, I wonder if Taiwanese people have a strong sense of emergency preparedness and awareness on a daily basis? I have a renewed impression that they might have a strong sense of preparedness and awareness on a daily basis. Regardless of whether they are above or below us, shouldn't Japan humbly learn from them? I am keenly aware of this. It would be better if there was no crisis, but it would be worse if there was nothing we could do when a crisis occurs.

> [OKMRKJ](https://twitter.com/OKMRKJ/status/1776878811025752086) As I always tell law school students, copyright law, when considering something a little more complicated, it is essential to check the text.
>  For example, "making it illegal to download infringing content" is a catchphrase, but "making it illegal" is a rather vague expression (although there are many other ambiguous parts), and at first glance one might imagine that "making it illegal" = "copyright infringement," but this is not the case. If we restate the "illegalization" part a little more precisely (assuming it is a civil matter), it would be "exclusion of the application of the right limitation provision regarding reproduction for private use to download infringing content.
>  In other words, Article 30 (the right limitation provision regarding reproduction for private use) does not apply to the downloading of infringing content (← this is also a rather vague explanation, but we will ignore that point here).
>  So, there can be application of rights limitation provisions other than Article 30, and if they are applied, downloading of infringing content does not constitute copyright infringement. For example, if the downloading of infringing content is done within the scope necessary for court proceedings, then (in principle) Article 41-2 would apply, so it is not copyright infringement.
>  Of course, downloading infringing content does not of course constitute copyright infringement even if the rights holder authorizes the download.
>  Since the above points are not expressed in the catchphrase-like explanation of "illegal downloading of infringing content" (← it is a catchphrase, so there is no choice), we need to check the article if we want to consider something a little more complicated.



> [golden_lucky](https://twitter.com/golden_lucky/status/1776857047151321522) There is a technical writing style that says "don't write 'I think'", which can be paraphrased as "assert", but in fact "don't assert" is more important. I would like to write a text that conveys such a message, but I can't start writing because I can't assert it.

> [golden_lucky](https://twitter.com/golden_lucky/status/1776864320766316853) It's important to remember that not all writing is definitive, but the "don't write 'I think'" line tends to get passed down. So, we tend to play the game that if you write "I think", you lose, and as a result, the argument may be questionable.

> [golden_lucky](https://twitter.com/golden_lucky/status/1776865233987830094) "This can be proven" or "There is an argument for this in the literature" must be written as a definite statement. I usually edit out sentences that are definitive, such as "I heard that it is 00 (because I heard that it is 00 somewhere)" or "it is 00 (because someone said that it is 00)".

> [golden_lucky](https://twitter.com/golden_lucky/status/1776908288493281391) This is more about metacognition than writing style. I want people to stop thinking, "I don't know if I can make a determination, so I'd like to be vague, but I've been told it's not a good idea to write "I think" or "it's possible", so I'm going to make a determination gracefully".

You should spend time with people you want to be in a good mood with. If you do that, you will appear to other people as someone who can take care of his/her own mood. It looks like that, but it is not true. Someone is supporting you in an unseen way.

It is important to value the relationships you have with the people you are with and to build relationships where you can support each other.


> [y_matsuwitter](https://twitter.com/y_matsuwitter/status/1775887121020236070) Search engines are difficult, and each component of indexing, scoring, query construction, etc. requires specialized knowledge. It's not just a matter of doing a fluffy vector search or something like that. However, we are hearing more and more about RAGs in the fluffy search. I think this is because it seems to work well at first glance, as long as the document has a certain level of cleanness in terms of conventions and source data.
>
>  If we think about the business use beyond that, it is essential to make the search and its query assembly more sophisticated, and it is not a product that can be easily used by end users after writing a prompt, but a product of tuning to the domain.
>
>  I also have a feeling that, considering the response time, a simple Retrieve would be better than a RAG. It depends on the use case. I think there are many use cases where only the query assembly part is needed.

> [y_matsuwitter](https://twitter.com/y_matsuwitter/status/1775524061239791979) The value of LLM is in the part that assembles the search query, rather than the answer itself, and the value after that is more Rather, it depends on how skillful it is as a search engine. That's why I'm worried that RAGs are being over-hyped these days. It is more difficult to find the right source than to generate an answer.

> [onokoro48](https://twitter.com/onokoro48/status/1775739594329534703) I think so, it is quite difficult to get appropriate data from RAG. I think it's difficult to get appropriate data from RAGs, especially in Japanese, where there are no good embedding models yet.
