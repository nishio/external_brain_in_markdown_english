title: "What you call assets or unearned income."
---

Certain concepts are contaminated by [[cheater]] when they are popularized by whatever term you call them. This is because it is a concept strongly associated with human greed.

The term "[[assets]]" is used to sell something that is not an asset to "customers who want to own an asset but don't really know what an asset is" by explaining that it is an asset. Buyers become strong supporters of the scammer's theory because they do not want to admit that they have lost money due to their own stupidity.

The term "[[unearned income]]" is used to explain to customers who cannot think, "There are strict requirements for earning it, and in that sense it is difficult. It is used to sell a means of acquisition to customers who cannot think that "if it were easy to get it, many people would do it and it would be considered 'natural'" by explaining that "it is easy to get it if you do this". There are not zero people who have earned unearned income by using such means. However, not everyone can acquire income through this method.

Some people falsely believe that the concept itself is false because the words used to refer to the concept have been contaminated by fraudsters. This is because they do not learn the history themselves, but only see the advertisements made by fraudsters.
