Re: Is [[Scrapbox]] a "[[Blog]]"?
from [/villagepump/Scrapbox is a "blog"?](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/Scrapbox is a "blog"?)
- First of all, there was [[Web Diary]] before the word "blog" was popular
    - 2001 [tDiary - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/TDiary)
    - That's why there was "[[Hatena Diary]]" before "[[Hatena Blog]]".
        - Hatena Diary was released in 2003
        - Hatena Blog was released in 2011
    - It's also why old-timers call their blog-like things "[[diary]]".
        - [Diary of Hiroshi Yuki](https://www.hyuki.com/d/) 2002~
        - [Matz Nikki](https://matz.rubyist.net/) 2003~? ([https://matz.rubyist.net/20030501.html)](https://matz.rubyist.net/20030501.html))
- Early Web diaries were really just diaries on the Web.
    - However, with the advent of the blog system, comments and [[trackback]] functions were created, and it became a primitive form of [[SNS]].
        - If you post a link to an article, the person who wrote that article will be notified.
        - For example, Hatena Diary had a mechanism that if you wrote a user's ID with the ID notation (`id:nishiohirokazu`), that person would be notified that there is an article mentioning you ([[ID call]]).
            - Like a Twitter Mention (`@nishio`)
- Then social networking goes viral.
    - Twitter, released 2006
        - Landed in Japan in 2008
        - At the time, mixi (2004~) and Mobage (2006~) were all the rage.
            - [The leading figure who popularized Twitter in Japan talks about Twitter's past 10 years and its future](https://gaiax-socialmedialab.jp/post-39058/).
                - > Okubo: In 2008, social networking services such as "mixi" and "Mobage" were popular in Japan.
                - >  Mr. Sasaki: I thought it would be something completely different; it has a 140-character limit. Also, the primary information spreads overwhelmingly faster than other things, so I thought there were new possibilities.
        - Facebook also supported Japanese at the same time.
- In light of this trend, here's what I wrote in 2017
        - [[The blog was dismantled and became a social networking site and Scrapbox.]]
    - The function of immediate distribution of information that blogs had been waiting for was eclipsed by Twitter and other social networking services.
    - The remaining part of the system is the function of stocking information, but the blogging system as of 2017 is weak at reusing past information.
    - So I decided to stop blogging and use Scrapbox and social networking.
- Five years later, I look back.
    - Scrapbox as a place to stock information was, as expected, far better than a blog.
        - My Scrapbox, which grew up in 5 years, is more useful to me than the blog posts of the 5 years before that!
    - Communication on Scrapbox was something that worked well except
        - This is what I started thinking when I started getting into the well.
        - Wellhead has reinvented the Web diary.
    - Scrapbox as SNS]" is currently about "a primitive SNS on a 2005 blog system. [[Pastoral Internet]].
