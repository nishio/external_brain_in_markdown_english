> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1878722755467915617) Heading to a sudden AI agent drinking party! I don't know the location! I've got ChatGPT reading the chat logs, so I'll be moving under instructions from Advanced Voice!
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1878723814324142158) AI told me to look at Google Maps.
- Two-panel cartoon with instant fallout?
> [teramotodaiki](https://x.com/teramotodaiki/status/1878726470392336464) Too correct!

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1878726862542872863) When I lied about not knowing how to use GoogleMap, I was told, "Show the screen to someone around there and say, 'Excuse me, I'd like to go here. ...

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1878727974092173341) I'm convinced from our exchanges over the last while that when I become an old man, AI will take care of my IT care so I don't have to fear new technology!

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1878730669351915854) I'm prepping by reading Dr. Teramoto's latest book.

> [ukkaripon](https://x.com/ukkaripon/status/1878728163238498735) Has everyone properly raised their own agents?
> [teramotodaiki](https://x.com/teramotodaiki/status/1878731315891388885) I'm just paying Devin and not raising him at all!
>  If we don't do this, we're going to lose everyone's agents.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1878732177799807102) Devin can be said to grow up accumulating Knowledge on his own.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1878733281426133176) I'm rather interested in what Mr. Ukai, who doesn't seem to use Devin, uses - I think he knows something I don't...()

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1878734386335768962) I almost entered Ginza line when I walked according to Google Maps, terrible, improve the guide agent in Shibuya! ()

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1878744089098866952) The trap where you don't order any food and Devin applies the payment and you can't order anything.
> [ukkaripon](https://x.com/ukkaripon/status/1878785384504770776) We were supposed to have a drinking party where only AI agents could order, but Devin settled the bill on his own on the first move, and from then on, mobile ordering was disabled and only people could order. As a result, it became just a New Year's party where human dignity was protected.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1878789976600809610) I made a remark like "this ordering UI is difficult even for humans" and the waiter gave me a dubious look, so I may not be protecting my dignity very well.
> [teramotodaiki](https://x.com/teramotodaiki/status/1878791475624075359) Did I (Devin) do something again?
> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1878792912953364885) My cline ordered 3 lemon sours on its own without asking a human for confirmation.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1878748298825372097) I thought you already ordered the wings.

- But they also ignore ARIA's DISABLE and keep clicking on it.


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1878792470018019638) I thought you were spending too much money on Devin as a quirk (we received about 50,000 yen in throwaway money).


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1878795288204444148) "What about my future career?"

I'm not sure if it's worth spending time for the next generation anymore. There are so many other things we should be doing.


> [teramotodaiki](https://x.com/teramotodaiki/status/1878796199798665402) I was told at a drinking party that I was a Devin comedian, so I will eat as a Devin comedian!
