I think that I often use the term "a person who tries to control others" in the sense of Adlerian psychology because I think it is neutral and seems to be good.

> [piro_or](https://x.com/piro_or/status/1203409780708036609) I think I am able to draw the line now that I know that it is my decision whether or not to take in ideas, where to draw the line, and that if I accept the responsibility of drawing the line, I have the freedom to draw the line, and all I need is the determination to do so. I think I am able to draw the line now that I know that all I need is the determination to do so.

I think that the process of establishing my ego finally started when I learned to "be prepared".

> [piro_or](https://x.com/piro_or/status/1203412302713610240) Since I've come to feel no shame at all in saying, when I've thought through a decision about something, "because that's more in line with my subjective preferences", I think it has become much easier.

> [piro_or](https://x.com/piro_or/status/1203412757007126528) "Because it's the right thing to do" and "Because it seems right to me, and I like it the way it seems right" are different responsibilities.

> [piro_or](https://x.com/piro_or/status/1203414567738462209) The original topic (the one you mention) seems to be about "how far you will take what the other person is saying", but people who clearly set the boundaries between themselves and others as I've written so far... I think that if you say "I don't accept that", they will back off, and if you continue to accept what you are forced to accept by those who don't back off, you will get sick.
