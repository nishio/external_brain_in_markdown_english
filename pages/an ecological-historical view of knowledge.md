I think academia is about [[information compressibility]], where students and newcomers can catch up to the cutting edge after only a few months of learning what their predecessors spent 10 years discovering."

It is important to control the osmotic pressure of new generations of knowledge flowing into any field: "I think the most important thing for a field to become vibrant is for young students and researchers to enter and work on new ideas. To this end, it is essential for the field to establish a situation in which students can catch up with the state-of-the-art (relatively easily) after only six months or a year of study."

- Is it important that the people who move to a new location be able to settle in within a year (i.e., that the cost of moving is low) in order for [[Attention mobile voting]] to be successful?
