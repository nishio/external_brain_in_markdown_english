title: "Motivation and Choices"

> The Nishio Family Today
>  I "don't want to go out in the rain, but I have to."
>  Wife: "You don't have to go. You can send a message saying, 'My stomach has exploded and I will not be attending. Or 'I have a stomach headache.'"
>  I "I see!"
- In other words, "must go" is a [[policy constraint]], which can be changed through negotiation!
- Instead of going because "I have to go," I thought, "It's my choice to go or not to go, but which would you choose?" I thought about it and decided to go lol.

> I don't want to go out in the rain.
>  Tachikawa: "The game I'm going to ask you to play now is a game in which hit points are reduced when you get hit by rain.
>  You are free to think and act on your own ways to protect yourself from the rain.
>  Even the route to your destination is at your disposal. You can even craft tools with what you have around you.
>
>  "Come on, let's go out."
- I had a little trouble figuring out how to craft, so I went out normally with a large umbrella lol.
- First, negative feelings were generated about "going out in the rain" as a vague [abstract concept
    - It was redefined as a means-free game, which turned into "something you choose from a wide variety of [[options]]."
    - I thought for about 10 seconds about a giant cardboard umbrella or armor to wear on my legs and concluded "no, I'll just use a regular umbrella" lol.

In short, it is important to "have a choice" in putting out "[willingness (e.g., to do something)"
- (Tachikawa) "There is no choice. Wouldn't it be useful to create a situation where "we have no choice but to do it"?

- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>We need a "do or die" situation.
    - Also, isn't that "being made to do" and not "motivated"?
    - Does not meet the "interesting" criteria.
    - Tachikawa's definition of "motivation": "the feeling you get when you are [[acting]] in a direction you find [[interesting]].

- And what makes it interesting?
    - That's an option.
    - The bodge in the example was not well-balanced at first, so there was practically no choice.
        - You could choose to invoke the command or not, but there was practically no choice because there were no cases where it was beneficial not to invoke the command.
    - Huh? There's practically no choice this time either, right?
