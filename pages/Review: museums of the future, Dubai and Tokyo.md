1. the Museum of the Future in Dubai
        - - Presenting a bolder, more ambitious vision
        - - Focus on advanced technologies such as space exploration and genetic engineering
        - - Demonstrate the concept of improving and enhancing nature
        - - Presenting a vision of the future for consumers

2. the [[National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation]] in Tokyo, Japan
        - - More participatory and educational approach
        - - Focus on environmental and social issues
        - - Focus on improving and adapting current technologies
        - - Exhibits that encourage visitors to think and discuss

3. comparison and discussion of the two: 1.
        - - Different approaches, but complementary to each other
        - - Ideal combination of Dubai's bold vision and Tokyo's participatory approach
        - - Balance between technological advancement and social understanding and participation is important.

The authors are attracted to Dubai's ambitious vision, but also recognize the importance of the inclusive and participatory approach demonstrated by the Tokyo exhibit. The ideal museum of the future, they conclude, would combine the best of both worlds.
