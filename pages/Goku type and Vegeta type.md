title: "Goku type and Vegeta type"
---

> [panyamasao](https://x.com/panyamasao/status/1898933548532559968) There are three types of otaku: the Goku type [[who gets stronger and stronger by himself]], the Vegeta type who gets stronger [[envy]] the more strong people around him, the Yamcha type [[who doesn't get stronger but seems to have fun]], and the Chaozu type [[who gets sick on his own and self-destructs]]. There is the Yamcha type who is not strong but seems to be having fun, and the Chaozu type who gets sick on his own and blows himself up on his own.
    - [[Stronger.]]
        - [[strength]]
    - [[Looks like fun.]]

> [bWUtmGXDvN7sxPU](https://x.com/bWUtmGXDvN7sxPU/status/1899061827415490664) Piccolo type who spends too much money on hobbies and is at the very least frugal with his meals.

> [kiku26waku](https://x.com/kiku26waku/status/1899228886522900912) There are Mr. Satan types who think they are strong but really aren't.

> [yoritaka34](https://x.com/yoritaka34/status/1899065963040956512) I'm almost always the turtle hermit type of the accomplished skeptic.

> [k_1_table](https://x.com/k_1_table/status/1899197080033468896) And then there are the Broly types who are usually kind, but the moment they start talking about their guesses, their hoops come off and they go berserk on another level...

> [katze_zzz](https://x.com/katze_zzz/status/1899153281492140411) He knows a lot and can do a lot, but he is a poor Tenshinhan type who says, "It is unacceptable for a light user like me to talk about geeky stuff, that I am not.)

> [Stdal_23](https://x.com/Stdal_23/status/1899382671371112805) Sometimes there are krillin types who shoot for amazing partners.

> [PsuraraC83](https://x.com/PsuraraC83/status/1899113429493039253) Some dende are brought to an event without knowing what to expect, and as they help out, they adapt and become a part of the event.

> [MAD_Vrsner_NT](https://x.com/MAD_Vrsner_NT/status/1899328343604134101) Freeza type who is strong from the start, but while he's being a jerk, before he knows it, the knowledge and skills of those around him catch up and overtake him.

> [LeChienFantasme](https://x.com/LeChienFantasme/status/1899081643782238292) I like Yajirobe best when he goes his own way without much concern for his surroundings.

> [d80rUh70JAL63DL](https://x.com/d80rUh70JAL63DL/status/1899228717500760292) like the Majin Buu type, which is gradually becoming more and more distant from its original form as it takes in more and more of everything.

> [mai_z0926](https://x.com/mai_z0926/status/1899391694002663625) You don't have to be a geek to have this
>  Is the Vegeta type the type that grows when there is a rival? Goku type is a go-getting-my-way type, whose motives are a mystery to those around him, but who seems to grow up on his own? Yamcha type seems to have fun! I admire them!

> [tenshoku2010](https://x.com/tenshoku2010/status/1899381015275245707) Bloomer types who will go to the ends of the earth to collect

> [noritamahane](https://x.com/noritamahane/status/1899048981256167456) There is also the Piccolo type, which calmly looks at the war situation and, if necessary, combines other elements to rise to the top.
>  Dr. Eko Mikawa of Oblivious Battery is probably a Piccolo type.
