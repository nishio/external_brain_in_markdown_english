[[POC]]
[[Verification of concept]].
    - [[conception]]
    - [[verification]] of [[concept]]

A word that has come to be used rather crudely.
- What is the concept that you want to validate through that POC?
- Can the concept be validated by its POC?
- What results can be said to have been verified?
