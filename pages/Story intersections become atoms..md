- [[Intersection of Stories]] becomes [atom
- Suppose we have two [[stories]] here
    - Texts written by two people on related topics
    - Writings by myself now and three years ago.
- There is some overlap between the two stories.

    - Image of this darker colored area
    - We'll call it a story intersection.
    - In the KJ method and the Kozane method:.
        - Carve two stories into a kozane and place them in space
        - Kozane from different stories gather in one place so you can notice them.
        - Example: [[It's easier to write if you don't expect others to respond.]]
    - In Scrapbox:.
        - You can notice it by a link in a page you wrote three years ago that unexpectedly leads to the page you are writing now.
- Calling it "[[atom]]" has the metaphor "[[Atom is not a part but a function]]" and [integrity
        - [[It's not "writing in parts."]]
        - > If you describe writing [[atomic]] as "writing in parts", the image is somewhat off. It seems to me that it cannot accomplish anything on its own. Rather, "let's write it functionally" is closer to "let's write it functionally.
        - [[Functions created for big picture understanding and reuse]]
        - >  [[semantically united]] code and name it so that it is easy to understand what it is doing. Then, the function can be reused by calling it from elsewhere. (Technology Supporting Coding, p. 56)
    - Since the item has appeared twice in existing stories, it can be reused a third time or later by hanging it up.
    - The parts are not made in advance, but there is a story first, and then parts of the story are cut out after the fact.
