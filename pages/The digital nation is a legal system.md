title: "The digital nation is a legal system"

The [[digital nation]] is not the technology, but the carefully crafted [[legal system]] around it."
- "Digital government is not about technology but carefully drafted legal system around it"
- [Estonian President talks about the digital nation](https://kristinayasuda.com/posts/estonia-president-and-a-digital-nation/)
- I was wondering if this "draft" includes the nuance of unfinished.
- I am more comfortable with the model that it is a "careful" but unfinished draft, which will be improved as the situation is monitored. In Japanese translation, "carefully crafted" has a nuance of "perfectly crafted," which I think is not the case.
