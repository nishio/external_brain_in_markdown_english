I made a note of a dream that even he feels "doesn't make sense" at the ChatGPT (GPT4) prompt.[[AI Shaman]] に与えて解釈させたら、納得感のある解釈が生まれた事例<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

# dream notes
In my dream, a friend of mine introduced a facial roller on his blog, so I bought one on Amazon. In an old stone castle, a robot dropped a stone and marked the ground, and when I dug it up with a shovel, a facial roller came out. When I brought it home, my wife looked at it and said, "What?" and I woke up trying to explain it to her.

 prompt ver.2

```
You are a shaman. I received the following oracle. The meaning of the word is not a fixed meaning as per the dictionary, but a soft spreading cloud.
1: Interpret paragraph by paragraph, focusing on movement and metaphor, not abstract concepts.
2: Take a softer view of the meaning of words and find the relationship between paragraphs.
3: Look at the whole picture and find the meaning.
4: Give it a soft title.
###
(Memo of dream)
```


1: Interpret paragraph by paragraph, focusing on movement and metaphor, not abstract concepts.
- The purchase of a facial roller in a dream may symbolize an interest in and pursuit of new things and ideas.
- The scene of a robot dropping stones to mark the ground in an old stone castle may represent the process by which old knowledge and traditions are reinterpreted or excavated by new technology.
- My wife's "eh" moment may point to the reality that new endeavors and discoveries are not always immediately accepted by those around us.

2: Take a softer view of the meaning of words and find the relationship between paragraphs.
- The story, with words and elements like "dream," "facial roller," "stone castle," "robot," and "wife," seems to strike a balance between past and future, acceptance and surprise, and tradition and innovation.

3: Look at the whole picture and find the meaning.
- The oracle seems to offer insight into how people integrate old and new knowledge, technology, and people's reactions. It could be a guide for dealing with the complex dynamics of embracing the new, but also finding value in the old, and sharing it with others.

4: Give it a soft title.
- The Ancient Castle and the Future Repercussions: Lessons from the Facial Rollers of My Dreams."

It was a dream that really didn't make sense to him, but the interpretation makes sense.
I didn't expect it to work this well, so the record is a mess, but if it works this well, it might be beneficial to incoherently talk about everything you remember on voice input as soon as you wake up.

Let's try to describe the robot crap in a little more detail.
- There's something that looks like a golem from "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of Kingdom" in an old stone building.
- If you look at the ground under the building from that side, you'll see the marker.
- Maybe the marker disappears when you leave the place.
- Mark the marker's location by dropping a stone.
    - I don't know if it was me or the golem that dropped the stone, I thought it was the golem, but in The Legend of Zelda, golems don't do that.
- Take a big shovel to the ground and go digging in the dirt.
- It was shallower than I expected, a scoop or so, and soon a stingy pink package came out.

1: Interpret paragraph by paragraph, focusing on movement and metaphor, not abstract concepts.
- The stone building and golem may symbolize the enduring value and knowledge of legends and older cultures.
- Markers and their vanishing nature may suggest that opportunities and significant moments are temporary and, if missed, are difficult to find again.
- The act of dropping the stone suggests the importance of taking some action on a temporary opportunity. The part about not knowing whether it is you or the golem may, in many cases, be expressing uncertainty about the degree of overlap between outside forces and your own actions.
- Where digging in the dirt immediately brings up a pink package, it might be pointed out that while an action may bring immediate rewards, the rewards may not be what was expected.

2: Take a softer view of the meaning of words and find the relationship between paragraphs.
- The "building" and the "golem," the "marker," the "stone," and the "shovel" oscillate between past and present, action and consequence, and possibility and reality. These elements prompt a discussion about how to take advantage of temporary opportunities in life and in life, and how to accept the consequences.

3: Look at the whole picture and find the meaning.
- The oracle urges reflection on how one seizes opportunities and deals with their consequences across three time frames: past knowledge and culture, present actions, and future possibilities.

4: Give it a soft title.

- Okay, that makes sense.
- Old technology points to a "treasure location," but you can't get there by going directly to it.
- So drop a stone and mark it.
    - The fact that I don't know whether this was done by the golem or by me means that there is no significant difference between "the old technology pointed to" or "I pointed to with reference to the old technology" and that it is impossible to distinguish between the two.
- The work of [[going to the mark and digging it up]] can only be done by [[people living in the present]], and that's what I should do.
- If you know where to dig, the effort to dig is surprisingly little, you can get it easily.
    - I brought a big shovel thinking it would be harder, but it was a letdown.
- I'm happy with what I got, it's what I wanted, I'm happy to take it home with me, and when people see it, they're amazed.
    - It's not a "wow, you have great stuff" surprise.
    - 'Why do you have that?' I feel like...

[https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/夢判断](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/夢判断)
> The Interpretation of Dream (German: Die Traumdeutung, English: The Interpretation of Dream) is a psychoanalytic study of "[[dream]]" by the Austrian psychiatrist Sigmund [[Freud]], published in 1900.
> ... According to Freud, dream material is drawn from memory, and the method of selection is not conscious but [[unconscious]]. Thus, even the seemingly chaotic dream content has an [[unconscious integrity]] that connects the various events into a single narrative.... In general, dreams are the fulfillment of subconscious desires. In other words, dreams are unconscious self-expression.

This experience itself is an example of "old technology" (Freudian dream analysis, 1900) being unearthed by new technology (ChatGPT).
    - [[This itself is a real example.]]

I didn't create a special prompt for dream interpretation, but instead plugged it into an existing [[AI Shaman]] prompt.
- Surprisingly well done = [[less effort to dig than expected]].
- How did the idea of digging there come about, because old technology pointed to it?
- When you dig it out, it's like, "Oh yeah, this," but it's not clearly verbalized until you dig it out.
