title: "Nonverbal decision-making skills are developed first."

from[/villagepump/2025/04/02](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/2025/04/02)
- Through [[gaining experience]], [[non-verbal decision-making abilities]] called [[sense of smell]], [[sense of skin]], and [[tacit knowledge (knowledge management terminology)]] are developed.
    - By [[action]] using that non-verbal judgment ability, you will know the [[good or bad]] of the choice/[[judgment]].
        - Related: [[Knowledge must be verified by action]].
    - Then you will be able to give a verbal explanation of what you did.
        - I think both [[bouldering]] and [[how to use AI agents]] are the same
    - Each person has different muscle strength, height, hip range of motion, and past sports experience, so they have different pathways to getting things done.
        - [[Pathways vary from person to person]].
