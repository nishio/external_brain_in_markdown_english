title: "Donations to public institutions"

> [@antitaxhike](https://twitter.com/antitaxhike/status/1644480354953068544?s=20): RIKEN is the only national institute of natural science in Japan, and despite being a national institution, it is still crowdfunding to support human resource development. What is our country doing? What in the world is our country doing? What in the world is our country doing? The government should do something before asking the private sector to do it.

It seems to be a tax-deductible donation. The biggest difference between Japan and the U.S. is "not donating" (attached is the case of universities). Is it a national trait? Of course there are differences in the taxation system...

OpenAI would not exist if only "the government should do basic research".

- [It is interesting to see the contrast between people who think "[[The state should do it...]]" when they have the opportunity to contribute to society, and the data showing a big difference in the amount of donations between Japan and the U.S.
