title: "The Chatwork Forced Survey Case"
---

In a chat service normally used for speedy exchange of information, a policy of "you can't use the service until you answer the questionnaire" was implemented, resulting in negative comments being posted on social networking sites.
The results of this survey may not be useful because many users enter appropriate information in an attempt to use the service quickly.

There is no close button and no matter how many times I reload, it comes up and I can't open the chat until I answer.

> [@tkddy_](https://twitter.com/tkddy_/status/1574608469239349249?s=21&t=UEIubc1-Ss0x--BbIHKD1w): i need to contact you on chatwork in a hurry, but this keeps going on and it's uncomfortable...
> I can't close it and it keeps coming up when I refresh it.
> I know how you feel, but wait a minute, I'll answer when I'm not in a hurry.

> [@sugarnaoo](https://twitter.com/sugarnaoo/status/1574654294930096128?s=21&t=UEIubc1-Ss0x--BbIHKD1w): I had to rush over to Chatwork to check in! I opened it and was forced to answer a survey form. There is no close button and if I don't answer, I can't see the chat.
> I wanted it to be able to be closed, and if you don't answer it, it should just show up moderately 🤔.

> I think you guys don't have to be so mad at me because I've always been a big fan of your service. If it's for the sake of better service in the future, I've made Aphrodite Gang.inc a farming business, and I'm happy to help.
