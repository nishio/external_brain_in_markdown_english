[Progress made.
- Polis Summer 2024, Social Hack Day #62, and other digital democracy-related events and tool validation continue
- Launched "TTTC Turbo" on June 27; writing on "Broad Listening" and "Digital Technology x Democracy" through early July
- Enhanced outputs, including a review of the Governor's race (shared KPT) and video recording related to Plurality

[[Being stagnant]].
- Questions and Additions to Talk to the City Study Group
- Viewing of FtC study group (non-Anno's part)
- Watch Hayashi's video

Awareness and issues
- I am working on multiple events/writing at the same time and tend to lose track of pinning my weekly journal and reminding myself of tasks
- Broad listening environment construction tends to be burdensome. Difficult to deal with problems when they occur.

[Points for the future
- Prioritize and write about topics that have not yet been written about, such as TTTC, Miner voting, Polis cases, etc.
- Consider using Google Colab to reduce the burden of building a Python environment
- Combined weekly journal and AI summary to strengthen the system of reflection so that the writing doesn't end there.
