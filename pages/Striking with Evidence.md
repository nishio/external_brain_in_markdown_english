title: "Striking with Evidence"

> [philomyu](https://twitter.com/philomyu/status/1719908979659374795) I heard that there was an expression in the Asahi Shimbun article "being beaten up by evidence," but I think it is more like "people who used to be beaten up by the 'feelings' of the evidence are getting their hands injured these days" or something like that. I think it is closer to the situation where "people who used to be beaten up by the evidence have recently become more defensive of the evidence and are getting their hands injured" or something like that.

I think it is also "people who used to be punched for harassment are now getting their hands hurt because of the hardening of the compliance defense these days".

>  > The percentage of respondents who consider "setting the political agenda" to be an important job in journalism is unusually prominent.
>  > Low percentages feel it is important to "be an objective observer" and "allow people to express their opinions.
>
>  This may be connected to the story that a low percentage of Japanese journalists feel it is important to "be an objective observer.

    - [[Tell the facts as they are.]]

> [shioshio38](https://twitter.com/shioshio38/status/1720066045854273678) Isn't there a common thread between the attitude of disregard for being an objective observer and the expression "hit with evidence"?
