<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/> [[Dewey.]] saw school as a place where children learn about social life. He believed that school was a microcosm of adult society and that their experiences there should prepare them for their future social life.

Specifically, we emphasize the following points

1. children should be given opportunities in school to work together on projects and to live collectively according to a set of rules. This will foster social and communication skills.

- Teachers should be [[partners in sharing experiences]] with children, not authoritative transmitters of knowledge.

3. schools should not be isolated from the community and should actively interact with local people and resources.

4. by integrating the democratic decision-making process into school life, children can acquire democratic values.

5. free interaction among children should be encouraged in schools and an environment should be created where children from different backgrounds can understand each other.

Thus, for Dewey, the purpose of schooling was not merely to transmit knowledge, but to foster the qualities and attitudes necessary for social life. It was also to foster a sense of responsibility and solidarity as a member of society while respecting the individuality of each child.
