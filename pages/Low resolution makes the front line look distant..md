    - On the boundaries of [what we already have and what we don't yet have
    - What we already have" is [[spiked]].
    - There's a lot of [[what hasn't been done yet]] if you can get to it, because there's a lot of [[crevice]] in between.
    - However, if the [[resolution (e.g. display, dpi)]] is low, this spike becomes blurry and thick
    - The "gap between" is invisible.
    - This makes the front line more distant.
