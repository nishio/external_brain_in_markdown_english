<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/sge/icon' alt='sge.icon' height="19.5"/>Kyoro-support" is an Internet term that refers to people who are always in a group, scurrying around and paying attention to their surroundings. They play the role of [[rea-supportive]] because they want to be thought of as a good-looking person by those around them, and they often belong to a group that is above their so-called rank at school or at work.
