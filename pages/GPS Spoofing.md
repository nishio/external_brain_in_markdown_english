> There are reports that a U.S. military [[UAV]] (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) flying near the Iranian border was captured in 2011. It is rumored that Iran spoofed the UAV at that time.
> [[Spoofing]] attacks send falsified location data to the drone side. The drone can then be guided to another location or crashed instead of heading to its original destination.
> Fujita said, "There is no proof that Iran was really spoofing at the time, but it is said that the world became aware of the risks associated with drone positioning, and the tide turned in favor of security.

> Spoofing is also occurring in Russia and Ukraine during the very time of war. Incidents targeting ships and military UAVs around the Black Sea and Baltic Sea are said to be common. There are even reports that the number of times ships and planes passing through the Black Sea have had their positional data messed up has risen to about 10,000 times between 2016 and 2018.
