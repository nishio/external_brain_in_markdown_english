title: "Fog of War"
---

> Fog of war is the [[factor of uncertainty]] from the commander's point of view in operations and battles. It was defined by [[Carl von Clausewitz]], a Prussian soldier and military scientist.

>  Since ancient times, the accuracy of decision-making in operations and battles has depended on the quality and quantity of information gathered, and armies have systematically conducted reconnaissance and search operations to gather information. Historically, however, it has been extremely rare for information to be available on the battlefield to enable a complete picture of the situation at all times. This is because it was impossible from a technical standpoint for a commander to have a complete, real-time grasp of the terrain, the situation of his own forces and those of the enemy, and their actions. The need for constant updating and [[incomplete information]], especially with regard to enemy conditions, which were so fluid, prevented commanders from making [[decision-making]] decisions with sufficient basis and confidence. [[Clausewitz.]] called this the "fog of war" (Theory of War, Part II, Chapter 2-24, etc.).
