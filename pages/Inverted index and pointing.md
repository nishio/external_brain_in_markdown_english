    - [[document]]   [[observation]]
- The document is a location, and the observation vector is created by the observations at that location.
    - One specific example of an observation is the appearance of the word
    - One specific example of a location is the document ID
    - [[inverted index]]
    - Mapping observations to locations
    - Change the observation being generated from a location to a function that generates a location from an observation in the opposite direction.
    - Feel like making $P(X|Y)$ from $P(Y|X)$ see [[Bayes' theorem]].
- A function that returns a location for some input is [pointing at
- Document ID is discrete
