You'll have no interest in anything but hurting people and taking pleasure in it.

When people really fall to the point of falling, they no longer have any other pleasure than to enjoy the misfortune of others.

>  What's that in [[Goethe]]?

> [sh_HERALBONY](https://twitter.com/sh_HERALBONY/status/1574059431708729344) A similar translation, "When a man gets really bad, he has no interest in anything but taking pleasure in hurting others." is from Goethe's Aphorisms in the Shincho Bunko, and according to the book, it is from "[[aphorisms and reflections]]".
