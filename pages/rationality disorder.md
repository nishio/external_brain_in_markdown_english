title: "rationality disorder"

from  [[intelligence trap]]
- [[rationality disorder]] （dysrationalia）
- > High intelligence does not necessarily prevent such attitudes from being fostered in the first place. Rather, high learning ability may foster a tendency to gather "facts" that reinforce one's own ideas.

There is no correlation between ability to make rational decisions and SAT scores.
- > In one experiment examining typical cognitive biases, Stanovich found that people with high SAT scores had a rather "somewhat larger [[cognitive blind spot]]" than those with not so high scores (16). He stated, "People with high cognitive ability are aware of it and believe that they should be able to perform most cognitive tasks better than others. Cognitive biases are presented in the form of cognitive tasks, so they still think they should be able to outperform others," Stanovich said.
