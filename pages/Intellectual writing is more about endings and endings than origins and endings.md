title: "Intellectual writing is more about endings and endings than origins and endings"

from  [[Diary 2024-04-26]]
[[Intelligent writing]] is more [[conclusion]] than [[beginning and end]].
> [honnoinosisi555](https://twitter.com/honnoinosisi555/status/1440982755492306955/photo/1) "I would not recommend origins and endings to anyone who writes intelligently. First, there is no need to start with a topic that seems irrelevant. If you write in a more straightforward manner, excluding the beginning and the end, starting from the conclusion and ending with the conclusion, it will be an easy-to-understand document." (Toshio Kuroki, "Intellectual Writing Techniques: An Introduction," Iwanami Shinsho, p. 69)
