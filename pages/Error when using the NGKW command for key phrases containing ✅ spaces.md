title: "Error when using the NGKW command for key phrases containing ✅ spaces"
---

- Multiple keywords separated by spaces, because the design was to specify multiple keywords, and they were split up.
- In the first place, it is used via command button, so in normal usage, it should not be specified more than once...
- For both the entire string and the engraved one, we decided to check if it exists as a keyword before deleting it.
- Maybe we should not target the engraved ones for deletion when the entire 🤔 string is the key phrase?
    - I did ✅.
