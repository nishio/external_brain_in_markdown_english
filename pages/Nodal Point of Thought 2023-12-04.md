Check the range and then [[take a position]].
- Without an understanding of what is going on around you, you are "just standing there".
- Run around and see things for yourself
        - [[one must see with one's own eyes]]
        - [[It can be seen only by moving]]
- Gathering Other People's Perspectives
    - [[Ideas supported by multiple perspectives]].
            - [[Decisions supported by multiple perspectives]]
    - It is [[barbaric]] to jump at one stimulus.
    - [[Median low-risk option]]
    - The majority is not the center.
        - Mean is not median
    - The average moves only slowly when the majority does not.
        - The unmoving majority falsely believes they are the median.
            - Because they don't see what's going on outside the city.

- [[Taking a risk or not taking a risk is a false choice]]
- It is a mistake to think of risk on a one-dimensional axis.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1731491445050392933) People who don't move consider themselves central. And they think the center is safe. However, this is a mental model from the old days when "exploration" was a two-dimensional movement, and the space to be explored is actually a higher dimension.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1731493192238043511) So, when A, B, and C, who seem to be doing disparate things, get together, they actually find that there is a "common direction Ω" in the arrows they are each going. notice.

They become the edge with the belief that "we are not the edge, we are the center, therefore we are safe."
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1731497929188499491) "There is an exploratory space here" type thinking as opposed to "high risk low risk" type thinking. Those who don't move are perceived as "those who don't explore" and are "outside the space" and "those who don't deserve special attention".

The fact that space is of a higher dimension allows this perception to be established.



Some information is widely circulated and some is not.
    - [[inner circle]]
- Information not in circulation is fundamentally more valuable.
- When there is an overabundance of information distribution, the value of "attention" information on which to focus increases.
    - Because Attention is a limited resource.
- How do you get information that is not in circulation?
    - To be perceived by the person who has the information as "sharing information with this person may generate a return"?
        - Some kind of "trust."
    - You wouldn't give it to someone who is acting in a self-interested way, "I want the information."
    - Small start and pay forward?
- [[Resources not financed by cash]].
        - [[commodity called cash]]

[[slavery without ethical problems]].
    - [[Computational Thinking is a monarchical theory]]
    - [[What would you do if you had a thousand people in your life?]]
