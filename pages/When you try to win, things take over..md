title: "When you try to win, things take over."

> What I really think about these days is that there is no need to try to win. If you do what you want to do steadily at your own pace, those who are trying to win by forcing themselves will drop out on their own. They get into trouble, get sick, and so on. You can only win in that way for ten years at most, and it won't work in the age of a hundred years of life.

> The biggest problem with "trying to win" is that it "hijacks your perspective. The moment you try to win, you end up fighting with the other person's monism. You are then forced to behave, and even if you win in the end, you will not be happy. Always focus on "fun," not "winning.
