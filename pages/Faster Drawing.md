Faster Drawing
    - [[Moving stickies]] I was thinking of doing that.
    - But as far as moving stickies, it was surprisingly stress-free.
    - So lower the priority until it's time to speed up pen drawing.
    - →Needed with the implementation of the lasso choice.
- Need clarification: do I just stack layers on the same canvas or do I need to stack two canvases as DOM?
    - Two canvases needed to be stacked. done

    - [[Faster pen input]]  done

    - [[Faster moving of stickies]]
    - [[Faster path movement]]
    - [[Faster drawing when updating sentences when creating stickies]]
