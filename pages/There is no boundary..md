title: "There is no boundary."
---

    - [[boundary]] is missing.
- There are not always boundaries.
- The presence of a boundary in the direction of one [[axis]] does not imply that it is bounded in the direction of another axis.
- In the chronological process of A, B, C, D, the part of B and C is a phase called X. I circled only B and C in red as shown on the left
- But this figure implicitly assumes that "E and F are not X".
- Is that assumption correct?

    - A clear boundary in the [[time axis]] direction does not necessarily mean that there is also a clear boundary in the [[spatial axis]] direction.
    - [[The bias of easy drawing]]
    - [[Organizational Boundaries]] 　 [[campfire (usually large, and for gathering and singing, etc.)]]
