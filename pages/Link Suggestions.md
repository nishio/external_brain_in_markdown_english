title: "Link Suggestions"
---

- I don't know which of the following two is the case when using the term [[link suggestion]].
- Scrapbox itself has a feature that does an "ambiguous search" while you are typing in a link and suggests relevant links.
    - see  [[Scrapbox's link suggestions are useful]]
- If you do not have Scrapbox itself, and you enter multiple pages that do not yet have links to make use of Scrapbox, the function will suggest "links that would be good to create".
    - What I originally called [[link suggestion]] is here
            - [[How Link Suggestions/Transversal Ambiguous Searches Work]]

I thought it would be clearer to recognize the latter as the proposed system of the [[Scaffolding Network]].
