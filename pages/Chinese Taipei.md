> Chinese Taipei (English: Chinese Taipei, French: Taipei chinois, Traditional Chinese: 中華台北, IOC code: TPE) is the name used to refer to the Republic of China (Taiwan) in international sports, including the Olympics, and international organizations. The issue of sovereignty and state recognition was shelved as a compromise in order for the country to participate in the international community after the 1970s, when China lost its representation in the United Nations and was effectively expelled and forced into diplomatic isolation.
>  While the ROC government's position that the ROC represents all of China has prevented the use of the name "[[Taiwan]]," the name "[[Republic of China]]" is no longer accepted by the international community because the ROC does not in fact effectively control all of China, and the People's Republic of China's insistence on "[[one China]]" has made it impossible to use either the name "Republic of China" or "Taiwan. [The reason for this is that neither the name "Republic of China" nor "Taiwan" can be used in relation to the theory of "one China" advocated by the People's Republic of China.

When the Chinese TV crew was introducing the show, the female lead singer, Kana Zhongshan, said, "This is Taiwan! (It's Taiwan!)" After the opening ceremony of Tokyo Deun, the Japanese media once again showed the friendship between Japan and Taiwan, which was very moving for our friends.
