> [vMP2JOuXu4icoEr](https://x.com/vMP2JOuXu4icoEr/status/1832690554976735578) [[(system of) selective marital separation]], I get the impression that not a few men I have the strong impression that many men think that it is their right to interfere with others and that it is their right to do so.
>  When a woman says, "This is my area and I will decide what to do from here," I feel like I'm being violated.
>  [[boundary between oneself and others]] is too weak.

There are many people who misunderstand, but there are no people who want to have separate surnames for married couples.
>  I just want to do what most men do as a matter of course, which is to > live with the last name I was born with.

> [vMP2JOuXu4icoEr](https://x.com/vMP2JOuXu4icoEr/status/1833321530635522236) "Married couples should have the same last name" is the obvious thing to say, that I want my request to be fulfilled, so I should be the one to make the change. It's bad enough that I can't get through to them as a matter of course.
>  (And it's even worse because you don't even want to take responsibility for making them change their last name by replacing "your demands" as if they were the demands of society or the other party, without realizing it)

> [X1446251931338](https://x.com/X1446251931338/status/1833399599748538543) Wow, I understand so much.
>  What's really going on with that [[desire for control]]?
