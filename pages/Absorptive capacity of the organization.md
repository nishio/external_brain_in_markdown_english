title: "Absorptive capacity of the organization"
---

> A closed organization has a harder time getting new knowledge. The ability of the organization to notice new things is reduced. As a result, the timing of noticing new opportunities and threats will lag behind competitors.
>
>  In addition, the lack of regular [[training for knowledge acquisition]] reduces [[the speed at which knowledge is acquired]]. As a result, even if they become aware of something new, the "cost required to acquire it" is estimated to be larger than that of their competitors, making it easier for them to decide that they should not invest in acquiring it.
>
>  Thus the organization is left behind in the marketplace. Since you became a member of the company of your own free will, it is your responsibility to ensure that the company does not get stuck in this quagmire.
