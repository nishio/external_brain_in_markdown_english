I believe that people who are [[too busy]] and cannot [[Controlling Emotions]], and people who are [[too much free time]] and [[Concerned about others]] are the ones who are irritated online. And when you are "too busy at work" & "too free in your private life", the ultimate monster is complete. If you meet one, run away without fighting.


Note that I thought this [[Too busy to control emotions]] was related to [[Intellectual Production and Vipassana]].
    - [[emotional control]]

The "too much time" one might have something to do with [[waste of time]].
