I was going to put together some information yesterday, but I got caught up in the development.
I need to organize my information today.

I have updated the "[/plurality-japanese/History of Plurality in Japan](https://scrapbox.io/plurality-japanese/History of Plurality in Japan)" page and created a page about upcoming events.
- I switched the chit-chat as well.

Let's have lunch.
- I tried to set up [[PLAUD NotePin]] before I left and the firmware update took a long time.
- I was thinking of walking to the next station, but it's already 2pm.

I told o3 to make about 2 million because if the cash to assets ratio was less than 1%, I was about to short the stone.

- Organizing "Japanese Stocks to Sell
    - Concentrated positions to be reduced: reduce excess by no more than 3% of total assets in any one stock
    - Overvalued or undervalued stocks (unrealized gains): xxx, yyy, zzz (+401 %) and others with higher valuations
        - It had increased fivefold while it was left unattended!<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Candidate for loss: aaa... and others that can be tax deductible at a loss.
- Visualization of tax value and AA after rebalancing on a sheet if needed (on request)
    - I'm not asking for that much.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
It's useful to give advice on the level of how many shares of a specific stock to sell as a summary! I'll follow that! I thought it was a holiday, but it was a holiday.
- I used to enjoy playing the game, but now it's too much of a hassle and I want the AI to buy and sell everything, and I'm still waiting for a brokerage firm that I can connect with on MCP.

By the way, for an AI to make the right decisions, it needs to put all the information in properly.
- The outcome also depends on the human perception of what is considered "everything".
- For example, information on how much they are paid per year in Japan, where the risk of dismissal is low.
    - Overwhelmingly stable compared to stock price movements
- I have life insurance to take care of my wife's needs in the event of my sudden death.
    - This is invested in dollar-denominated bonds.
    - Limited timing of withdrawals compared to regular bond purchases.
    - Targets that should be taken into account when considering the "funds should be allocated to stable financial instruments for retirement savings" argument.

- [[(a) gorilla]] I got it.
