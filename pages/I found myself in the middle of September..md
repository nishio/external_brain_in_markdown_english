title: "I found myself in the middle of September."

- I found myself in the middle of September.
    - I wondered why I didn't have a sense of the month, and the reason is simple: I realized that for a while now, I've been looking at my schedule in terms of "what's happening this week" instead of "what day of the month".
    - Put into iCal at the time of the event on what day of the month.
    - I lived to see "what's in store this week" every week.
    - I thought maybe it was a variant of "[[Don't make a to-do list ahead of time if you have ADHD.]]", where it becomes painful to look at the monthly schedule when the schedule gets too full beyond a certain point.
        - Capacity overflowed, so we narrowed the amount of information coming in.
- I feel like I'm trying out a new way of life.
    - I've been doing this for a few months and it's been rather tough, so I'm ready to tone it down.
- There are projects A, B, and C that seem to be going nowhere if I don't move forward, and A and B have deadlines and C does not.
    - When this happens, we tend to do only A and B.
    - A1 produces A2, and A2 produces A3.
        - There will never be a time to do C forever.
    - The solution to these situations is to put them on a schedule.
        - But the coarse way of putting "do C on this day" on a holiday was not executed.
                - [[Doraemon's Dorayaki Shop Story]] won.
        - First of all, I think [[the unit of "day" is too big]].
            - Weak power to start now.
        - Also, the task itself was vague, which is not good.
            - On the other hand, I don't have time to do it, and I don't avoid time for clarification.
        - So, I'm wondering if I should schedule an appointment with myself to spend time on one pomodoro clarification.

- The gears that used to mesh and rotate have come off due to overloading for a period of time, and then seem to not come back on even when the load has decreased.
    - I remember dealing with a gear problem.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/Hiro Aki/icon' alt='/villagepump/Hiro Aki.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - The shaft that supports the gears has worn out and rattled against the housing, the teeth on the surface of the gears have worn out and the gears no longer rotate properly, or the cause of failure is said to be insufficient strength of the gears due to excessive load.
        - After calculating the strength, it was found that there was enough margin to assume the loads that could occur, and the seizure due to lack of [[grease]] was treated as the reason for the memory.
        - I remember understanding well that gears turning at high speed must always be considered for cooling, and that maintenance is important.
- I thought I knew something else, but I forgot.
