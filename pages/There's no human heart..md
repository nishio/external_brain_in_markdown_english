title: "There's no human heart."
---

The expression "no human mind" is a line used to negatively evaluate others, but it is impossible to objectively observe what a "[[mind]]" is.
If people really do or don't have "heart", isn't it just as undesirable to evaluate people based on whether or not they have heart as it is to evaluate "that person has no legs" in a negative way?

- [[Discrimination -> undesirable]]
