- [[complex inter-relationship (as in the struggle between two types of vine over one piece of land)]] <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/葛藤/icon' alt='葛藤.icon' height="19.5"/>of [[cancellation]].

    - The idea that [[confrontation]] is something that will be resolved in the future.

Use as an icon.
Leave the conflict with a conflict icon and change it to a cessation icon when it is resolved.
I need a better icon, but I made it 20px high for now.
