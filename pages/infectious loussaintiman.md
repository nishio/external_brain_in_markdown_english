title: "infectious loussaintiman"

    - The elderly who have [[ressentiment]] preach to the young, and the naïve young are interrupted and become [[infected]] with lusantimania.
- Roussentiments are a rather infectious [[meme]], and since there are so many infected people, they can huddle together to create an [[echo chamber]] effect.
    - [Echo chamber phenomenon - Wikipedia [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A8%E3%82%B3%E3%83%BC%E3%83%81%E3%82%A7%E3%83%B3%E3%83%90%E3%83%BC%E7%8F%](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A8%E3%82%B3%E3%83%BC%E3%83%81%E3%82%A7%E3%83%B3%E3%83%90%E3%83%BC%E7%8F%) BE%E8%B1%A1]
- While it is good to have a mindset based on lusantimanism, it is not good to mistakenly believe that it is the only correct one.
    - It was pointed out over 100 years ago that there are two kinds of thinking: [[Monarch Morality and Slave Morality]].
- Instead of assimilating to the same ideology (i.e., becoming infected and becoming a [[(disease) carrier]]), it is better to understand the ideology but identify with it as something different from oneself (i.e., after being infected, one is cured and has [[immunity]]).
        - Having [[emulator]] is beneficial in itself.
