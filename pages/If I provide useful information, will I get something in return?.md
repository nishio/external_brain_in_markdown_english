- Is there a [[quid pro quo]] if I provide [[beneficial]] information?

    - The word "beneficial" seems to have a low resolution.
    - Who is it beneficial to?
    - In the market transaction metaphor, "customer perceived benefit" is measured by "how much the customer is willing to pay to get it.
        - So if you don't get something in return, then it wasn't beneficial.
            - It means that it was not beneficial to the customer "to the extent that they would be willing to pay for it."
            - This payment is not limited to monetary.
                - This includes hitting the like button and writing comments.
        - To what extent is the market transaction metaphor valid?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/yosider/icon' alt='/villagepump/yosider.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - The amount the buyer pays is not equal to the amount the seller receives.
            - Because [Transaction costs
        - For example, if you like something on Twitter, the sender is paid 10 yen.
            - When this is debited together with communication charges by carrier billing even if no procedures are taken
            - If you have to enter your credit card number each time
            - The amount received is the same, but the volume of transactions concluded is lower in the latter.
        - For those who don't yet use Scrapbox, it's a crazy costly pathway to "being asked to put your Google password into a service you don't understand".
    - Are we talking about not getting the expected return?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I feel like we need to design it so that it's easy to get the return we want to get.
