Every person is different, and so are the ways to improve

- [[Are we repeating the same thing or slightly different experiments?]]
[[Dr. Stretch]], I've been doing the leg spread for quite a while.
On the other hand, there were [[Steps to Awareness]] today.

Early on, the long seat was never 90 degrees to begin with.
When I bent my hips waist to 90 degrees, my knees were bent. This was because the chain on the rear side of the body was stiff.

As a countermeasure against this, the legs were opened by pressing the feet against the wall and keeping them at 90 degrees.
- [[wall open legs]]

Cross your legs [[standing forward bending]].
- This was done by first being able to perform normal standing counter-bending
- How did you come to be able to do a normal standing forward bend?
    - My hips are now bent at 90 degrees.
    - That meant he had to have soft muscles to bend his pelvis 90 degrees.

Then much longer for a while.
- When people think of leg spread, they tend to think of [[adductor muscle]].
- However, a phenomenon was observed in which the right side [[gluteus medius]] in particular was caught
- I was mainly doing [[PNF]] on the gluteus medius.

Sometimes [[psoas muscle]] was found to be stiff
- This was observed especially after conferences where they sat for long periods of time.

I'm starting to switch sometimes between when my adductor muscles are hooked and when my gluteus medius are hooked.

It was found that there was stiffness in the [[quadriceps muscle]], although the patient was not aware of it. Especially on the right side

Last time the bottleneck changed to the left side instead of the right side.

I noticed it yesterday.
- Iliopsoas muscle is very contracted.
    - Especially after concentrated work
    - Caused by cross-legged
    - And it does not move for several hours.
    - Most of the quad muscles have stiffened up too.

In other words, stretching in the direction of stretching the [[psoas muscle]] and [[quadriceps muscle]] should be done after or in between tasks.
- I found that by collecting information on lifestyle and the state of the body in various situations

After all, since lifestyles are [[different for each person]], what activities in the lifestyle will help improve the situation is also different for each person. The most important thing is to be aware of what to do.
