title: "Cases of URL shortening service advertisements directing users to inappropriate sites"
---

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1722831291987767336/photo/1) I see... Offensive ads are only displayed with a probability, and even if they are displayed, people who are familiar with IT will unconsciously pass them by. So it will be recognized as a social networking post in the form of "I got scammed when I read Company A's QR code" only after it is widely spread to people with mixed IT literacy...

We confirmed similar cases in our environment. However, it is not always the case that a suspicious site is posted because it is an advertisement.
>  Beware of places that use the same shortened URL service.

> [chiraura_yrc](https://twitter.com/chiraura_yrc/status/1722936957687492958/photo/1) I accessed the "New Autobacs membership renewal" QR code in the Autobacs DM. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to use the "new Autobacs membership renewal" QR code from the Autobacs DM, but I entered my card information and the payment was made while I was checking it out.

> [chiraura_yrc](https://twitter.com/chiraura_yrc/status/1722957589326204999) I immediately locked the card from Vpass and went through the process of deactivating and reissuing the card. I have also sent an email to the overseas site where I believe I registered, asking for a refund and withdrawal procedures.
>  I have also contacted Autobacs via email form.

>  Of course I have already contacted customer service without logging in.
