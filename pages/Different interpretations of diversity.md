title: "Different interpretations of diversity"

> [mathlava](https://x.com/mathlava/status/1971446002466029604) We usually use the word "diversity" without much thought, but the problem of quantifying it is very difficult and mathematically profound. For example, there are different opinions on the interpretation of whether A or B in the figure is more diverse.

> [mathlava](https://x.com/mathlava/status/1971449622708294004) The reason for the disagreement is that the interpretation of diversity depends on the balance between the number of categories ([[richness]]) and the evenness of their composition ([[evenness]]). The [[Shannon Diversity Index]], which has been used most often in biology, has had trouble expressing this.

By changing the value of this q, you can adjust the sensitivity to diversity, whether to emphasize rare categories or dominant categories by changing the value of q. The sensitivity to diversity can be adjusted.

From there, the discussion moves on to "what conditions of measure would satisfy the logical properties that we want diversity to have?" The discussion moved on to "What conditions are necessary for a measure to satisfy the logical properties that we want diversity to have? The axiomatic approach was born.

As a proponent of "[[consequential diversity]]", which states that the variation of elements that are not related to the objective in a composition that results from considering only elements related to the objective is described as "diverse", I feel that B may be distorted.
