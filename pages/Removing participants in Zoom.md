In [[Zoom]], participants can be kicked out from "Details" and "Delete" in the participant list. The ejected participant cannot participate again.

After 2020-04-04, you will need to log in with your Zoom account to participate from a browser.
It is likely that the deleted user will not be able to join again with that information remaining in their account, but that has not been verified yet.
