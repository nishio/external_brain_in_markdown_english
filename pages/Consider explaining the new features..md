title: "Consider explaining the new features."
---

A new command called "UPKW command" was created today, and I will consider explaining it.
- I wanted to explain a new feature, but he started talking about "how it used to be" or something like that.
    - This is an inadequate explanation of the user perspective
- After plowing through, the "what is the value?" question verbalized something close to user value.
    - I realized that the explanation to the user should bring this to the front of the line more often.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of UPKW command is that UPKW command?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Up until now, when it was running as a bot in an existing chat, such as Slack, the commands were entered by a human as a string. So they were short strings, and basically took no arguments, and were targeted to the keyword selected immediately before the command. The implementation that took arguments was implemented, but it was not used because it was too cumbersome.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of Slack is that Slack?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>A text-based user interface, also known as CUI.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of user interface is it?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>In creating the Web version, we decided to create our own user interface, and the idea naturally came to us that it would be a good idea to install the commands as buttons.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about its user interface?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Even commands that take arguments can be made into buttons for each argument.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of command is that command?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The first command I implemented was the NGKW command, which "removes keywords used in the previous question when they are keywords you don't want to dig into.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that command?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>This led to the idea that it would be nice to have a "command that tells the user to ask for more of a keyword that was not used in the previous question".
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is that command?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>They are lined up as buttons below the input fields. So you can separately present "keywords that were not chosen" that do not appear in the chat document.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of keywords are those?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Keywords extracted from user input.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about those keywords?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Users implicitly have keywords that they want you to dig into and keywords that they don't. By actually being asked a digging question, what they want you to dig into becomes an output and observable as a response of "No, don't dig into that" or "Ask me more about this".
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Software that can do this is valuable, and the UPKW command is valuable because it contributes to this.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that UPKW command?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>If used, the target keyword is more likely to be used in the question. The information that a user pressed this button is information that the user values the keyword selected by the button more highly than the keyword selected immediately before it, so if a lot of this information is collected, it could be used to improve the keyword selection algorithm.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where are those keywords?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>This is a button that expresses the feeling that the chosen keyword itself is not bad but the question just before is not so good üôÅ.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of last minute is that last minute?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>NGKW Last minute
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>The question is can it?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Not entirely impossible, but not clear how it can be achieved.

- >  We want to encourage the output of what is not yet clearly output in humans by having software work on it, and software that can do this is valuable, and the UPKW command is valuable because it contributes to this.
- What is the relationship between this UPKW command and the question?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>A command that pulls back "not that way, this way" when the bot starts asking misguided questions. So you get closer to a "good balance".
