Isn't formal knowledge impossible?
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1756502065789219107) In order to store knowledge capital and social-relationship capital in a company, doesn't it inevitably have to be membership-based employment rather than job-based?

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1756855175086780593) I took a step forward in my thinking about this story yesterday. If what members of an organization experience is "appropriately verbalized and converted into formal knowledge", it can be accumulated in the organization. So what is this "appropriate [[formal knowledge]]"? Is it possible? And then I thought, "No, isn't it impossible? and "No, I think it is impossible.

In order to do so, each member needs to have adequate [[linguistic ability]] and a work system that allows them to devote time to linguistic work in a relaxed manner, and I think that few organizations have been able to realize such an ideal. At least before LLM.

It's "preparing documentation, etc., about what you have experienced so that others who may need that knowledge in the future can reuse it without having to ask you questions", but it's pretty hard to do. People tend to get angry when they are not "done", but can you do it?

The former is to hire consultants, for example. The former would be to hire consultants, for example, and the latter would be to hire employees on a membership basis. In the future, they will have "[[an AI]] that answers questions.
