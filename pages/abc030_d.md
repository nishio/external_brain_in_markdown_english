Thoughts.
- In short, the problem of tracing a directed graph
- The number of steps K to follow is 10^100000
- The tracing part can be solved by [[doubling]], but I'd rather not do the binary expansion of K
- So, instead of doubling the doubling, we multiply it by 10 so that the decimal notation can be handled as it is.
Official Explanation
    - [[Loop detection instead of doubling]]
- I was thinking maybe 3 x 10^5 with doubling, but not because you have to multiply the word count 10^5 as well.
- I thought I was being asked about doubling huge numbers, but [[Surplus of huge numbers]] was gross.
