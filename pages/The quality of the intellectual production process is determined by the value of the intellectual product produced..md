### Digest of Research Notes
.

The value of the art of intellectual production is determined by the value of the resulting intellectual product. As producers of knowledge, we "produce" non-material "intellectual" things. In modern times, both the production and consumption of non-material things are common, and therefore require a higher level of resolution.

Intellectual production includes "knowledge already in circulation" in textbooks and other sources, but this is replicable and therefore unlikely to lead to differentiation. On the other hand, knowledge produced in the field of "application" is highly valuable. Therefore, there is value in "producing knowledge that is adapted to the situation.

Intellectual production techniques must be self-made. Intellectual productions are highly profitable and money-colored. Intellectual production is not stoic but fun.

Intellectual productivity is the augmentation of the capacities that contribute to intellectual production, the purpose of which is to advance the progress of civilization.

The rights to intellectual production are legally protected. Intellectual production is the use of knowledge to create value, and it is important to create new knowledge oneself.

In light of the above, improving intellectual production techniques and increasing the value of intellectual products requires the ability to use one's own knowledge and experience and to generate new knowledge that is appropriate to the situation. It is also important to understand the legal protection of intellectual productions.
