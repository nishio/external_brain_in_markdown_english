title: 'Resolution of "picture is out of date"'
---

(ChatGPT) "[[The picture is old.]]" is a remark that denies the artist's individuality and is often uttered when the editor is inexperienced. The artist should create a picture that matches his/her taste and taste, and it is important to verbalize and share with the editor the specific direction he/she is aiming for, rather than vague advice. This way, they will be able to get the advice they need, and the writer's excitement will be restored.
- The point that "the picture is old" is a [[vague]] term that comes from the inexperience of the editors [[if no specific point is made, it should be ignored."]].
- If there are specific pointers, they should be heard and can raise feelings in the direction of trial and error
- There is nothing wrong with drawing "90's style pictures," but it is more important to draw pictures that suit the artist's taste and personality.
