- Advantages of using existing terms rather than unique terms include the ability to Google and share stories with others.

- There's a common pattern of having a concept X that you thought of as far as your mind could go, only to find out later that it has a name.
    - [/blu3mo-public/ some knowledge I had before I knew about it](https://scrapbox.io/blu3mo-public/ some knowledge I had before I knew about it).
    - It would be nice to know the name already attached to the [/blu3mo-public/ concept](https://scrapbox.io/blu3mo-public/ concept).
            - [[Advantages of using existing terms instead of proprietary terms]] ：
        - >  Googleable
        - >  Then you can use [[Shoulder of the Giants]], [Wisdom of the ancients
        - >  Discussions about the concept (including counterclaims)
        - >  Post-XX against XX, and so on.
        - >  Can share the story with others who know the word
        - >  If others don't know the word, they can easily communicate it by Googling it (depending on the case).
    - (With Scrapbox, if you make the concept X a link, you can replace it all at once after you know it was named, which is convenient.)
