title: "nomadic philosophy"

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1638795656373612544) I would like to learn something like the "nomadic philosophy" of the non-settled [[nomad]]. Maybe it didn't stay in writing because they didn't want to carry something heavy like a philosophy book? But I'm sure there are researchers who went to check it out and wrote it down.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1638795932962787329) Settling agrarians are already riddled with biases due to their [[settlement]] way of life, so they need to learn nomadic thinking as a counter [nishio
    - [[agrarian bias]]

### digest of notes
.
Nishio states that he would like to learn about nomadic philosophy and points out the need to counter the bias of sedentary agrarians with nomadic thinking. He also seeks specific information about nomadic life and thinking.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The fragment "What to do for a living" is agrarian thinking is related to the part of the note "Settling agrarians are already riddled with biases due to the way of life they [[settle]]." This indicates that agrarian life and thinking tend to be fixed to a certain place or job.

The fragment about mobile people linking settled people is related to the "need to learn nomadic thinking" section of the note. This suggests that the perspectives and thoughts of nomads (people on the move) may broaden the perspectives of those who settle down and create new values.

### deep thinking
The nomadic way of thinking and living shows the potential for new ways of working and living in modern society. By freeing themselves from the biases of sedentary agriculturalists, it is thought that freer and more diverse ways of living and working will become possible.
