Before federalization, the states, or 13 colonies, were established by English immigrants from the 16th to 18th centuries with different purposes and backgrounds. For example, the New England colonies (e.g., Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut), built by Puritans seeking religious freedom; the Central colonies (e.g., New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware), founded by commercial and diverse immigrant groups; and Southern colonies (e.g., Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia), which developed around plantation agriculture. These colonies were established under different systems, such as the company, fiefdom, and self-governing colonies, and while each developed its own self-governing institutions (such as colonial assemblies), they were ultimately under the authority of the British Empire, which led to the American Revolutionary War This led to the American Revolutionary War.

crown colony
- They were established under the direct rule of the king, with the governor appointed as the king's representative. Representative examples include New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.

fiefdom
- The colony was established by a patent granted by the king, with the right to govern by an individual or family. Final authority, however, belonged to the king. Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland are examples.
    - A company colony is a form of colonization and governance overseas in which a private company (patent company) that has received a patent (royal warrant) from the government solicits funds from investors.
    - These companies were granted exclusive trading rights, tax collection rights, and in some cases administrative rights by the government, and were established for the purpose of territorial expansion and resource expropriation in remote areas. The British East India Company and the Dutch East India Company are representative examples of large-scale colonial operations backed by private capital.

autonomous colony
- These are colonies where the immigrants themselves were allowed to govern themselves through assemblies (such as the Colonial Congress). Connecticut and Rhode Island are typical examples. Massachusetts was originally a royal colony, but its semi-autonomous character was strengthened later when its residents elected a governor and an assembly.
