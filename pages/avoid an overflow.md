- There is a container that can hold 20
    - Container contains 10.
    - Now there is a chance to get 20
- A: Let's get 10 now!
- B: [procrastination
    - 10 overflowing and lost if you try to gain now, what a waste!
    - Better to get it after consuming the 10 already in the container.

Which is better depends on the situation, but I think in many cases people inappropriately choose B.
- Because B tends to overlook "the loss of delay in action" and "the possibility of losing the opportunity to gain 20 while procrastinating".
