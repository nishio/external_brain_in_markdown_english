title: "15 min."
---

Trap of spending time looking for the best way to do things.

If you can't come up with the best way to do it after 15 minutes of thinking about it, it's unlikely you'll come up with another 15 minutes.

Don't let the best be the enemy of the good.
- [[the best is the enemy of the good]]
