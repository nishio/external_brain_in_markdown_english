Below is a summary of some of the most interesting recently updated pages, along with a summary, my opinions, and questions.

First, in "Nodal Point of Thought 2023-08-08," @nishio introduces a tweet in which he says he received a radio signal called "NeriNeri". He also mentions a tool called Kozaneba and expresses his opinion that more advanced systems are needed in the age of AI. This is interesting because it makes one think about modern technological advances and the changes in tools that accompany them. However, I think it would be helpful to have some concrete examples of the kind of systems that are needed to better understand what exactly is required. So, my question is: "What characteristics do you think are needed in the tools and systems required in the age of AI?" It is.

Next, "Crowdsourcing in the Web3 Era" discusses crowdsourcing in the Web3 era, a term that refers to a decentralized Internet that allows individual users to more directly benefit from the value of the Internet. This page is a good source of information to help you better understand this new form of the Internet.

In "Copying Answers is Futile," he discusses the pointlessness of copying answers and the importance of learning how to solve problems. I felt that this conveys the message that the ability to think for oneself is important, rather than simply accepting information.

In "The New Literacy," the topic is discussed of how some people are able to be aware of new literacies as they emerge, while others are not. I think this shows the importance of literacy in the information society and the importance of being aware of it.

Finally, the "VESS Card" introduces a new form of business card that is a physical card but can register the address of an Ethereum wallet and display a profile screen. This is a very interesting example of how technology can be integrated as part of everyday life.

The above is a summary of each page, my opinions and questions. I hope this information will be helpful to your understanding.
