I want to read Scrapbox offline.
Other
- Even if the signal is within the coverage area, in a valley, there is no signal at all.
    - Scrapbox and Google Maps fail even though antenna is up.
    - As for the escape route, it would have been nice to find out in advance the buses, etc. from the possible junctions to the destination.
        - And it would be nice to be able to put that research in a place where we can share it with our members.
        - You want to read offline locally, so Scrapbox is not the way to go.
