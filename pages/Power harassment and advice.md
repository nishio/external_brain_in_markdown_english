title: "Power harassment and advice"
---

    - [[power harassment]]
- If someone with power doesn't do it, it's not harassment.
- If Mr. X gives [[advice]] and the other party, Mr. Y, does not agree with the advice, and Mr. X has the power to force Mr. Y to follow the advice even if he does not agree with it, then [[enforcement]] is considered harassment even if the advice was intended by the other party.
    - Even if the force is not externally given, Mr. Y's personality would read compulsion into it.

- [[read the situation]]
- [[Forced by air]]
- [[Dare to air]]
