The KJ method was created to "summarize a lot of qualitative data" and then applied to various purposes

Calling this "expanded scope" the KJ method seems to me to be vague in its objectives ,

Is the purpose of Thinking Fireworks to "quickly find the Next Action"?
- Not a messy decision, but one based on data.

- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Yeah, well, the conclusion is not always the action.
    - It could also conclude, "There's nothing we can do about this at this time, so we're going to hold off until six months from now."


I tried to show that I was working on such a tool, but there was no mention of it on the [[Kozaneba digital stationery to organize your thoughts]] page.
