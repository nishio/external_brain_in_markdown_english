[[Taha Yasseri]] points out the danger of LLMs being perceived as an authoritative source of information for users, spreading "the illusion that there is a consensus in society when there really is no consensus. For example, when a user asks an AI about a controversial issue, the AI will respond by summarizing the mainstream views in the training data. The user may misinterpret this as "everyone's opinion. When only one point of view is presented repeatedly in this way, it can create the illusion that it is a consensus supported by multiple independent sources. This is what the author calls "[[the]] illusion of consensus. When this illusion is combined with a "spiral of silence" that makes it difficult for people to express minority opinions, society becomes more monolithic than it really is, and [[plurality]] may be lost.
