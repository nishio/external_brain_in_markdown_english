Even if there is no clear boundary between black and white, it is possible for a particular subject to be clearly black.
- In the diagram, there is no distinct boundary between white and black
    - B argues, "Y is a gray area where it's unclear if it's white or black."
    - Despite this, A's assertion that "X is black" can still hold true

This is due to a variation in the definition of "clarity."
- B's definition of "clear distinction between black and white" is "for any x, it is known whether it is white or black."
- A's assertion is "for a specific X, it is known whether it is white or black."
- B's condition is more stringent

In [[Darwin Incident]]2 p.86, a vegan argued from A's perspective
- In response to B's claim, "Can ants or cabbages feel pain? Current science may not know," 
- They argued, "Even if it's unclear whether ants or cabbages feel pain, it is clearly known that cows feel pain."
