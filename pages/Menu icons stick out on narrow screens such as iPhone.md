Menu icons stick out on narrow screens such as iPhone
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/75da1e99b5128ffc320d7eb1bfd6cd94/thumb/1000)
    - Menu icons are sticking out
    - TODO: Include code to make icons smaller when width is small!

cause
- Because the spacers between the buttons were a fixed length to fit the iPad
    - [[Using Conditional Branches, Variables, and Calculations with CSS]]
- It might be too wide on iPad or PC, maybe specifying max-width would help?
    - But I'm sure they'll eventually add more buttons or something, so not now.
