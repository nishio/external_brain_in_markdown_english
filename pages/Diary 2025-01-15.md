> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1879104268294390258) The feeling I get when I see people in their 20s now using AI to generate code is the same feeling I think the older generation got when we used to use IDEs to compile code we knew would never compile. I think it's the same feeling that the older generation felt when we were compiling code that we knew wouldn't pass the compile test with the IDE, and saying things like, "The IDE doesn't respond well to changes when the development machine is not powerful enough, so productivity goes down.
- Well, but they call it CI, and they don't change the source code, but they run tests by fixing typos in the documentation.
[[IDE]]
[[CI]]


- [[Non-verbally acquired skills]]

- [[Risks on both sides of AI costs]]
