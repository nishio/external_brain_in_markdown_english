>  Japan's current entrepreneurs are just subcontractors to them. So the market capitalization ranking in Japan will not be replaced. It is natural.

It's just that they switch it to "it's not interesting" because it's painful to admit the fact that "I found something interesting", which means the decline of their own antennae.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1966513133545025577) If you simply don't find it interesting without that kind of jealousy or cognitive dissonance, you simply let it pass, and if you don't think it's interesting enough to act on at the moment but might in the future, you say "interesting. If you don't think it's interesting enough to act on at the moment, but you think it might be in the future, you say, "Well, let me know if there's an update," and act as if the information is coming in.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1966513905527890052) It's futile to argue with such elders, so you can spell "kicho nagoi ken arigatoo gozaimasu" and press the mute button on your mind and prove it with your achievements! Yo!

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1966523645532012637) I think we need to firmly refute these things when we see them, because it is a social loss when the elders' side of the argument goes through and the young people's tension drops. It is a kind of misinformation or harmful meme, so I think it should function like a vaccination to immunize society by criticizing it whenever we see it.
