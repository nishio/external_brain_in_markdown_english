It was interesting to hear a friend talk about how to raise a [[subordinate person]], so I considered it.

Assume the following assumptions
- A situation where the subordinate's current abilities are overall inferior to your own and "[It's faster if I do it myself.
- Subordinates' strengths are different from their own
- You have some control over what your subordinates learn.

There are three different policies on what to study.
![image](https://gyazo.com/403868ef30e6def7eabde59d540c16a4/thumb/1000)
- A: [Overcoming Weaknesses
- B: Teach [[Teach what you are good at.]].
- C: opponent's [[develop one's strengths]].

- A: Allow them to overcome their weaknesses
    - Raise the overall bottom line by focusing on developing the weakest areas
    - It will be a form of training generalists see #Specialists and generalists
    - When your overall ability has grown enough to exceed your general ability, you can concentrate on your strengths and delegate other things to that person.
    - demerit
        - Time cost to become a useful resource is quite high
        - Difficulty in maintaining motivation because they are forced to do only what they are not good at.
- B: Teach what you are good at
    - Teach what you know best so you can learn more efficiently.
        - In the figure, I wrote C higher, but B is more likely to be higher.
    - Beneficial when you are short of your own resources and need a clone who can work in your place
    - demerit
        - High time cost until the education target reaches a level where it can be replaced by you because it is where you are strongest.
- C: Developing the strengths of the other party
    - Stretch out where the opponent is strong at the moment
            - From the standpoint of [[comparative advantage]], it is justified to swing the task where the opponent is strong.
    - If it doesn't clearly exist, then by being biased in the type of work you do, you create a situation where you are relatively more knowledgeable about that type of work than others, and extend that as a strong point.
    - Easy to motivate
    - It is possible to create a situation where the other party performs better than you with respect to their area of expertise, at a low cost.
    - Increased productivity] through delegation works.
    - demerit
        - The strengths of the other party will determine the areas to be developed, so it is not always possible to develop what is convenient for us.


My friend told me that C "is the right way to develop strengths". I summarized the three different methods and the advantages and disadvantages of each for comparison. I too think C > B > A.

Noticed the connection with [[Stretch out the pointy end.]] on 2018-10-23

- [[A good boss takes advantage of the "sharp edges" of his subordinates.]]
