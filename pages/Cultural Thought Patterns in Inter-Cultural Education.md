[[Robert Kaplan's]] 1966 article "Cultural Thought Patterns in Inter-Cultural Education" is an important study that analyzed differences in sentence structure and logical development among people from different linguistic backgrounds and laid the foundation for [[contrastive rhetoric]] (Contrastive Rhetoric] by analyzing the differences in sentence structure and logical development between people of different linguistic backgrounds.

Paper Outline
- Kaplan analyzed the English compositions of approximately 600 international students and noted that native language thought patterns influence the structure of English sentences.
- He has schematized the logical structure of each language as follows
    - English: Straightforward, central opinions and conclusions are stated at the beginning.
    - Semitic (e.g. Arabic): a series of continuous coordinate structures.
    - Oriental languages (e.g., Japanese, Chinese): spiral, indirect approach to reaching conclusions.
    - Romance languages (French, Spanish, etc.): take a lateral approach and approach the subject matter indirectly.
    - Russian: zigzag pattern, approaching the subject matter from multiple angles.
- These patterns are said to reflect the thinking and communication styles of each culture.

Logical development of Japanese
- The following characteristics of Japanese sentence structure have been noted:
    - Indirect approach: Do not directly state conclusions or assertions, but emphasize background information and contextual explanations.
    - Leave it to the reader's interpretation: the writer does not explicitly state his/her intention, but the reader is expected to take the meaning from the context.
    - Kiyo-sei-tenketsu" structure: a traditional structure in which things are explained in order and a conclusion is given at the end.
- These characteristics are related to the culture of "[[satori]]" and the communication style of [[avoiding direct expression]] in Japanese culture.

Criticisms and subsequent research
- Kaplan's model was also criticized for oversimplifying the rhetorical structure of each language.
- However, this study was a starting point for understanding cross-cultural differences in sentence structure and has influenced many subsequent studies.
- For example, Hinds (1987) points out that in Japanese writing, the reader is responsible for reading consistency, and the writer does not make everything explicit.
- Kobayashi (1984) also shows that logical development varies not only with language but also with the place and situation in which it is used.
        - [[A Consideration of the Logical Development of the Japanese in Expressing their Opinions]]

summary
- Kaplan's 1966 paper revealed how different cultures and language backgrounds affect the logical development of a text, and played an important role in developing understanding in cross-cultural communication and education.
- Subsequent studies have provided more in-depth analysis of the characteristics of each language and culture, and have accumulated knowledge to promote cross-cultural understanding.
