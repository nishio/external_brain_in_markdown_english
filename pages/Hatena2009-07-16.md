Yeah, I was looking at the sunset sky yesterday, and I noticed that between the blue sky and the sunset, it's not magenta, it's more like blue to white to yellow to red.

<body>Between the red light and the blue light there is green light, so that's what makes it white or yellow. It's a matter of scattering which color the sky will be, not that the original light doesn't have green wavelengths. </body>
