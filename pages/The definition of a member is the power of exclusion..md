title: "The definition of a member is the power of exclusion."

> Often you start some organization, it grows, and then the initial objectives fade away, right? So it's fine to reaffirm "[[Organizational Objectives]]", but the [[organization]] that starts reaffirming "member definitions" is doomed to [[decline]] and disappear. The more we try to define them properly, the fewer people will fit the definition.
>  "[[Member Definition]]" is basically "the power of [[elimination]] orientation. It tries to preserve the purity of the values held by the current members. No new ones are allowed in, and those that have been altered by former members are eliminated, and as a result, they have to decline. I sense a similar odor in the definition of "engineer" in some places.
