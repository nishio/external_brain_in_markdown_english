SNS has diverse roles
- [[subdividing the utility satisfied by SNSs]].
        - [[Diary 2023-08-01]]
        - > If you want to get a megaphone to reach a lot of people, you should stop using Japanese

    - [[Why do social networking sites rise and fall?]]
    - > In the beginning, we are a group of [[early adopters]].
    - > There is an accumulation effect of [[SOC]] in networking with that group (pointed out by [[tokoroten]]).
    - > When it spreads, [[late majority]] comes in.
    - > Human resource density becomes diluted and less useful.
    - > Early adopters move to another [[SNS]].
- This places value on "[[building a human network]]".
    - For the past few years, for me, "[[a social networking site with early adopters]]" has been [[Scrapbox]].
    - This ultimately only needs to be a "[[social network]]" and it doesn't have to be an online system
        - Join a community of other kinds of early adopters.
        - [[Plurality Tokyo]], [[name-your-enemy party]], [[Social Hack Day]], etc.
