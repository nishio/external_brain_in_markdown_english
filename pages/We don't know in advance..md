title: "We don't know in advance."

- [[in advance]] don't know.
    - Only [[posterior]] can tell.

- [[hindsight bias]]

- [[publication bias]]
- When a successful person is interviewed and told that "[[Success is luck]]" is not interesting for an article, a [[story]] is fabricated that "it's because there was some kind of prior expectation and it turned out the way it was supposed to".
