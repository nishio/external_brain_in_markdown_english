I really like this diagram.
I have been working on [[KPT]] until now.
- [[Keep]]
- [[Problem]]
- [[Try]]
I recognized it as a tasteless list of three words.

What's good about this diagram

Arranging them like this clarifies the time frame.
- Decide [[Try]]=[[Next Action]] for the current [Problem
- The next time you look back, you know the result of that Try.
    - Of those that produced good results, those that will be continued next time go into Keep.
        - Stop what is not worth continuing.
        - I like that it's explicitly stated to stop.
    - Those that did not produce good results are naturally accompanied by some kind of Problem.
        - Problem can spontaneously disappear over time.

So, I was inspired by this diagram and added some things.

I had a lot of fun and painted a lot of things.

I drew too much and the diagram was messy. Not good. Explanation:.
- [[Problem]] is the gap between [[Reality]] and [[Vision]]: [[Problem Solving Methods]] [[The problem is the gap between ideal and reality]]
- It is [[creative tension]] that pulls Reality into Vision: [[Learning Organization]].
- Negative beliefs pull in the opposite direction. See: [[Ideal, Reality and Helplessness]].
- Problem-solving methods consider multiple causes of reality and focus on those related to people
- Negative beliefs are part of [[policy constraints]], [[constraints]]: [[constraint theory]]
- When Reality is a Problem, the action to get out of it is Remedy, and the place you want to reach after getting out is Outcome, which is a concept similar to Vision: [[PRO Model]].
    - [Keep corresponds to Again, Quit corresponds to Abandon.
