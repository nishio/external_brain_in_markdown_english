This chat system is not a good way to organize tasks.
â†’ Maybe we can make a version that asks questions to help organize tasks. Joining with [Motivational Advice

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I want to organize my tasks for tomorrow and beyond, but I also have a feeling that this chat system might not be the best for task organization, and I'm bothered by it, so I want to organize it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of chat system is that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The system has an initial question, answers it, finds keywords from the answers, and asks questions about them. So it has one root, but task organization has many roots because "there are many tasks that are not necessarily related to each other, and you have to write them down first. The way of asking questions needs to change.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of task is the task?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>If it were an urgent and important task, we would have to do it without having to worry about it, so basically it would be "tasks that look important but are not urgent". In terms of task management, they say, "Let's write down everything that's bothering you first," so if you want to do that with this system, the question would be, "Is there anything else that's bothering you?" And then, "Is there anything else that's bothering you?" and keep asking them until they say, "No more"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that task?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I think it's rather possible if you specialize the way you ask questions to organize tasks, but thinking about it and making it is one of the "tasks that might be good to do but are not urgent"
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is the task?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The task is in the brain, and that is confusing, so it needs to be written down. Same composition here. If it's like writing out a task, I would ignore all the questions that don't ring a bell and just say what I want to say.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is the task located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>In the meantime, let's look back at the tasks in this week's work log. First of all, when using this, there is an inconvenience that happens when the text field is covered by the keyboard. Why does it happen and how can I solve it? It is important because it greatly affects the usability of the system.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Ease of use is important. Also, right now, for importing into Regroup, I keep copying and pasting and then hitting the split button, but I end up splitting everything, so I think "one click sends it to the server, and Regroup opens with all the split contents" is fine.

- What does this task look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I wonder what it is. There is a lack of content stored by the chat server and the problem of extracted keywords not being in chronological order needs to be resolved. When organizing, it is inconvenient to not have the extracted keywords nearby.

- Where does this task come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Tasks appear as something that fills the gap between reality and the ideal when you use what you have created. It is often impossible to verbalize what is ideal until we see what we have created.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>How do you know what the task is?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I want to make sure that commands such as "ask first" in chat do not become stickies. Write test code before messing with the chat server internals. What specific tests would you write? I want to be able to take machine learning training data. I want to download data from Firebase. I also want to delete objects that are created by "opened page but did not talk" and so on.

- What do you hope will happen with this task?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Tasks are good when they are solved. Since a task is the gap between the ideal and reality, it will disappear if the ideal changes or if the ideal state is reached. I want to create a user object. What will be stored there? For example, in my case, I write "listening chat system" but every time I write "chat system". It would be nice to remember high-frequency phrases.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to that task for it to work?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The task must be clear enough and motivated enough to solve it. Since none of the tasks are urgent and unenforceable, they can easily be stopped if there are factors that hinder motivation.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Can that task do it?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>You need "task clarification tasks," often.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between the task and all of them?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>NG
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  "Tasks to clarify tasks" Often needed.
- Is this task the same as all of them? Is it different?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's not a good idea to cut everything out as keywords.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to the task when its all done?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>NGKW
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of NGKW is that NGKW?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Mmm, this behavior is a bug.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of bug is it?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>That's supposed to be a command, so it's not supposed to be a keyword.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of keywords are those?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Continuing with the task export, "There's a bug where the command is a keyword, I'll look into it and fix it."
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about those keywords?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>As for the chat web client, I would like to be able to send commands. Up until now, since it was a chatbot, we had to send commands as strings, but it would be nice to be able to use buttons to give feedback to the keywords picked just before, such as "don't dig into that," or "all of them," as I mentioned earlier.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of command is that command?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It would be nice to have commands like, "Let's get this over with," or "You're getting too far from where you wanted to be in the first place."
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that command?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I need a page explaining how to use it, including the commands. But I also want to do it after I can log properly.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is that command?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I think the "Kikidashi Chat System" page is an appropriate place to put the explanation. The page is a bit cluttered at the moment, so it should be moved to a separate page.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that chat system?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Hmmm, this usage seems to be in a state of "I'm in the middle of writing out a task, and someone interrupts me from the side, and sometimes it distracts me from the task", which is not good!
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  I need a page explaining how to use it, including an explanation of the commands. But I'm also inclined to wait until I can get a proper log.
- Where is this command located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>After all, this current system is tied to a form of delving into a single topic!
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  I need a page explaining how to use it, including an explanation of the commands. But I'm also inclined to wait until I can get a proper log.
- What does this command look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I'll make a Kanban in Github Project tomorrow and see if I can get it in there...
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  I need a page explaining how to use it, including an explanation of the commands. But I'm also inclined to wait until I can get a proper log.
- Where does this command come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I noticed when I tried to export this to Scrapbox, I didn't deploy it and the icon change is not yet implemented.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>

- How do you know this command?
