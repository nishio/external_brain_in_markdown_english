title: "People who, when they want to praise something, belittle something else."
---

When someone wants to praise something, they belittle something else.
Why it happens.
- Lack of confidence in X to praise.
    - If you're confident, you can just say, "I love X, no matter what anyone says!" that's all you need to say.
    - I want others to approve of my "feeling that X is good" because I'm not confident
    - So I want to talk about "why X is better".
- Can't name a single "reason why X is better."
    - If it's clear why X is better, just tell them that.
    - Unable to explain why, and their reasons are not sufficiently convincing
    - So belittle something Y that is not X.
- Contrary to his intention, belittling Y will not convince him of the merits of X.
    - No amount of "Y is bad" can make "X is good."
    - It just spreads the fact that "some people can't explain how good X is, and they're just belittling Y."
    - X rating is more or less down.
