title: "It's not a one-on-one dialogue."
---

People who think "it is not good to continue without a response" perceive social networking sites as one-on-one [[dialogues]], when in fact they are more like [[shared whiteboards]] where anyone can post as many times as they wish. If someone thinks a post is incorrect, it is more natural for the point to be repeated until it is corrected.

- > "I will continue even though you have not responded" is for the reference of other tweet readers. This is a public tweet, so of course I am not writing this with only one of you in mind.

I modified the wording a bit.
- before It is more natural that if a wrong post is not corrected, the point will be repeated until it is corrected.
- after If someone thinks the writing is incorrect, it is more natural for the point to be repeated until it is corrected.
- It is not a requirement that the first statement be incorrect.
