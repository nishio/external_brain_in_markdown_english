There are diverse [the weak

> [kitazatosatuki](https://x.com/kitazatosatuki/status/1815008705207058875) I think masks can certainly be harmful in situations where you learn to read lips!

>  Just how far would wearing a mask on a train be harmful?

>  Pregnant women, people undergoing cancer treatment, and many other people on the train

>  Since I work in obstetrics and gynecology, I consider such people as vulnerable in infectious diseases and recommend wearing masks on trains!
>  >tsukio45: This person also doesn't seem to have an eye for the children at the deaf school.
>  A person I work with at a certain prefectural school for the deaf lamented that the masks are a detriment for deaf children to learn to read others' facial expressions and lip-read in social life, though.

> [tsukio45](https://x.com/tsukio45/status/1815019505678180356) I understand the need to wear masks on trains.

>  The more individuals work to wear masks, the more alienated the hearing impaired feel, which is truly a synthetic fallacy.
>  I've already given up. However, I would be happy to know that there are people who are crippled by not being able to see the expression on the other person's face.
