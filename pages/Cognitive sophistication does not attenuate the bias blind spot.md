title: "Cognitive sophistication does not attenuate the bias blind spot"
---

- bias blind spot: [[Blind spot of bias]] is a cognitive bias in which one can recognize the influence of bias in the judgments of others, but cannot recognize the influence of bias on one's own judgments. [blind spot of bias - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/バイアスの盲点) #blind spot
- Even with cognitive sophistication, this blind spot doesn't get smaller. Rather, the size of the blind spot correlates with cognitive sophistication.
- And even if there is no bias blind spot, it does not mean that classic cognitive biases can be avoided.
> The so-called bias blind spot arises when people report that thinking biases are more prevalent in others than in themselves. Bias turns out to be relatively easy to recognize in the behaviors of others, but often difficult to detect in one’s own judgments. Most previous research on the bias blind spot has focused on bias in the social domain. In 2 studies, we found replicable bias blind spots with respect to many of the classic cognitive biases studied in the heuristics and biases literature (e.g., Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).
>  Further, we found that none of these bias blind spots were attenuated by measures of cognitive sophistication such as cognitive ability or thinking dispositions related to bias. If anything, a larger bias blind spot was associated with higher cognitive ability. Additional analyses indicated that being free of the bias blind spot does not help a person avoid the actual classic cognitive biases. We discuss these findings in terms of a generic dual-process theory of cognition.

    - I guess the only way to do that is to have a computer secretary gently tell me from next door that I'm addicted to bias.
    - When other homo sapiens tell me, "You're wrong! and I don't take it in stride.
        - He's a monkey, it can't be helped...
            - [Intelligent bodies that are not homo sapiens.
    - If not computers, then aliens who are vastly more powerful than homo sapiens show up, so be it.
        - In short, the problem is that homo sapiens tend to look down on the same homo sapiens, so they must be different
