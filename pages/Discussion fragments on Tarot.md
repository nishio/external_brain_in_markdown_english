title: "Discussion fragments on Tarot"
---

from  [[tarot]]

I would like Ohkubo Kohei to use his knowledge of magic to verbalize "the structure that important inventions in the history of magic have". The only thing I know is "If there is something that customers don't want to see, emphasize what you don't mind being seen".
After drawing TRIZ again, I thought that the first part is a rather generic collection of things, and the nesting and asymmetry are rather interesting perspectives, but the last part, "increase oxygen", can be more abstract.
The "change materials" and "change methods" that appeared in the TRIZ section also appeared last year as part of the "5 methods of innovation," but I am wondering whether it would be better to use the 5 cards separately or as a group of cards. The other three are "change the product," "change the market," and "change the organization," and the other one, "change the way you get paid," which is very important these days, is missing. I wonder if monthly installment sales had not yet been invented in Schumpeter's time.
It's like reading the back or the page designated by the card number, and there's an explanation.
My image is that there is a chart on the front with diagrams that may or may not be legible, and an explanation in the back.

You could make it in PowerPoint and print it on business card paper.

- TRIZ cards, already there.
For now, let's collect the explanatory texts of the total of 78 Major and Minor Arcana of Tarot, 64 hexagrams of I Ching, and (10 planets + 4 asteroids) x 12 palaces of astrology from somewhere and find out the main components w
In order to promote collepon, it is important to be moderately detailed, but the degree of detail depends on the situation, doesn't it? Therefore, I thought it would be good to be able to adjust the aperture to "this in 10 sheets", "this in 32 sheets", "this in 64 sheets..." and so on.
For principal component analysis, you can choose any N.
No, I'd still like to get that out of a principal component analysis, not a human conceptualization.
I know the first two pictures are "yin" and "yang".
I wonder if there are any studies that synthesize the metaphors of tarot, Osborn's checklist, astrology, and many other things out there, and do a principal component analysis to extract the 40 most important patterns.
The basic premise of TRIZ is to focus on how to resolve the trade-off relationship between physical performance, so you have to abstract yourself one more step to apply it to software and so on.
Yes, so recently I've been wondering if it would be possible to create a tarot where the symbols on the front are math or science themed, etc.
