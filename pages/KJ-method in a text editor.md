title: "KJ-method in a text editor"
---

- The [[KJ method]] has the appearance of using [[tag]], but it is only a prominent appearance.
The essential [[grouping]] process is not much different from the process of "writing one item per line of what comes to mind in the [[outline processor]], then moving it up and down so that strongly related items are close together. Would it be easier to explain the two in parallel?

As a thought experiment, what would I do if I had no pens or sticky notes, only a text editor, and I wanted to do something KJ-legal?
First, write a series of short sentences in a text editor, one line at a time, then pair the lines as you go along, and when you have gathered some, add a title, copy and paste just the title, and repeat.

    - 1 Write down
    - 2 Create a blank area by putting a line break in the front and sending it to the bottom.
    - 3 4 Make pairs and move them to a blank piece of paper.
    - 5 Repeat
    - 6 Finally, everything will be grouped together.
    - 7 Put a nameplate on the group
    - 8 Send it down with a new line, copy and paste only the front cover and collect it in the blank area.
    - Back to 1.

What's harder with this than with sticky notes.
- It's hard to display 100 items in the missing direction.
- What to do when you want to express something that cannot be expressed well in words in a diagram?
    - Large overhead
