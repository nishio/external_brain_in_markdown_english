- There was no hassle, I could start setting it up with just my iPhone, and I was able to charge it via Apple Pay.
- The Suica I usually use is set to auto-charge 10,000 yen when it's less than 5,000 yen.
    - I tried to tie it together, left it unattended because I didn't know what I was doing, but it was easy to create a new one.
