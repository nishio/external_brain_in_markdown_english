title: "Chasm and Population"

>  [[chasm]] figure doesn't assume a uniform population distribution?
>  [[demographic bonus period]] is dominated by young people, often just before the chasm, hence new businesses flourish
>  [[PERIOD OF POPULATION OVERESTIMATION]] is older, more behind the chasm, hence more conservative firms, more difficult for new business

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1419145595906707459): not a simple composition of age only, but "people who saw it for the first time" appreciate it more highly than it really is and get excited, and "people who have seen something similar in the past" are subsequently disillusioned The image of stepping on the brake after remembering the period
    - Disillusionment period of [hype cycle

> And when one is caught up in [[Pessimistic Misconceptions]], one cannot get out of it because it inhibits one from "trying," and over time people move from optimism to pessimism.
> If a certain balance is optimal, then a society that has increased its life expectancy from that point is overly pessimistic. Is this what you meant to say?

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1419159672477536256): ...... that doesn't have to be forcibly explained by hype cycles, the human capacity to learn You're assuming too much that the human capacity to learn doesn't change throughout life.
> It's usually [[Decreased curiosity due to aging]], and a diminished ability to learn is a sufficient explanation,
>  Conversely, at younger ages, in addition to the reverse of the above, idiosyncratic consumption activities are associated with sex appeal

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1419167804121518087): It is true that as we age we lose the ability to learn new things, but I think that in addition, "[[Disregard for the new]]" is causing the behavior of "not devoting resources to learning it," and that has a significant impact. I think that the "disregard for the new" is causing the behavior of "not devoting resources to learning it", and the effect of that may be significant. And what causes this "disregard" and "pessimism" and "[[learned helplessness]]"?

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1419170605971034114): I think I can roughly explain it in terms of sex appeal
> Because in human society "[[Adaptability to new things]]" appears to be an indicator of sexual excellence,
> As the need to appeal for sex disappears, the ability to learn is reduced

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1419173693469589506): hmmm. I think that hypothesis is a bit overstated when you consider, for example, whether people who enthusiastically tinkered with computers in the early days of computers thought that it would lead to sexual appeal to the opposite sex, or whether it did in fact lead to sexual appeal.
> It's an observable fact that there are small wealthy first generation men who study youth culture to attract the attention of young women.
