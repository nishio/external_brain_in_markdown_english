title: "common enemy"

> [@yubais](https://twitter.com/yubais/status/1669245913955733506?s=46&t=gkSZtjGEtUZPO0JCzBxCBw): "unite when you have a common [[enemy]]" is precisely "unite when you [[attack]] a common opponent together". It doesn't have to be an enemy, but rather [[the weak]] who can't fight back is preferable.
