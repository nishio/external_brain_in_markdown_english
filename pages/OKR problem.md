- Problem with words such as "OKR" and "MBR" being broken into new lines
    - I really want three letters side by side.
- relevance
        - [[Automatic font size adjustment for stickies]]
- English words try to avoid folding as much as possible.
- But if you don't wrap it, the font could be very small.
    - So, if it is a "wrap-around character all the way from the beginning of the line", I'm going to wrap it.
    - The result is only three characters, but it's folded.

- OKR" is broken into "→/OKR" because "→" is not alphabetic and the line should be broken here.

proposed amendment
- > "Wrap if the character is a "wrap-around avoidance character all the way from the beginning of the line".
    - Minimum Length Limit on
- > "→" is not alphabetical.
    - alphabetize
