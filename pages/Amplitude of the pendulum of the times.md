Amplitude of [the pendulum of the times
> [paji_a](https://x.com/paji_a/status/1818046923707920415) What NFT projects will be trending in the second half of 2024? Considering the amount of investment in the industry so far, "game-based NFT" is the dominant & mainstay of the industry. I expect the "pendulum of the times" of categories that existed until last year, such as fashion, memes, and animation, to swing around again with greater amplitude. I have a feeling that spring is about to arrive.

- If the string gets shorter and shorter, don't diverge somewhere else.
        - Another interpretation of [singularity
