- 2022-05-25 If I don't have a picture in my diary, I'll put up a picture of a cat or a flower or something.

✅ Unexplored Association Meeting
- ✅ Complete additions to the study page.
    - Read the email of [KJ Method Study Session @ Loftwork
    - I replied ✅ lightly.
        - It sounds interesting if you read it carefully, but I don't have time, so I'd rather do smaller tasks and keep the flow going than try to block it by trying to do bigger tasks.
- ✅ [[Progress of Unexplored Junior and About the Unexplored Ecosystem]]
    - Watch the video and turn important words into text.

- [[word created by retaining the first syllable (or two) of a word]]
- Associated with: [[Always in the shadows.]]]
    - It doesn't directly match the context in which the shadows were mentioned.
        - But we can find it.
    - The story that even if you think you are dealing with something highly abstract, it should always be accompanied by a "concrete experience" of the least abstract level.
        - I imagine this "concrete experience" as a "shadow on the ground".

[[Oblique Strategies]]
- I just happened to see it.
    - [[tarot]] or [[I Ching (Yi Jing) or The Book of Changes - one of the Five Classics]] Similarly, those that consider a randomly selected piece of advice

hangover
- The Mycra server has solved the disk full, but we haven't confirmed that it's working, and there are updates to the server itself, so we'll put it together and do it at night.

- Proposal to read Kozaneba user scripts and such from Scrapbox.
- Moving Scrapbox cards to KJ legal, since it's a regular topic of discussion, I'll make a page explaining how to do it in Kozaneba.
- The subtraction service itself doesn't ring a bell, but development on Scrapbox sounds interesting.
    - I was thinking about what to develop [[a motivating system]].
