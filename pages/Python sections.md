Python sections
- I found the introductory section on Python difficult to follow. I will wrestle with this, but if it doesn’t become clear, I’ll have to ask you to help me understand. This is why it is a good thing that I am not a programmer – you need people with no prior knowledge of Python to be able to understand the analogy.

If you looks something interesting but the auto-translated English is not good enough to understand it, feel free to let me know at [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en). I'm very happy to spread my thought to non-Japanese readers.
