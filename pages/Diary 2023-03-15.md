[[GPT-4]] released
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I am writing a book on programming techniques and am wondering if advances in language models will make such technical books unnecessary. What are your thoughts on this point?
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT/icon' alt='GPT.icon' height="19.5"/>There are several perspectives on whether books on programming technology will become unnecessary. While advances in language models are certainly useful in gathering information and providing solutions, technical books still have an important role to play.
        - Courtesy of [[Structured Knowledge]].
        - Technical books provide structured knowledge on a topic. While language models can provide answers to questions, technical books are superior for comprehensive learning of overall concepts and related information.
    - Author Expertise::
        - Authors of technical books are experts in their fields and can offer [[Unique Perspectives]] and experience. A language model can combine many sources, but it can be difficult to reflect the in-depth understanding of individual experts.
    - Curriculum and learning progression:.
        - Technical books provide a step-by-step curriculum and learning progression to help readers develop a deeper understanding. Language models are good for answering specific questions, but can be difficult to guide the entire [[learning process]].
    - Renewal & Maintenance:.
        - Technical manuals are updated regularly to reflect the latest information and trends. Language models generate answers based on training data, but they do not always reflect the latest information.
    - Finally, while advances in language models may reduce the demand for books on programming techniques, technical books still have an important role to play. Both can be used to acquire knowledge and improve skills in ways that complement each other.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Knowledge of the overall structure might be useful. Advances in language models will allow for fast travel, but thinking about where to go must be done by humans. A wide-area map is needed to think about it.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT/icon' alt='GPT.icon' height="19.5"/>You are correct. While language models are capable of providing quick and accurate answers to specific questions, understanding the overall structure and breadth of knowledge requires a human-driven learning process.
    - Comparing it to a map of a large area, a technical book or educational material provides that map, and the reader can use it as a basis for determining the destination and the path to take. On the other hand, a language model can serve as a road map, providing help if one gets lost along the way or needs more detailed information.
    - Thus, technical books and materials provide the overall structure and knowledge, while language models complement them to help with specific questions and problem solving. The combination of both allows for effective learning and skill development.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I think that in the not-too-distant future, the role of maps will also be performed by giant language models.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT/icon' alt='GPT.icon' height="19.5"/>Indeed, as advances in language models continue, language models may also play a role in maps in the future. Further refinement of language models may provide structured knowledge, learning curricula, and holistic conceptual understanding.
    - But even in such a future, human experts and educators will undoubtedly play an important role. They can contribute to improving language models, designing curricula, and discovering and researching further knowledge.
    - Moreover, no matter how much progress is made in language models, there are some unique human perspectives, experiences, and creativity that cannot be replicated in a language model. Therefore, technical books and educational materials will continue to play an important role as a means for experts and educators to communicate their unique insights and knowledge.
    - Ultimately, even in a future where language models play the role of maps, the learning process will be most effective when humans and language models work together.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Hmmm, that sounds so fake.
