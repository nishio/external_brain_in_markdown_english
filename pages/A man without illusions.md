from [[The Art of Worldly Wisdom]]
A man without illusions
c
A man without illusions, a wise Christian, a philosophical courtier.

Being all of these things, not merely seeming to be so, but not even seeming to be so. Philosophy is discredited today, yet it has always been the chief concern of the wise. The art of thinking has lost none of its former reputation. [[Seneca.]] introduced it at Rome, and for some time it was practiced at court, but it is now regarded as out of place. But the discovery of deception was always considered the true nourishment of a thoughtful mind and the true delight of a virtuous soul.
