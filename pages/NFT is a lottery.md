title: "NFT is a lottery"
---

This is probably the easiest and truest explanation

[[NFT]] is [[lottery]].
- There are people who bought NFT and gained in price, True
    - There are people who bought lottery tickets and won, True.
- Buy NFT and the majority of cases will not increase in value, True
    - Buying lottery tickets and most lotteries do not win, True
- The expected value of lottery profits is negative, True
    - NFT's expected gain in value is negative (in the long run)
            - [[zero-sum game]], and the money that someone has put in is distributed, so the amount of money that someone has withdrawn is minus, True.
- If you don't buy a lottery ticket, you will never win the lottery, True
    - If you don't buy NFTs, you don't get a price gain on NFTs, True
- Lottery issuers can profit with no risk, True
    - NFT issuers can profit with no risk, True

When I mentioned this to my wife, she pointed out that "[[NFT is a horse race]]" is closer to "NFT is a horse race" if we take into account the fact that people purchase the tickets for the purpose of "supporting their guesses".
