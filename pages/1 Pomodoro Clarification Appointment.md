title: "1 Pomodoro Clarification Appointment"
---

Decisions to "do X on this day" often don't get carried out.

- Should I make an appointment with myself to spend time on 1Pomodoro clarification and put it in the [[Schedule]]?
    - Take a 1 hour slot, 1 pomodoro clarification, and document it in the remaining time.
