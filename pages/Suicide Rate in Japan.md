There is a surprising [[gender gap]] in the world in general.
    - I thought that in countries where the idea of [[gender equality]] is strong, there would be a higher rate of female suicide.
- Japanese women commit suicide at a higher rate than women worldwide.
- But still lower suicide rates than men in all G7 countries except Italy.
