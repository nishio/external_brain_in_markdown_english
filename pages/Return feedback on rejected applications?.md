title: "Return feedback on rejected applications?"

from [[mitoujr-mentoring-tips]]
Return feedback on rejected applications?
- return (something)
- This is a practice maintained from the unexplored body.
- On the other hand, it is customary for companies not to include details in rejection notices to avoid risk, and the discussion turned to what the difference is.
- Unexplored Junior is based on the premise that "applicants have a project they want to do voluntarily and will do it even if they are not selected.
    - So even if the matching is unsuccessful, feedback is given, such as, "This may be helpful in moving forward with that project.
    - This assumption is very different from the "people who apply to a company seeking an employment contract" model.
- Rather than giving feedback on the reasons for rejection (i.e., the areas of inferiority at the moment), the feedback might be on what to do in the future (i.e., future actions).
        - [[No attempt to write the reason for rejection in the rejection feedback]]
