It is often said that "Japanese people have a low risk tolerance.
    - [[risk tolerance]]

An interesting point on the topic of

> [StrayRabbitchan](https://x.com/StrayRabbitchan/status/1851904245802455150) I also borrow at a variable rate, which is super [[gambling]] when you think about it.

- Individual real estate is even riskier than buying [[individual stocks]].
- It's like the [[Barbell Strategy]] of taking high risk in one place and low risk in the rest.
    - But I don't feel that the majority of people have that kind of perception.

> [iida_yasuyuki](https://x.com/iida_yasuyuki/status/1851909175569453149) I think that is also quite convincing. Also, there are many possibilities, such as because everyone chooses to use variable, [[myopic]] (because it's cheap now), and so on.
