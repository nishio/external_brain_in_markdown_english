title: "Polis: Cinema Seating Open to the Public Issue"
---

> [@shine_sann](https://twitter.com/shine_sann/status/1655484576071057408?s=20): As for changing movie theater seats, even if you accept, don't exchange ticket stubs, just ask for your seat and move on. There was a case in which I got in trouble because I was forced to exchange a stub for a ticket stub of a show I had already seen. Do not give up the ticket stub you bought, as it is difficult to confirm that the ticket stub is the correct one in the dimly lit theater.

> [@naka85ryo](https://twitter.com/naka85ryo/status/1654431727350325248?s=20): The guy asking to exchange seats at the cinema, not just at the cinema, but anyone who takes reserved seats, change. It's insane to ask to exchange seats, because the person who bought the seats first has the right to exercise that right. If the person you are negotiating with is willing to give up their seats based on this premise, it is only because that person has an open mind, and the person who didn't give up theirs is not small.

> [@peripatos07](https://twitter.com/peripatos07/status/1654866419539140608?s=20): When I work part-time at a movie theater, it is common for people to ask if they can change or cancel their seats after they have been reserved, despite the fact that we notify them when we hold their seats. I'm not sure if it's possible to change or cancel after you've taken a seat, but there are usually people who ask if it's possible.
> This is a problem between customers, but from the staff's point of view, it is usually a nuisance. They wanted to sit next to each other, so they should get seats earlier in the day, like the day before.

> [@honeking](https://twitter.com/honeking/status/1653864914916872192?s=20): I saw a tweet where a couple who could only get seats far from each other at a movie theater asked to switch seats, as if it was extremely insane. I saw a tweet that said "If you ask me to take your seat, I'll take your seat. I'd say no if it meant we'd have a worse seat or a seat further away from them, but if it was just one seat away, I don't understand why they wouldn't take over for them.
- > [@honeking](https://twitter.com/honeking/status/1653864917752254464?s=20): And it's scary in Japan because all the rips are strongly agreeing with the tweeter. I'm scared of Japan. I feel sorry for the couple sitting on either side of my family or group, it makes me feel more uncomfortable.

> [@tokyo_wander](https://twitter.com/tokyo_wander/status/1654386537025646593?s=20): @honeking When "xxxxxx", one guest will reserve the middle.
> "Just make it "xxxxxx".
> What better way to make sure that as many two-person seats as possible remain?
> Any discounts if a single guest reserves a seat contiguous to a seat that is already reserved?

> [@tagamekamo](https://twitter.com/tagamekamo/status/1655026955828465664?s=20): When I mutter that I don't like it when single patrons at movie theaters are told to give up their seats so that couples can watch in a row, why do I have to be petty or Why do I have to be called petty or narrow-minded and bigoted?
> Movies are a bit special and unusual for me.
> This is an important time even if you don't have a date. The freedom to watch from the seat you chose and bought is there for the lone visitor too.

> [@syukatumuri2021](https://twitter.com/syukatumuri2021/status/1654674491900071939?s=20): The issue of couples replacing seats in movie theaters, if I were to go to a movie theater with my girlfriend or a friend and say, "We don't have seats next to each other, I'm not sure I'd agree if someone said to me, "There are no seats next to each other, why don't you just take this seat in the same row and ask to be shifted? I would never agree to it and would say with a straight face, "Are you crazy...? I wonder if I'm in the minority here...

> [@moromi_zzz](https://twitter.com/moromi_zzz/status/1655512879020535812?s=20): I saw someone lamenting about wanting to replace seats at movie theaters, like "more selfish people with no compassion for the weak". I saw someone lamenting about wanting to "ignore the reservation and watch the movie in the seat of your choice" like "more and more selfish people who have no consideration for the weak"...?

> [@kaieda_h](https://twitter.com/kaieda_h/status/1654874355682410496?s=20): The subject of giving up or not giving up seats for couples in movie theaters is under fire, but the negative side frankly doesn't care if you change your seat or not. I think it's probably not important.
> "Selfishness in relying on the goodwill of others from the beginning."
>  isn't the cause of the rejection.

> [@rudolph_zenda](https://twitter.com/rudolph_zenda/status/1654814316015800320?s=20): for me, it seems so insane when you ask to change seats in a movie theater! I don't know.
> I don't even understand what is written in the series of tweets. Isn't there a system of designation so that you don't have to negotiate that way?

> [@enokor0](https://twitter.com/enokor0/status/1655520739980873728?s=20): Some idiots call exchanging seats at a movie theater 'ceding' seats, but it's not ceding a seat to someone who just neglected to make a reservation for you, it's a one-way free ride to someone who made a reservation properly. It's not a "give and take", it's a one-way free ride.
> People who say "you should do that much for them" afterwards are only thinking of the convenience of those who want to exchange, and are not kind at all.

> [@tagamekamo](https://twitter.com/tagamekamo/status/1655163009806004225?s=20): planning to book in advance is necessary, but it's about being able to act on one when faced with a problem.
> I got a comment saying.
> I said, "We have a date at the movie theater and can't sit next to each other because we didn't reserve seats. Okay, let's move the lone guest and sit ourselves next to each other."
I hate to think that > is the way to go about solving a problem.

> [@tagamekamo](https://twitter.com/tagamekamo/status/1655072931813425153?s=20): "And if you're not the kind of guy who can say to a lone customer at a movie theater, "Please take my seat so I can sit in line," you won't get a girlfriend now, And if you can say that, she'll be glad you said that for me."
> I got a comment that it was a "good idea".
> If you're going to the movies on a date, someone who has her best interests at heart will reserve a seat in advance.

> [@lojun1970](https://twitter.com/lojun1970/status/1655452612454649856): I'm afraid there are a lot of comments on this saying "I can't refuse" and "brazen". What's going on in Nippon?
> You don't have the option to say no. Is it so difficult to talk to each other and give up your place in a public place? Some people are saying without permission that TSUNKU reluctantly accepted it, which is very disrespectful to TSUNKU.

> [@lojun1970](https://twitter.com/lojun1970/status/1655577451492265984?s=20): @itokenichiro I get a lot of comments, but they say it like it's a very bad rule violation. I'm scared. It seems that there are a lot of people who can't handle the situation in an appropriate and flexible manner on the spot with only a simple agreement of the parties involved.

> [@DyVEA4YOat2Uol1](https://twitter.com/DyVEA4YOat2Uol1/status/1655549058780639232?s=20): Seat assignments are not a "place of mutual aid and comfort". It is not a "place to help and give away", but a contract where the buyer is buying the right to sit in that seat for a fair price.
> I know that resellers, etc. have become a problem in various circles, but we should not forget that only those who have the right to sit in those seats are the ones who have the right to do so.
> In the first place, it is against protocol to give up your seat in a movie theater.

> [@BTvTcW1iiQsfs6g](https://twitter.com/BTvTcW1iiQsfs6g/status/1654861014922563584?s=20): The issue of whether to give up your seat to a couple at a movie theater: 1) laziness in not making a reservation when you can get a seat in line, 2) laziness in putting up a shelf and relying on the goodwill of others, 3) indifference to the hassle of this exchange, and 4) anxiety about what will happen if these people chat during the screening (because they can't watch from a distance). I can't do it because (1) I'm too lazy to make a reservation when I can get a seat in line, (2) I'm too arrogant to rely on the goodwill of others, (3) I'm too indifferent to cause any trouble in this exchange, and (4) I'm too worried that they might chat with me during the screening...

> [@taisadon](https://twitter.com/taisadon/status/1655374234942865408?s=20): I think it's good that the people who aggressively rip on people who don't want to give up their seats at the movie theater, saying "Why don't you change? I think it's good to have the kindness to imagine that when someone asks you if you'd be willing to give up your seat, you might have a hard time saying no, or you might feel a lot of stress about being asked to negotiate.

> [@TABECHAUYO](https://twitter.com/TABECHAUYO/status/1654847911866548224?s=20): the ones who ask you to change seats at the movie theater, I don't mind changing seats per se, but I don't mind strangers suddenly talking to me in the theater. I don't mind changing seats, but I don't like it when people I don't know suddenly talk to me in the theater. I'm wary of people talking to me and it stresses me out.

> [@JOUDO_GOKURAKU](https://twitter.com/JOUDO_GOKURAKU/status/1655374886544740352?s=20): The story about exchanging seats at the movie theater is a human-interest story in the Heisei era, when you could buy tickets in advance but you could only select your seats at the theater on the day of the movie. It is not a story for the year 2023, when you can even select your seat in advance and purchase it.

> [@mu_mu_](https://twitter.com/mu_mu_/status/1655420401265295360?s=20): the story about a couple offering to trade seats in a movie theater, the same theory that's been put forward about taking a 3-seater on a bullet train with the middle open and using it for luggage storage. or ......

> [@lunaticflyair](https://twitter.com/lunaticflyair/status/1655435901714178049?s=20): this is almost always a woman of the gender of the person asked to give up her seat.
> And a man defends himself at length, saying that he has had his movie theater seat changed many times.
> This is just too much of the usual pattern already😇......(far away)
> We just got burned the other day for saying that we had a woman stand up to make a help mark person sit down!

> [@DjUWA0Yz4ybb1g8](https://twitter.com/DjUWA0Yz4ybb1g8/status/1654674660662075394?s=20): I can understand a couple with some brazenness who want to switch seats because they want to be next to each other at the movie theater. I can understand the feelings of a couple with some brazenness who want to switch seats because they want to be next to each other at the movie theater, but I can't understand the feelings of a couple who reserved their seats properly before the couple and don't want to give them up because they want to see the movie in those seats.

> [@OmasukinO](https://twitter.com/OmasukinO/status/1654741066179039234?s=20): changing assigned seats is often prohibited by reservation sites and movie theater policies.
> Asking someone to give up their seat is like asking them, "Would you be willing to violate protocol for us?" It's a bit insane.
> People who demand or force others to be nice and kind, they live in a world that is not kind.
