> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1821731875649679741) When X is replaced by Y by environmental factors and becomes commonplace enough that X is no longer there, something that was taken for granted and not considered valuable when X was present is X is replaced by the environmental factor Y and X disappears. There is not only a way to replace Y at this time, but also a form in which X is created on top of Y as an infrastructure.
