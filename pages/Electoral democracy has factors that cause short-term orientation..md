title: "Electoral democracy has factors that cause short-term orientation."

> On the other hand, it was introduced that in political science, "there are factors that cause [[electoral democracy]] to be [[short-term oriented]]," and that there is debate among experts on the need for some remedial measures. In addition to the idea that democracy emphasizes the selection of representatives who make social decisions through elections and voting (electoral democracy), there is also the idea that its essence lies in the active participation and discussion of people with different ideas in social decision-making (deliberative democracy) (these can also be compatible). Divided into these two, we can say that it is expected to improve electoral democracy so that it does not become too short-term oriented, while at the same time developing [[deliberation democracy]] through participation and discussion.
