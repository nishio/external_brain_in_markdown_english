title: "Community is an echo chamber"

- On the way back from [[unexplored conference]] 2019
- [Unexplored Conference Summary](https://togetter.com/li/1326529)
> I thought that [[contagion of enthusiasm]] and [[tolerance of being weird]], while beneficial in themselves, are [[echo chambers]] when one abstracts the phenomenon that is taking place. We need to quickly counteract strange ideas before they are echoed. Two such occurrences in the past were "[[entrepreneurship is good]]" and "[[the rest of us are inferior]]. Both were quelled at one time or another, but could flare up again at any time.
>  [[Community]] is certainly beneficial, but when it comes to "[[I'm awesome to belong to this community.]]" it turns into [[idea of being part of a chosen people]]. It's not that the community is awesome or that the people who belong to the community are awesome, but that the individual people are awesome and the community is beneficial because it has the effect of creating [[opportunities for synergy]] with those people.

Next day [[Community boundaries and familial similarities]].

- > It's not that the people who belong to that community are amazing, but the individual people are amazing,
- I know this part is hard to make sense of.
- That it's not, "Wow, I belong to this community, therefore I'm awesome."
- The second half is a chunk of the following
    - > beneficial because the individual person is amazing and the community has the effect of creating opportunities for synergy with that person.
    - That "I'm not awesome, there are a lot of awesome people in this community, so it's beneficial to belong here."
