In particular, in the context of [[Organizational Knowledge Acquisition]], it is used to refer to the suppression of knowledge B acquisition when comparing knowledge A, which is clearly related to the "current business," with knowledge B, which is not clearly related to the "current business.
- From the perspective of individual members of the organization, when [[acquisition behavior]] of knowledge B is performed, it costs "[[persuasion cost]] for [[decision maker]] to make a decision to allocate resources such as time to knowledge B".
- Acquisition of knowledge A is low in its cost.
- This difference in cost creates a bias in the individual's decision to choose knowledge A as the acquisition target.
- A situation occurs where all members have acquired Knowledge A and there are no members with Knowledge B in the company.
- Diversity of knowledge] is lost when viewed as an organization as a whole, not holistically optimal

Some argue that this is the principle by which [[disruptive innovation]] occurs.
- [[Newly generated knowledge]] is knowledge that is not currently used in the business.
- Existing firms lose on the [[knowledge gap]] side because they cannot acquire new knowledge due to path dependence and startups do not have that bias.

Examples of countermeasures

- A person [[who belongs to more than one organization]].
        - [[Pulling and combining from the outside world what is not in the company]]
        - [[There are two channels for information to flow into the organization]]
    - If you belong to more than one organization, your "current business" will also be more than one.
    - In some cases, this is negative for individuals: [[Company Boundaries and Personal Valuation]].
    - Establish [Research Division
    - Create a department with the responsibility of acquiring and creating knowledge.
