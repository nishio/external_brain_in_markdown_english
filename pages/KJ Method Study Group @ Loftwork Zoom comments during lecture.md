from  [[KJ Method Study Session @ Loftwork]]

Zoom comments during lecture
- I couldn't pick it up during the lecture so I wrote the answer later 2022-12-05

Q: This lecture design itself follows the KJ process, doesn't it?
- A: Well, after a little email back and forth with the organizer, we got the results of the pre-survey and did the miscellaneous KJ method!
    - It was harder than I thought because I don't usually do KJ methods on anonymous surveys, so I wrote "[[KJ method from surveys is]] the most difficult.

Q: Might it be easier to distribute/exchange with [[name your own style]]?
- A: I couldn't agree more.
    - It makes sense to create a [[lingua franca]] to share within the organization, but as a preliminary step, it might be a good idea to sneak a personal name for your method ([[Personal words]]).
    - Unnamed concepts are like liquid, elusive and difficult to manipulate!
    - By naming the concept, you can manipulate it with a handle, like coffee in a mug ([[Metaphor of liquid in a container]]).

Q: I have a sense that you are thinking about what is being said in the areas of [[psychological safety]] and [[organizational diversity]] from a different perspective.
- A: I think you're right.
    - > Undesirable compromises occur and do not work well / Team members are able to express multifaceted opinions without hesitation
        - This is an environment (= psychological safety environment) where one should not hesitate to express one's "different opinion
    - > Make sure that your "judgment" is consistent with information from a number of different perspectives.
        - Gathering this "information from different perspectives" can also be accomplished by gathering opinions from a variety of people with different points of view
            - If the [[diversity]] of the organization's members is high, you will be able to gather diverse opinions at a lower cost
            - However, "members of an organization" will become a "less diverse group" from the perspective of society as a whole, no matter how hard they try, because "the benefit to the organization is their own benefit," "there is no significant difference in knowledge or economic status," and "common interests are easily generated through conversations within the organization.
            - It is beneficial to break the existing "organizational boundaries" and have relationships with people outside. This is also similar to the KJ method.
    - Tip: At the time of "Ideas" he said this
        - > Jiro Kawakita.icon] "How to bring together disparate data" and "how to bring together disparate sentient knowledge" are exactly the same in one respect: "integration of heterogeneity" (Preface, p. ii).

Q: It's already starting to look like [[slime mold]] <yellow labeled line connection
- A: Interesting metaphor!
    - It may be slime mold-like in that it moves around on its own, goes outside, and attaches itself to whatever it wants to attach itself to.
    - Instead of "humans putting things together," the image is that "(data|labels|mucus) go where they want to go and stick together to form a 'group'".

Q: I'm curious about the words "appreciation and works".
- A: Indeed. I had never really thought about it, but indeed <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Jiro Kawakita/icon' alt='Jiro Kawakita.icon' height="19.5"/> calls what is produced as a result of the KJ method a "work of art.
    - As for "appreciation," it is used in the sense of taking a closer look at a diagram created using the KJ method, but also in a broader sense of "savoring the results of a single task one has accomplished."

            - [[let the chaos speak for itself]] p.57

Q: I've been doing things my own way and before I knew it, I was a firework!
- A: That's exactly right! I thought, "Isn't it too hard to do this seriously? I thought I was doing the "labor-saving version" on my own, but when I found out about the "Exploratory Net and Thinking Fireworks," I thought, "Jiro Kawakita also came to the conclusion that it's too hard!
