Note down examples of "You should use Scrapbox for that.
(I'm generalizing because I don't want to be too specific.)
(Concerned that he may have [When you hold a hammer, everything looks like a nail.)

- Alumni information record sharing website
    - What?
        - I'm compiling this information in terms of who is in sync with who, who worked on the project together, who was the supervisor, and so on.
    - status quo
        - Currently, we have CSV-like raw data, which we convert with a script to create static HTML.
        - If someone wants to add a particular graduate to the topic or something, there is no easy way to do so.
    - Problems to be solved
        - High hurdles to information output and maintenance
                - [[Lowering the hurdles to information output]]
        - Not clear how to help
    - solution
        - Slightly tweak a script that spits out static HTML and outputs it to Scrapbox
        - Place Invite links on member sites
    - point of concern
        - To begin with, the project's objective is to "collect data in a form that is easy to handle mechanically
            - So they were collecting data in CSV-like form.
        - Concern that once a wiki allows free editing in natural language, there is no going back.


- Documentary site for workgroup activities
    - What?
        - A website that summarizes past activities of the workgroup
        - A website to enable interested parties to obtain more information.
    - status quo
        - There is talk of "we need it," but no one has started to create it.
    - Problems to be solved
            - [[Lowering the hurdles to information output]]
    - solution
        - Create a public Scrapbox project for now.
        - Write minimal information
            - There are issues where it is not clear what the minimum is required.
    - point of concern
        - It's possible that they'll just make a project and nothing will be written in the end.
        - Someone has to write a certain amount first?

- Electronics Components List
    - Indexing Electronics Components
    - Easy to grasp
    - Where did I find that?" can be solved with a search.
    - point of concern
        - High maintenance costs, not maintained, and discarded.
