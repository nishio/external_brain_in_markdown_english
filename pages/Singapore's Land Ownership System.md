Singapore's Land Ownership System
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>
Singapore has its own system of land ownership, but it is not entirely private; the majority of land is owned by the government.

Singapore's Land Ownership System

government-owned land
- Approximately 80% of the land in Singapore is owned by the government. The government makes this land available to individuals and companies on long-term leases (99-year or 999-year leases).

private land
- The remaining approximately 20% of the land is recognized as private land. These lands can be owned by individuals or companies, but remain subject to government land use policies and regulations.

public housing system
- Most Singapore residents live in government-provided public housing (HDB flats). These houses are also provided in a leasehold format, effectively making the government the owner of the land.

Role of Government
- The Singapore government strictly controls land use and promotes efficient land use through urban planning and development projects.

Although private ownership of land is not fully recognized in Singapore, individuals and companies are able to use land through a long-term lease system. This promotes efficient land use and economic development.
