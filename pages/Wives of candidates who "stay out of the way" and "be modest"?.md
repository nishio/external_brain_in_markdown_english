["Don't get out of the way" and "be modest" candidate's wife is...

1. Rina's campaign support speech attracted attention on social networking sites.
2. Rina supported his campaign while continuing to work as an editor for a major publishing company.
3. the workplace was understanding of the need to balance work with campaign activities and took paid leave to cope with the situation.
- He was also responsible for organizing about 100 volunteers.
5. questions the traditional stereotypes about the role of the "candidate's wife".
6. questions about sacrificing anything in electioneering and offers thoughts on how elections can be inclusive for everyone.
7. through the elections, they have realized that many people are interested in politics and feel the need for a system that allows more people to get involved in politics.

- I don't like it when people tell a candidate's wife not to "get involved" because it reveals a "wife is subordinate to her husband" kind of thinking.
- I feel a new sense of goodness in the way that close couples work as a pair.
    - I don't know why I ever took "invisibility of family" and "going it alone" for granted.
    - Since hereditary politicians have a strong support effect from their parents, it may be better for independent newcomers to visualize the support of the people around them.
