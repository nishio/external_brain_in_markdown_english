title: "Parable of the Hot Air Balloon"
---

- Dropping a weighted sand bag from a hot air balloon
- Drop one, drop two, and the hot air balloon begins to float when the Nth one is dropped.
- Is it correct that "it was the dropping of this sandbag that caused the hot air balloon to float?"
    - No doubt it triggered it.
    - But to assume that it is the sole cause is ridiculous.
    - Only when combined with the presence of hot air in the balloon and up to N-1 sandbags being dropped, does it "float".
