<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I've been asked to write a column about ChatGPT and I'd like to organize my thoughts by talking about it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "ChatGPT" is this "ChatGPT"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>This is an additional study of InstuctionGPT on top of LLM so that even the average person with no technical knowledge can pull off the results. At the time of the request, ChatGPT was the only service available, but now there is a wide variety of services, so it would be better to discuss what the LLM brings to the table rather than individual services.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that "ChatGPT"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I was asked to write an article about ChatGPT, and I was thinking about what to write, but I realized that even if the language model is smart, the demand for "knowledge that mankind does not yet know = unspoken knowledge and putting it into words" will not disappear, and that it is inefficient if what is put into words is not promptly learned by AI So, as a natural consequence, the results of research should be open access promptly, and non-open access contributions will be negatively incentivized by not getting mentioned via AI... and I was thinking about this, and then I mentioned DeSci... I feel like I need to mention DeSci.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>How do you know its "ChatGPT"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>We know by actually using the service. The API gives you a little more insight into what's inside. On a related note, I recently wrote an article titled "Don't talk about ChatGPT without experiencing GPT-4.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is this "ChatGPT" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Continued: In the end, if AI increases productivity, people will have an incentive to use AI, even if they have to pay for it, and the greater the increase in productivity, the more they will pay for AI, so AI will grant grants to publish research in AI-readable format as a public service to make itself stronger. Granting grants in a highly AI-readable format

- >  We know by actually using the service. I don't know what's inside because it's a black box, but the API gives me a little more insight. On a related note, I recently wrote an article titled "Don't talk about ChatGPT without experiencing GPT-4
- Where can I find this "ChatGPT"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It's in OpenAI's servers, you could say Azure.

- What does this "ChatGPT" look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Humans are similar because what's inside is a black box and can only be known superficially through conversation.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the "content" of this "content"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Internal Implementation. Continued: The question of who is going to pay for DeSci, it is not necessarily a human being who pays for it, rather, if the decision-making mechanism for resource distribution becomes decentralized, it would be better to make itself a mechanism without human intervention than to have a human being as a pipe to connect to bring in funds.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "DeSci" is this "DeSci"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>A New Movement About Science
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "new movement" is this "new movement"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I honestly don't know much about it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "honesty too much" is that "honesty too little"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>👎 honestly not much.

- Is there anything else about this "DeSci"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>The question is open access or not, and with respect to that open access, there is an incentive for existing publishers to be closed and take a toll for access, and for AI development, there is an incentive for open access and for AI to read it, a clash of two business models, I think the latter is stronger.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Civilization progresses and being open access accelerates progress.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>

- Where does this "ChatGPT" come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>OpenAI, if you think about where LLM comes from, it comes from competition between companies and open research.

- What do you hope will happen regarding this "ChatGPT"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I'd like to see human intelligence augmented.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to "ChatGPT" for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Right now, it's mostly used in the form of humans asking questions and LLMs answering them, but we should do more with the use of LLMs asking questions of humans and eliciting information from them.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>As for "ChatGPT," can it?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Can be done, as long as people realize the usefulness of its use.

- What kind of "LLM" is this "LLM"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Summary.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>- The language model has the ability to put into words what humans do not know.
- We need to let the AI learn that capability, and we should grant the research publication in a highly readable format for the AI in a public works manner.
- It would be nice if the decision-making mechanism for resource allocation were decentralized.
- The business models of open access with tolling by existing publishers and open access for AI use clash.
- In addition to the use of LLM through question and answer, the AI should be used to elicit information from humans.
- People should be informed about the usefulness of AI.

Communication Initiation Protocol

To take out as words what is in the human mind that has not yet been put into words.
- Necessary until non-verbal communication channels are thickened.

a flesh-and-blood person
You can't listen to a hundred people.

Humans discover new knowledge and
- Tell it to others.
- Value Creation
- The means
    - Legacy means used in the historical process
- [[Jiro Kawakita]]
[[study science]].
- [[outdoor science]]
- [[empirical science]]


- [[movement]]
- Remain, disappear
- Thinking in terms of 0/1 is a false dichotomy
    - [[Part of it disappears, part of it remains, and a new one is born.]]

People who settle and farm
Climate Change
Moving on.
Can the appropriate destination be known before the move begins?
I can't.
[[Moving around will broaden your horizons]].
Staying put without moving and making decisions based on narrowly focused observations is detrimental

Don't stick to your "area of expertise",
It is beneficial to use one's footwork to look around various areas.

There was only one body, so there were two choices: stay or move. Attention can be divided.

Choosing "business as usual" is also a betting option.
Extreme betting.
You can't escape the stakes.
