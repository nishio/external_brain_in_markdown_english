Ichiryu-manbai-bi, an auspicious day when a single grain of rice increases ten thousandfold.

I wonder if it is a regional thing. As a native of Osaka, I had heard of it since childhood, but my wife, who is from Hokkaido, was not so familiar with it.

I don't really know the origin of it. It's the same feeling as "Daian" or "Oyasu".

By the way, knowing that "today is the day of a million times a grain" has the effect of pushing you to do something like "Well, let's do that thing I've been thinking of doing someday," so a lucky day has the effect of promoting change.

        - I think I probably went through a mild depression due to the new Corona when it was released, and then I didn't have a chance to say, "Okay, I'll order it," so I just let it slip away.
    - I sold something I'd been sitting on for a long time, thinking I'd sell it on Mercury.
        - I should have just gotten on with it because it sold easily in less than an hour after I put it on display.
