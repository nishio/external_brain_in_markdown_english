A type of Wiki usage (see [[Wiki mode]])

- ADD: Comments may be added. SIGNATURE.
- EDIT: You may edit what others have said in the past for readability.
    - Sorting, merging, and editing are contributions to communication
    - Do it with respect and attention to other speakers.
    - If a wiki keeps a history of edits, you'll have proof if you make a strange edit -- nishio
- SPLIT: If more than one topic is being discussed, you may split it up. Move all comments on a particular topic to a separate page, leaving the original page with a short summary and the name of the new page.
- CAPTURE: When the discussion appears to have converged, move into pattern mode. Propose a one-paragraph "pattern" of ideas that have emerged in the discussion. The "pattern" can be anonymous or signed by all.
