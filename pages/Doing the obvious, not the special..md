title: "Doing the obvious, not the special."

>  [do not do special things for the sake of doing special things, do [[natural]] things [[as usual]] for the sake of doing special things. - [[Ichiro (fifth highest of the eight hereditary titles)]]

OLD TITLE: Do the obvious, not the [[fancy]] stuff
- The "fancy" is my interpretation, so I've stuck to the original.
