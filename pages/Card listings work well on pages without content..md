title: "Card listings work well on pages without content."

- [[Scrapbox Usage Considerations]]
- I saw a statement somewhere that "I don't see [[card list]] at the bottom of the Scrapbox page, so I don't care to add a link to it".
- This is a discrepancy with my understanding of how to use Scrapbox, but I thought it would be interesting to dig deeper to find out where the discrepancy comes from.
- Dig into your perceptions.
    - I'm not linking to make a card list.
    - So you seem to think the "I don't feel the card list is worth it, so I won't link to it" argument is odd.
    - So you don't feel you are worth the card list?
        - I feel it.
    - Do you always look at the card list?
        - Not always.
        - On pages with a lot of content, often with a lot of links, the card list is huge, not much to look at
    - At what point do you look at the card list?
            - [[blank page]]
            - No wonder, since the only content is the card list.
        - Pages for redirection and absorption of notational errors
            - The text only says "see X" or "notation shaking Y".
        - Short pages of content
            - Something that is less than one page.
    - In other words, if you only use long-form content created outside of Scrapbox and paste it into Scrapbox to create "long-form pages with few links," you may not observe situations where you would be happy to have a card list in the first place.
        - That's why some people don't see the need for it.
