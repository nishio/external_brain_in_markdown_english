- When doing the [[Writing Method]], instruct students to write down anything that comes to mind without thinking about whether or not it is appropriate to publish such a thing.

However, in services where information is separated by public/private, this is disconnected.
It is inevitable that "non-language" cannot be put on the service, but the public/private split is a design problem that can be solved.

Shouldn't everything that is output go into the "personal/private" space by default?
- This solves the problem of "[ðŸŒ€Where should I write?
- Attribution of information "to publish or not to publish" should be decided after the fact.
        - [[Information should be determined after the fact.]]
    - Even if it's published after the fact, it's not moving to another space.
        - All together subject to search
            - [[One pocket principle]]
        - In other words, not "private group/public group" # False dichotomy
            - A default private group that includes everything and a select group of publicly available items, the former encompassing the latter.

I was thinking about the design of [[Regroup]].
