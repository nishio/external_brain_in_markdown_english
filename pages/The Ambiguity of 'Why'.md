The question of "[[why]]" is [[ambiguous]], as it can pertain to the concrete, abstract, future, or past.

Q: Why are you on the train now?  
A1: Because I boarded the train 5 minutes ago (a concrete fact from the past, history)  
A2: To arrive at X station in 5 minutes (a concrete purpose for the future, intention)

Q: Why does the train run?  
A3: To transport people (an explanation as a component of a larger concept)  
A4: Because the motor rotates when supplied with electricity (an explanation using the combination of smaller components that make up the train)

Moreover, it can be used for criticism. "Why did you do such a thing!"

- Similar ideas
    - Asking "Why did this happen?" can be misunderstood as blame, leading to excuses, so it's better to ask specifically "What happened? (past)"
    - Asking "Why do you want to do that?" might be perceived as criticism of the desire, so it's better to ask specifically "What will happen if you do that? (future)"

- After researching the situation in various languages with GPT5
- In Russian and Spanish, different words are used for cause and purpose
    - Russian
        - почему (pochemu) … "why" for cause or circumstances (leaning towards the past)
        - зачем (zachem) … "why" for purpose or intention (leaning towards the future, "for what")
    - Spanish
        - por qué … "why" for cause or reason
        - para qué … "for what purpose" or "for what"
- Even in languages with a single word for "why" (like English), in practical and coaching contexts, a breakdown similar to Nishio's approach in Japanese is recommended.
    - The question expecting the answer like A4 "Why does a train run? Because the motor rotates" is not "why" in English but "how"
        - “How does a train move?”
    - For A1/A2, "why" is used, but to avoid sounding strong, "what" is often used
        - “What happened?” / “What will happen if you do that?”
        - For A2, asking "What's your goal here?" is also common
    - For A3, you can ask “What is a train for?”
