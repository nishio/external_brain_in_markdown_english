- On metaphors that compare [[(human) life (i.e., conception to death)]] to "[[a drama in which]] I am the main character

Is it better to [[dance as you like]] without worrying about whether or not there is an audience for [[the drama]]?

relevance
- [[It would be a waste if I didn't at least enjoy my life (drama) in which I am the main character.]]
