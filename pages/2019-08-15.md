- Tachikawa and Nishio first played the board game "[[Spaghetti Code]]".
    - This game is a competitive programming game that challenges your logical thinking skills.
    - During play, Mr. Tachikawa suggested that it would be more interesting to watch the advanced players play rather than actually play this game.
    - Mr. Nishio agreed and suggested that we hold a competition for this game.

- Next, Mr. Nishio reported on his business trip to Shenzhen.
    - The robot battle competition "[[RoboMaster]]" was particularly impressive.
    - A team of Chinese university students was playing an advanced game against each other using AR technology and other techniques.
    - Hearing this, Mr. Tachikawa suggested that such a convention should be held in Japan as well.

- Nishio also found an interesting system at a library in Shenzhen.
    - Users select a book of their choice at a bookstore, the library pays for the book, and the user borrows the book for a certain period of time before donating it to the library.
    - This is said to make the library's collection more efficient in terms of the books that users need.
    - Mr. Tachikawa said this should be incorporated in Japan as well.

- Changing the subject, the two of us analyzed the mechanism of "awareness" that Mr. Tachikawa has recently felt.
    - I hypothesized that when I felt "I see" about a certain matter, I would notice similarities with my own past experiences.

- Finally, we played a cooperative game, The Game.
    - During the play, Nishio and Tachikawa actively communicated with each other and worked together to understand the intent of each other's comments and proceeded with the game.
    - Although we exceeded the time limit, we were able to reduce the deck to the remaining 9 cards.

This is a summary of the entire dialogue between Mr. Tachikawa and Mr. Nishio. Thought-provoking discussions were held on a wide variety of topics, including board games, robot competitions, library systems, and analysis of thoughts.
