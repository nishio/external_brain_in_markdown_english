*1263366355* Day 2 of the 51st Prosin Diary
I used to blog all over the place with fragmented notes, but since time has caught up with me in the form of Twitter, I no longer have anything to blog about. Hmmm.

<hr>

My presentation is coming soon. I'm so nervous. Things to keep in mind:
-Disconnect wireless LAN
-I'll talk calmly.
-Turn the stopwatch (I set the timer on my iPhone to use it in the summer and it made a sound even though I had it on silent mode.)
-I'm not going to make up some lame excuse.
