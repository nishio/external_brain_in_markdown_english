title: "A place to grow the active top 1%."
---

> Ukai: This is something I have experienced through my involvement in education at programming classes, but in Japan there are very few places that nurture the top 1% of children. This [[top layer]] does not refer to children who excel in passive education such as taking entrance exams, but rather to children who excel in the sense of "[[*]] [[who]] can think for themselves and create products with their hands. If they go on to university or graduate school, they can engage in high-quality discussions in laboratories or at academic conferences, but there is no such place for elementary, junior high, and high school students. We thought that if we want to develop the top tier, we should provide [[a place for high-quality discussions]] and [[Opportunities for output]]. [[unexplored]] exists for exactly that purpose."
>  --especially public school education is tailored to children who are the slowest in progress, and there are not many opportunities for elementary or junior high school students to learn what "argumentation is" in the first place, are there?
