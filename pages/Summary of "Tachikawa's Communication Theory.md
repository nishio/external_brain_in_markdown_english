- [[Tachikawa-san Communication Theory]]
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Claude/icon' alt='Claude.icon' height="19.5"/>Two [[atypical developers]], Ms. Nishio and Mr. Tachikawa, discuss the differences and difficulties in communication with [[socially awkward persons]].

Main points:.
- People have different [[communication protocols]] (ways of doing things), and if you and your partner's [[protocols]] don't match, you can't communicate well.
- Atypical developers can learn [[protocols for typical developers]] to facilitate communication.
- Organizing and understanding the patterns of various communication protocols is important to make life easier for atypical developers
- Ms. Nishio and Mr. Tachikawa learned the protocol through [[discussions with partners]] and by [[actively engaging with others]], respectively
- It is important to recognize each person's [[differences in thinking]] and [[one should not impose one's values on the other]].
- By [[verbalizing and accumulating]] thoughts and experiences, it becomes easier to [[utilize them later]] and [[new insights]] are generated.

It is a thought-provoking dialogue in which we share each other's experiences and explore tips for atypical developers to [[live better in society]].

- [[Tomoya Tachikawa]]
