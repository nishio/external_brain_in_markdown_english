Would the community itself be rather more interesting if it were more unitary?

chat log
    - [[Tomoya Tachikawa]] (T): It is not necessary to maintain [[diversity]] within a community, and the community itself is more interesting if it is highly [[unitary]]. It is more interesting if [[an individual belongs to multiple communities and maintains diversity among them]].

- nishio (n): what is a [[highly unitary community]]?

- T: I imagine that people have a lot of knowledge, and they can just say, "You know what?
    - Similar in some aspects.
    - 「[[アオいいよね]]」で全部伝わるような集団かな<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/cFQ2f7LRuLYP/icon' alt='/villagepump/cFQ2f7LRuLYP.icon' height="19.5"/>

- N: If the definition is that all participants are similar, then of course I who am participating in them are similar, so if I belong to community A and B, then A and B are also similar
- "[[Some knowledge is]] shared in high concentration throughout." or
    - T: yes, yes, yes

- N: In the end, that's "[[I enjoy]] a community where knowledge is shared in high concentration."

- T: Yes.
    - There's a high concentration of knowledge shared in certain areas, but not so much in others.
    - Still, we can say "that community is unitary."
    - I mean, the premise is that a community is not interesting unless there is a strong unity in some attribute.

- N: Hypothesis: Because of Mr. Tachikawa's idea that "[[all participants should be able to enjoy]]," [[interpretation tailored to those without knowledge]] and [[topic control]] will spoil the fun in the absence of [[high concentration of knowledge sharing]].

- T Oh, that's right.
    - Isn't that usually the case?

- N: You implicitly assume voice [[synchronous communication]].

- T: Oh, you do.

- N: There is a community of culture that says, "[[Don't demand that]] the reader skim what they are not interested in, don't demand that the speaker output so much to the reader's expectations."

- T: Is that something that if the speaker offers a topic that no one is interested in, everyone will skip over it?

- N: Yes

- T: Then the speaker would automatically leave the community
    - There is an addendum here later.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - [[A community that doesn't care if you go through with it.]]

- N: [[Online communities blur the boundaries of participation and non-participation]], so it's possible.
    - Can act without showing an explicit "leave" action by not waving [[attention]].
    - No, on the contrary, some social networking sites have a "[[mute]] to" mechanism.

- T: Ah, okay, it's possible that you're [[throwing different things into the "community"]] box!
    - The [[word]] "community" is too big.

- N: Tachikawa's [[level of expectation for the community]] is high
    - I'm expensive, so I feel I have to satisfy the other participants.
    - It can be expressed the other way around.
    - My level of expectation for the community is low.
    - So [[I'm not willing to devote my effort to the care of others]] and I'm not willing to let [[the community disappear]] because of it.
    - I should learn a little more from Mr. Tachikawa.
    - On the other hand, I think "not every community is worth the effort" is also True.

- T: I agree with this and it's more like [[ownership]] than expectations for the community
    - [I guess I feel that if I work hard, the community will improve, and if I don't work hard, it won't improve.
    - My image of a good community is [[a community with a high level of ownership by the participants]].
    - Or is it a community where there are multiple members with high ownership.

- N: Mr. Tachikawa sees the community as "[[an object]] that you can improve," while the majority of people see it as "something that is there [[naturally]].
    - It's like ownership of a software product.
    - [I feel like I'm holding the steering wheel.
    - There's likely to be a political stance like this as well.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>

- T: I see!
    - In my opinion, even a community that seems to have come about naturally must have been created by at least one individual who thought, "I wish this was a community!
    - If no one has that expectation, then the community won't be able to? I think so.
    - There is a sense of [[someone's]] intention in the community! A sense of
    - I think it's usually a factual error to see a community as something that's "naturally there." w

- N: I think that at least [[geographical communities]] occur naturally, but instead they are connected only because they are "in the same place," so if they leave, they are cut off. If there is a will to create a "community that continues to be connected even after you leave," then the community that Mr. Tachikawa is referring to is created for that purpose.
    - There's also a naturally occurring community of people who attended the same college at the same time, and if they're not incorporated into the "surviving [[alumni]] community," they'll dissipate into the clouds with graduation.

- T: My thinking is different. For example, in a community of college classmates, if someone doesn't have a sense of "we're classmates, so we want to get along with each other," it won't happen.
    - You don't need as strong an ownership as you have at the wheel, but you do need to have a [[vague expectation]] that you want to get along with each other.

- N: It reflects the high expectations of Mr. Tachikawa, who only recognizes as a community a community of people who share [[the intention to "get along"]].
    - Where you draw the line in the definition is not essential, so that's fine.
    - I don't think all of us start out with the intention of "getting along."
    - [[Intentions when people join a "group of people"]], I think there's a lot more to it than that.
    - [[I want you to pay attention to me]], [[help me achieve what I want to achieve]], [[get along with me]], is that about it?
    - And there's also the desire to "[[be]] left alone," which doesn't go into a group of people.
        - Postscript:.[[McClelland's theory of desire]] <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - There's a type of participation where you don't actively go in, but if you [[being swept up in]], you try to get involved a little bit, and if you're not uncomfortable, you'll settle in.

- T: I'm not sure about the classification, but it's certainly true that you have a purpose other than just wanting to get along.
    - > There's also a type of participation where you don't actively go in, but if you get involved, you try to get involved a little bit, and if you're not uncomfortable, you settle in.
    - There are a lot of people like that.
