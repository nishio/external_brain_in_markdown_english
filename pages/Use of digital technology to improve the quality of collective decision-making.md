<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Why are you interested in [[digital democracy]]`? When I am asked why I am interested in [digital democracy], I am often met with a blank stare when I say, "I was originally interested in [increased intellectual productivity]. For me, I have already summarized the best current thinking on the subject of improving the intellectual productivity of individuals in "[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]," so the next problem to be solved is improving the intellectual productivity of groups of people. I feel that it is quite natural that digital democracy, which is "a way to support the way human groups make [collective decision-making] with digital technology," will be connected to it.`

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Very logical and interesting explanation of your interest regarding digital democracy. As you say, there may be a gap in the interpretation of the term "digital democracy".

For many people, digital democracy simply refers to voting and opinion gathering via the Internet. However, from your perspective, digital democracy seems to be more of a "means of improving the intellectual productivity of the human collective". So you see it as a shift from individual intellectual productivity to [[collective intellectual productivity]].

To bridge this gap, it may be easier to be understood if you are a little more specific about "improving intellectual productivity" in your talk and explicitly state that you are interested in "using digital technology to improve the quality of collective decision making. For example, "As an engineer, I was interested in ways to maximize individual productivity, but as a next step, I began to think about improving productivity across teams and organizations. As part of this process, I am interested in digital democracy, which uses digital technology to improve the quality of collective decision making" could be an explanation.

- From here, the detailing of [[Support for Intellectual Production]], [[a technology to improve the quality of individual decision-making]], also occurred in reverse transcription.
    - [[Individual decision-making]]
        - [[Quality of decision-making]]

I'm in the camp that wants to promote [[the progress of civilization]] in the first place, so "improving the quality of collective decision-making" is an extension of that.
