title: "Affirmative Action and Imposter Syndrome"

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/> [[affirmative action]] refers to policies and measures to assist socially or economically disadvantaged groups. This includes the promotion of positive recruitment and enrollment for certain groups, such as those of gender, race, ethnicity, or disability. The goal of affirmative action is to reduce inequality and discrimination faced by members of these groups and to achieve a more equal society.

- The [[imposter syndrome]] is a psychological condition in which an individual does not attribute his or her success to inner competence, but feels that he or she succeeded by chance or through the fault of others. People suffering from this syndrome are constantly plagued by anxiety and self-doubt because they attribute their success to chance or external factors rather than their own abilities.

Considering the relationship between affirmative action and imposter syndrome, individuals who have benefited from affirmative action may feel that they are in place not because of their ability or effort, but because of affirmative action policies. This may trigger feelings of imposter syndrome or reinforce existing feelings.

In Japan, affirmative action efforts are more limited than in other countries, but efforts in specific areas, such as the promotion of women's activities and employment of people with disabilities, have been observed. In Japan, individuals who benefit from affirmative action may also experience imposter syndrome, but awareness and discussion of this issue is still in its infancy. In addition, social and cultural factors unique to Japan may influence how the imposter syndrome and affirmative action are perceived.

After reading the Japanese translation of the following video, I felt that [[affirmative action]] may be one of the causes of [[imposter syndrome]].

> I had the GPA and ACT scores to prove I could stay. I was at the top of my class in high school. By the way, over 95% of that grade was white. Despite this, within a week of starting college, I began to doubt everything.
> This was my first encounter with affirmative action. Namely, the negative effects and the impact it has on the psyche. Minority students become anxious, "Am I really here on merit?" Classmates (usually unspoken) become skeptical, "Are they really qualified to be here?

I had never been aware of it since I am a Japanese living in Japan,
