I'm going to show off how smart I am because I saw an interesting [[puzzle]] in an ad. lol.

The only combinations that represent 8 without duplication are 1,3,4. 6 has only 2,4. Therefore, A is 2

The rest is determined by 4. 5 could be 1,4 and 2,3, but the 1,4 line disappears. Therefore, B is 2.

The rest is 3. This determines the right 2 columns C. The only way to divide 6 into two is by 2 and 4, which determines the middle 2 rows D. The only way to divide 6 into two is by 2 and 4, which determines the middle 2 rows D. All that remains is to fill in the rest. Done.

The constraints are so tight that once a few are finalized, the dominoes fall and the decision is made very quickly.
