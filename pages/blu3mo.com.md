    - Scrapbox's English translation site flaked (for the third time in as many months).
    - I've been repeatedly making them and leaving them because I wasn't satisfied with the quality, but now I think I can introduce them to other people!
    - mounting
        - Cache translations and translate only the differences when updating
        - I'm using gpt-3.5-turbo.
        - I convert the content to markdown, translate it, and publish it using [[Quartz]].
            - markdown is good because gpt understands bullets and formatting and translates them.
            - [[ScrapboxToObsidian]]、 [[Obsidian Vault at Quartz]] 、[[ScrapboxTranslator v1]]など過去の実装が役に立って嬉しい<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/blu3mo/icon' alt='/villagepump/blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I'm done with the [[make ScrapboxTranslator v2]] prompt.
            - Too much hallucination.
    - What we are going to do
        - Pick up some pages that you think will be interesting and translate them & put them in an easy-to-see place.
        - Add a page as a portfolio site
        - Connect with your English Twitter account
    - I'm afraid of accidents, so I keep repo private, but if you want to use the mechanism, please contact me.
        - I'm curious<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
