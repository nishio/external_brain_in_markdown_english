title: "KJ method with folders"
---

2018-04-13
- I saw an article that introduced how to do [[kanban]] using [[Paper folder]], and tried to do [[KJ method]] with it.
- Conclusion: Not good
- A3 is too small to do KJ method.
    - Three folders of sticky notes for one lecture.
- Well, but it has the advantage of being able to carry it safely, or open it and lay it out on the go.
- If you have to put a sticky note on the back of a notepad [[Rhodia]], a folder is much better than a sticky note on the back of a notepad.
    - If you put it on a Rhodia, it's just a bunch of Rhodia, plus it ruins the functionality of the Rhodia.
- Wife's advice
    - The first thing you should do is write an explanation on the tab.
        - Writing on both sides is good because it can be seen from either side
        - One of my bad habits is to unconsciously think about reusing folders.
        - By writing a description on the tab and labeling it "Exclusive/Use-all", it becomes "A3 cardboard that can be written on" instead of just "something to put sticky notes in".

        - It's easier to prepare and place an A4 sheet of paper than to start with this, but it seems possible to use them together.
