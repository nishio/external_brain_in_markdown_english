- [[Ability to see an opportunity and recognize it as an opportunity]]
- People who say, "If I had such an opportunity, I would have wanted to know in advance, I would have participated," or "I couldn't participate this time because of the conditions, but I would definitely participate if the conditions changed," or "I wouldn't participate even if the conditions changed.
- It's not that they're aware and don't participate, it's that they don't realize it's an opportunity, even if they go out of their way to give you a friendly notice.

I don't have time to do the weekly journal switch! I thought, but I had to take tomorrow off, if that's possible.
