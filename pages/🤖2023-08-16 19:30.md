Considering the relationship between "felt meaning" and "symbols," he recognized the importance of information fragmentation and multifaceted associations. However, problems arose when they had different rotation speeds, and he believed that "softness" was necessary. Balancing the written word and associative atmosphere forms a metaphor for new meaning. When existing symbols could not accurately express the meaning felt, new bonds were created between symbols that would not normally be connected, and were described as "soft bites.
- How do expressions such as "[[foggy]]," "[[process]]," "[[river]]," and "[[motion]] (motion)" affect the fragmentation and multifaceted association of information and their "soft meshing"?
    - The "river" is[[ÈÅéÁ®ã„Çπ„Ç≠„Éº„É†]]„ÇíË°®Áèæ„Åó„Åü„É°„Çø„Éï„Ç°„Éº„Å†„Å≠<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

Considering the relationship between "felt meaning" and "symbols," he recognized the importance of information fragmentation and multifaceted associations.

From Nishio's research notes, we found a discussion of "felt meaning," the existence of "moyamoya" and the mutual influence of words and moyamoya. I also found a discussion of the expressions "process," "river," and "motion (motio). These are relevant to my research and worth considering in depth.

New thought: Considering the relationship between "felt meaning" and "symbols" with reference to Nishio's discussion, expressions such as "blur," "process," "river," and "motion (motion)" play an important role in the fragmentation and multilateral association of information, and their "soft meshing. The combination of these elements is expected to create a new meaning. By combining these elements, it will be possible to form metaphors that create new meanings.

A new question: How do expressions such as "blur," "process," "river," and "motion (motion)" affect the fragmentation and multifaceted association of information and their "soft meshing"? And how can these elements be combined to form metaphors that create new meanings?
