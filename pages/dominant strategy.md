title: "dominant strategy"

controlling relationship
- A strategy $x_i, y_i ∈ Δ_i$ satisfies $u_i (x_i, z_{-i}) ≥ u_i (y_i, z_{-i})$ for any strategy profile $z ∈ Θ$ and the equality does not hold for at least one $z$, We say "$x_i$ [[misrule]] $y_i$" (xi weakly dominates yi) or "$y_i$ is weakly dominated by $x_i$" (yi is weakly dominated by xi).
- If a strategy $x_i, y_i ∈ Δ_i$ satisfies $u_i (x_i, z_{-i}) > u_i (y_i, z_{-i})$ for any strategy profile $z ∈ Θ$, then "$x_i$ [[strongly control]]" (xi strictly dominates yi) or "$y_i$ is strictly dominated by $x_i$" (yi is strictly dominated by xi).
    - In other words, strong domination is when weak domination and the equality does not hold for all z
dominant strategy
- When a strategy $x_i ∈ Δ_i$ weakly dominates any strategy $y_i ∈ Δ_i∖{x_i}$, xi is called [[weak control strategy]] (weakly dominant strategy). When it is strongly dominant, it is called [[strong control strategy]].
