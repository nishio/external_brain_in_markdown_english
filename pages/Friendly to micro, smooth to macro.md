Friendly to micro, smooth to macro
- [Micro friend to foe, macro smooth.
    - [[FRIENDS AND ENEMIES]]
        - [[step function]]
        - [[velvety]]
        - [[not flat, not step, sigmoid]].

This is an interesting point.
- Smooth Society and Its Enemies]" achieved [[dialectic development]] that the dichotomy between "single" and "diverse" is a [[false dichotomy]] and that "smooth" is better.
- But there is an implicit conflict between the "smooth" who overcame it and the "[[friends and enemies]]" who overcame it.
    - [[the antagonism between what has been overcome and what has been overcome]].
- This conflict is overcome by attributing it to "the difference in [[the observer's]] [[scale of observation]]."
        - [We see the same things, but from different perspectives.
        - Example: [[A cylinder looks like a circle or a square, but it is neither a circle nor a square]].
        - [[Difference in Observation Scale]]
