I see. So it's not gambling because there is no cash value.

Emotion Log
- When I saw the 13% listed, I felt compelled to "support" the project.
- I didn't think it was rational behavior to plunk down all the 1000 mana I received at the start of my account to "support" them.
    - That's not a "prediction."
    - If you tell Team Mirai officials that this is being done, it is likely to swing to the YES side by those who are "cheering" as well!
    - If you send out a message on social media that this is being done, many people are likely to "cheer" as well!
    - After all, that's a popularity contest, not a prediction market.
- If we think about it based on the current "how it is" rather than "how the system should be," the negative value of losing "1000 mana given for free" is almost negligible, so the benefit of increasing the expected value by plunging 1000 mana into the system is greater, isn't it?
- Create an account to shove 1000 mana into it.

        - You put 50 mana in, you get 337 mana back.
        - Oh well, the odds are changing because of the swing to NO.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/d90f7de7ea7c25224f8b6e2fbce123d0/thumb/1000)![image](https://gyazo.com/d6ba7ef9d6762d54ee2c04d9ae3afc16/thumb/1000)
        - 617 for 100, 1675 for 400.
        - It's going down gradually, because the odds change depending on my purchases.

        - When I tried to put more in, he said, "Really?" I was told.
    - It's more fun to put in a little at a time than to put in 1,000 and not be able to take action in the future.
        - I only put in 100.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/7a14d9970b41ee6276677df1c54cd4df/thumb/1000)
        - With this purchase, it went up to 20%.
        - It's like a stock that has too little liquidity to move in price with your trades.
- I bought another one.

    - way of walking (e.g. in martial arts, etc.)
        - The first 100 mana yielded a share of 617 and the second 100 mana yielded a share of 442.
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/934b77250917db6db5a7438d9f61d9d1/thumb/1000)
    - What happens if I sell here?
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/07a329c6a18de44c8b1cbf70c1250361/thumb/1000)
    - hmm
        - (I misinterpreted this as "what the heck, I can sell" and did "then I'll buy a lot while it's cheap", but this is not selling, it's just holding both positions, so the mana is locked and won't come back until the end.)
    - Currently, just one new account has fluctuated from 30% to 60% just by plunking down the coins they get when they create an account, so I'm not going to have faith in the "predictions" until we get more people.

- Apparently, $5 for 500 mana.
    - You could play distort the prediction market.
    - I tend to assume that everyone feels the same value for cash, but I still feel that when it's game coins that can't be converted to cash, it's money that is spent for the experience of playing the game and doesn't need to come back.

- What's that? Can you still sell?

- Ah, I can SELL, and the mana is coming back.
    - But I'd like to SELL the NO position, but I don't know where that leads.

> [0xtkgshn](https://x.com/0xtkgshn/status/1921568390923043044) Looks like you can buy it at a limit price.

- Tokens are not consumed when limit orders are placed.
    - It would be consumed when actually purchased.
