I see. So it's not gambling because there is no cash value.

Emotion Log
- When I saw the 13% listed, I felt compelled to "support" the project.
- I didn't think it was rational behavior to plunk down all the 1000 mana I received at the start of my account to "support" them.
    - That's not a "prediction."
    - If you tell Team Mirai officials that this is being done, it is likely to swing to the YES side by those who are "cheering" as well!
    - If you send out a message on social media that this is being done, many people are likely to "cheer" as well!
    - After all, that's a popularity contest, not a prediction market.
- If we think about it based on the current "how it is" rather than "how the system should be," the negative value of losing "1000 mana given for free" is almost negligible, so the benefit of increasing the expected value by plunging 1000 mana into the system is greater, isn't it?
- Create an account to shove 1000 mana into it.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/8d4d3a9369505bcbf7e828314602210a/thumb/1000)
        - You put 50 mana in, you get 337 mana back.
        - Oh well, the odds are changing because of the swing to NO.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/d90f7de7ea7c25224f8b6e2fbce123d0/thumb/1000)![image](https://gyazo.com/d6ba7ef9d6762d54ee2c04d9ae3afc16/thumb/1000)
        - 617 for 100, 1675 for 400.
        - It's going down gradually, because the odds change depending on my purchases.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/4329c3874f776109a07d21cea8389a74/thumb/1000)![image](https://gyazo.com/6275b3974bd08a0de9300141f26db0dc/thumb/1000)
        - When I tried to put more in, he said, "Really?" I was told.
    - It's more fun to put in a little at a time than to put in 1,000 and not be able to take action in the future.
        - I only put in 100.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/7a14d9970b41ee6276677df1c54cd4df/thumb/1000)
        - With this purchase, it went up to 20%.
        - It's like a stock that has too little liquidity to move in price with your trades.
        - > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1921350272539849126) I was standing in the prediction market to see if Team Mirai could become a political party with a service that allows you to legally experience the prediction market with non-cashable game coins. I put 100 game coins in YES!
- I bought another one.

    - way of walking (e.g. in martial arts, etc.)
        - The first 100 mana yielded a share of 617 and the second 100 mana yielded a share of 442.
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/934b77250917db6db5a7438d9f61d9d1/thumb/1000)
    - What happens if I sell here?
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/07a329c6a18de44c8b1cbf70c1250361/thumb/1000)
    - hmm
        - (I misinterpreted this as "what the heck, I can sell" and did "then I'll buy a lot while it's cheap", but this is not selling, it's just holding both positions, so the mana is locked and won't come back until the end.)
    - Currently, just one new account has fluctuated from 30% to 60% just by plunking down the coins they get when they create an account, so I'm not going to have faith in the "predictions" until we get more people.

- Apparently, $5 for 500 mana.
    - You could play distort the prediction market.
    - I tend to assume that everyone feels the same value for cash, but I still feel that when it's game coins that can't be converted to cash, it's money that is spent for the experience of playing the game and doesn't need to come back.

- What's that? Can you still sell?

- Ah, I can SELL, and the mana is coming back.
    - But I'd like to SELL the NO position, but I don't know where that leads.

> [0xtkgshn](https://x.com/0xtkgshn/status/1921568390923043044) Looks like you can buy it at a limit price.

- Tokens are not consumed when limit orders are placed.
    - It would be consumed when actually purchased.

- be amused
- "[[Take a position]] before others understand it."
    - [[SOC]] to learn about the market opening before others do, take a position with all their assets and go from 27% to 65%, and then spread that information by social capital, thereby increasing the number of tokens attributed to individuals.

- Aww, that's hilarious!
    - By selling first, you lock in a profit, while the unrealized profit of those who are holding shrinks as the price drops due to the sale.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/207b6d6c5db9488e5e9867481fa325be/thumb/1000)![image](https://gyazo.com/489dca7b7c0096570c62b7d2c556e04b/thumb/1000)
    - I'll just buy the cheapest part of the price drop caused by this sale.

- You can place a limit order with a token you don't have and paint a picture of a buying advantage w
- W did on the Yes side on a larger scale what the No side originally did.
- I don't like the specification that the order is cancelled if there aren't enough tokens when the order is placed.
    - In other words, you can place any number of large limit orders with no risk, making the quote information meaningless.
    - If you don't have enough tokens, you should be able to automatically debit your credit card to pay for the W.

When I think of simply maximizing money, it is better to sell now what I bought at 16% to fix the profit of unrealized profit, but that is to own the tokens invested by people who bought with the desire to support Mr. Anno, so it is a delicate feeling when considering social capital outside the market and other factors. It's not a pure prediction market when these feelings arise.
- First of all, it should be anonymous to reduce the impact on social capital, and you should be able to bet so much money that you can't care about others and get twitchy (...)
    - 単純にマネーの最大化を考えた時、16%の時に買ったものを今売って含み益の利益確定をするのが良い どうなんだろう。結局最終的には、yes or no になるので、人によって期待値の査定が違うというだけだと思う。確信してたら、今利確しなくて良い<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/tkgshn/icon' alt='tkgshn.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - If I can repurchase the position by taking a profit now because I have more tokens available to hold the position, it would be a larger profit, but does that mean that I will not have the opportunity to repurchase in the future? Does the forecast for future price volatility also have an impact?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Yes, so theoretically, even 99% (not at 100%) would be undervalued.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/tkgshn/icon' alt='tkgshn.icon' height="19.5"/>

I thought that being able to SELL as well as BUY YES/NO is a bad design because it attracts "people who are not interested in the final YES/NO but want to profit from short-term price movements".
- After a while, I thought those people might be useful to increase liquidity.

- interesting
    - The timing of this the other day was that bluemo made a profit by selling at a high price, while the drop in price caused a lot of damage to me, who had a position in the market.
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/6aa2e64d3de5521e5235751e6ca24535/thumb/1000)
    - Then I picked up the low and the price returned to its pre-drop level, which increased my unrealized profit to 1000, and in the process, bluemo's profit did not increase, indicating that he did not have a position.
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/bf42b19a576b7c030ff052ae99fc1f84/thumb/1000)
    - Since the limit price is soaked to 69% and 70%, it's hard to move the price in either direction, since it would trigger the opposite buyers.
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/98a9d438bfb330f968fe972cc06fc015/thumb/1000)
        - It's funny(?). I'll buy up to 70%.
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/01b7409558bbdfc054107e0e5f3114ec/thumb/1000)
        - Now it's going to be a power struggle to see which way to push this contacting board.

- I want to buy it but I don't have the coins because it's too good to waste because the prediction market is not reacting to the people's democratic zeal and people are flowing to Team Mirai.
