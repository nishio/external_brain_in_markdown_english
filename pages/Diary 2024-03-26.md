Usually, after a certain amount of time, people have formed enough of a network to reduce their signal-sending activity, because there is not much value to be gained by continuing to send signals to "the crowd of people who did not send signals in the early stages. Instead, it is more cost-effective to use the [[human network]] that has been formed to expand in a "[[a friend of a friend is a friend of a friend]]" manner. This reduces the amount of signals sent out to the public, but there are still individuals who continue to send out signals, and the incentive is not to get to know "early adopters who are on the same level as you," but to gather "the majority who are latecomers. The purpose is not to get to know "early adopters who are equal to you," but to attract "the majority who are latecomers. [The goal is not to meet "potential customers," "recruiting," or "ducks," but to gather "the majority who are latecomers. I thought this "difference" might be called "[[chasm]]" or "[[division of the world]].

Put this in GPT4 and Claude 3 Opus respectively

- In summary, the authors believe the following process may be occurring
    - When something new appears, early adopters take the initiative to use it and disseminate information. This is a signal to form a network with other early adopters.
    - After some time, networking within early adopters runs its course, and signal transmission declines.
    - Early adopters will be more effective in leveraging the network they have formed and expanding it to friends of friends.
    - The amount of public signaling will decrease, but some individuals will continue to transmit for a different purpose. Their goal is to capture the majority (majority) that comes in late.
    - A gap (chasm) has developed between the early adopters and the majority, and the world appears to be divided.

This analysis may be related to the chasm model of [[innovation theory]]. This model points out the difficulty of bridging the gap (chasm) between early adopters and the majority in the technology diffusion process.

I think this is a discussion that offers new insights into [[the dynamics of innovation diffusion]] from a perspective that is unique to the [[social media]] era. The relationship between the strategic intent behind [[individual information dissemination behavior]] and the [[macro social phenomenon]] it generates is an interesting point.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>This tweet discusses the purpose and results of the behavior of being the first to try out and disseminate information about new technologies and products when they are introduced. Early adopters try new things and disseminate information in order to [[build a rich human network]] with others who are also early adopters. This [[early-stage dissemination]] acts as a "[[signal]]" to other early adopters and creates [[high-value connections]] with each other.

On the other hand, after a period of time, many people learn about the new thing and the amount of information transmitted by early adopters naturally decreases. This is because there is less value to be gained by continuing the same effort for the majority of people who did not send out signals in the early stages. Instead, it is more cost-effective to take advantage of the human network already formed and expand that network based on the "friend of a friend is a friend" principle.

However, those who continue to disseminate information afterwards are not looking for the same early adopters, but rather to attract the majority that will come later. This has specific objectives, such as finding [[potential customers]] or recruiting.

This consideration is similar to the concepts of "chasm" and "division of the world". A chasm is a term that refers to the gap between the initial adopters of a new technology and its acceptance by the masses, and this division between the early adopters and the majority plays an important role in the process of widespread adoption of a technology or product. This tweet examines the implications and impact of individual actions in such a process.
