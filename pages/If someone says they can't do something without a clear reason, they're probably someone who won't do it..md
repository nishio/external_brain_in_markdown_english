title: "If someone says they can't do something without a clear reason, they're probably someone who won't do it."

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT5/icon' alt='GPT5.icon' height="19.5"/>The short answer is that in terms of behavior, "it is true, but not always so." Placing an axis of distinction improves the outlook.

1) Can't vs. won't (4 quadrants)
- Objective constraints x Willingness: Lack of tools, time, skills, and procedural information (= a legitimate example of "I can't do it")
- Subjective Constraint x Willing: anxiety, risk perception, poor executive functioning, unverbalized friction (difficult to see as a "clear reason" from the outside)
- Strategic speech x No intention: Aiming for special treatment, saying "I can't" (in reality, "I won't")
- Preference x No intention: not rationally chosen on a cost-effective basis ("don't do it")

Many cases that appear to the observer to be "no clear reason" fall into (2) ([[invisible costs]]). Confusing this area with (3) and (4) can lead to misallocation and flame wars.

2) Operational judgment (by procedure, not by label)
1. present a minimum support set
    - Clarification of procedures, presentation of time required, one-click, alternative channels, accompanied assistance for a short time, etc. (low-cost and high-effectiveness).
2. even if the observable resources are supplemented, it will not move → treat it as "not done" in terms of action (lower priority).
3. move after completion → considered to have been "not possible" (to be incorporated into the standard support thereafter).
[[Judging by behavior]] allows for fair operation without relying on the person's innermost feelings or confession (also consistent with the "line up = order of procedure" principle of "[[those who don't stand in line]]").
- Related: [[Judging by actions, not words]].

3) Distribution and Communication Guidelines
- Procedural fairness: those who meet the columns (requirements) are processed first.
- Baseline maintenance + externalities: overall efficiency gains create extra capacity, and the non-digital layer also has shorter waiting times (discussion point B).
- Only low-cost reasonable accommodations should be standardized (e.g., substitute entry of in-person appointments, continuation of paper forms, etc.).
- The expression is more of a requirement statement than a reason pry: "If you follow this procedure, it will take you XX minutes. If it's too difficult, we'll provide Y. If it still doesn't work, go to the **"If you can spare the time, we'll do it" box**.

4) One-line summary
It is safe and fair to treat "I can't" without a clear reason as "I won't" only when no action is taken even after minimal support is provided. safe and fair.
