[[George Bernard Shaw]]
[[G.B. Shaw]]
> George Bernard Shaw (July 26, 1856 - November 2, 1950) was an Irish-born literary scholar, screenwriter, playwright, critic, politician, educator, and journalist. He is also known by this name without George, as he disliked the first name "George" from his youth and wrote many of his works under the name Bernard Shaw, which he omitted.
