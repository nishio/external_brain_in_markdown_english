title: "Organizational theory without employment contracts"
---

- Many [[organizational theories]] implicitly assume the basic premise that "[[a]] contract of employment keeps you on the clock about five days a week, and that you have a boss and subordinates, and the boss has the right of command."
- As Drucker points out, expert groups are hard to govern that way.
        - [[Drucker.]]   [[The knowledge society is not a society of bosses and subordinates.]]
- So, rather, it is the volunteer organizations and open source communities, etc., where there is no pay, no restraints, no command authority, etc., that can be helpful.
    - When we think about [[Organizational Survival]], we tend to focus on the [[Survival of gold]], because we bind people by employment contracts.
- If you remove that condition, [[Survival of the human spirit]] is more important to the survival of the organization.
    - When people's hearts and minds don't survive in a for-profit company, [[job turnover]] jumps and the money is damaged.
