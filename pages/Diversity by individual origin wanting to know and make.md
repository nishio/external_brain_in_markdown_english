title: "Diversity by individual origin wanting to know and make"

> [rkmt](https://x.com/rkmt/status/1890938037229715600) The fulfillment of two major human desires (or not?), curiosity to know something and creativity to make something (currently mainly programming, but in the near future, everything), are rapidly being fulfilled by AI. I feel a phase change in the human race. It is also interesting to note that the trigger for both is the individual. I believe that the ultimate diversified society will be one in which each individual can do what he or she wants to do.
