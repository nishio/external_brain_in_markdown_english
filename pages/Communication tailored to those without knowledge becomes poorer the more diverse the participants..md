from  [[Nodal Point of Thought 2023-12]]
Communication tailored to those without knowledge becomes poorer the more diverse the participants.
- [[Communication tailored to the uninformed]] becomes poorer the more diverse the participants.

    - Context: [[Communities that are allowed to go through]].
    - In [[communities where going through is not allowed]], the more homogeneity, the better the quality of communication.
- T:
    - Those without knowledge should communicate among those without knowledge."
    - in Tokyo
    - Those without knowledge should give up communicating in highly diverse settings."
    - While I kind of hate the conclusion that
    - You can't do that unless you give up, can you?"
    - I also feel that I wonder what it is!
