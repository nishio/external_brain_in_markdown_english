title: "Don't talk about incorrect answers."

> [isnki](https://twitter.com/isnki/status/1788919727370432565) The problem is that when I say "B" instead of "A" in class, people take it as "A, I didn't know that". I have been trying to prevent this from happening for some time, but I have found another method that has proven effective in my classes. ↓.

> [isnki](https://twitter.com/isnki/status/1788920921648157128) Ask students questions where the answer is B, not A. Guess some students and ask them to each say what they think. This will result in several different answers. I then explain that I have received many different answers, and the correct answer is B. In my practice, this has eliminated students who misunderstand.

>  Depending on the content to be explained and the format of the class, the above method may or may not be feasible. If there are any teachers who have practiced something similar, I would like to hear their opinions on its effectiveness.
