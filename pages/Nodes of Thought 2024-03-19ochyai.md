I don't dislike the original and incorrect conclusion that it is wrong to let [[hunter-gatherers]] do [[agriculture]] (including [[(manufacturing) industry]] and [[capitalism]]).

I think this is because, although there was nature in the computer at that time, nature outside the computer could be the nature of the computer as well as the nature in the computer, and the technological progress that would break through the dichotomy in the connection between the two could not be predicted at that time.

In other words, it is an assertion that deconstruction is not limited to human intellectual activity or analytical methods, but should be understood as one of the fundamental characteristics of nature itself. This perspective emphasizes the deep connection and unity between humans and nature, and between language and the natural world, and advocates a broader view of the universe that goes beyond an anthropocentric perspective.
