title: "What is the intersection of meaning?"

> I wonder if the intersection of concepts is a concept, a meta-concept, or something other than a concept.
「 [[Intersection of concepts]] 」というメタファーの指すものが僕の持っているものと同じかどうかはわからないが、同じだとするなら「概念の交差点は概念」<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamedcamp/nishio/icon' alt='/unnamedcamp/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- I'm using a different definition of the word "concept" in my Scrapbox than it is used here, so for the sake of distinction, I'll say "intersection of meanings is meaning".
- First, meanings can seem separate and unrelated, or overlapping and related, depending on your point of view.

- The term "intersection of concepts" on this page seems to be a metaphor used to refer to a phenomenon that occurs after "observing from a different perspective, there appears to be a relationship between meanings that were previously thought to be unrelated.
- At this time, "meaning" is a "blurry circle" that does not yet have clearly defined boundaries

            - [[blurred circle]]
    - It's hard to tell if you draw with these blurry circles, so we'll draw with two "dark zones and light zones".

                - [[Dark Thin Circle Diagram]]
        - Unlike "concepts" used in mathematics, which have clearly defined boundaries, the "meanings" we usually deal with have both thick and thin parts like this.
- So far, we have all the tools we need to describe the "intersection of meanings."
- What is meant by "intersection of meanings?"

        - [["Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning" Study Group 3#6233f244aff09e00009fa2ae]]
    - The thin areas of the edges of the two "meanings" A and B overlap, creating a new "dense area" L. This L
    - This is also a "blurry circle" like A and B, so "intersection of meanings is also a meaning"
- Side note: I use the term "concept" to refer to something whose boundaries have been clarified by careful definition.
        - [[A "concept" is logically uniquely identified and symbolized]]
