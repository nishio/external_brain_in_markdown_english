Innovation Game Design and Satisfactory Space Design
Abstract: In conceiving a "game for business administration and innovation learning", abstract business strategies can be modeled as a "spatial" design problem, inspired by the construction of production lines in 3D space at Satisfactory.

Commentary:
- Satisfactory sets up production lines in a 3D space and expands the factory by using multi-level intersections and layered structures.
- In the innovation game, market needs, technological constraints, and competitive situations could be represented as "spatial constraints" on a map.
- For example, new market development is associated with the image of reaching an "unknown upland area" by building a bridge.
- Technological innovation can be represented by the concept of "heights" and "corridors" to break through existing constraints, as well as elevators that go through the upper and lower levels and three-dimensional pipeline laying.
- These spatial metaphors facilitate learning by transforming abstract business strategy decisions into spatial design problems that players can intuitively understand.

- It is useful to some extent to understand abstract things by mapping them to physical things, but it is important to keep in mind that there is more than one way to [[map (e.g. an address on a computer screen)]]!
