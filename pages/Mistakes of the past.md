> I have to admit that I made a serious mistake in what I wrote in my first book.
- [[Wittgenstein]] [[philosophical inquiry]] p.11 Introduction

The "first book" is [[Essays in Philosophy of Logic and Philosophy]], written in 1918 and published in 1921.
It is believed that Philosophical Inquiry was roughly finished writing by 1946. Publication was posthumous.

As an example of how a book author's ideas are not immutable, I wrote in column [[(Column) Time Direction Reading]] of [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]] p.125, but thought it would be better to be more specific.
