[[rules and discipline]].
    - [[rule]] and [[discipline]].
- Japanese do not follow the rules.
- observe discipline
- No discipline to follow the rules.
- What is discipline?
    - [[air]]
    - [[the general will]]
        - Even [[General Will 2.0]] wrote [The general will is similar to the sense of reading the air.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The "general will" advocated by French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau refers to a collective will that goes beyond individual interests and considers the well-being of society as a whole. In Hiroki Azuma's "General Will 2.0," this "general will" is said to be similar to a sense of reading the air; in other words, it reflects the values and consciousness that we all unconsciously share.

[[Broad listening is AI-like induction]].
    - [[broad listening]] is [[AI-like induction]].
    - It's not like "[[induction]]."
    - If it's "[[AI-like induction]]," well, I guess so.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Induction is a method of reasoning that derives general laws and principles from individual, specific cases. For example, observing the sun rise repeatedly and drawing the conclusion that "the sun rises every day" is inductive reasoning.
    - If an AI derives a general law or principle that is not necessarily correct from a few "individual specific cases," "[[induction]]"

What is discipline?
- A person who touches the body of the opposite sex at work is fired.
    - It generates an ethic that says you shouldn't do that kind of behavior.
    - [[violence]] creates discipline
    - One person does act X and is beaten by a competent person, another person sees this and thinks that it is unethical to do act X. This creates ethics.
        - [[Mackie's Theory of Error]]
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>This idea refers to the process by which ethics is formed through observed outcomes and social experiences, and is considered a concept similar to "[[social learning]]" or "[[consequentialism]]" in ethics.
            - First, the process by which others judge an action to be unethical based on observed conduct is an example of ethical judgment learned from experience. This relates to the Social Learning Theory, which states that people form their own ethical standards by watching the actions of others and their consequences. This theory is based on [[Bandura's]] ([[Albert Bandura]]) "modeling" or "observational learning." We see that behavior is rewarded or punished, and we decide whether it is good or bad ethically.
            - It is also associated with a form of Consequentialism ([[Consequentialism]]). Consequentialism judges whether an action is ethically good or bad based on the consequences of the action. Typical examples include [[John Stuart Mill.]]'s [[utilitarianism]] ([[Utilitarianism]]), in which the criterion for judgment is whether the consequences of an action result in happiness or unhappiness for people.
            - The formation of such ethics is based on personal observation and experience, a concept in which social impact and consequences are important.
            - [[Mackie]] ([[J.G. Mackie]], [[John Leslie Mackie]]) is best known for his "Error Theory" in the field of ethics. He took the position that all ethical claims are "false," and argued that people believe moral facts because of false assumptions and social conditioning.
            - Specifically, McKee denied that moral claims are objectively correct and argued that morality has no objective foundation. His "error theory" holds that what we think is morally right is actually shaped by social customs and personal beliefs, not objective truth.
            - Thus, the situation you described of "seeing others perform act X and judging it to be unethical" is also viewed by McKee's theory as another matter of whether it is objectively correct, although people feel that way based on their social experiences and observations. In other words, McKee's position is that moral judgments are a kind of "illusion" and have no actual objective basis.
            - In this sense, it can be said that McKee takes a critical position on the process by which ethical judgments are formed by looking at the actions of others, in that it is "socially constructed" and not an objective fact.
