[OSS Gate](https://oss-gate.github.io/)
> "OSS Gate" is an initiative to provide a "gateway" to participate in OSS development. We will turn those who have not yet participated in OSS development into participants, and turn those who have participated a little into continuous participants. In this way, we will continuously increase the number of people participating in OSS development. This is the purpose of "OSS Gate".
