title: "I don't think there is any basis for confidence."

from [/villagepump/I guess there is no basis for confidence](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/I guess there is no basis for confidence).
- There is no such thing as [[basis]] in [[confidence (in oneself)]].
    - [[self-assurance]] とか [[confidence (in oneself)]] ってそもそも [[Unsubstantiated Impressions]] なのでは<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Implicit in the phrase "[[Unsubstantiated Confidence.]]" is the feeling that "you must have a basis for yourself" and "you who have no basis for yourself must not be confident."
    - But even if someone thinks they have "grounded confidence," that "grounding" doesn't logically lead to "so I should be confident."
    - that I associate with [[Humean scepticism]].
        - Even causality is iffy, much less confidence.
        - Isn't it funny that you think you need evidence? I mean.
        - The connection was made after the fact.
    - The basis for this is considered to be[[track record]] のことが多い？<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/yosider/icon' alt='/villagepump/yosider.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Just because something has worked in the past doesn't mean it will work the next time.
            - I just wanted to say this.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - But I think the odds are that someone with a proven track record will do better.
            - +1<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Probability is that a person who acts confidently in the same capacity is more likely than a person who acts less confidently...<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - Probability of success is likely to be high with respect to tasks that are affected by human evaluation
            - (I thought that the probability of a bug is the same even if you write a program with full confidence, so I limited it to "evaluation by humans.)
            - I guess we shouldn't look too much at attitude when evaluating people.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - I'm getting dragged along, though.
                - Are we supposed to say that we should just look at the portfolio and make a decision?
                    - If the goal is to look at [[culture fit]] or something, you need to look at attitude.
        - Is there anything to be gained by acting unsure?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - Moderate confidence?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
                    - [[overconfident]] There's also the word
                - [[Expected value control]] ？<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/yosider/icon' alt='/villagepump/yosider.icon' height="19.5"/>
