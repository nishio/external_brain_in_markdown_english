title: "All models are wrong."

> Since all models are wrong the scientist cannot obtain a “correct” one by excessive elaboration.
- All [[models]] are wrong, so putting more effort than necessary will not yield the "right" model.

- [[David Glasner]] took Paul Romer's critique of macroeconomics and made the following assertions.
    - Macroeconomists counter that "all models are wrong," but microfoundation models have not escaped Lucasian criticism either.
    - The [[Friedman]] assertion that [[the more important the theory, the more unrealistic the assumptions]] is also used, but the word "simple" should have been used rather than "unrealistic".
    - The phrase "all models are wrong" originated in a paper by George Box, the gist of which is as follows
        - [[Models should aim for a conservative depiction without over-elaboration.]]
        - Scientists need to be careful [[about which mistakes are important]].
        - When applying mathematics, make [[untrue but useful assumptions]].
        - [[The usefulness of a statistical technique is not known until it is used.]]
        - [[Major advances in science occur in the back-and-forth between theory and practice.]]
    - Modern macroeconomists flaunt advanced mathematical techniques, but they should be a bit more humble if they accept the content of Box's lecture.
