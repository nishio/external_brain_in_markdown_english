title: "AI automation by flying DX with Leap Frog"

> [@fukkyy](https://twitter.com/fukkyy/status/1686890251347001344?s=20): [[leapfrog]]: I conclude that Japan has a choice to automate and copilot by AI. I think it is possible to jump from paper to automation by AI, as seen in our customer case studies. In fact, it is more effective than halfway digitalization, and there is a possibility to move at once.
- [Leapfrog-type development - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/リープフロッグ型発展)
    - > Leapfrog-type development refers to the spread of new services in emerging countries without existing social infrastructure, leapfrogging the technological progress made by developed countries. It is also called the leapfrog phenomenon.
    - > One example is the rapid adoption of cell phones and smartphones in many emerging economies, which did not wait for fixed-line phones to become widespread.
    - > Mongolia, where solar cells and satellite broadcasting have leapfrogged the power grid and the spread of TV terrestrial broadcasting.
    - This is also the reason why [[Decentralized finance]] and [[Decentralized ID]] are used in countries that were a little late to the game and are not easily understood in Japan.

> [@kensuu](https://twitter.com/kensuu/status/1686912477806854146?s=20): I think this is quite common. I often hear that "resistance to DXing business processes is strong", but "proposals to use AI are very popular". ...
- But that's because customers' expectations of AI are inflated beyond reality...

> [@yousukehirai](https://twitter.com/yousukehirai/status/1686920448494469120?s=20): I very much agree with this idea.
> In conversations with customers, there are many companies and executives who "have no understanding of digitization" but are interested in how AI can be used.
> To move forward from this point, I think it is important to find ways to improve the situation of "general agreement and disagreement on each issue.

> I agree that Japan needs a "leap frog" in AI. The situation is similar to the Meiji Restoration, when the situation changed from isolation to the Black Ships. ChatGPT" will be the black ship to spread AI to companies and government, and then to introduce robots.
