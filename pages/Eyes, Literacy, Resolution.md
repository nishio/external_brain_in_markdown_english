I noticed a connection between these three.
    - [[(a) look]]
        - [[What I learned only after 12 hours of drawing cylinders]]
            - [[Have an eye to notice]]
    - [[literacy]]
    - [[Cognitive Resolution]]

After gaining the eye, one moves up one level [[dialectics]] by recognizing that "but most people don't have that eye."
- There's no eye contact.
- There's a look in your eye.
- Understand that "the majority of people who don't have an "eye for an eye
    - I have an eye for myself.
        - If you don't have an eye for an eye, you don't understand "no eye for an eye."
    - Understand that their own eyesight (cognitive pattern) is not common.
        - Cognitive [[relativization]].
