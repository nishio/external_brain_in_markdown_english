- Focusing on the V1 side vertex, only one edge at most comes out of one vertex.
    - That is, [[split matroid]].
- Same for V2 side
- The edge set that is matching is a common subset of these two
    - In other words [[matroid crossing]].

    - [[incremental algorithm]]
    - The [[Maximum matching]] problem on [[2-part graph]] is a [[split matroid]] pair crossing problem
