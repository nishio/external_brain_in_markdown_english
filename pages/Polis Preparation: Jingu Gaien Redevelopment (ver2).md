```
This is a forum for discussion about the redevelopment of Jingu Gaien. You can vote for or against an opinion, or post a new one.

Submissions and votes will be made open data in a form that does not identify individuals.

In [ver1](https://polis.nhiro.org/9herb9baam), the AI moderated human opinions and made a list of opinions, but it was not very exciting, so we decided to let the human opinions come through unmoderated.
```
