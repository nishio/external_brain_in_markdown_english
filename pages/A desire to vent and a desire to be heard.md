The desire to get out what is in your head and the desire to make others listen to it are a set of two things that create the behavior of "restraining others and making them listen to you".

    - [[Chat is for mutual consumption]]
    - [[You can read it as you want it to be read.]]

Why do you want to spit it out?
- The person in the middle says something.
- If I don't write it down, I'll say the same thing over and over again.
- When the same thing is said over and over again, it consumes the resources of the place and interferes with other actions.
- I write them down and they shut up.
