title: "Broad Listening to Discover New Cuts"

prev  [[Broad Listening from Text Format Data]]
- Hypothesis that customer value is the discovery of a "new angle" when the objective is not to visualize and show a scatter plot

mounting
- Instead of making it 2-dimensional with UMAP and then SpectralClustering, [[HDBSCAN]] it in a higher dimension.
    - In this case, use a large number of clusters (30~100), discard sparse regions, and extract only dense clusters.
    - When we did "[[Teaching AI the KJ Method]]", we had the students extract pairs as if they were teaching humans, but this time, we will directly perform the "[[grouping]]" of the KJ method by extracting the dense regions in the high-dimensional space.
- Have LLM create a description of the extracted clusters (where [[Surprisingness Judgment]] is also performed).
    - This is what the KJ method calls "[[making a table nameplate]]."
    - Describe the group first, then add a front cover that compresses that description.
- Then, based on the description of the cluster, check for "relatedness" with respect to the excluded data, and pick up
    - This is a confluence of [[ape]].
        - Expanding [[associative mood]] and [[expansion of pertinent judgment]] increases the probability of new [[associative connection]].

- If the objective is to discover [[New Perspectives]], it is not important to say "there were many opinions like this," so the direction is to "extract [[strong opinions]]," "discover [[unexpected approaches]]," and "obtain a wide range of information related to these opinions.

PS
- In the above process, I abandoned the creation of a scatter plot once, but then I realized that in the KJ method, too, you do the grouping and then the spatial arrangement, so you can just do the spatial arrangement after this.
