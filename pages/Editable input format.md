title: "Editable input format"
---

    - I wonder if [[(computer) format]] of input that cannot be [[edited]] is not ideal as [[Forms of Knowledge Representation]].
- Editing examples
        - [[underline]] Subtract
    - Write down what comes to mind in the margins.
    - Creating Scrapbox-like links
- The current editing of paper books and e-books is not good enough
    - Inherently more conducive to intellectual production.
    - Cases where the margins are too small to write in
        - Make reading notes in a separate notebook because you can't write in the margins.
            - → Books and notebooks are kept separate from each other.
                - Cannot jump from the book side to the notes I wrote reading that page.
    - I want to compare the contents on separate pages side by side.
        - It was cumbersome on paper, but depending on the implementation of the e-book viewer, it's more cumbersome than paper, degenerate.
    - Phenomenon that output becomes a hassle and output ceases.
        - Unconsciously, we are shackling our intellect.
        - Writing clarifies thoughts: [[literary work]].
- Creating Scrapbox-like links
    - Bracketing keywords that seem important that come up while reading.
        - Or add the keywords you associate with it.
    - If the page is two hops ahead of the link, it is indicated by a blue link.
    - Strongly support discovering the connection between concepts
    - Forming a network of knowledge
