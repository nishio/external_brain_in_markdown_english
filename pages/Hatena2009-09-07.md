The famous solitaire where you can turn after taking the so-called balls, but not jump over them. I like how the package explains it all in one sentence: "Clear the game if you get all the balls like a stroke of a pen.

But I don't think "the number of answers is 3,000" is a point of appeal, even up to "you can enjoy all 48 questions".
