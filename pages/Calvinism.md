<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Calvinism is one of the [[protestant]] teachings formed through the Reformation in the 16th century and is based primarily on the teachings of [[John Calvin]]. The core teachings and characteristics of Calvinism are briefly summarized below.
- Scheduling (doctrine of election): This is one of the best-known doctrines of Calvinism, the idea that God has already chosen some people for eternal salvation and others for eternal perdition. This is said to be based on God's will regardless of human choice or action.
- [Total depravity: This is the teaching that man is totally depraved by Adam and Eve's first sin and does not have the ability to seek salvation on his own.
- Limited Awe: The death of Jesus Christ is valid only for the scheduled chosen people, not for all people.
- Non-resistible grace: teaches that the elect do not have a free will to accept God's grace, but cannot resist it.
- Perpetuation of the Saints: Once saved, a person is said to be saved forever. In other words, the idea is that true Christians never lose their faith.

Calvinism centers around these doctrines, emphasizing [[the sovereignty of God]] and [[the sinfulness of man]]. This has led to the formation of many churches and denominations, with a particularly strong influence in areas such as Scandinavia and North America.

However, these doctrines are often controversial, and differences with other Protestant teachings and Catholicism can be seen.
