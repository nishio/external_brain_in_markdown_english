Okay, this is [[unclear definition of done]].
- If you look only at the "design of the task recording mechanism," you'll see that it's done.
    - The details indicate that "designing a system to prevent omission of task records" is not done.

It's unclear what exactly the "analysis of the MVID dataset at TTTC" is supposed to do.
- Like, "'Analysis' is not a do-able task, is it?"

I tried to get Devin to improve it, but he failed spectacularly.

- Root of the problem: The user is in the "I want to make the task more concrete" stage, but the AI has jumped to large-scale implementation policies and phase design, and the goals of both parties are misaligned.
- Solution: Focus first on bottleneck tasks such as "T0011 and T0008" and only write down the completion definition (acceptance criteria), necessary specifications, and output format in concrete terms. Implementation plans, deployment procedures, etc. will come later.
- Expected effect: By clarifying this step, the user's "what he/she wants to know/do" and the AI's suggestions will match, and the conversation will proceed smoothly.

Not this one per se, but regarding this kind of ambiguous task.
> Each task is subdivided into smaller sections, and questions are provided to check the progress of each. This identifies those portions that are complete and those that are incomplete.
This is quite nice.
Obviously yes, obviously no, and I don't understand the question.
- Done or not."
- There are cases of "not done" & "don't see the need to do it."
