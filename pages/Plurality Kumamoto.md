>  Plurality and Digital Democracy event will be held at Kumadai!
>  Masashi Koyama, former mayor of Kumamoto City, will also be here, so this will be a valuable opportunity to discuss the idea of digital democracy with someone who has experience as a chief executive!
>  Please dm if you would like to attend, as the number of seats is running low!
