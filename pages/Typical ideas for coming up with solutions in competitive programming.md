[Typical ideas for coming up with solutions in competitive programming | Algorithmic Logic](https://algo-logic.info/how-to-think-cp/)
- There is quite a bit of overlap with what was being verbalized to put [[Power of Attribution]] on.

- Think in terms of input constraints
        - [[Small constraint problem]]
        - [[Constraints with N around 8]]
        - [[Constraints with N around 10~20]]
        - [[Constraints with N around 30~40]]
        - [[Constraints with N around 50]]  O(N^4) OK
        - [[Constraints with N around 300~500]]
        - [[Constraints with N around 1000]]
- Take it apart and think about it.
        - [[Notice the small constants.]]
    - [[Fix one variable]]
        - [[Fix the middle of three things]]
    - [[Half of the queue]]
    - [[divide into X and Y]]
    - [[Note the invariants of the operation.]]
    - [[focus on the even and odd]]
        - [[even and odd cases]]
    - [[independent of the order of operations]]
    - [[time reversal (physics)]]
    - [[Undoable operations]]
    - [[Cumulative product from left to right]]
    - [[Addition of isoperimetric sequences focuses on the difference]]
    - [[Composition of interval inversion is XOR]]
    - [[Grundy number]]
    - [[have an after-event]]
    - [[Binary search for k-th number]]
    - [[XOR is addition without carryover]]
    - [[XOR can be split by digit]]
    - [[45 degree rotation]]
    - [[Minimize difference is median]]
    - [[Typical graphs for consideration]]
    - [[Tree is a two-part graph]]
    - [[Diameter of tree]]
    - [[Maximization with bisection search.]]
    - [[Greed from those with fewer options.]]
    - [[Bipartite graph of two-dimensional coordinates]]
    - [[Make the order a directed graph]]
    - [[Extreme values of convex functions are tristimulus searches]]
    - [[Shakudori method for monotonic increase]]
    - [[The equi-proportion sequence focuses on the remainder]]
    - [[N-decimal numbers focus on the remainder.]]
    - [[Bracketed rows are up and down]]

- [[Typical ideas for coming up with solutions in competitive programming]] to review the issues mentioned.
