The idea that "[[formative experience (from one's youth)]] is constituted [[posterior]]" refers to the interpretation that [[personal experience]] itself can be given meaning in retrospect, even if it is not significant in the moment. This is the interpretation of [[Gyojin Karatani]]. This is one of the key themes in the discussion of [[Gyojin Karatani]].

Emaya discusses this idea in relation to the concepts of thinkers such as Saussure, Marx, and Kant. For example, his "[[retrospective perspective]]" emphasizes the process by which experiences and events are later interpreted and meaning is reconstructed. This perspective is deeply connected to subjective understanding in phenomenology and linguistics, which Emaya explored thoroughly.

This assertion by Emaya can also be seen as a contemporary "[[rediscovery of the self]]" or "[[editing of memory]]," in which individual experiences pass unconsciously in the moment and their importance is later constructed. This allows us to view what we call our "original experiences" as also being shaped over time.
