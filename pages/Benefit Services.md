title: "Benefit Services"

The argument is that you shouldn't put the hassle of benefits on local governments, you should create a system.

>
>  There are proposals being floated by various parties to provide benefits to the public. I understand that you want to take measures against rising prices, but please, please think about how to do it.
>
>  Do you remember the 100,000 yen flat benefit five years ago? The application should have been made to the municipality.
>
>  This benefit work was decided by the national government, but all the work was done by municipal employees. I would like to express my respect once again to all the employees from all over the country who worked on this project, even in the midst of the chaos caused by the Corona disaster.
>  At that time, all municipal officials must have thought. Why doesn't the government do this?
>
>  ■Benefit programs are "municipalities coming forward to do this themselves".
>
>  There are some affairs that should be handled by the national government but are left to local governments. For example, affairs related to national elections, public assistance, and family registers are essentially the work of the national government, but local governments are responsible for them. These are "legally mandated affairs. What local governments are responsible for is determined by law.
>
>  However, the benefit program is not a "legally mandated" program. In other words, local governments come forward to do this on their own as "self-governing affairs," and the government bears the financial burden.
>
>  Isn't this something strange?
>  It is virtually impossible to say that only our city does not provide benefits.
>
>  Moreover, the start date of benefits is set by each municipality. We must not forget that there have been reports of a competition to see which municipality provides benefits earlier, which has increased the mental burden on the employees.
>
>  ■In an emergency, there are other jobs that only municipal officials can do.
>
>  Some may say that it is good because the government bears the financial burden.
>
>  But in the end, it is the municipal employees who are responsible for the work. No matter how many additional people are hired, it is the regular employees who lead the team, and I have heard that in 2020, many employees gave up their original duties to work on the project.
>
>  Benefits are not provided in normal times. It is an emergency. It is during such times that only city hall employees can do their jobs.
>  Only city hall employees, who are closest to the lives of citizens, can be close to and support each and every citizen in front of them.
>
>  I would like the government to do the work of accepting and transferring applications for a uniform amount.
>
>  Of course, I don't think that state officials should do it manually. It has been 5 years since the Corona disaster. I think it is all about the lack of an automatic benefit system in place during this time.
>  The system of linking public money receipt accounts to my number is progressing, but not everyone is linked to it. If you are only concerned about benefits for everyone, it is more of a hassle. There is a risk of double payment.
>
>  ...
>
>  Local governments should not be subcontractors to the national government.
>
>  It's about time to sort out what should be done at the national level and what should be done at the local level. I think we need to sort things out based on an understanding of the current situation in the local areas. I will continue to transmit what I can in my capacity as mayor.

Mayor of Miyazaki City [[Tomonori Kiyoyama]].
> [T_Kiyoyama](https://x.com/T_Kiyoyama/status/1717322937681018959) Good morning.
>  Many people have commented that it would be more efficient to use the [[public money receiving account]] linked to my number for the payment of the 70,000 yen benefit.
>  Well, that's what you would normally think, wouldn't you? I have been saying since last year that we can't take advantage of it.
>
>  However, the process is not as simple as one might imagine: benefits are not simply deposited into a public account from the government.
>
>  First of all, local governments budget the administrative costs of benefits and payments and submit them to the council. (Some local governments skip this step by an exclusive decision of the head of the local government, but this depends on the head's idea and relationship with the council.
>
>  Once the city council has met and passed the resolution, we can start the payment paperwork, but since the payment of benefits is a "gift contract" with the citizen, a notice must be sent to the citizen in order for that contract to be executed.
>
>  And in order to send it, we have to identify exactly who is eligible. For example, we need to accurately identify every single person who is exempt from resident tax as of ~year~month~date.
>
>  Once the eligible persons are identified, we will mail a confirmation letter notifying them of the payment and confirming the transfer account. We would like to do this digitally, but we don't have the means to properly deliver it digitally to all eligible persons, so it is a paper form.
>  In it, you will also enclose a return form requesting denial of receipt or change of receiving account, and if necessary, we will ask you to mail it to us.
>  If there is no problem with your account information and you have the intention to receive the money, you do not have to do anything. We adopted this push system last year. Until then, we had to go to the trouble of confirming the will to receive the money with a return letter, but if there is no indication of the will to refuse to receive the money, we consider that there is a will to receive the money and we pay the money.
>
>  Benefits were repeatedly paid out due to the Corona disaster, so the municipality is most likely aware of accounts that have been paid out within the last year.
>  So, rather than public money receiving accounts, we check the information of accounts that have a track record of payments and pay them out.
>  For the accounts of those who have no payment records, it is necessary to consider whether to utilize public money receiving accounts linked to mynahs in the future, but previously it was necessary to work on verifying information linkage with the system of the vendor that was commissioned to perform screening and payment services.
>
>  And finally, the process of transferring benefits from the designated financial institution. It has been discussed that there may be fees to be paid to financial institutions for such transfers of public funds in the future. We will be very careful to ensure that no mistakes are made during the transfer process.
>
>  In addition, until now, there have been households with sudden changes in household finances, which do not meet the above requirements of being exempt from residential tax as of the date of the taxable year, month, or day, but whose finances have deteriorated since that date, which also required a great deal of administrative work. Since the number of applicants was too large for our staff to handle, we had to outsource the work to a private company.
>
>  Furthermore, we receive many inquiries from citizens. I wonder if I am not eligible, when will the money be transferred, is this kind of project wasteful (it is a government policy...), etc.
>  Since such inquiries cannot be handled by regular staff, a separate call center will be set up. That, too, will cost money.
>
>  The above is a rough description.
>  I am not engaged in the field, so some of the details may be inaccurate or not mentioned enough.
>
>  I hope this has given you some idea that it is not a simple process of just getting a quick deposit in a public money receiving account linked to my number and being OK...
>  So, I personally think that it would be a good idea if these inefficient administrative measures did not occur.

Interesting Opinion
> [9xvBzCwKbsTwfie](https://x.com/9xvBzCwKbsTwfie/status/1934050039757947151) Let's just hand out 20,000 yen at the House of Councillors polling stations and do a census while we're at it. The voting rate will go up, the administrative cost of distributing the money will go down, you'll get the money quickly, and you'll have less time and effort to do the survey.
>  I have to do it.
