title: "Broad Listening is a qualitative analysis"
---

- [[broad listening]] is [[qualitative analysis]].
- I'm just saying that we shouldn't interpret the results of broad listening like a quantitative analysis.
- Until now, qualitative analysis has tended to be expensive and only quantitative analysis reports have been produced, so many people have only seen quantitative analysis reports.
    - So we try to interpret "the unfamiliar" in the way we are used to.

    - [[Broad Listening Pitfalls]]
    - > tokoroten: I recommend this video for more information on what kind of data is obtained and how it is biased when using public hearing AI.


- > tokoroten: You have to separate the policy between appeals to voters and analysis of internal use, and that's where the problem arises because you confuse the two.
    - At the time of the TMG election, TTTC Turbo was better received by the policy making team for analysis of internal use, but Turbo at the time was not stable enough to be shown to the general public, so Scatter was used primarily.
    - This Scatter is used for general users in a broadcast-like manner that finds value for its "strength of appeal to viewers," such as its use on TV in the House of Representatives election.
    - Turbo-like hierarchical analysis was loaded on Scatter and [[public information AI]] was created.

        - [[noisy minority]]
    - General agreement
    - To add a little more to the discussion, "data that is not random sampling should not be used for quantitative analysis" is irrelevant to broadband AI.
    - There's another story that goes, "You can't use a broadband AI for quantitative analysis, even if it's random sampling."

        - I really like this diagram. I was imagining the bottom right square of this diagram when I said the other day, "If you want to do a quantitative analysis, why don't you look at the results of the broad-based AI and decide what you want to ask and do a survey?"
        - If you already have a scale and it is reliable enough, you can use it to conduct surveys, etc. (top right)
        - Qualitative analysis, such as broadband AI, is a technique that can be used when reliable measures cannot be established in advance, and that is its strength (top left).

        - > ohki: Nishio's talk about this area was also easy to understand!
            - > There's not much point in being "right ratio" about this.
            - >  Information that A is 60% and B is 30% is meaningless.
            - >  It doesn't even matter if C is 1% or 2%.
            - >  The realization that "C exists" is important.
