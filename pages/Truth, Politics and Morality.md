    - [[truth]] - [[politics]] - [[morals]] - [[pragmatism]] and [[careful deliberation]]
- [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3EBOe8V)

I bought it because of the subtitle "[[Pragmatism and Deliberation]]"
The author [[Misak]] re-evaluates [[classical pragmatism]] and examines [[deliberation democracy]] on that basis
- On the other hand, it is different from "[[neo-pragmatism]]" centered on [[Richard Rorty]].
- Rorty discards the concept of "[[truth]]" and aims for "[[uncoerced]] consensus" within the community.
- Misak maintains "truth" to base "[[research]]" on [[parse]]
    - How to hold the concept of truth in the field of ethics and politics is discussed in this book.

Original was written in 2000, Japanese translation in 2023.
