- Most of what I wrote was summarized in [[Auto Bracketing]].
- What is not written

    - [[I want to bracket local files.]]
    - [[Bracketing for non-editable items]]
- For example, for a cut and scanned PDF, it would be nice to have the metadata for that file.
- Similarly for images...

- I've thought this far and realized that the meaning has expanded from the original meaning of "[[bracketing]]"
- Competition/Inherent Bracketing is to bracket a portion of editable text to make it a "link" and create the possibility of future merging
- The broad usage here focuses on "[[Increase the potential for coupling]]"
    - In other words, you want to increase the [[Possibility of coupling]] for local files as well as for those in Scrapbox.

- Intrinsically important from a UX perspective to be presented at a sufficient speed
