title: "Summer Cicada Parable 2"
---

> I recommend that you observe programmers who are angry because they have been neglected, but if you generalize it to "some people underestimate what they have not experienced," it is a natural phenomenon that is not at all uncommon, so you can just feel like "oh, it's summer, the cicadas are singing. It is futile to feel angry at the cicadas.

I thought I had written on the same subject before, but when I looked back at it, it didn't seem to be an equal.
    - [[Parable of the Summer Cicadas]]
The last one was "someone who has something negative to say about your output."
This time it's "people who underestimate what they haven't experienced."
The common point is "it is a [[natural phenomenon (phenomena)]] that there are people like that, so I don't mind".
