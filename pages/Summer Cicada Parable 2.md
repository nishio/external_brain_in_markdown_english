title: "Summer Cicada Parable 2"
---

> I recommend generalizing the observed programmers' anger at the neglect of programmers to "[[people underestimating what they haven't experienced]]" because it's a natural phenomenon that's not at all uncommon and makes you feel like "Oh, it's summer, the cicadas are chirping. I recommend it because it's a natural phenomenon that is not unusual at all. It is futile to feel anger toward cicadas.

I thought I had written on the same subject before, but when I looked back at it, it didn't seem to be an equal.
    - [[Parable of the Summer Cicadas]]
The last one was "someone who has something negative to say about your output."
This time it's "someone who [[underestimates]] what they [[experience]] not."
The common point is "it is a [[natural phenomenon (phenomena)]] that there are people like that, so I don't mind".
