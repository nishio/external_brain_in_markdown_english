title: "Bug or Ability."

Q: Is [[placebo]] a bug or a human ability?
A:
- I see, I thought that was like asking if Super Mario's infinite growth was a bug or [[ability]].
- The system first assumes that a certain behavior is "[[ideal]]".
- Called a "[[(computer) bug]]" when actual behavior deviates from the ideal.
- This means that "a bug is [[subjective]]" because it depends on what you consider to be ideal.
- If the ideal is not assumed in advance, then "the system behaves this way?" comes first, and then "then I can produce a favorable result if I do this". This is a useful [[hack]].

- People seem to be bitter about hacks against the social system. Like, "It's a cheat to exploit a bug in society!" Like that.
- Even if the specifications are not ideal, they may be maintained by someone who finds it convenient to keep them.
