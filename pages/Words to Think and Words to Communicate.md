title: "Words to Think and Words to Communicate"
---

Associated from [[Resolution of reality]].

- Words to communicate are meant to be communicated, so they must be adapted to the vocabulary of the receiver.
- Not so with words for thinking.
    - It doesn't have to be communicated.
        - So it doesn't have to be an existing "well-known term".
    - It is beneficial to increase the resolution to the object of consideration
        - So it is more beneficial to keep creating new words!
