The term "[[value]]" is ambiguous.
It is not obvious what Mr. A means by "[[Value of Knowledge]]".
Thinking in terms of whether others perceive value in Mr. A's knowledge, it depends on the knowledge that others have.
Mr. B does not value Mr. A's knowledge, but Mr. C, who has exactly the same amount of knowledge as Mr. B, values Mr. A's knowledge.
- More [[Amount of knowledge]] increases the probability of being perceived as valuable by others, but not proportionately so.
The value of A's knowledge is neither "A's attributes" nor "A's knowledge attributes." It is created in interaction with others.

To be more specific, if someone spends several hours each day playing a particular game, for example, he or she will surely have a vast amount of knowledge about that game. If the amount of knowledge is valuable, then knowledge of the game is also valuable.
I believe that the value of knowledge itself is not determined by the value of the knowledge itself, but by the price paid by those who seek it. For example, if game knowledge is something that can be obtained by anyone by looking at a strategy site, not many people will pay the price for Mr. A, who has game knowledge in his brain. As a result, game knowledge will be perceived as having little value.
