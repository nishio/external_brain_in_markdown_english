- I'll write an article when I feel like it, saying that it can be explained by a mathematical model.
    - I think that [[qualitative]] can help us to improve our understanding by expressing the "what is it?" in [[mathematic model]], so that we can tweak the details as they are mapped to the logic world.
- We can do replicated experiments or [[experiment]] with different conditions.
        - Experimenting with different [[terms]] and [[Comparison]] can help to deepen [understanding
- Let's try this on several topics to create some examples of "mathematical model thinking" and then we can compare them to explain more about mathematical model thinking!
