Intent to invade
> [rootport](https://twitter.com/rootport/status/1773905495751045180) "We now know the biology of the aliens who invaded Earth."
>  "Hmm?"
>  "They have a part of their brain that is a backup part, and they apparently exchange information by preying on each other."
>  "I mean, they eat the brains of the human race..."
>  "...because they want to be friends with us. There is no intention of aggression on their part."

The reason why they can communicate (no hostility) even by gestures is because they have the same architectural brain...

I wonder if it would be as difficult to communicate with aliens as it would be to decipher them.

>  There was a "fusion/assimilation" of communication methods...
