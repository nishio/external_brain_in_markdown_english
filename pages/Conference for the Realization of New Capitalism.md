Conference for the Realization of New Capitalism (24th)

>
>  - Increase markup rate (add value)
>  - Raise managers' salaries, create a pay gap.
>  - then have the people who get paid less move labor!
>
>  The premise seems to be that increased value-added → increased salary disparity.

Not skill upskilling/wage upskilling as white-collar. It is the blue-collar workers who have the most labor shortages, and this would be more realistic.

This triangular figure is from the "Submission by Commissioner Tomiyama.
- I didn't understand the diagram itself, but I redrew it in my own way based on tokoroten's explanation.

    - 1: Certain industries X are forced to raise wages due to labor shortages
    - 2: Certain industries Y will be replaced from below by AI
        - If there are no restrictions on layoffs, you can simply fire the person below you.
        - What to do in Japan?
    - 3: We can widen the gap in the treatment of Y
    - 4: People who are worse off in Y voluntarily move to industry X, which is understaffed.
- The problem with this interpretation is that there is an implicit assumption that AI will replace it from the lower end of the pay scale.
    - It is not connected to value creation, but it is a way to increase salaries by removing middle managers who were there to maintain the structure of the organization and distribute the high salaries taken from the seniority list to the younger employees.
    - I think the idea that the alternative is from the lower end of the pay scale is an assumption.
    - Maybe it will look something like this.
        - Top management creating value without AI improves performance.
            - Even if the person cannot master the AI, the performance will improve as the performance of human assistants who can master the AI improves.
        - Younger people can use AI to improve their performance over younger people in the past.
        - The middle tier appears to perform relatively poorly.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1762468597665087564) The overall document of the Conference for the Realization of New Capitalism looks like this...
>
>  Increase product price (value added)
>  → Affirmation of salary disparity/variance
>  → Promote mobility of human resources through salary disparity
>  → Move to industries where human resources are in short supply (plus education)
>
>  Feels like rattling off human resources while causing slow inflation.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1762470708997976065) If you look at these things and then look at the MHLW's education and training benefit courses, you'll see that...
>
>  You are urging white-collar workers, whose labor demand has decreased, to get these certifications and move to other industries.

>  Perhaps it will be necessary to pay the middle class less than the younger generation.
> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1762519103921926383) Yes, buying [[nursing care business]] is the right thing to do.
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1762525685736993086) I get it, you buy [[growth industries]] without releasing them into the market and channel your [[excess resources]] to them, surely that's the right answer.
