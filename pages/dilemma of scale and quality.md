title: "dilemma of scale and quality"
---

- Projects with selection (A)
        - [[gated community]]
    - Suppose this produces some value.
- Thinking you want more value
    - Trying to increase scale in the short term will reduce the quality of selection (B)
    - If the quality of the selection is the factor that produces value, value will not be produced.
        - [[The goose that lays the golden egg]] allegory.
        - Killing a goose that lays one golden egg a day in an attempt to get more money out of it.
- We should create a community with no or weak selection before the gate.
    - First, improve quality within this community.
    - Ex post facto, the scale can be expanded without compromising the quality of the selection.
