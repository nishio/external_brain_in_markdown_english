title: "Don't fill the framework with ease."
---

- [[framework]] is not about filling a given box,
The goal is to gain [[awareness]] by thinking about trying to fill it in.
If you fill it up easy, it doesn't make sense.

    - [[become aware of a blind spot]]
    - [[Work forgetting why the question is there.]]
