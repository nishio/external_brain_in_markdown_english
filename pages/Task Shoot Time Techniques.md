- Four Major Factors of Lack of Time p. 57
    - We waste time without realizing that we have very little time to waste.
    - Prioritize interruptive work and requests from others.
    - Repeatedly put off because of the hassle of getting around to it (but always aware of it).
        - Excessive expectations of future self
    - You want perfect results 90% of the time and only 10% of the time to get it done.

- Tend to think that there are still a few days before the deadline
    - But if the total amount of tasks is greater than the number of days remaining, there is no time to waste
    - Why do we think we can afford it if we can't estimate the total amount of tasks?

- Five Task Shooting Basics p. 62
    - Manage today's one day's work in one sheet
    - Centralized management of "to-do" and "done so far" lists
    - Manage anything that takes more than one minute of your time.
    - Estimate time for all jobs.
    - Automatically calculate and always know what time you will be done for the day.

- You can't "waste time."
    - I don't think it's useless when executed.

- Derailment is an interruption to oneself. p. 36
    - [[postpone]] also [[wedging oneself in]].
    - I'm interrupting the break before I do what I need to do now.
