- It would be good to check out other PROJECTS that are working with more than one person.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - For now, I'll list the projects that are also in COMMUNICATION

        - Is it still there?
- If you have the time, I recommend joining a multi-person project that is working well first.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/yosider/icon' alt='/villagepump/yosider.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/kuuote/icon' alt='/villagepump/kuuote.icon' height="19.5"/>

I decided to give it a try because it's not good to recommend it to others without having experienced it myself.

(nature, etc.) observation diary
- There are psychological hurdles before and after participation.
- Before participating
- The ones where you just click on an invite link and the ones where you have to contact the administrator.
    - The latter, of course, is a hurdle.
    - Contacting them doesn't always result in an immediate response (in fact, one does).


What is the difference between what you saw and what you did not comment on
- Not all the notes, I thought along the way, "This would be more interesting to record."
- What is the middle of the road?
    - Anyway, I couldn't decide where to start reading, so I did a search on nishio and read from the top.
- Something I have no way of commenting on.
    - One that only has a link and I don't understand what you mean by it.
    - Something placed on the definition page of a word like "Dewey."

Something with a relatively large amount of text and a sense that meaningful thought may be taking place.
- And yet no comment was written, why?

    - This is easy to understand.

(nature, etc.) observation diary
- After participating in
    - The cost of decision-making to "choose an action" is high if you don't know what to do first.
    - arpla is kind enough to provide a tutorial for those unfamiliar with Scrapbox.
    - Unnamed Camp took quite a while to get to the first step.
        - I switched to most viewed instead of most recent and found the page where the conversation was taking place
            - For a project like this one, where the inflow is from Twitter, this sort order tends to be "the result of what was popular on Twitter", but otherwise it would be "the pages most frequently referred to (and sometimes updated) by the members".
            - Maybe it would be better to have a rather direct "updated count sort".
        - It was easy to imitate and participate because the conversation was already taking place.
- After that[/villagepump/2022/03/03](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/2022/03/03).
    - Unnamed Camp's psychological hurdle is overcome.
    - flow of this time
        - View Most Viewed
        - There's a page where they're conversing.
        - Comments.
        - We're going to look at a lot of things.
        - See statements to the effect that hurdles are necessary for intellectual production.
        - Then you have to experience that hurdle, and I'm going to try.
        - I'm blown away.
