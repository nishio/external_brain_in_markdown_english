Never heard of it" is "narrowly observable."
Successful testing does not mean absence of bugs
"Never heard of it" does not mean "it doesn't exist."
If someone says "X exists" and I think "I've never heard of it", I assume it does and search for it, etc.
    - We never assume that "X must not exist."
- Mostly, you'll learn of the existence of something you didn't know existed before.
- I think, "I have been too narrow in my observation."
- This happens on a daily basis.
- The obvious fact is that my scope of observation is small.
    - And if it weren't for my wife, no matter how popular BTS became worldwide, it wouldn't have caught my antennae.
    - If I hadn't participated in the well, I wouldn't have learned to read collapsed letters,
    - TRPG Microscope also didn't hang on my antenna, and even if it did, I didn't invite people to play with me.
