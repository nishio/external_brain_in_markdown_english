title: "Advantages of Diagramming on the iPad"
---

iPad + Apple Pencil to illustrate, now.
- Easy color-coding without carrying around a lot of pens
- Infinite paper.
- Able to copy and paste drawn diagrams
Especially the third one, replacing paper is [[high cost]].

I used to achieve this by drawing on a whiteboard, taking a picture, rewriting it, and taking another picture, but then I'd have to erase the previous diagram so I'd have trouble when I wanted to correct it.

- [[diagrammatic thinking]]

My brain sometimes perceives changes in the system in terms of movement, and when I try to express this in a still image on paper, it tends to take the form of multiple nearly identical diagrams with differences. It was expensive to do that on paper.
