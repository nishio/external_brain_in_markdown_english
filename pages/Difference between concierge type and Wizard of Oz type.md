The difference between the two [[MVP]] ([[Minimum Viable Product]]) methods, the "concierge type" and the "Wizard of Oz type," is briefly explained.

- [[concierge type]]
    - A method in which a human being ([[concierge]]) actually interacts with the customer, understands the user needs, and then manually provides the service.
    - Through careful human response, the needs of users are explored, and from the results, points to be automated and commercialized are found.

- [[Wizard of Oz type]]
    - A method that appears to be an automated product or service but hides from the user that it is actually operated manually by a human behind the scenes.
    - This will verify the effectiveness of the product by observing user reactions while behaving like an actual automated product.

The difference between the two lies in "whether the user is aware of the presence of a human being. The concierge type is clearly a human service, while the Wizard of Oz type makes it appear as if the system is operating automatically.
