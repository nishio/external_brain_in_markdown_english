- Left, comparing in-house knowledge with knowledge that is distributed outside the company to an unspecified number of people, [[in-house knowledge]] is more valuable, [[fallacy]].
    - Narrow vision and lack of [[relativization]] of viewpoints
    - It is funny that you compare internal "[[Knowledge that is]] not distributed to an unspecified number of people." with external "knowledge that is distributed to an unspecified number of people.
- Right, actually there are many more companies than the one you belong to.
    - Of course there is "unspecified knowledge that is not distributed to the general public" within those companies.
- Bias to assume that what is not observable does not exist
- I know this sounds obvious if you think about it for a minute, but there seems to be a disease that prevents us from understanding these obvious things.
- I think it has been repeatedly referred to as a type of typical [[big business disease]].
