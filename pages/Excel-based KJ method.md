title: "Excel-based KJ method"
---

- [[Jun Kuikei]] developed this [[Intellectual Production]] with the essence of KJ method without knowing [[KJ method]].
- This story got me thinking about the KJ-method without sticky notes: [[KJ-method in a text editor]].

Specific Methods
- Excel rows correspond to stickies in the KJ method
- Cut and paste up and down to move
    - KJ legal is where it is placed according to the "likely relationship" that is not verbalized here.
- Each row is an Excel cell with various characteristics.
        - [[grounded theory]] associated with
            - [[property]] and [[dimension]] ([[key]] and [[value]])
- Writing properties on the horizontal axis is equivalent to making a light template
    - For example, 5W1H.
- Attributes broken down by templates are attached to stickies drawn by the KJ method.
    - [[information content bias]] is visualized
- Excel's filter function can be used to narrow down the search ← this is a great place to start
