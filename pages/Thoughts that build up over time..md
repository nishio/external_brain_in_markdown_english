title: "Thoughts that build up over time."
---

Like stalactites, drops of water fall and accumulate over time.

A living human brain has difficulty recalling what it thought a year ago.
- So those who do not externalize their brains will never experience it.
    - Externalization = keeping a journal, keeping a research notebook, writing thoughts in Scrapbox
- It is important that it is easy to find relevant topics from the past
    - People who write in their diaries but do not read them back.
        - Designs such as [[10-Year Diary]], which naturally brings the diary of a year ago into view.
    - Scrapbox Link
    - In 2023, [[vector search]] is what we think of now.
