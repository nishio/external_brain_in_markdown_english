title: "person who hangs a spider's thread"
---

We talked about how when one person feels that another person X is intellectually inferior to him, there are two kinds of people: person A who drops "[[spider silk]]" and person B who rejects X.
Person A, who hangs the line, is also like, "Oh, you fell in, I can't help it," and is not so strongly enthusiastic about pulling up, but there is a big difference between hanging the line and not hanging the line.

Personally, I see the A's hanging by a thread as more likely to enjoy life. There is the possibility of "Unexpected Success. Those who are refusing from the beginning have closed the "door of possibility" for themselves.

After writing this, I read the original version of [[spider silk]] and realized. When I wrote the above, I thought "A=[[Buddha]]" and "X=[[Kandata]]". However, "A/B=Kandata" and "X=many people following from below" were more appropriate.

In the first place, Buddha is working to "[[save]] many sentient beings," which is necessarily A. When Khandata saw the multitude that followed him from below, he should have felt A, saying, "This will save a lot of people. Then he could have been in the same situation as Buddha. However, in the story, he behaved as B. By doing so, he could no longer reach the same state of being as Buddha, and he fell down.
