I think it's a good thing that there are so many people who say "If you don't like it, don't look at it.

>  "If you don't like it, don't look at it" doesn't work when people say they don't want to look at it, but they don't want to be forced to look at it.

They lack the imagination to wonder if the opinions they express now are not "unwilling to see" for someone else.

Do you delete it as you are told? Or would you block it and say, "If you don't like it, don't look at it"? If you take the latter, you are being very self-contradictory, aren't you?
