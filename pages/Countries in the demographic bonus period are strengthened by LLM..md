Countries in the [[demographic bonus]] period are strengthened by [LLM
> [@rkmt](https://twitter.com/rkmt/status/1645104537626365952): I have a feeling that a country in a demographic bonus period would be tremendous if enhanced by LLM... I wonder where, like Indonesia? Countries where [[educational opportunities]] are not well developed but have a large number of young people will also see their talents (≒groundwork*education) flourish with AI education. Since the rate of occurrence of talent (genetics) is a certain percentage of the population, it will be enhanced by AI education....

If LLMs are to fill this gap, the level of education in a country will be determined by how good the LLMs are at the language.
