title: "Jigsaw Puzzle Parable"

You can only have one jigsaw piece at a time.
If you try to treat all the pieces equally, you will make no progress.
#TaskManagement

When there is more than one person, try to give everyone something equally.
And because of the binding "it has to be [[equality]]," not much is given.
The [[Small Start]] method of "giving to a few first" is blocked.
