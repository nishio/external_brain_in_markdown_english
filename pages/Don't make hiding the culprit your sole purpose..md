> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1966166368631529762) [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1966166368631529762) Regarding the clear maddening mistake in [[line of reasoning]], if there are people with sufficiently high logical thinking ability on the detective side and the atmosphere is favorable to the disclosure of information, the criminal who is inconvenienced by the disclosure of information will be at a great disadvantage because he or she will be suspected even if he or she resists the disclosure of information. If the killer is not comfortable with the disclosure of information, he/she will be suspected even if he/she resists the disclosure of information, so the killer is essentially at a great disadvantage, and therefore, the only way to achieve balance is to prevent the sharing of information through rules and flavors.

I think we're pretty much on the same page here. I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not, but I'm not sure.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1966300216795279776) I see, indeed! Just as there is often another objective on the detective's side besides "finding the culprit", if there is another objective on the culprit's side besides "not being revealed as the culprit", then the game does not end even if the culprit is found during game time.

> [elkurin_games](https://x.com/elkurin_games/status/1966406819305439595) I don't think it's very interesting if a completely different sub-goal is attached to it, but the culprits of MADAMIS usually have a big goal they want to achieve ahead of the crime, and the way to achieve it tends to be "not to be found out as the culprit". If there is another way to achieve the goal, the person will be motivated to work hard not to be found out as the culprit.

> [elkurin_games](https://x.com/elkurin_games/status/1966426633021366637) I guess we'll have to talk about whether this is really a Murderer's Mystery, though.
