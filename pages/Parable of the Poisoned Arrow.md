title: "Parable of the Poisoned Arrow"
---

- Someone was hit by a poisoned arrow and I am trying to cure him.
- If a person struck by a poisoned arrow prioritizes getting the answer to "who struck this poisoned arrow" over treatment, he or she will die before getting the answer.
- Some questions serve a purpose to answer and others do not.
- [[Not all questions need to be answered]].

- pragmatism] ideas that do not value answers to unhelpful questions.
- I said [[Buddha]].
