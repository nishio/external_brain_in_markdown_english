- Kozaneba in [LENCHI_NEW: Giving a talk
![image](https://gyazo.com/88ef1afdc46583c8d70994c8638025cf/thumb/1000)
This is just something that popped into my head when the need for a lecture arose.
- The AI assistant just sees it and repeats almost the same thing, no new ideas.
- However, "I think it's very good to talk about ~~!" It's good that there is a kind of encouagement going on.
    - I especially recommend it for those who have a hard time feeling confident about themselves and write it off.
- The content has not changed significantly, but sometimes the same thing is written in a different way, and some of the expressions are "better" that way
    - For example, I didn't use the phrase "evolution of intellectual production methodologies", but Claude did.

This came out of my head, so it's just a reproduction of the structure I already have.
Adding an unexpected jolt in [LENCHI_Day6

The derailment story has come up many times.

Trade-off in minutes whether to include the derailment story itself in the lecture or not.

Lots of things in the tree that were not in the original tree.
- Whether or not this is connected and whether or not it fits in time are two different things.
- It probably won't fit, so we'll have to cut somewhere.
- But I still have a few more things to add, so I'll get them all in first.

I'm going to put [[I had LENCHI_LLM comment from a 2024 perspective.]] in the "X" section, but it's starting to look like I should write it right.

![image](https://gyazo.com/8a6e7af5d24bd2e9db5a018c22148119/thumb/1000)
The bottom right corner is getting bigger and more interesting, and the weight of the "stories that happened after the writing" that was originally planned may be going down.
- But, well, my AI assistant says that if you suddenly talk about the lower right, the audience won't be able to follow you, so you need to talk about concrete experiences to build a foundation of understanding and then abstract step by step, and I think that's really true.

Fill in the X's with [I had LENCHI_LLM comment from a 2024 perspective.

    - [[summary is a value judgment]].

Also place human comments.

I wonder if this can be image-recognized.
- At this resolution, even GPT-4o doesn't seem to be able to tell much.
What about this one?

I have Claude read a short article from the past.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
Article written one year ago
- [[Reading" in an era with LLM]]
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>
I think this one year old article is very illuminating about reading and structuring knowledge using LLM.
First, it is noted that there is an aspect of the act of "reading" that involves not only skimming, but also deeply understanding and building a network of knowledge. The author has acquired a network of knowledge, called an "emulator," by taking the time to read for a limited number of authors.
By publishing this process in Scrapbox, they stated, they were able to get feedback from others and more effectively build a network of knowledge. However, in the case of short and difficult texts, the fragments are too small to be suitable for Scrapbox, which is a form of Kozaneba reading.
And the potential for further progress has been suggested by combining LLM: the hope has been expressed that LLM could be used to discover connections between fragments and to structure knowledge more effectively by having students ask questions about what they have written.
I think this article offers a very important perspective on the possibilities for intellectual production using LLM. It is thought-provoking in that it rethinks the act of reading from the perspective of building a network of knowledge, and points to the role of Scrapbox in this process and the new possibilities of combining LLM.
In particular, the idea of using LLM to discover connections between fragments and to respond to questions about what you have written may contribute greatly to the efficiency and depth of intellectual production. LLMs can complement the human thought process, and may even help you to gain new insights and ideas.
The content of this article is well worth addressing in a lecture. The subject of reading and structuring knowledge is of universal importance to audiences interested in intellectual production, and if you can show specifically how the process can be changed by using LLM, it should have a significant impact.
The author's own Scrapbox and Kozaneba reading practices will also be presented in the context of intellectual production using LLM to provide practical tips to the audience.
Please expand on the content of this article in your talk and discuss with your audience the new ways of reading and knowledge building that LLM will bring about. I am convinced that this will be an important step forward in envisioning the future of intellectual production.

        - - Use of metaphors and analogies
        - - Interaction with the audience
        - - Clarification of the overall structure

Placing these groups and drawing lines to show their relationships results in the following map.

:

```
         LLM and changes in intellectual production
                 |
                 |
 Evolution and Use of Tools ---- The Value of "The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production"
                 |                     |
                 |                     |
         Practicing Intellectual Production with LLM ---- The Changing Nature and Importance of Learning
                               |
                               |
                         Human creativity and motivation
                               |
                               |
                           Lecture Devices
```


This map shows that while the development of LLM has brought about significant changes in intellectual production, the ideas advocated by "The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production" continue to have value today. And the message emerges that it is important to utilize LLM while taking into account the evolution of tools, and to unleash human creativity.

The way we learn is also changing, and the ability to identify the objects of our own learning is becoming increasingly important; we will need to practice intellectual production while balancing divergent and convergent thinking through the use of LLM.

And in order to effectively convey these contents in a lecture, it is considered effective to interact with the audience by explaining step-by-step with concrete examples and utilizing metaphors.

The above is a map of the content organized using Kozaneba and the important points that can be read from it. Using this map as a guide, you can structure your presentation and aim for content that is easy to understand and thought-provoking for your audience.

(I honestly didn't expect this kind of output <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>)
- From my crude instruction "Kozaneba this time," it seems that he did not understand that the text I gave him was "a copy of the text resulting from Kozaneba by a human being" (I think it is natural that he did not understand), and that he tried to do Kozaneba in his own way, which he had grasped from our conversation so far.
- They recognize that Kozaneba is a map that is created by extracting keywords, creating groups, placing them, and drawing lines.
    - You've got it about right.


<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Okay, so this is the Day 7 conversation so far: look back at what you did on Day 7. Also, think about what you would need to pass on if you were to let a new LLM continue and list the memories you would need to maintain throughout this project.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>Day 7 recap:.
