The [[structure that discards the individual human being]] is brought about by [[the observer who is not interested in human beings]].

- [After seeing the over-abundance of graduates at the Boost Conference in 2009, I personally suggested that the conference should stop inviting old graduates like myself and invite more recent graduates who are closer in age to the current students, but my suggestion was not heeded. I wondered why.

Yesterday, I wrote "[[Don't let others take on the risks you didn't take on yourself]]" and after hearing the positive response to it, I thought, "Maybe this is my role. I was asked to write a one-page article on "Unexplored as a network formation system" in 2011, and the one I thought I should write the most was "[[Unexplored as a network formation system]]". What I have been doing has not changed much since then. In other words, "seeing structure without individual people" is easily brought about by observers who are not so interested in people or individual projects.
