title: "Lots of toys in a box"
---

There are people who feel like they [[have]] a lot of [[toys]] in [[a box]], but they don't take them out and [[play with them]], and they [[only]] know the [[name]] of that box.

Similar situation
- Buying plastic models and not assembling them
- Buy the book, don't read it

relevance
- [abstract and concrete
        - [[abstract]] [[name of box]] instead of [[concrete]] [[contents]].
    - [[They put it in a jar and mix it up.]]
    - > [[I can't speak to "what's in this box?"]]
    - [[Ready to use when needed]]
        - [[It's as if there's nothing you can't take out when you need it.]]
            - [[take out]]
    - [[Wealth is not how much you have, but how much you can give]]
    - If you can't get it out of the box, you can't give it to them.
    - Wisdom? is...
        - The phrase "not whether you have..."
            - Wisdom? Knowledge? It's not about having a book written about
            - It's not about knowing the names of abstract concepts.
        - whenever necessary
            - What is necessary?
            - For the problem you want to solve now
        - Take out concepts that are useful in solving the problem.
        - Can be used
            - A variant of "use" is "give to others."

relevance
    - [[The disease of saying abstract things and thinking you know what you're talking about.]]
