Showing one's face is bad culture
> [hikalium](https://twitter.com/hikalium/status/1731247414273810820), I think that [[showing one's face]] is [[bad culture]] and not kind to [[non-human]] beings. (And also promotes [[lookism]].) (But I also understand that this opinion is too much in the current society.)
