title: "Difficulty does not mean impossible, but that there is room for ingenuity"
---

I wrote it casually, but it sounded like a quote, so I cut it out.
Original statement [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1050200418439974912)
> There are no circumstances unique to writing, it is just that "intellectual production is difficult to estimate in advance" just like any other task. It is essentially the same as software development or research management. And "difficult" in "difficult to estimate" is not "impossible" but "open to improvement through ingenuity."

Context: [[Writing and Scheduling]].

- [[Difficulty]] means that there is [[room for ingenuity]], not [[impossible]].

relevance
- > Difficult is defined as taking an extra 30 minutes longer than easy, and impossible is defined as taking an extra 30 minutes longer than difficult.
    - I'm told it's the motto of the U.S. Marine Corps, but I don't know the source.
    - See more at: [[impossible]].
