Posting of experience when I got used to it 2024-02-05
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1754181219263373647) It's easy to figure out when you use it, and I don't know what can only be done with Cursor and what can be done with [[Github Copilot]], so I said, " I didn't make a post saying "You can do this with Cursor! I didn't post this post, but the other day at an engineering party, the person I was talking to didn't know about Cursor, so I thought I'd post it here.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1754181657597550818) When I pasted a description of a service written in React JSX (mostly HTML) into README.md and told it to "mark it down", it was approximately correct. It turned out to be markdown.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1754181967086833831) I did that by putting up a list of links written in Scrapbox notation and "make it a in ul".

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1754182638099956081) I had written the sample data directly to tsx and tried to bundle it into a data file. I did the first one myself and then "filled in this file as a reference" and the rest were filled in. In addition, he also did the work of undoing the &quot that I forgot to do the first time I did it.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1754183737586467251) If you look closely, you say "in front of the >" but it's a line break later, I didn't notice. In other words, it wasn't important.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1754184180588781763) "Make it 3 columns" got me 3 columns.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1754184699629682826) I changed the one that was implemented with divs to span only at the beginning and "make it all span" made it all span.

With Cursor, I can have code written based on the latest documentation, and it is easy to integrate with the development environment.  twitter.com/rice_vc/status...

> [rice_vc](https://twitter.com/rice_vc/status/1717409715490378132) Cursor is free, but you can use GPT-4 Assistant for up to 50 cases and 3.5 for up to 200 cases per month, and the operation is very intuitive and familiar.

> [gijigae](https://twitter.com/gijigae/status/1717540315043889656/photo/1) Cursor is a tool that I recommend to everyone who wants to know about the possibilities of AI, not just developers. one of the features that Cursor has is that you can see AI can refer to files in conversation with the AI. How to create a mind map (MM), and save it to generate_mindmap.md,

> [gijigae](https://twitter.com/gijigae/status/1717570083248283845) Cursor can also create a vector database (VectorDB) instantly with the data on that page by simply passing a URL. Originally intended for development documents, but it can be applied to study materials as well. Here's a shot of Berkeley's machine learning materials (Data 8) sucked up to create and ask questions about VectorDB ↓. It's too amazing!
