Cost of retaining [[difficult-to-market]] human resources

If you want to secure [[agility]] to use difficult-to-market resources when you need them, you need to pay [[Lent]].
- Unconfirmed if the use of the word "rent" is correct.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - You can't buy [[non-marketable]] things in the marketplace.

I recall a related story.
> [fukkyy](https://twitter.com/fukkyy/status/1723680222971920893/history) As mentioned, LayerX does not make hiring decisions based on urgency. We believe that it is rare to hire people who can make discontinuous changes to the business, and that it is almost impossible to hire people at a time that is convenient for us.
- [[No one can ever hire scarce talent at a convenient time.]]
    - [[Convenient timing]]
- [[marketable skills are weak skills]].
