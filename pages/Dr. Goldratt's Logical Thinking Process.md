- Dr. Goldratt's Logical Thinking Process - Create the strongest company with [[TOC]]! #Japanese title changed
- Original title: Goldratt's Theory of Constraints - A Systems Approach to Continuous Improvement
    - Goldratt's Theory of Constraints - a [[systems thinking]] approach to continuous improvement
- [Amazon](http://amzn.to/2wUHOxR)

    - One of the few decent books that explains the specific methodology of [[constraint theory]] (TOC), but the title is odd.
    - [[constraints]] includes [[policy constraints]] (= human-created constraints) as well as [physical restraints
    - [[Conflict Resolution Diagram]] is a framework used specifically for human [resolving disagreements
    - Even if both parties are working toward the same ideal, different conclusions can be drawn due to [Different observation ranges
    - see  [[limited rationality]]

- Understanding the Current Situation
    - status quo analysis tree
    - Finding Constraints
    - The fundamental concept of TOC is that it is important to find bottlenecks, rate-limiting steps, and improve them.
    - In other words, we think it's important to find one "place to change."
- Create Ideas
    - Conflict Resolution Diagram
    - In many cases, there is some kind of conflict, and we're not working toward a resolution.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I don't think it's necessarily a conflict between people.
    - Resolve by clarifying the implicit hypothesis behind it.
