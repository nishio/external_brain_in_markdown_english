> We attempt to explain why [[Hours.]] is taken to be linear, progressing in a straight line, using the following figurative diagram.
> In the process model, time is created by arising into [[implicit implication]] (implying). Figure 1 on the next page shows this movement (theta diagram).
> If we assume a linear time axis, A and B are the same point in time. However, the actual arising is occurring from A through B as in the writing of theta, i.e., intersecting with the future and the past (in the implicit implication).
> Gendlin points out that when this sequence of occurrences continues uninterrupted, the theta diagram becomes a stripe and can be viewed as a linear time axis (see Figure 2). In this way, we try to see time as linear, when in fact, as in the theta diagram above, it is time that intersects (and changes) with the future and the past.

[[Brain and Time]]

It's interesting that you have a philosophy background but also do clinical psychology in terms of combining fields.
- I was digging for the "verbalizing what hasn't been verbalized yet" part, but then the time thing came up.
