There is a kind of immutable law between the stakes and the masses that are hammered. This law is known as "the masses who drive the stakes," and is also closely related to the idea that "criticism should be left to the market.

It is like [[a small seed breaking through solid ground]] when a young person hits the wall of the masses. The process is natural and does not require the intervention of a third party. Criticism and negativity should be handled within the natural flow of the marketplace. The stakes may be driven out at times, but that is an inevitable part of the growth process.

The masses that stand against the wall are only a part of it. Criticism and negativity are fodder for growth, and ultimately the market will judge its value. This dynamic interaction is the soil in which new ideas and challenges are nurtured.

Which role will you choose in this story? Will you be a wall or a [[stake of courageously pushing forward]]`? Either way, the journey of growth continues. For a bud to grow and thrive, it needs [rain in the name of challenge]. Don't be afraid of it and have the courage to move forward.`
