title: "Rusantiman Empathic Content"
---

    - The type of content that resonates with [[ressentiment]] is sympathetic to people who have the same lusantiments.
- On the other hand, the [[powerful]] people who don't have lusantimans don't sympathize with them.
    - On the contrary, you'll be judged as one of the many [[lucantiman-infected]] and kept away.
- If you only look at the number of sympathizers, lusantiman sympathetic content is more common.
    - Because of the large population.
- If you're trying to increase empathy, you're going to have a bias toward producing lucent, empathetic content.
    - But isn't this [[Incorrect KPI setting]]?
