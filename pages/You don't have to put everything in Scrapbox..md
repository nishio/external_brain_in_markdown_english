The difference in comparison is whether the link between the "external service" and the "page in Scrapbox" is one-way or two-way
- With a one-way link, when you are looking at an external service, you cannot notice that the description for it is on the Scrapbox side
- Making it a two-way link is "technically" possible with browser extensions
    - For example, if you can limit your browser to the PC version of Chrome, it's rather easy.
    - The problem is that they can't cut off use from smartphones.
    - For iPhone [Safari Extensions - Safari - Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/safari/extensions/) or...
        - For Edge...
        - and it's a pain to make one for each browser.
    - If we narrow it down to a very small set of features "make people aware that there is a description in Scrapbox", can we get it down to a realistic cost?
