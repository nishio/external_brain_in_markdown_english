title: "knowledge osmosis"

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1890780657518850258) Each person has a different appropriate concentration, and if a person is exposed to information that is too dense for him or her, it seems that he or she cannot absorb the knowledge by osmosis.

I honestly thought the analogy of "[[osmotic pressure]] of [[knowledge]]" was too subtle, but when I left it alone, it kind of got buzzed about.
- (so it was still subtle and thinner than usual.)
- That said, it's esprit de corps to get involved in the "nice and salty" thing.
