I saw what I wrote in May 2017 and corrected it myself in August 2018.

Written in May 2017

That's what I thought when I saw it in August 2018.
- I put a very long sentence in the title [[Effective use of margins when creating text-only pages in Scrapbox]] or something like that.
- But I don't think this is a very good stance to take.
- The title is a summary and an eye catcher, so it is better to write a shorter, more concise description of the part that moved you the most.
- Make it a title that your future self will think, "Sounds interesting, let's read it.
    - I don't mean to exaggerate the content and make it a fishing title.
- With a title like the tasteless `20180101 memo', it's hard to get motivated to read it again.
    - I only read it when I get a hit from a search.
    - If you can't think of a good title, it is better to write first even with such a title, good titles will come to you later

- I clicked on the ref to see what was at the end of the ref and it was Amazon.
    - And the URL is shortened to t.co, so you can't tell what it is until you follow it, which is not good!
    - Recently, I've been doing `[Amazon URL]` and stating that the link is to Amazon.
- To begin with, I just checked and there are multiple pages in the project that link to "Serendipity of Random Reading".
    - It should have been a link within Scrapbox, not an external link.
    - Then those pages would have connected on their own.
- Let's put the link to Amazon on the "Serendipity of Random Reading" page.

- It's important to post images.
- Keywords in the title should be chopped and linked.
- I made a link to `Shihiko Toyama` in the author's name and it connected to other pages.
    - I was able to discover that a page exists that mentions another book by the same author, "Organizing Thoughts."

- Older ones had the link separately at the end, but the ones that appear in the text will be made into a link in the text.
- The link outside the text was changed to `#quick read

- Loose keywords such as "memory" and "understanding" were also made into links.
    - It's hard for humans to notice when something that should be linked wasn't.
    - It's easy for humans to ignore when something superfluous is linked to it.
    - Seemingly superfluous items may actually be useful, leading to the discovery of unexpected connections

- It is a simple page with two lines of text and one tag, but it seems to have become very interesting.
