- Advance Release of Materials
    - I didn't.
    - Published after the fact
    - Q: Why don't you do advance release of materials?
        - It's not that I don't have a strong policy against doing it.
        - Sometimes it's not completed until the last minute.
        - Most people won't read it even if it's published in advance, and I'll present it assuming no one has read it.
        - There was a time when I used to prepare a story for an announcement and think, "I don't want to spoil it if people see it before I do." But now, more than 10 years later, looking back and thinking about it, that story is not interesting, and the time spent preparing the story should be used more to improve the content.
- Make the material readable and understandable later.
    - Strongly aware of
    - The maximum number of people listening to my presentation at one time so far is 900, and the number of views of my published material is 56,000.
    - People who hear the presentation can introduce it to others.
    - People who heard the presentation can review it.
- Create detailed documentation
    - If I have time to spare, I do so. Indicate the source paper, link to references, supplement with footnotes, etc.
        - Not intended to be viewed at the time of presentation.
    - However, for the purpose of "conveying important content in a limited amount of time," it needs to be crisp so that important items stand out
- Presentation materials are made in PowerPoint / Keynote
    - Why not use Gist or other "you can present in JS in the browser" types?
    - Because they use "[presenter tool](https://www.microsoft.com/ja-jp/atlife/tips/archive/office/tips/108.aspx)."
    - So why use [[Presenter Tools]]?
    - There's also time management, knowing how many pages you have left, pacing, etc.
    - I think the most important thing is "see the next slide before you turn it over."
    - Instead of having a slide that says, "X is Y," and then speaking, "X is Y," before flipping it over, I want to say, "What do you think X is?" and then take a breath before turning it over and saying, "X is Y.
- Keep your presentation on time.
    - Of course, that is what we are aiming for.
    - Presenter Tool Useful
- Change what you say based on the audience's reaction.
    - Of course.
    - If the audience looks at you and pouts, compensate for your explanation.
    - Inevitably, you will be facing the audience, so you will look better than those who talk while looking at slides or screens only.
- I'll even do a presentation on something I don't know if I think it's necessary.
    - Creating presentation materials is a great learning experience.
    - In cases where it is faster for me to do the research than for the audience to do it themselves, what I do is create customer value.
    - But, well, of course, the man-hours involved are orders of magnitude more, so we don't take it so casually.

Much has changed since 2017.
- A: Materials are open to the public from the process of creation unless there are circumstances that prevent them from being made public.
- B: Make the material readable and understandable later.
    - This continues
- C: Presentation materials are made in Scrapbox
    - I've come to believe that's basically the better way to accomplish B.
- D: I no longer use the presenter tool.
- E: Change what you say based on the audience's reaction
- F: I will do presentations about things I don't know if I feel I need to.
