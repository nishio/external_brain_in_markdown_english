title: 'When I point out a problem, they say, "You do it."'
---

I thought I saw a conversation about how there is an environment where if you point out a problem, you are told "you do it" and it's not desirable.

What is the next action on your part in a situation where you point out a problem and your supervisor or others say "you do it" in response.
- Whining, "It's not nice to say, 'You do it,'" is not an action that improves things.

Depends on whether or not I want to take remedial action on the issue.
- If you want to do it
    - Don't secure evidence that "Boss X told me to do this."
    - For those who are in a weaker position than that X, "I'm taking instructions from X," as a rationale for their actions.
    - In parallel, summarize the results obtained from the work, etc., and then tell "people who are not weaker than X" who can benefit from it, "X instructed me to do this, and I thought you might be interested, so I shared the information with you," to elicit positive words of support, etc., which are then summarized and fed back to X. If X tells them to stop, tell them, "I have already shared the information with these people, so they will also share the fact that we have decided to stop at your direction.
- If you don't want to do it
    - You do it." "I'm not the right person for the job."
    - The reason for not being suitable is usually "lack of authority," so I'd explain and say, "Grant the authority.
    - If it's just an idea and you're saying, "You do it," it's not authorizing and it's going to stand.
    - This would be troublesome if the authorization is granted...

- [[You do it.]]
- [[dissatisfaction]]
