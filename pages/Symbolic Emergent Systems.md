>  From "[[Symbolic Grounding Problem]]" to "[Symbolic Emergence Problem
>  New Systems Theory in the Generative AI Era
>  How is the meaning of symbols (language) formed? This is a new field of study in which cutting-edge AI and robotics researchers and leading researchers in the humanities and social sciences gather to explore this fundamental question. This is the first collection of keywords that will help us to foresee the coming symbiotic society with generative AI.
