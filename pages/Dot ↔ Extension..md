title: "Dot ↔ Extension."
---

[[Connecting the Dots]] in the sense of "dots" and "[[extension of a straight line]]" in the sense of "action as an extension of the past" are opposing concepts
- We hit dots that are not connected to anything at this point in time, and when we look back over time, we find the connection.
- Extend the extension from the present time and act on the extension.
    - This is connected first, no connection is made later.

There is a positive meaning to "[making a leap (e.g. in logic)" that is not connected to the current [[context]].
