<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The following information about Ryuichi Sakamoto's relationship with Yukito Emorya at NAM can be gleaned from the text.
- In June 2000, Yukito Emorya launched NAM ([[New Associationist Movement]]), a "movement against the state and capital" in Osaka.
- Ryuichi Sakamoto, along with Yukito Karatani and others, contributed to "NAM Generation" (2001), a sequel-like book to NAM.
- NAM Generation]" is a sequel to "NAM Principles" and presents a more concrete concept of NAM than "NAM Principles.
- For example, NAM's "free school concept" is discussed in concrete terms. The author is interested in "what kind of answers to education will be offered by Yukito Emaya, [[Akira Asada]], and the world-class Ryuichi Sakamoto, who have been leading postwar Japanese thought (for better or worse?) with overwhelming power.

From the above, it can be inferred that Ryuichi Sakamoto was one of the core members of NAM, which was led by Yukito Karatani, and that he was involved in the process of materializing the NAM philosophy. It can be inferred that Sakamoto, a well-known artist, may have played a role in raising the profile of NAM in society by being named to the organization.
