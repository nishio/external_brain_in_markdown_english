title: "Not chasing cash flow"
---

    - [Not having to chase [[short-term]] Cash Flow is a business [[advantage]].
    - More options compared to competitors who have to chase cash flow.
    - Long-term optimization is possible.
    - Concepts of [[pay]] and [not paying
        - Can [[profit]] be taken or not?
- Tends to lead to the short-sighted idea that "no pay = bad."
    - Short-term and long-term perspectives are often overlooked
    - Investments that are profitable in the long run usually don't pay off in the short run.

The same composition is used for [[paper]] book count pressure in academia.
- It's hard to do research that takes 5 years when you have to write a paper that appeals to [[novelty (patentability)]] in 1 year

I remember writing about this story in [[Academia and the Trap of Differentiation]].
