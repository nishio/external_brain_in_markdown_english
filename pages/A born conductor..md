A born conductor.

It is the secret power of superiority that works, not by clever trickery, but by innate dominance. All men recognize and submit to the secret vitality of their innate authority without knowing why. These dominant spirits are kings by merit and lions by innate privilege. They win the hearts of others by the respect they inspire. When other qualities permit, these men are born to be the driving force of a nation. They achieve more with their gestures than others do with lengthy speeches.
