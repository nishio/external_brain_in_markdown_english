Just as there are links to English pages on Japanese blogs without notice, there may eventually be links to Chinese pages without notice.

Implicitly assumes that "readers can read English" despite knowing this to be factually incorrect
As for the Chinese language, it just doesn't feel right because there's no implicit assumption of that.

If you looks something interesting but the auto-translated English is not good enough to understand it, feel free to let me know at [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en). I'm very happy to spread my thought to non-Japanese readers.
