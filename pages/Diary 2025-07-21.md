> [198Q](https://x.com/198Q/status/1946894564398403888) Mr. Anno, just the fact that Team Mirai supporters have had the success experience of "getting out the vote and moving the vote" is too big a step!


> [m_datasci_](https://x.com/m_datasci_/status/1946957036270518590) I think the computational social science people should pool their money and data and write a number of papers on this election (with a lot of authorship), and even go so far as to create a consensus as a field and promote it in the media. I think it would be a good idea to write a number of papers on this election, and promote it in the media after building a consensus in the field.


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1946979488979706051) "What are you going to do after the election?" I had a conversation about climbing mountains, but I'm starting to feel like I'm going to have an accident in the mountains, so I might as well take it easy at home tomorrow and do "nothing"...


> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1947035605973745922) Team Mirai is now a national political party!
>
>  1.2 million votes, or roughly the requirement to have the support of more than 1% of the entire population. We are very pleased that so many of you support our ideas.
>
>  I would like to thank everyone who supported us in achieving this result!
>  >[team_mirai_stu](https://x.com/team_mirai_stu/status/1947035605973745922) [Report
>  Team Mirai was able to achieve its goal of becoming a national political party, which was set as a goal for this Upper House election!
>
>  We are very grateful to the more than one million people who cast their precious votes for Team Mirai.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1947086999891906560) Maybe the fact that I didn't write technical articles like "Technology Supporting Policy Pullic Utilization" is another reason why the counter to misinformation has weakened.
>  (Not written because they decided that they had enough awareness of the technical people and went around helping people make dashboards and short videos, etc.)
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1947088823802053020) I will write about it slowly in the future, but this case is also the world's most advanced case, and I think it should be well written and shared with the world because it was more successful than expected and caused unexpected troubles. I think it is an insight that should be shared with the world.



> [kasai_sinya](https://x.com/kasai_sinya/status/1947062337195876541) The only way to avoid making the topic of politics taboo is to stop acting like "different political parties and ideologies are irreconcilable enemies".
>
>  You and I are supporters of different parties, but we like the same idols, we're soccer fans, even though we don't have a favorite team, and the beer we drink together is delicious.
> [kasai_sinya](https://x.com/kasai_sinya/status/1947062823559049562) If there is no room for dialogue, there can be no search for compromise, and it becomes a blue or red confrontation.
> [kasai_sinya](https://x.com/kasai_sinya/status/1947064717811618108) Politics is important and no one can stay away from it, but it's not everything in life and not necessarily the top priority.
>  (Or rather, we accumulate political activities every day in order not to fall into the crisis of "politics is everything, top priority.")
> [kasai_sinya](https://x.com/kasai_sinya/status/1947066486939611523) "All political choices, top priority" situation, one typical example is a civil war.



> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1947091220167323660) I want to create a society where, when we look back in six years, we can say "I'm glad Team Mirai won a seat in Congress" and "I'm glad I voted in 2025.
>  >minowanowa: Is the election over?
>  To be honest, it was noisy.
>  No matter where you win, your life won't be the same tomorrow.
>  Well, if you vote, you might be able to at least avoid the worst.
>  In fact, it could even be the shortest to the worst.
>  In the end, you have to make your own way in life.
>  Let's keep up the good work tomorrow.




> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1947094693264904287) Team Mirai has become a national political party. Led by Takahiro Anno—who drew attention in the Tokyo gubernatorial race 2024 by making Broad Listening a central manifesto plank—the new party captured more than 1 percent of the vote in the 2025 House of Councillors election, securing national status. Going forward, it will be fascinating to see how they advance their pledge to channel public party subsidies into open-source digital public-goods development, offering an intriguing case study in public-goods funding methods.

It will be interesting to see how they proceed with their commitment to redirect public party subsidies to the development of open-source digital public goods and provide an interesting case study in how public goods are financed in the future.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1947274764831137848) Correction:
>  My previous post misstated the figures. Team Mirai actually received more than 2 percent of the votes cast(it is the condition), which corresponds to roughly 1 percent of the entire electorate. I regret the error.
>  Correction:
>  In my previous post, the numbers were incorrectly stated. Team Mirai actually received more than 2% of the vote (a requirement), which equates to about 1% of all voters. I regret the error.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1947212145051214150) "Top 10 Individual Vote Counts for Proportional Representation (final election results)
>  (10) Takahiro Yasuno (Chimi) 239,349"
>  Takahiro Yasuno, apparently 10th in individual votes!
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1947276788540821687) I didn't think anything of the individual vote ranking, Team Mirai as a whole has 1.24 million votes, and I said it doesn't matter which one you write because it has nothing to do with the number of seats, If I had told them to write down the names of the individuals, I don't think it would be surprising that they would be number one in the individual rankings.

> [blu3mo](https://x.com/blu3mo/status/1947086045478318255) We did it!
>  Team Mirai, founded by Takahiro Anno, has officially emerged as a national political party, making digital democracy the heart of its manifesto.
>  In the 2025 July House of Councillors election, the new party captured 2.6% of the vote—over 1.4 million ballots cast nationwide—securing its status as a recognized national party for the next six years.
>  This milestone also unlocks public party subsidies, which Team Mirai has pledged to dedicate to building open-source digital public goods that will help strengthen democracy in Japan.
>  The road ahead promises to be exciting!
> [team_mirai_jp](https://x.com/team_mirai_jp/status/1947086045478318255) Team Mirai's party leader, Takahiro Yasuno, was elected as a proportional representative in this Upper House election.
>  In addition, a party can become a national political party by obtaining 2% of the votes cast, which meets the requirements for a political party under the Public Election Law.
>
>  Thanks to all of our supporters, those who supported us with donations, and those who voted for us.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1947124291423887790) A little experience will help people see things with more resolution. Giving more people the opportunity to experience will move society as a whole in the direction of better observation and thinking.


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1947125614605115827) It's wonderful that the KPT (furikake) was done and made public during the Tokyo gubernatorial election, and that there is a movement to look back after the Upper House election without the management flagging it down. Bottom-up "kaizen" is progressing instead of top-down directives.
>  >ume_keizai: But Team Mirai supporters are calm. They are able to criticize, make suggestions, and move their hands rather than blindly believing in the KPT of this election, the flaws in the system, and what they can support but what they can't. I think one of the major factors that pushed Team Mirai up was the fact that the election was supported by such supporters. Now, I am going to start preparing for the KPT.
> [ume_keizai](https://x.com/ume_keizai/status/1947132865579553196) No, that was god awful. It was something that should be referenced in elections all over the country (I actually did).


> [BrandonKHill](https://x.com/BrandonKHill/status/1947152556003930329) When Mr. Anno was with our company, he said, "I have a connect-the-dots type of life. I don't make hard plans, I just do what interests me at the time, and eventually it all connects. I remember you saying that. Yes, that's right. It was all an experience for the betterment of Japan.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1947164310037573923) I realized an hour before the polls closed on the day before the polls closed, and in my haste, I cut the microphone video.

> [tsurezure_lab](https://x.com/tsurezure_lab/status/1947083032395145568) The following is a [[bump chart]]-style visualization of the [[voting party by age group]] from the Upper House Election Mouth Survey. The KMT is the top vote-getter among those in their 20s and younger, and the LP among those in their 30s and 40s. The population and voter turnout are added to form the public opinion, but it appears that a major structural change is underway, and it is the voting behavior of the 10-40s that is driving this change.

People pay attention to what they consider important.
Everyone has a different idea of what they think is important.
There are [[people with blurred boundaries between self and others]] who believe that others should be equally attentive to what they pay attention to and know well.


I saw the expression, "Elections are the only way to have a say in the future," and I thought, "I doubt that."
It's a minimum method that is secured for all voters at government expense, and from there, there are different pluses for each person.
