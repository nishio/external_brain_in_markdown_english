title: "Increased productivity of knowledge workers"

- [[Increased productivity]] of [[knowledge workers]] and self-actualization of the knowledge workers themselves can be achieved in the same way.
- [[Drucker.]]   [[Management in Practice]]

- Hold knowledge workers accountable themselves.
    - Are you making a contribution worthy of your compensation?
    - What contributions are being made?
    - What are you going to do to contribute?
    - This must be asked of the knowledge workers themselves.
    - Knowledge workers must be able to explain their contributions
- Enable knowledge workers to value their own contributions
    - Need to be able to perceive how their contributions have changed the company.
    - Need to know what to do.
        - The idea that [[R & D]] can't be evaluated is false #Managing R&D
        - What contributions have you made to change the company in the last couple of years?
        - What contribution will you make to change the company in the next couple of years?
    - You may not be able to measure it, but if you don't allow yourself to evaluate your contribution, you will not be moved to contribute.
- Let knowledge workers do what they are supposed to do.
    - incentive
    - willingness (e.g. to do something)
- For opportunities, put in place personnel who can turn opportunities into results.
    - First we must recognize the opportunity.
    - We have to assign people to those opportunities.
    - The assignee must be the right person.
    - The right people are those who can turn those opportunities into results
    - We must know who are the people who will deliver results.
    - We must know what is currently assigned to that personnel.
