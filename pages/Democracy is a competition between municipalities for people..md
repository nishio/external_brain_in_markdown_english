title: "Democracy is a competition between municipalities for people."

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1682105507253989376) [[election]] is not a requirement for [[democracy]], but "[[competitiveness]]" brought about by elections is a requirement for democracy. I thought that the competitiveness in Japan is not national politics but [[competition for human resources]] between [[municipality]], [[mobile voting]] by [[immigration]].

If you win, you are a programmer, if you lose, you are a debugger or inspector, but if you and the users keep making noise and getting in the way of implementation, your work will be delayed.
