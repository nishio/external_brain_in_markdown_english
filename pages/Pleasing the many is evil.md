title: "Pleasing the many is evil"

"Can't please everyone with your deeds and works? Then please a few people. It is evil to please the many."

Translation by Nishio of a fragment of a poem by [[Schiller]] quoted at the top of Klimt's [[Nuda Veritas]] (The Naked Truth).

It means that instead of trying to please the vague "many," we should try to please a few, more specific people.
