title: "Early adopters are not possible in all areas."
---

You can't be an [[early adopter]] in every field, so you have to be selective about which fields you are an early adopter in.
In areas where we didn't choose, we at least want to make sure we don't get laggarded.
When you make "being an early adopter" your identity, you're concerned about the areas where you're not an early adopter.
In [[times of]] rapid change, you can't be an early adopter in every field because the frequency of new things in all fields increases.
