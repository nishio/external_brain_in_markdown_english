[[Live by yourself ⇔ Live by killing yourself]].
- [[Live by killing yourself]].

- [[Not to be somebody's problem.]]

Ueki said, "I am now over 60 years old, and I don't know what I should do with my life from now on.

- [[Good projects don't come from ambition.]]

The way it is. The gift is to be. When the word "thank you" is returned for work, not "interesting" or "interesting".

Books, people, and workplaces that present "what is the purpose of working" and "how we should live our lives" have a certain gravitational pull, but is this something that should be presented by others?

- [[An obsession that there should be something to like.]]

- [[It begins when you begin.]]

- [[myself between myself and society.]]

- [[No need to despise complacency.]]
- [[Originating from oneself.]]
