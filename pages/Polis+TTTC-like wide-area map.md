title: "Polis+TTTC-like wide-area map"

[[Polis]] tends to split into two diagrams when there are more votes
This is because a linear [[PCA]] will not be able to clearly discriminate high-dimensional distributions no matter how hard you try.
Then take the data in that state and put it into [[UMAP]] in [[Talk to the City]].
What PCA cannot separate, UMAP can.
Just do [[TTTC-like cluster description generation]] on the separated ones.

I thought of the [[Map]] metaphor when the discussion on Polis came up.
- [[Polis with lots of data tend to be half-full]].

Revisit after the election as I don't feel like making it now.


- [[Visualizing Ideological Vectors]]
- You could try this.
