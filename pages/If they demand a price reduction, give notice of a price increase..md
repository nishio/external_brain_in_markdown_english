- If [[price reduction request]] is made, [[price hike warning]] will be given.

When I get a comment saying, "[[cut in price]] is not something I'm considering. He said that if I replied, "I'm going to raise the price next week," they would buy it immediately. A request for a lower price is just saying, "I want it! is just saying, "I want to buy it. So, I should make them "[[excuse]]" to buy. I am learning a lot.
