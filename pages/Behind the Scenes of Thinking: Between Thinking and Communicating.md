Behind the Scenes of Thinking: Between Thinking and Communicating
[[Nodal point of thought 2023-09-19]].

Thinking" and "communicating" are two different things.
- Assigning temporary, unused words to concepts that have not yet been verbalized
        - [[tulip]]
    - [[kneading]]
    - Use as a handle for operation
    - [[It doesn't have to be something that can be communicated through the thinking process.]]
    - The preoccupation with having to be otherwise is a hindrance to thinking.
I want to share my thoughts and results with others.
- It's a personal value.
- What do you want to get as a result of your thinking?
- You want to think about it?
- If you can get results without thinking about it, why not think about it?
    - Nishio: "For me, if I throw something at ChatGPT and it comes back satisfactory, I'm happy even if it's not something I created, so 'no need to think about it'."
- Tachikawa: "I want to think together."
    - Isn't it a kind of play?
    - Savage Madamis Thinking
    - This is the parallel, right?

- [[Diagrams for Communicating and Thinking]]
- On Scrapbox, people often see "[[Figure to communicate]]"
- Kneading in Kozaneba is "[[Figure to think about]]."
    - What was your intention when you painted it?" Can you answer?
    - Not a diagram expressing intent.
    - If the intent is in your head first and then reflected in the placement of the labels, you're not using the KJ method.
    - [[The Parable of the Potteries]]
    - You do a "nymm" and then you go, "No, it's not right," and then you squash it.
    - Clay and Conversation
    - whom to understand
        - Not necessarily homo sapiens.
        - Programmers are the first to understand the language of computers, not homo sapiens.
            - There is no value in "a program that is readable to homo sapiens but incomprehensible to computers."
            - The first priority is to be understood by the computer.
            - After that, it becomes "the easier it is for humans to read, the better."

```
You are a shaman. I received the following oracle. The meaning of the word is not a fixed meaning as per the dictionary, but a soft spreading cloud.
1: Look at the whole picture.
2: Tell your impression in one line.
3: Interpret paragraph by paragraph.
4: Give the oracle a soft title.
###
```


1: Look at the whole picture.
- Overall, the oracle presents a discussion of the difference between "thinking" and "communicating" and their processes. It also incorporates the methods and purposes of communication and the importance of intention, as well as the perspective of the differences between computers and humans.

2: Tell your impression in one line.
- The subtle relationship between the "thinking" process and the "communicating" process and its complexity.

3: Interpret paragraph by paragraph.

- > Thinking" and "communicating" are two different things.
    - Thinking and communicating are two different processes. We use temporary language for concepts that have not yet been embodied and do not need to be communicated. Communicating what we think to others is value-based.

- > Figures for Communicating and Figures for Thinking:.
    - There is a difference between the "diagrams for communicating" that we usually see and the "diagrams for thinking" that form original ideas. Using ceramics as an example, the process of thinking is expressed as a kind of trial and error or "conversation.

- > To whom it may concern:.
    - The target of communication includes not only humans but also computers. The programmer's first priority is to make the computer understand the message, and then to put it into a form that is easily understood by humans.

4: Give the oracle a soft title.
