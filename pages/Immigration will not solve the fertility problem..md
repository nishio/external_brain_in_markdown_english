title: "Immigration will not solve the fertility problem."

- About [Future Population of Japan
- It is felt that there is an atmosphere of having given up on measures to deal with Japan's [[declining birthrate]].
- Some believe that there is no need to be overly pessimistic about the fact that even if the population is halved, there will still be a population about the size of the United Kingdom or France.
- It has been pointed out that the birthrate is declining and the population may decrease to 20 million by 2100, requiring changes in the social structure, and [[immigration]] policies are also being discussed.

> [eraitencho](https://twitter.com/eraitencho/status/1763028506668302757) I think there is a mood of resignation about the declining birthrate, or perhaps a feeling that it is impossible for the Japanese people alone to manage the entire Japanese archipelago.

>  Too many Owari-mori have mistaken the need for change in social structure for the scale of owari as a single sovereign nation.

> [BoufrawFrodo2](https://twitter.com/BoufrawFrodo2/status/1763274859050930203) I feel that the projections are not good at all, and the reality is that the birthrate is already half what it is now, and if that is all it takes, then the birthrate is at the level of a great success.
>  The 60 million line will certainly fall below the 60 million mark by 2100, and if the current pace continues, even 20 million is doubtful.
>  Even if everyone born this year is alive in 2100, the number will not reach 20 million in 2100.
> [BoufrawFrodo2](https://twitter.com/BoufrawFrodo2/status/1763275425844007294) If a nation of this size today were to have less than 1/5th of its population in just 70 years, it would be a drastic change that would be so drastic that it would be no exaggeration to say that it would be a crisis of survival. It is not an exaggeration to say that it will be a drastic change, and it is not a change so fluent that we can say that it will require changes in the social structure.
> [BoufrawFrodo2](https://twitter.com/BoufrawFrodo2/status/1763276503591317519) People who say that we should bring in immigrants are totally blind. Where are they going to get the immigrants from? Even in the countries that are currently the largest source of immigrants on the planet, most of them already have a net reproduction rate of less than 1.
> [BoufrawFrodo2](https://twitter.com/BoufrawFrodo2/status/1763276994123633130) This is a sure prediction that I don't think will ever come off, but in 10 years, every country will be fighting over immigrants. I am sure of it.
>  There is no way that countries that are supplying immigrants now will be able to continue to do so on the same scale in 10 years.

(Just kidding.)
