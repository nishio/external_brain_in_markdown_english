title: "The results briefing is not a goal, but a start."
---

    - The idea that PM/OB/PG have repeatedly conveyed at [[unexplored]] events, not only to me but also to other PM/OB/PG.
    - [[results briefing]] is [[start]], not [[goal]].
- This is the starting point.
    - I've been running with a PM accompanying me for about 6 months to help out.
    - How I will run after this from the starting line of the results debriefing.
    - The same goes for [[writing (e.g., as a profession)]]. [[Publishing is not a goal, but a start]].
    - Software too [[it's not the end of the story.]], there are version upgrades.
    - Would the version upgrade in the book be an expanded and revised edition?
    - That makes me think that an expanded and revised edition could come out in three years...

- [[Start, not finish]]
relevance
    - [[People up to/from]]
