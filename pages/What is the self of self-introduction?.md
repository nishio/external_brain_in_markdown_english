title: "What is the self of self-introduction?"
---

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The definition of "self" in self-introduction is discussed from a variety of perspectives.
1. Mr. Nishio believes that the project he is currently working on is part of his "self," but the organization he belongs to is not his "self.
2. some consider genetic information, organizational affiliations, past accomplishments, and other information that helps us find relationships and commonalities with others to be part of the "self".
3. it has been pointed out that, from a Buddhist perspective, action, affiliation, and connection also define "self".
4. as a service to the audience, some include information such as hometown, past affiliations, and other information to find common acquaintances.
5. in some cases, some people believe that disclosing private aspects of the "self," such as hobbies and personal mottoes, can be helpful in building relationships.
6. On the other hand, it was pointed out that many people's ego is integrated with the organization they belong to, and the current situation was raised that some people cannot introduce themselves without the name of their company.
7. it was suggested that the content of self-introductions should be adjusted according to the situation through exchange of information and recognition with the other party.

I was pointed out that "I always talk about the project I am working on and don't talk about my affiliation, etc." When I introduced myself, I was asked, "What is the "self" that should be introduced in a self-introduction? In my mind, "what I am doing now" is the self and "the organization I belong to" is not the self.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1779317793806242296) Its very interesting to hear about the concept of self in Buddhism!

> [overlast](https://twitter.com/overlast/status/1779295356016382183) For areas where the person's self-introduction coincides with an introduction from a colleague or former colleague of the person, I thought it might be comfortable to include that in the self-introduction, whether it's from the organization or past performance. I thought it might not be a problem.

> [kmizu](https://twitter.com/kmizu/status/1779329381959364844) It depends, but I think it's okay to at least add a light private note.

> [nakayoshix](https://twitter.com/nakayoshix/status/1779412295065743410) I think this episode shows how many people in the world are integrated (ego) with the organization to which they belong. I feel that this episode shows how many people are united with the organization to which they belong in general.

At some career development seminars, they ask you to introduce yourself and your job without company name, and you are made aware of it when you freeze. On the other hand, this may not happen if the company is unknown.

> [sharakus](https://twitter.com/sharakus/status/1779381760331304972) You might want to use how you perceive and distinguish about others as a criterion. Since the criteria differ from person to person, it would be a good idea to exchange information with each other to align the items of recognition. For example, if a person gives his/her title, we should also give our title, and we should ask the other person about the label we have disclosed.
