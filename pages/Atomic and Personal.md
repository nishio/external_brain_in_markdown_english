- > A card written in Atomic, while having relationships with other cards, makes one complete description on its own.
- >  Intellectual production that takes place in an individual also has relationships with other intellectual production, but the individual alone produces one complete intellectual production.
- I really doubt that.
    - For example, a card written in Japanese is perceived as a meaningless list of symbols by those who cannot read Japanese.
        - Even if you can read Japanese, if you do not understand the meaning of each word used there, you will not understand what the author is trying to convey.
    - Personal Intellectual Production
        - Especially in intellectual production of [[Uncomfortable Drive]], a source of discomfort is necessary
        - Differences are unlikely to occur with our current selves (they occur with our old selves).
