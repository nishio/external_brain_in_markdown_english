prev  [[What is the problem with calling people resources?]]
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1833889044461494494) When there are two people, A who [[(self-)acknowledgement]] that he/she is R and B who self-identifies as not being R, A does not consider it problematic to call others R, but B feels [[discomfort]] to be called R. A does not consider it a problem to call others R, but B feels [[discomfort]] to be called R. I am beginning to think that "[[Resources]]" just happens to be substituted for "R" in "A".

- The overwhelming majority of people think they are a resource.

Thinking about it a little more, it seemed like a phenomenon where people who perceive themselves as "R" implicitly generalize that people are "R" and apply that to others.
    - [[Identification with oneself and others]]
- Just because you are "R" does not mean that others are "R."
    - Some are R's and some are not.
        - This is going to mean something a little different.
        - For someone who thinks "I am a valuable resource", "Mr. A is not a resource" is the equivalent of "Mr. A is worthless trash", so it is not fair.
- Uh, okay.
    - Even if "I think I am 'R,'" it does not necessarily mean that "others think I am 'R.
    - effect
    - You've got a double structure.
    - The subject of the content is not necessarily "[[myself]]".
    - I think there's also "people" and "the world."

- > Even if "I think 'I am R'", it does not mean that "others think 'I am R'".
    - When I wrote this and asked GPT-4o to translate it into English, he translated "myself" two different ways.
    - > Even if one thinks "I am R," it does not necessarily mean that others think "I am R."
    - Related: [[Jibun and Watashi]].
