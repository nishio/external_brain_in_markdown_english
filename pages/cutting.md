## Digest 1
Summarize the discussion of the "cutout." The cutout needs a "glue line" and a summary of the flow leading up to the topic should be at the beginning of the new page. The appropriate cutout will be determined after the needs are identified. The cut-out page should also contain opinions from a different point of view than the original context. Also, people tend to want to comment when they are cut out.

## Digest 2
.
The following details the relevance of the fragments "glue is needed for the cutout," "needs are identified before the cutout is made," and "people will want to comment on the cutout when it is made." The "need for a glue line" indicates the idea that a summary of the flow leading up to the topic should be at the beginning of the new page when it is cut out. The "needs are identified before the cutout" indicates the idea that the appropriate cutout is determined after the needs have been identified. The "When the page is cropped, people will want to comment" indicates the idea that the cropped page should also contain opinions from other viewpoints than the original context.

## deep thinking
Cutouts play an important role in organizing and sharing information. However, its appropriateness will vary depending on needs and context. In addition, reactions and opinions about the cut-out information may bring new perspectives and depth.

　[Short-term reaction].
　　It's easy to relate to the act because you get it right away.
　　But it's only as good as you can get quickly, so even if you collect a lot of them, they quickly scatter and become empty.

This is the reason why I'm not very excited about operating an English account.
　I write for my own reading, so it will be optimal if it's written in a language I'm comfortable reading.
　Putting it into English would allow "many people" to hear it, but I didn't want to speak to "many people".
　So I can't find what I want to post on my English account on Twitter or on Bluesky.
　Just stop trying to "talk" to unspecified people.
　Enables you to hear
　If there is a particular individual who has asked you a question, have a conversation with that one person.

I'm trying to figure out why I'm not excited about all the technical things we can do.
