Important point when considering ROI: What is "return"?

In information sharing and bridging, the concept of [[ROI]] (Return on Investment), which means "what kind of return (Return) can be obtained on investment (Investment)," is not limited to monetary gains, but is multi-layered as follows.

1. financial return
- Increase in sales of products and services
    - Cases where shared information leads directly to sales and marketing.
- cost reduction
    - When know-how sharing lowers development and operating costs.

The argument is relatively simple when the monetary ROI is clear, but in areas such as software development and research activities, it is often difficult to quantify the increase in sales.

Social Return (Reputation / Social Capital)
- 2-1. name recognition from an unspecified number of people
    - Widely known brand strength
        - Increase social recognition through buzz on SNS, media coverage, etc.
    - Support and endorsement from the masses
        - It will be easier to gather funds and collaborators through crowdfunding and other means.
    - The advantage of having your name known by many people is that you can "reach a wide audience," but there is also the risk that your image will be tarnished without a deep appreciation of your content.
- 2-2. evaluation from a specific few
    - Connections with experts and professionals
        - A high reputation in a narrow and deep relationship makes it easier to obtain cooperation and advice in areas of expertise.
    - Community Quality Improvement
        - A network is formed that allows for in-depth discussions and mutual enhancement.
    - This one values professionalism and quality over popular prestige and may foster a strong "[[SOC]]" as a result. It is suited to those who value long-term cooperation and trust over short-term profit.

3. personal return (learning and growth)
- Learning Effectiveness/Skill Development
    - Teaching others and disseminating information deepens my understanding and expands my skills.
- Self-fulfillment and fulfillment
    - Motivation comes from the feeling of being of service to others.
- Even if these do not lead directly to money or social recognition, they can generate returns in the form of career advancement and [[life satisfaction]].

4. multi-dimensional ROI
In practice, the above factors work in combination,
- pecuniary return
- Social return (name recognition, reputation)
- Personal return (learning, satisfaction)
A balance of the following must be considered. For example,

- B: Share to unspecified number."
    - -> Even if the short-term financial return is small, it will lead to increased visibility from an unspecified number of people, and may lead to collaborators and new projects in the future.

- A: Share to a specific few.
    - -> While immediate financial gain may be difficult to obtain, a deep appreciation and access to a deep community may result, leading to long-term collaboration and co-development.

- Closed to Open" Hybrid Strategy
    - -> Information elaborated by a small community and later released to the general public will first enhance the expertise and quality of the information, while eventually gaining support and recognition from a wide audience.

5. summary
[[Returns are multidimensional.]]
- Monetary profit is not the only measure of ROI. Various factors such as name recognition (for the masses), professional recognition (for a few), and even one's own learning and growth can be "return on investment".
Clarify the purpose of the action
- Depending on what you value, the sharing methods and the communities you work with will vary. It is important to be clear about the return you are seeking.
Short-term and long-term perspectives are needed
- In some cases, even if the company does not make money right now, the accumulation of name recognition and personal connections can lead to great value in the future. Conversely, there is also the risk of making money right away but losing credibility in the long run, so a sense of balance is required according to the goals one is aiming for.

By comprehensively considering these multi-layered returns, you will be able to choose the style and strategy of sharing that is best for you.
