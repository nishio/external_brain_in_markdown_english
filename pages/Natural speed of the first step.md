- Do everything slowly in the system that you learn in your body.
    - thumb shift
    - musical instrument
    - write
- Programming fails fast.
    - Drafting the bar exam
        - handwritten proposal
        - snow goose (Chen caerulescens)
    - think after writing
    - As for the behavior of the intellect, not the physicality, it would be beneficial to get it out there and make it relative.
