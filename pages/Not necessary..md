title: "Not necessary."
---

When Mr. A says that a certain X is "[[not]] necessary," it is not that objectively "X is not necessary," but that Mr. A subjectively "does not feel the need for it."

Necessity depends on the situation.

If X is "[[useful]] but not [[indispensable]]" in a certain situation, those who do not understand its usefulness say it is not necessary, while those who do understand it say it is necessary.
