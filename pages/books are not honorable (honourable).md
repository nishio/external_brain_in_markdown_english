title: "books are not honorable (honourable)"
---

- We tend to discriminate between books by great authors with bulky hardcovers as "great books" and those sold in convenience stores as "not so great books".
- The value of a book to you is determined by what you can produce by applying the knowledge you gain from reading it.
    - Even if you read a famous book by a great man and memorize the entire text, it is not useful unless you can apply it and make it useful in your life.
            - [[Knowledge must be proven by deeds.]]
    - [[A book that should be chewed and digested well]] is not the only book
        - [Reading is about getting others to think about things.
