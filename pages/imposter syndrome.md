title: "imposter syndrome"

2023-12-20 merged from  [[imposter syndrome]]
An Imposter is a "fraudster". A phenomenon in which a person feels that he or she is not being evaluated on merit and that he or she is unknowingly committing fraudulent acts.
Although named a "syndrome," advocates later came to believe that "imposter experience" would have been more appropriate. The word has a strong impact and stands alone.

> Many socially successful women do not consider themselves smart and think they are [[overestimated]] by others
- Some argue that it's not limited to women.
    - I agree with you on the "not necessarily" point, but I wonder if it's an unknown if there's a gender difference.
