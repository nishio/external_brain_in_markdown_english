I'm trying to, but I'm not aware that type guarding is "to protect against potential runtime errors" in the first place. The mental model is something like, "I'll type guard [[Because I'll be pissed.]] on TS." Maybe that's fine at first, but it's a moot point because runtime errors can only be gained through experience with JS.

If you only write TypeScript, you can probably get by with "because TS will get mad at me" to some extent, but I wonder how you can learn when to do that, or how to write smartly without needing a type guard in the first place by applying processing earlier....
