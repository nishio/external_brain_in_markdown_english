title: "Anger of Pride Restoration"

> [cicada3301_kig](https://twitter.com/cicada3301_kig/status/1712400694567940181) "The reason people get angry is to recover [[wounded pride]] from being treated less than [[expected status]]," the language says. I think it's important to keep this in mind. In other words, if someone is angry, they are either [[expecting too much]], [[their pride is vulnerable]], or they were treated really badly. And that needs to be distinguished from mere [[irritation]].

> [cicada3301_kig](https://twitter.com/cicada3301_kig/status/1712401177311375575) because "irritation" in mental illness, children and the elderly does not involve [[a sense of status]], unlike true "[[anger]]", There is no point in paying attention to that.

>  I have long called it "[[unfairness]]," and I believe that the root of all conflicts, crimes, wars, etc. is unfairness.
>  >shields_pikes: I believe that at the root of every conflict in the world is a sense of injustice. From infant tantrums and fights, to disagreements between friends and couples, to fraud, robbery, street murders, terrorism and world wars, it all starts with this. In particular, the sense of unfairness that has built up over the years is a very powerful and deep-seated emotion that justifies every act of self.
