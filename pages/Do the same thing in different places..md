title: "Do the same thing in different places."

To "do [[it's the same thing.]]" or "do [[something different]]" is [[False dichotomy]].
People who focus on the action interpret "doing the same thing in different places" as "doing the same thing," while people who focus on the location interpret it as "doing something different."

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1757976186519703638) It makes things easier at first glance to pull the [[expressway]] through the [[wasteland]] we walked through so that people who come after us can get through quickly. but it is going to be "doing the same thing in a different place" in the new wasteland after the highway

- People who only see the path they have walked say, "It's outrageous that young people have it easy," but they just don't see that the same hardships lie ahead.
