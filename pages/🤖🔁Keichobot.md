Keichobot is a thought embodiment tool that works with Scrapbox and GPT4 to facilitate synchronous communication between AI and humans. It improves concentration and assists in understanding difficult books. What other tools can be used in conjunction with Keichobot to take full advantage of its capabilities? What other tools can be used to take full advantage of Keichobot's capabilities? What mechanisms are at work in Keichobot's ability to enhance concentration?

Nishio's "Nodal Point of Thought on Scrapbox and AI 2023/8/16" and "A Diary a Day" show the importance of balancing humans and AI and taking time to think about it. The "Preparing a Column on ChatGPT" and "Diary 2023-06-08" show how the emergence of AI has changed people's mental models and that AI should set the rules. Diary 2023-03-24" shows the expected expansion of documentation by AI. These provide important perspectives in the consideration of shared objectives between humans and AI.

Keichobot has gained the ability to put thoughts into words through "nerineri" research. Learning efficiency is variable depending on how you learn, innovation is possible with inferior products as well as new technologies, and GPT4 proposed a Next Action to organize traffic in Twitter discussions and make them productive discussions. This relates to the ability to put thoughts into words and organize information. The process of "can't write" = not enough information ‚Üí research gathering ‚Üí write it all down ‚Üí organizing (deleting and grouping) is critical.

Keichobot is a chatbot that elicits users' non-verbalized thoughts. By extracting key phrases and asking questions about them, it concretizes thoughts and broadens perspectives. And by repeating this process, thoughts are turned into observable chat logs.

Keichobot can also be used in forms other than chat, and may be used against tools such as Scrapbox. However, there are disadvantages to the chat format. Therefore, it is important to explore other forms of communication than chat.

### Questions and Discussions

1. how Keichobot can be used in ways other than chatting?
2. if Keichobot is used in a form other than chat, how does its effectiveness change?
3. what are the disadvantages of Keichobot if it is used in a form other than chat?
4. if Keichobot is used in a form other than chat, what are its advantages?

It is considered necessary to think deeply about these questions and conduct further research.

### fragments

Nishio's research notes reveal that Keichobot uses a question-answer format as its method for verbalizing users' thoughts. We also found that Keichobot emphasizes the verbalization of users' thoughts without distorting them.

Nishio also seems to be using Keichobot to organize his thoughts and is looking for ways to further develop this with tools such as Scrapbox and GPT4. This is related to my research and may help to shed some light on how Keichobot can be used in ways other than chatting.

Based on this information, we add the following questions

5. what kind of effects can we expect from Keichobot's integration with other tools?

### Digest of Research Notes
.

Keichobot is a chatbot that helps users elicit and verbalize thoughts that they have not yet clearly verbalized. Specifically, it extracts key phrases from human statements and asks questions about them. This enables the human to think more concretely or from a new perspective. Also, by repeating this process, vague thoughts in the brain are turned into observable chat logs.

Keichobot was originally called a "language-enhancing chat system," but it is believed that it can be used in other ways than chat. For example, it could be used for tools such as Scrapbox. This is because Keichobot has the effect of drawing information from humans or focusing humans on a single topic for a certain period of time by repeating the interaction between the program and humans.

However, there are also disadvantages to the chat format. Therefore, it is considered important to explore other forms than chat. In the new form, Keichobot may be used as an image of being beside the user, rather than in front of him or her.

### Questions and Discussions

1. what are the specific ways in which Keichobot can be used outside of chatting?
2. if Keichobot is used in a form other than chat, how does its effectiveness change?
3. what are the disadvantages of Keichobot if it is used in a form other than chat?
4. if Keichobot is used in a form other than chat, what are its advantages?

It is considered necessary to think deeply about these questions and conduct further research.
