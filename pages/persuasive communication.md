persuasive communication
I was thinking about [[convincing]] and realized that some communication is [[persuasive]] to begin with and some is not.
Mr. A to allow Mr. B to make decisions that Mr. A thinks are good for him.
- Mr. A: "If you buy this product, Mr. B's problem will be solved."
- Sometimes Mr. A thinks it's "good for Mr. B" and sometimes he doesn't.
    - S1: Mr. A: "Buying this product will solve Mr. B's problem (and I really think it will)."
        - Mr. B's happiness is Mr. A's goal.
    - S2: Mr. A: "Buying this product will solve Mr. B's problem (and I don't think, but I think Mr. B will buy it if I say so)"
        - Sales are Mr. A's goal.
- If it could be S2, then Mr. B needs to question Mr. A's statement.
    - Elderly people are forced to buy financial products at the behest of salespeople at brokerage firms.
    - If AI helps Mr. A by augmenting his power of persuasion, shouldn't it augment Mr. B's power of suspicion at an equivalent level?
- Even when Mr. A has good intentions in S1, Mr. A's values may not match Mr. B's values.
    - [[thank you]].
    - The definition of "goodness" is not [[aligned]].
        - [[Goodness" is subjective.]]
    - I prefer X, so Mr. B must prefer X, too."
    - Mr. B says X isn't good; Y is better."
    - I think there is a high-productivity state that only occurs in relationships that are mutually beneficial and where the definition of "goodness" is aligned.
        - Even if it's mutually beneficial, it's unproductive when the definitions of goodness are at odds with each other.
        - A "people who are willing to stop the current project and use the resources for what they think is a better outcome" v.s. B "people who would prefer that the current project be completed successfully".
            - Mr. A suggests, "Maybe you should stop doing that and do this.
            - Mr. B. thinks, "There's no way I can stop."
