> [nagise](https://x.com/nagise/status/1815581088217199056) So to speak, I think the Asahi Shimbun's answer is the thing, and I think it's corrupt.
>  "Reading Chairman Toyoda's statement and its context, it is clear that he was speaking to the "media" (and since that media is responsible for some of the perversion and proliferation, we can't even look at them...).

> [nagise](https://x.com/nagise/status/1815581569161339175) So in response to the following part, Asahi Shimbun answered with the act of writing a misleading, Toyota-bashing article
>  "You may think that our mission is to beat the strong, but without the strong, a nation cannot exist. I would like everyone to think carefully about how to use the power of the strong and take a hard look at it.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1815546969689137209) Post-election survey results from the Tokyo gubernatorial election showed that #Takahiro Yasuno received 3.3 times more votes than his opponent. Is this due to his increased name recognition as a result of the media coverage after the election?


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1815420634471760131) To summarize what I said verbally, AI governance will be better than human governance as soon as AI becomes smarter than humans. However, when we say "rule people happily," it is not good if some people define "happiness" as imposing a form of happiness on others, so we need a method in which everyone participates in deciding.

Regardless of whether we accept a dictatorship by a smart AI later, it is better to push for digital democracy at this point.
