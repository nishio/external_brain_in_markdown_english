<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/> Pragmatism (also called "[[instrumentalism]]") of [[Dewey.]] is a position that views knowledge not as fixed truths but as [[tools for]] problem solving. Learning and thinking are constantly renewed through daily experience, and are improved through [[practice]] in society and the environment through repeated [[research]] and [[experimentation]]. In terms of education, Deweyan pragmatism is characterized by its emphasis on [[independent experience]] and inquiry, rather than passive knowledge infusion, in order to promote the growth of individuals and society.
