- It's getting bigger and bigger, and the rate of increase is accelerating.
    - [Positive feedback
    - Not to be confused with "positive feedback" in communication.
- Right figure, cases that become smaller and smaller, and the rate of decrease accelerates, are also "positive feedback" cases
    - Often misunderstood because of the mood of the word "[[positive]]"

- When a value deviates from a reference value, a force is applied that magnifies the deviation (= positive, in the same direction as the direction of the deviation)
- Therefore, both "accelerating in the direction of increasing" and "accelerating in the direction of decreasing" are positive feedback.

    - What is [[negative feedback]]?
- Conversely, when a deviation from the reference value occurs, a force is applied in the direction to reduce the deviation.
- So, after a deviation due to disturbance, etc., the deviation decreases and returns to the original standard value.
- That is, negative feedback brings [stability
    - Some people make the mistake of thinking it's bad because of the word [[negative]], but it doesn't correspond to good or evil.

    - [[positive return]] / [negative feedback
    - [[Howling (esp. audio feedback)]] is an example of [[Positive feedback]].
    - The sound that comes in through the microphone is magnified and comes out through the speakers, which are then picked up again by the microphone, developing into a loud sound.
- Everything that is stable around us involves some form of negative feedback.
    - For example, body temperature
        - When the body temperature rises, sweat is produced on the body surface to cool down by vaporization heat to lower the temperature.
        - When the body temperature drops, the muscles quiver to produce heat and raise the temperature
        - [[homeostasis]]

    - [[echo chamber]]
    - [[the nail that sticks out gets hammered in]]
        - [[Stability is Depression]]
