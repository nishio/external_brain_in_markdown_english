title: 'Same" and "different" are not symmetrical.'

from [/villagepump/Masui and nishio have symmetrical ideas in terms of "same" and "difference"](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/Masui and nishio have symmetrical ideas in terms of "same" and "difference").
Mr. Masui and nishio are thinking symmetrically in terms of "same" and "difference".

            - Throwing in a mystery file and bookmarking it are the same thing.
        - Search and input are the same
        - And there was more.

    - The [[UI that does search and new creation together]] would be interesting from this point of view.
- I wonder if it would be more developed if I wrote this [[Nota's thing]].

    - On the other hand, it's good to analyze the differences that are there, instead of taking a cursory view of them as "roughly similar, so let's treat them as the same thing".
    - So you can do both.
        - That's right.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Most of the time, one or the other will be the norm, so the only analysis will be that one or the other is "obvious".<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>

- It was pointed out to me that there is a difference between focusing on the differences and focusing on the same, but I thought as I was writing this article that sometimes we are focusing on the same.
        - [[Seeing only the ends is the same as seeing only the thick of it.]]
- I'm starting to get the feeling that this is not symmetrical behavior.
    - Mr. Masui's "X and Y are the same" is an "invention of a new point of view" that "from this point of view, they appear to overlap.
        - Figure: [[The two images appear to overlap depending on the viewing direction]].
    - When I say "different" I don't think it's "X and Y don't overlap when you change your point of view".
        - The X is vague and spread out (= [[Low resolution]]), we should observe it more clearly (= increase resolution).
        - Are you changing the camera lens rather than changing the point of view? Are you adjusting the focus?

- Same: [[finding commonality in seemingly different things]] is an abstraction
- No: "[[Observe more clearly and increase resolution]]" is an embodiment.
- I thought we were doing this back and forth.
