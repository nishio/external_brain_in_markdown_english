- > When a person has devoted himself to one thing and has passed the age of 40, he is able to come up with [[his own grand plan]], which he could not have thought of when he was young, because he has more experience and can imagine various things.
- > The [[idea]] is unique to each person because it is based on his or her own experiences up to that point.
- > On the other hand, however, his body is beginning to decline, his power as a living organism is going downhill, he is losing momentum overall, and he is becoming aware that he does not have much time left to realize the best expression of his life.

- > I can still move my body now, so I think I can manage. Then I must take advantage of the little time I have to move my body to execute this highly specific idea.
    - [[little time left]]
