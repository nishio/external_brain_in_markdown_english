I need a connection from the limb.
GPT4 and delving into certain concepts (specifically Ashby 1956 and Ikujiro Nonaka's reference to it).
I saw GPT4 came up with it and I thought, "This has something to do with Plurality," so I skipped it with [[GPT Mention]] and had them consider it.
I felt that there was a big loss of information in the vector search in the action, where it was compressed into "keywords".

Reading past discussions in chunks and quoting and referring to "where there is something relevant in Plurality's body of knowledge" or some such behavior is closer to what I want you to do.
(i.e. N times vector search)
