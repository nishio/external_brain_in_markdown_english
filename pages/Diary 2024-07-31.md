Too physically weak? I was exhausted when I got back.
Then you should sleep a lot, but you wake up at 6:00.

I'm not waking up crisp and energetic.
But if I go back to sleep twice now, I risk oversleeping.
I don't think I'll be able to sleep because my nerves are aroused to begin with.

I want to curl up and hibernate in a big tree cave deep in the mountains.

[[Lunch meeting with Vitalik]]


I'm home safe.
Then, exhausted, I fell asleep.
