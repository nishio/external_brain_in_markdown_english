title: "Methodologies that are difficult to observe are only effective for those who use them."
---


- "If you give them [[methodology]] from the beginning, they don't feel [[blessing]], so they don't use it."
- "Don't you appreciate C if you don't do assembly language first?"
- 'Don't you appreciate a tractor if you don't plant your seedlings by hand before you use it?'
- I think, "Why should we need to be thankful for tools that we can use without being thankful for them?"

In the case of tractors, even those who plant seedlings by hand can understand that "that one is more productive" when they see someone planting seedlings with a tractor. The productivity-enhancing effects of tools can be understood through observation.

Some methodologies, however, are difficult to observe others using. As a result, only those who have actually used the methodology are acutely aware of its effectiveness.
    - [[Difficult to observe]]

I had originally written that "[[first things first]], and then only those who actually use the methodology will feel the effects acutely," but I separated the two stories because they were mixed up.
