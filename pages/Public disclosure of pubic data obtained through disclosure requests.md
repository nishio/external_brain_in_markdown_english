title: "Public disclosure of pubic data obtained through disclosure requests"

- Posted in [Digital Democracy 2030

Whether the data from pubic comments obtained through disclosure requests can be made public (I'm not sure at the moment, so I'm working on closed channels for once, but this is not an ideal situation, I want to make it open data).

Court cases involving public comment

> The following is a summary of the public comments and the court's decision on whether the right of adaptation is infringed by the preparation of a written summary of the public comments.
> As shown in the court case below, it is expected that the public comment will be followed by the creation of a document summarizing the summary by the government, etc. Therefore, infringement of the right of adaptation, infringement of the right to preserve the identity, or infringement of the right to use one's own name will be difficult to prove.
If it says "will be open to the public" when soliciting public comments, can we not say that there is agreement for public disclosure for the same reason?

Nagaoka City publishes CSV in UTF-8 and SJIS, which is a good precedent.

> The following is an example of a work in which the copyright owner is the copyright holder: "For works in which the national government is the copyright holder, the national government can decide under what conditions of use the work will be made available to the public, and therefore, the national government should be allowed to use the work in advance in a manner that broadly permits secondary use (i.e., permits secondary use without restriction, except when secondary use is limited based on specific and reasonable grounds other than copyright). (2) The idea concerning the use of the copyrighted work shall be indicated in advance in a form that is as clear as possible. Such indication shall be as clear and uniform as possible.
Can't we consider that there is an agreement to be published under these terms and conditions at the time of submitting the babu komei?

The one published on e-Gov is licensed for ease of use, nice job.

For example, this Babkome note notes.
Content that infringes on the property or privacy of individuals or specific companies or organizations
The letter clearly states that the information is invalid. Using this kind of logic, could we request disclosure so that opinions containing personal information, etc., are removed and disclosed in the first place?
