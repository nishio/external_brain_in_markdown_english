summary
- In order to make the perpetrators of special frauds (such as the "Oreore" scam) feel less guilty, the masterminds of the scam intentionally imprint a "redistribution" narrative that "it is social justice for young people to use the 'dead money' accumulated by the elderly to turn the economy around. In order to make children feel guilty, the ringleaders intentionally print a "redistribution" narrative that "it is social justice for young people to use the 'dead money' accumulated by the elderly to turn the economy around. The following is a summary of key evidence.

Self-justifying story of "redistribution

wrestler of the fourth highest rank
- The perpetrators are trying to "close the gap" and project a "rat-boy" image, positioning themselves as "social justice leaders" by positioning their victims as the "marginalized".

2. organizational "education" to diminish feelings of guilt
- Self-development seminar-type training
    - Showing tired workers in front of a convenience store and imprinting "don't be like this" → Hopelessly creating a future other than fraud ([vice.com](https://www.vice.com/ja/article/daisuke-suzuki-kakusa-syakai/))
- Title assignment and performance-based
    - Even at the end of the line, titles such as "chief" and "section chief" are handed out to encourage "regular employee-like" self-utilization ([news-postseven.com [https://www.news-postseven.com/archives/20171028_](https://www.news-postseven.com/archives/20171028_) 623707.html?DETAIL=])
- Injection of "victim consciousness
    - Inverted as "we are the weak ones who don't even get a pension," the composition makes the victim look like the perpetrator ([news-postseven.com](https://www.news-postseven.com/archives/20171028_623707.html?DETAIL=))

These are typical of what criminologists call "[[techniques of neutralization]]"-"harm denied," "appeals to a higher allegiance.

Propaganda for "black jobs" at the recruitment stage
- Easy money" and "high hourly wage" ads on social networking sites
    - ([fukuishimbun.co.jp](https://www.fukuishimbun.co.jp/articles/-/996932))
- About 75% of underage children enter the market because of the "easy money" lure.
- Osaka Prefectural Police's educational materials also list "no-risk, high-income" deception tactics.

4. psychology and reality of the receiver and the receiver's child
- Hungry people are the focus - "I wouldn't do Lehman for pennies, but for 'big money,' I'll work hard" ([news-postseven.com [https://www.news-postseven.com/](https://www.news-postseven.com/) archives/20171028_623707.html?DETAIL=])
- Withdrawal from an organization is difficult - Example of threatening to "go to Kakuchi" to those who wish to withdraw ([fukuishimbun.co.jp](https://www.fukuishimbun.co.jp/articles/-/996932))
- Youth work part-time - Police statistics show that 90% of juveniles arrested are receivers.

5. summary and suggestions
- Interview reportage and interviews with former criminals confirm that the narrative of **"social justice to redistribute the dead assets of the elderly "** has been passed down to the terminus.
- These narratives function as "educational programs" that criminal organizations systematize to motivate and neutralize guilt.
- During the recruiting phase, the company is taking a two-step approach: first, it is promoting "fun and profit" to attract young people, and then, after they join, it lowers the ethical hurdle by promoting "social justice.
- Measures need to educate people about the dangers of "justification stories" as well as financial incentives - simply saying "it's a crime" is not enough to compete with neutralization techniques.

These materials show how cleverly the oleophobic scam organizations mobilize young people by fusing economic desire + moral excuses.
