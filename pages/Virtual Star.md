Nishio created [[art]] work series
Selected as [[ASIAGRAPH]] 2009 excellent works
[Virtual Star --- NISHIO Hirokazu](http://nhiro.org/what_i_did/virtual_star/)

> Tadao Shibata Tadao Editor-in-Chief, Nikkan Digital Creators
>  Although many varied works were received again this year, there was a wide range in the excellence of the works, and the choice of the selected works in each category was easy. In the following process, we selected works in which the intent of the artist's creation was clearly evident. In this respect, the Japanese artists whose works had been described by their creators in the first category had an advantage. For example, I also appreciated the excellent commentary on Yasukazu Nishio's work. I have long believed that an artist must be able to present his or her work not only visually, but also verbally. However, I evaluated the works of Minoru Sugiyama, Fumitake Suzuki, and Yuta Onoda based on the power of their visuals, even without such ability. This is not consistent with my argument. I am at a loss.

I wonder where my "excellent commentary" went at this time...
I think it's this one?
I guess the first time it was submitted to [[TAGBOAT SUMMER AWARD]] and the first time it was submitted to ASIAGRAPH was ver. 2.0.

>  This is a religious painting. However, it is not a depiction of the Christian God, as is usually imagined by the term "religious painting". God in human-like form is, after all, "represented" in a way that is easy for humans to understand, not universal. If there were a six-handed intelligent being on another planet, it would never use the same "representation" as we do. But no matter how different that intelligent being is from us, x such that x + 1 is x times x is 1.61803.... and the ratio of circumference to diameter is 3.14159... . Mathematics is the omnipresent, rigorous, regular, undivided, and gracious entity that transcends time and space.
>  In da Vinci's time, 500 years ago, there were no paintbrushes that could place trillions of liters of pigment at tens of thousands of times per second. Nor did those who calculated billions of times per second exist. Now we have both. The time has come when we can paint the beauty God has created with greater precision.
- The expression "x such that x + 1 is x times x is 1.61803.... Some people may not understand that it is [[golden ratio (approx. 1.6180339887)]] when they say "x such that x + 1 is x times x is 1.61803...".
    - But you didn't call the pi side "Pi", so I guess the intent is that the number, not the word, exists universally first.
