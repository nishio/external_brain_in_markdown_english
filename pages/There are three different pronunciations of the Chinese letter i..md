title: "There are three different pronunciations of the Chinese letter i."
---

- The "i" after [[retroflex sound]] and after [[lingual consonant]] is pronounced differently, so if you don't understand this and pronounce it with an "i", it will be mistaken for qi or xi.
- I tried many times to get Google Translate to recognize "haochi" as "好吃(haochi)" and it gave me "好奇(haoqi)", but this was the reason for that!
- I had a hard time believing that the consonants were mispronounced because they were misrecognized.
- Once I knew the i's sounded different, I practiced a little and they were correctly identified.
