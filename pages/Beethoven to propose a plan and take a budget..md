title: "Beethoven to propose a plan and take a budget."

> [@rkmt](https://twitter.com/rkmt/status/1549517810380210176?s=20&t=0mZp4_FuWxXz_CPZ_N5uEA): Bell Labs has a deep pocket that "you can do research on anything except telephones", and Unix was born. Unix was created by a small number of researchers who thought that MULTICS, a huge industry-academia collaboration project, was a bad idea. (Unix was originally created by a small number of researchers who thought that MULTICS, a huge industry-academia collaboration project, was not going to work.)
>  WWW was also born out of the nostalgia of a huge research institute like CERN, where you can do whatever you want. [[goal-oriented]] and I think it would be a bad idea to make it an organization like "Next Generation Information Sharing Platform Research Organization", maybe GNU too (where geniuses like Stallman can live without the pressure of writing papers).
>  But that kind of "continually pay for gobbledygook" is hard to explain, so it won't last forever.
>  I think it's the [[patron]] type that allows for the squirming, but when that disappears, you have to make a [[planning proposal]] and get a budget for everything... I imagined Beethoven saying, "I'm going to write a symphony with chorus, and I'd like to have a budget...
>  But this is also subtly different from "don't let basic researchers develop products"... Basic is not so much far from practical application as it is a conventional game changer...
