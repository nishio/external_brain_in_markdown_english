The X (formerly Twitter) thread presented discusses the significance of incorporating [[Human Rights Impact Assessment]] ([[HRIA]]) and [[Human Rights Due Diligence]] ([[HRDD]]) into [[policymaking]], likening it to [[safety engineering]]. HRIA/HRDD is a key component of [[policymaking]]. In particular, the book focuses on the argument that HRIA/HRDD can provide a multi-layered protection [[to protect society]] from [[populist]] type "quick-fix" policies.

What are HRIA and HRDD?
- HRIA ([[Human Rights Impact Assessment]])
    - Identification of potential impacts of new policies and projects on human rights and design modifications
    - Stakeholder consultation, risk assessment, and consideration of alternatives
    - Specification review / design review
- HRDD([[Human Rights Due Diligence]])
    - Monitoring and remediation during the implementation phase
    - KPI Monitoring, complaint handling, correction and publication
    - Continuous Integration & Testing (DevOps)


Why can we prevent "structural flaws" in manifestos?
- [[Early Detection of Discrimination Risk]]
    - AI Welfare Judgment System SyRI Certified Discriminatory Due to Lack of Prior Evaluation -> Suspended (Netherlands)
    - France mandated HRIA for the same type of algorithm, resulting in a 41% reduction in lawsuits.
- Verification of financial resources
    - Financial and procedural costs are also included in risk indicators, thus eliminating deskilling.
- Inclusion of the socially vulnerable
    - The "[[Nothing about us, without us]]" principle mandates party participation. The U.S. family separation policy firestorm is an example of the lack of this process.
