It is possible to create a book image URL from an ASIN.
`http://images-jp.amazon.com/images/P/{ASIN}.09.LZZZZZZZ.jpg`

However, this is HTTP, so it cannot be displayed directly from Scrapbox
- Related [[Latest Chrome does not allow HTTP images to be displayed on HTTPS pages]].

Technical Solutions
- Download the file to your hand via HTTP and then upload it back to [[Gyazo]].
        - [[Download book image with ✅ASIN]]
        - [[Upload ✅ images to Gyazo]]
