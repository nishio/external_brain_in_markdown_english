title: "The cause of frustration is self-aggrandizement."
---

    - [[sense of anxiety]] is caused by [[person who craves the limelight]].
        - There is a gap [[Gap between reality and ideal]] between myself in [[reality]] and "[[one's ideal state]]" that I consider [[ideal]].
        - If [[gap]] is narrow, we can move toward the ideal.
            - [[direction to go (towards)]] is clear for [achievement
        - No need to worry about when to "go to the nearest station" from home.
    - The wider the gap, the harder it is to know where to go.
        - You can't even see the big picture of the journey you're on.
        - A child who doesn't know much about international flights sees the Eiffel Tower on TV and says, "I want to go!" and doesn't know what to do.
            - [[The goal is far away.]]
