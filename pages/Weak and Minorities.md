title: "Weak and Minorities"
---

In 2024, I recognized "[[the weak]]" and "[[minority]]" as words that were somehow correlated and in a similar direction, but I realized that this may have already been biased by society.

For a long time after [[interchange format B]] was created in the first place, a few powerful people ruled the majority.
- At this time, the strong are the minority.

However, a counter-movement to this is born.
    - What [[Nietzsche]] called "[Sklavenmoral (slave morality, as a philosophical concept of Nietzsche)."
- The majority is good, the minority is evil."
- Justify collective decision-making by majority rule
    - The "Democracy" Movement
    - [[Tocqueville]] criticizes the term "[[tyranny of the majority]]."

The majority governs according to itself, and the minority is left out.
- If you're strong and in the minority, well, you can be lowered a bit and still be strong.
- In the case of a normal minority, being lowered makes them weaker than an equivalent majority and creates a "weak" group.

I was thinking of non-binary athletes.
- Athletes born and lived as women, with male chromosomes
    - [[IOC: "Born and lived as a woman"...stresses legitimacy Women's boxing athletes "with male chromosomes" (Published on August 3, 2024) 259e850546e54b70b552c33f7aa8574c]]
    - [It is incorrect that "a transgender ex-male competed in women's boxing and won" at the Paris Olympics. Female by birth (Shuji Shinohara) - Expert - Yahoo! News](https://news.yahoo.co.jp/expert/articles/357264b5b78328c263157238472c365f2350113e)
- To begin with, let's say there are "men" and "women" and if you mix them up and play a game, the women's side is at a disadvantage.
    - In other words, this has nothing to do with whether or not a woman is a minority, but with her physical characteristics that make her vulnerable in the first place.
- The current situation is one of apartheid, with separate leagues for men and women so that even vulnerable women can enjoy sports.
- This is where "minorities that are difficult to divide into two kinds of men and women" appear.
    - The trend of "minorities are vulnerable and need to be taken into consideration" has made me a "strong minority" because of my physical characteristics when I was placed in the women's league according to my own self-identification.

- [[Symbol-level thinking vs. vector-level thinking]]
