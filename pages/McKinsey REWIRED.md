It is packed with specifics on how to go about [[DX]] in terms of planning, people, organization, technology, and data. I thought I would have to pay tens of millions of dollars to get this book. Fatty. It's not the same as all the "ole' DX theory" out there. I'm not trying to be a crusader, but everyone involved in DX should read this book.

The price of 3,000 yen is unbeatable.
