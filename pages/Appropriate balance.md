        - Sometimes it is best to weight [[both extremes]], as in [barbell
- From the point of view of person X, who values A and disregards B, "balancing A and B" Y seems to lack [[balance]].
    - X says, "You're assigning a lot of weight to B, which isn't worth much and is [[unbalanced]]."
    - Y says, "X puts all the weight on A when it should be distributed to B in a balanced manner, which is unbalanced.
    - In the end [[balance is subjective]].
