A: "Can you take responsibility if something goes wrong?"
B: "Can you take responsibility if anything happens to me because of that statement?"

With the statement, "Can you take responsibility?" can you take responsibility for the lost income if the person who was told that atrophied and didn't do what they would have done if they hadn't been told?
