> He skillfully touches on the subtleties of human emotions. Expresses the essence of things well and precisely. A... way of looking at things.
> According to the 2011 "Public Opinion Survey on the Japanese Language" released by the Agency for Cultural Affairs, 26.4% of respondents used the phrase "take a skeptical view" in its original meaning of "take a view that captures the [[essence]] of things," while 48.2% used the phrase "take a skeptical view," which is not its original meaning. The result is a reversal of the original meaning.
