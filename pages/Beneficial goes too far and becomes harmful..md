For some X
- At some point, the utility of X causes X to increase [[positive feedback]].
    - This is the first watershed.
- As X increases, the growth of utility of X slows ([[diminishing marginal utility]]).
- On the other hand, suppose that the disadvantages ([[ineffectiveness]]) of increasing X do not diminish
    - [Marginal ineffectiveness - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%99%90%E7%95%8C%E9%9D%9E%E5%8A%B9%E7%94%A8)
        - [[negative externalities]]
    - Or the pace of diminishing returns may be slow.
- In that case, one day X's inefficiency will exceed X's utility.
    - At this moment, X's existence turns socially toxic.
