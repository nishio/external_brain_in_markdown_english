title: "curry favour with the young"
---

observed fact
- There's Uncle A who is communicating closely with the young man.
- Uncle B describes that Uncle A's actions as "flirting with youth."

consideration
- Choosing the word "flirtatious" means that Mr. B. thinks it's a negative thing.
    - Is it negative?
- Look up "[[flirt]]" in the dictionary.
    - > Trying to get the other person to like you and make you feel good about yourself.
    - If we take it literally, shouldn't we "flirt" if we want to have a good relationship with others?
    - If you do it the other way around and do the "don't like them, get them in a bad mood" thing, I don't think you can have a good relationship with them.
        - But [[power harassment]] and [[mounting]] are just that.
    - Mr. B may think that the ideal situation is one in which young people follow him without doing anything.
        - Some young people will think and act that way, and some young people will follow (if they have a good [[personality]]).
        - There are some communities that are maintained by a culture that says you have to [[respect your elders]].
        - In general, I think the attitude that young people should respect you even if you don't do anything to them is counterproductive.

relevance
    - [[One symptom of aging]]
