title: "Rinoro attack (assassination attempt on Prince Regent Hirohito, Dec. 27, 1923)"
---

[[Rina Kuroiwa]] (wife of [[Takahiro Yasuno]])
> [rinakuro](https://x.com/rinakuro/status/1937117099371139529) I was just on the street at night when a stranger asked me if I was Yasuno's wife,
>  "You racist!　Nazi!　Murderer!" and pushed me...
>
>  The injury was not serious, but it was indeed scary...
> [rinakuro](https://x.com/rinakuro/status/1937117686351482913) In the meantime, I went to the police and filed a damage report, but that's too scary indeed...
>
>  But "racist" is a crazy strong word... of course, resorting to violence is out of the question, but seriously, I'm not sure it's the same word you can throw at others online... well, you say "legitimate criticism". ...
> [rinakuro](https://x.com/rinakuro/status/1937128212863258900) It's a risky thing to pursue a career in politics, including for family members (I've never experienced violence like this, but it's normal to be abused on the street, etc.). (As you can imagine, this is the first time I have ever experienced such a violent incident,)
>  It's pretty harsh when people say things like "Anno isn't serious about politics, he's just playing with the elites.


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1937176183747367096) Violence is not good. And the act of casually throwing around the slander "racist/Nazi/murderer" over the internet also creates a bunch of people who mistakenly believe that their voices are right, which causes violent incidents like this. I wish everyone would imagine the possibility of the world moving in the wrong direction with that one word before posting it.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1937177223062224998) I don't think we should live in a world where people who throw slander can destroy evidence at the snap of a finger.
>  >riff_sansho: people are indeed too lame to be in a hurry to delete slanderous tweets against Mr. Anno after learning that Mr. Rinoro was attacked by thugs.
>  If you have time to fry people, why don't you think about how to improve politics with your own mind?


> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1937127186303271273) This is indeed strange!
> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1937129661903044877) It's as if the family is being harmed.
> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1937730829545013512) A few days ago, my family was assaulted on the street by a man who was verbally abusive in a heartless manner and then pushed away. Such acts of violence cannot be tolerated and I would like to firmly protest against them.
>
>  I take your comments and criticisms of my own words and actions and of the Party's policies very seriously. However, acts that result in physical harm are not acceptable, as they shake the very foundations of democracy.
>
>  In order to protect a society where everyone can feel safe to express their opinions and live in safety, we will take a firm stand against this kind of behavior.
