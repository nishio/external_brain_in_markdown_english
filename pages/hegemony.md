This dominance is characterized by being established not merely through military or economic power, but also through cultural and ideological influence. Hegemony tends to legitimize domination through consent rather than direct coercion. The theory by Gramsci emphasizes a system in which the ruling class uses intellectuals and culture to legitimize and maintain its authority.

Case Studies in Japan
Postwar Japan and American Hegemony
After World War II, Japan experienced economic recovery under the influence of the United States. This allowed Japan to embrace the American political and economic model ([[capitalism]], [[democracy]]), thereby instilling American hegemony in the country.
- Cultural: American culture is deeply rooted in Japan through Hollywood movies, pop music, and fast food.
- On the security front: The military cooperation through the [[Japan-U.S. Security Treaty]] symbolizes that Japan is part of the U.S. military hegemony.

Domestic hegemonies
- Within Japan, the fact that the [[Liberal Democratic Party]] has remained in power for so long after the war is sometimes regarded as a kind of hegemony.
- The LDP has justified its rule on the basis of [[economic growth]] and [[stability]], and has won the consent of the people while suppressing [[labor unions]] and [[innovative forces]].
- In the process, areas such as media and education also functioned in a way that supported certain values.

supplement
Hegemony is not always fixed, but can change with the emergence of [[counter-hegemonic]] forces. For example, the Soviet Union during the Cold War and China today are considered forces that challenge the hegemony of the United States. Similarly, in Japan, there are movements of citizens' movements and new political parties challenging the existing structure.
