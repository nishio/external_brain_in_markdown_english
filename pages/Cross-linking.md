title: "Cross-linking"
---

    - [[bracketing]] granularity worries me.
    - `Information sharing` as a link or `information` and `sharing`?
    - There is also an emergent pattern of `sharing information` and `sharing information` that I want to fine-tune.
- But now [[Scrapbox]] specs show articles containing `info` or `share` as links
    - This is equivalent to searching with OR
    - Fear that the linkage target is too broad.
- Wouldn't it be nice if AND-links ([[Cross-linking]]) were created automatically?
- If a keyword X or Y appears on too many pages to list, display "X and Y" before them
