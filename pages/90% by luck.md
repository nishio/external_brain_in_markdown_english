title: "90% by luck"
---

- [[Konosuke Matsushita]] "It's [[90% luck]] whether [[success]] happens or not.
- > I am not saying that [[destiny]] is 100 percent. I am not saying [[destiny]] is 100 percent, but 90 percent. So the remaining 10 percent is important for human beings.
- > You can't just [[effort]] because luck is 90%. And you can't assume that because you put in the effort, you will succeed. But you have to work hard to succeed.
