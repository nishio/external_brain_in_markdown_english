title: "Two before several."

>  There are various proposals for [[group flow]], [[brainstorming]], and other methods of [[multi-person knowledge creation]], but based on the principle of "[The more people you have, the harder it is to control. However, based on the principle that "[[the more people you have, the harder it is to control]]," the most controllable "multiple people" are "two people," so it would be better to first establish a firm footing on how to conduct "Knowledge Creation through Dialogue" before thinking about a multi-person approach. I think it would be a good idea.
- > For now, it's interesting to think of the various methods as "what would happen if I used them in a dialogue between myself and one person who doesn't know the method?" It is interesting to think about it.
- > I think the problem of "[[People who don't speak up]] are present" is less likely to occur in brainstorming sessions, when it's one-on-one.
- > Tokoroten: I tried [[brainwriting]] the other day and it solved all those problems and did pretty well.
