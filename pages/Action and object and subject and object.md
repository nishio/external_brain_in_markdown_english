I kind of drew it, but I need to verbalize it in the form of [[legend]] or I might lose the meaning, so I'll make a note of it.
- Arrows represent [action
- Express [[subject (of taxation, etc.)]] in a box
    - The object may be [[core]] or [object
    - Tend to think of "things" as objects from a non-programming tradition.
    - But a program is a thing, but it can be a subject of action.
- The arrow was attached to the box to express that "the action is attributed to the object".
- But it's not good to describe things in terms of "skimmers" because they are often overlooked
- A bridge until I can come up with a better expression.
