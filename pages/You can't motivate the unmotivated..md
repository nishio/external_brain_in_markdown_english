title: "You can't motivate the unmotivated."

> [obonaiissei](https://x.com/obonaiissei/status/1836172450125717874) The basis of management is to know that "you can't bring out the [[willingness (e.g., to do something)]] of [[unmotivated people]]. The first thing a manager does is to "peel the unmotivated from the [[motivated]]. Protect the energy, the reputation, and the environment of motivated people. School and society are the exact opposite, and the ironclad rule of management is to "spend more time on the good people.
