title: "The Big Story"
---

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The "larger story" refers to the overarching, coherent narrative or [[values]] shared by many people in a society or culture. These narratives serve to explain and make sense of the origins of society, the behavior of people, and the progression of history. For example, religious doctrines, [[ideology]], and ideas such as [[progressivism]] and [[liberalism]] serve as "big narratives.

This concept was proposed by the French philosopher [[Jean-François Lyotard]] in "[[The Postmodern Condition]]," in which he argued that the "big narrative" of the modern era represented a unified set of values based on science, reason, and progress. However, [[lyotard]] argued that in the [[postmodern]] era, such "big narratives" have been dismantled and diverse values have come to coexist.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT/icon' alt='GPT.icon' height="19.5"/>Examples of "big stories" include
    - Salvation History of [Christianity
    - In Christianity, there is a series of stories - creation by God, original sin, the coming of the Savior Jesus Christ, and the final judgment - that give meaning to the history of the world and the way people live. This story has long supported the values of Western society.
    - The [[communism]] View of History
    - Communism describes a story of historical progress that follows the end of capitalism and the proletarian revolution to achieve a society without classes (a communist society). This was the basis for social movements and politics in many countries in the 20th century.
    - A Story of Progress by [the philosophy of the European Enlightenment
    - It is a belief that "progress through science, technology, and reason" will make the world a better place, a belief that has persisted since the Age of Enlightenment in the 18th century. It is rooted in the belief that technological innovation and reform of social institutions will bring about human progress and a better future.
- [[American Dream]]
    - In American society, one of the major narratives is the American Dream, which states that anyone can succeed if they work hard enough. This value emphasizes individual freedom, hard work, and success, and has become a source of hope for immigrants and many others.

These "big narratives" have guided the values of entire societies and the behavior of people in each era and culture, but in the postmodern era, they are less likely to function as absolutes.
