title: "Hardworking and intelligent"
---

It's titled "diligent and intelligent," but it's more like the Japanese proverb, "[[more haste, less speed]]."
He mentions "[[Haste is the downfall of a fool.]]" and "[[The wise man procrastinates and fails.]]" before telling us to "hurry slowly."

- Also fits with [[better late than never]].

from [[The Art of Worldly Wisdom]]
Be diligent and intelligent.
53

Diligence performs promptly what the intellect excites slowly. Haste is the fault of fools. They start on a task without knowing the crucial points and without preparation. The wise, on the other hand, often fail because they procrastinate. Foresight begets deliberation, and rash actions often invalidate quick decisions. Promptness is the mother of good fortune. He who leaves nothing until tomorrow is one who has accomplished much. [Slow down, hurry up." ([[Festina lente]]) is the royal motto.
