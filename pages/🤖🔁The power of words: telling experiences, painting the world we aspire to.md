It is important to create a common language by using "verbs" to describe the experience and the world we are aiming for. Meanings are written as needed, avoiding definitions that are not grounded. Also, words are handles of meaning, and the process of creating them is often a metaphor or parable. The meaning of a word is not a point, but a distribution, and it is thought that as people repeatedly take actions for and against the same short sentence and visualize how it compares to the world's opinion, they will gradually align to the same distribution.

It is difficult to verbalize what you do not understand, but it is important to write it down first, even if it is just a list of fragmented keywords. Even if you think you are reading, you are only looking at it. So, even if you don't understand the meaning, you have to put it into your mind by moving your hands and typing with the keyboard.

It takes a lot of strength of mind to continue this muddy work. I often feel like giving up halfway through because my heart is not in proportion to the effort. This is because the effort is not proportional to the results. Therefore, I recommend that you set a goal that is achievable in hours or pages. Do not make understanding your goal. If you don't understand anything, it is because you are taking on a target that is difficult to understand.

### Relation to Fragment
.

The fragment "Clarification of Objectives" describes the importance of goal setting. This is relevant to my research. It is also related to my research in that making a "condensed memo" is easier to judge because it is more tangible.

### Considerations and questions

Given the relevance of the "superficial coined words" fragment, it seems important that the concepts to which the words refer be useful when creating the words. Also, considering the relevance of the "judging by action" fragment, it seems that not only the words but also the actions are important. From these perspectives, what factors should be emphasized when creating the words?

Also, given the relevance of the "post-LLM worldview" fragment, it would seem that training in expressing one's experiences in words is important. But how should that training be conducted? And what do we think we can gain through that training?

It is important to create a common language by using "verbs" to describe the experience and the world we are aiming for. Meanings are not explained from the beginning, but are written as needed. It is difficult to avoid definitions that are not grounded and to target searches for things that have not yet been put into words. It is required to carve sentences into concentrated parts of meaning.

In the fragment "I made it" vs. "I use it," there is a discussion about whether wiki refers to software or to a website built using wiki software, which is relevant to my research. In "I would like to consider an explanation of the ability to create a map of the Regroup from chat logs," it is suggested that the text be chopped into meaning-enriched parts.

Words are handles of meaning, and the process of making them is often a metaphor or parable. However, the words function as handles that make it easier to manipulate one's thoughts. It is important to pay attention to bodily sensations, experiences, and discomforts that have not yet been translated into words.

The meaning of words is not a point, but a distribution, and it is thought that as people repeatedly take actions for and against the same short sentence and visualize how it compares to other opinions in the world, they will gradually become aligned with the same distribution.

It is difficult to verbalize what we do not understand. It is absurd to try to explain it in neat and tidy words. It is important to first try to write it down, even if it is just a list of fragmentary keywords.

You may think you are reading, but you are merely looking at it. So, even if you don't understand the meaning, you have to put it into your mind by moving your hands and typing on the keyboard. In the process of doing so, you may be surprised to find that you can understand it.

It takes a lot of strength of mind to continue this muddy work. I often feel like giving up halfway through because the effort is not proportional to the result. There is no guarantee that if you spend 10 hours copying sutras, you will be able to understand the language you are copying. No matter how much effort you put in, you may end up not understanding anything. This will not give you a sense of accomplishment. Therefore, we recommend that you set an achievable goal in terms of time or pages. For example, "I will now copy sutras without looking away for 30 minutes," or "Today I will write down the formulas in chapter 1 and verse 1. This can be accomplished with effort and gives you a sense of accomplishment. Do not make understanding your goal. If you don't understand anything, it is because you are challenging a target that is difficult to understand. Rather, rejoice in the fact that you are lucky if you understand something simply by transcribing it.

Now, let's say you cut the information about the unknown into bite-sized pieces and swallow them.

A wiki is not a dictionary, but a tool to use "verbs" to describe experiences and the world you are aiming to create. The word title page also helps create a common language for the team. This takes the approach that instead of explaining the meaning of a word from the beginning, the sentence is written first and then the meaning of the word is written as needed. This avoids groundless definitions.

The report also discusses the top page of individual projects and the difficulty of targeting things that have not yet been worded. In particular, the problem that "things that have not yet been put into words" cannot be the subject of a search is pointed out.

In the fragment "IT Engineers are Engineers, Wikipedia is Wiki?" there is a discussion about whether Wiki refers to software or to websites built using Wiki software, which is relevant to my research.

In "I would like to come up with an explanation for the ability to create a map of the Regroup from chat logs," it is suggested that [Chop sentences into meaning enriched parts. This is related to my research.

In "Forced to Use to Organize Tasks," there is a discussion of word types, which is also relevant to my research.

On the "felt meaning" performing a specific function necessary for cognition," there is a discussion of the meaning and segmentation of words, which is also relevant to my research.

### Considerations and questions

How can we clarify specific wiki applications and procedures, specific guidelines and procedures for the creation of word title pages, and specific applications of the evolution of search and the need for languageization? Also, what approaches can be used to explore in depth the relevance of fragments?

The "Wiki as a Living Text" adopts an agile development philosophy that does not separate the creation and use phases. Speaking with Verbs" emphasizes the importance of using "verbs" rather than "nouns" when discussing the world we aim to create in the design of an experience. When we call it by nouns, we recognize it as something that does not change, but when we talk about it with verbs, we see it as something that changes.

The difference between "making" and "using" is that those who describe themselves as "using" see it as a tool, while those who describe themselves as "continuing" see it as something that should be continued. Those who speak of "wanting to make," but never actually make anything, do so because they "want to be the one who made it."

There are two ways people react to new tools. Some people quickly learn how to use the tool and enjoy using it. Others, on the other hand, feel frustrated and are content to argue with others who feel the same way, saying, "This isn't working.

In "Speaking with Verbs," he points out the importance of using "verbs" rather than "nouns" when discussing the world we are aiming for in the design of our experiences.

In "Don't Present What You Won't Use," he points out the problem with presenting what you won't actually use.

In "Two Ways to Behave Toward the New," he discusses the differences in people's reactions to new tools.

From the above discussion, we have learned that there are different mental models for the act of creating, the act of using, and the act of continuing to use them. We also gained a deeper understanding of factors that influence people's actions and thoughts, such as the problems of presenting something that one does not actually use, and the different reactions people have to new tools.
