- >  [[mental health]] is as important an issue as physical health, and seeking resources and help is not something to be ashamed of, but rather by casually telling people that your mental health situation is not good, just as you would tell someone that you have a cold, you would rather receive appropriate support. The trend is changing to the point that it is better to be able to receive appropriate support by casually telling people that your mental health situation is not good.
- > Seeking help for one's own wellbeing and sharing experiences with each other are not seen as "weaknesses" to be overcome, but as "strength" and "courage" necessary for growth.
- That's a good story.
        - [[Weaknesses to overcome -> Courage needed for growth]]
