# 5:00
Going to bed at 9:00 p.m.
I was supposed to wake up at 6:00 but woke up at 5:00. 8 hours!

Everyone is still sleeping... I should be the one who should be sleeping the most, since I am the least fit.

Through our conversation on the first day, I knew I had to get more physical.
For example, if I am invited to go bolting on a natural rock, I would say, "Sounds fun! I'm not sure if I can do it," I'll say, "This looks fun! I can't say, "I'm in! I can't say "I'm in!

Now, I'm going to try to sleep again. 5:30

Hmmm, no, the spirit can't sleep, so let's just lay the body down and let it rest.

My memory is a little fuzzy, but I think it was around this point that I got a call from the inn on the first day saying, "Mr. Nishio's wallet is forgotten.
- Idea of taking a cab back to pick it up.
- Proposal to have it mailed to you.
    - Mailing is once refused because "there is cash in the mail".
        - You may destroy the cash!"
    - I was able to have my wallet sent home by registered cashier's check.
        - Result: [[Send wallet by registered mail and return postage with a fixed amount money order.]]

A lot of foreigners got off the bus at Kawayu Onsen, what's there to see?

Is it written "Oosaihara-mae" and called "Oyunohara-mae"?

Arrive safely at Kumano Hongu by bus.
It looks like they built an information center and a museum since it was registered as a World Heritage site.

However, it was like a greenhouse because there was no air conditioning in spite of the glass walls.

        - Hmmm, lack of resolution on the part of the original image.
        - We'll find out later if it's online.

An explanatory video was shown at the information center.
- The summary of the historical video I watched was: "[[Shugendou]] was born when [[Esoteric Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]] joined [[mountain worship]], a religion that says you can attain enlightenment like Buddha if you practice in the mountains. The [[Kumano Hongu Taisha]] shrine enshrines [[Amida Nyorai]], who merged with Buddha, and was regarded as [[the Paradise]].
- Miscellaneous Notes
    - 9th century [[Shingon esoteric Buddhism]].
    - [Shugendo was established when esoteric Buddhism and Taoism were introduced into mountain worship.
    - As Buddhism grows [[manifestation theory (holding that Shinto gods are manifestations of buddhas)]].
        - Kumano's value went up.
    - Late Heian period, [[Latter Dharma philosophy]], desire to be reborn in the Pure Land of Amida Buddha.
    - Mountain forest practitioners since the 8th century
        - [[Kumano Sanja]]
        - Kumano Head Office was treated as [Paradise
    - The World Heritage site designates three shrines and two temples as sacred sites [[Kumano Sanzan]].
        - They descended as three moons.
            - Day1's [[Legend of the Three Bodies of the Moon]].
    - Kumano Hayatama Shrine
        - At least the 12th century?
    - Tree planted by Taira Shigemori
    - road repair

To the inn
- No cabs available, and even if they were called, it would take an hour to get a cab.
    - The first thing I did was to search for the phone number of the cab company that was the top suggestion, and the number that came up was "The number you have dialed is no longer in use.
    - I arrived early and was at the information center, so it would have been best for me to ask the staff about later transportation options, but I didn't realize it.
    - Members tactfully asked to be picked up and dropped off at the inn.

Tricky Tickets
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/6da820bbb59397f87cfdec389d0531ce/thumb/1000)
- A single ticket from Shingu to Tokyo metropolitan area will generate a transfer discount of 1,500 yen by setting the transfer judgment to True for the express ticket to Nagoya on the 27th and the Shinkansen express ticket to Shinagawa on the 28th, which are two different days.
    - Overnight stay in Nagoya is treated as a "temporary stopover".
- When I heard about the ticketing process, I didn't understand it, but when I saw the real thing, I understood that this is the kind of puzzle-like thing they wanted to do.
    - The $1500 discount is not the goal.
- Bottom line, I couldn't get it on the online reservation site, and when I came to the Shingu station counter, the local staff couldn't get it, and I had to wait for 20 people or something at a ticket machine that had a video call connection to some center.

![image](https://gyazo.com/09f354c390e645c99a04670cf22f5946/thumb/1000)
- Xu Fu properly carried out the idea of [[Confucius]].
    - > Confucius said, "In a world where reason is not practiced, let us go abroad on a raft.
    - > During the Warring States Period in China, a man named Lu Zhonglian said, "If the Qin Dynasty ever came to power, I would immediately throw myself into the East Sea to die. I cannot become a citizen of the Qin Dynasty by any means. The people were moved by Lu Zhonglian's spirit and thought his words were very clever. However, he only said these words, but did not act on them. Compared to Xu Fu, who fled far away from the Qin Dynasty to the pure world, Lu Zhonglian was a world away from the Qin Dynasty.
    - I guess there will always be those who say [[only]] small talk [[to be accepted by the masses]] and don't do it when the time comes.
    - Xu Fu practiced "[[If you are dissatisfied with the regime, move on]]."

It's hard to pee standing up at a urinal on a train that sways from side to side.
- I succeeded successfully, but I'm wondering if there are people who fail and spread it around!

They say the next stop is Tsu, but they stop at a mysterious station.
- Because of a train mishap, I see.

[To the Yamabushi, if you want to be one:](http://yamabusi.gozaru.jp/1bosyuu.html)
- It was too funny that as a punchline to the story about how you can become a Yamabushi if you do the training once a year for 3 years, once you become a Yamabushi, you can enter a special site and learn remotely.
    - This site is quite funny, with links to Nico Nico Douga suddenly appearing with icons.

I think this is probably the training that my mother made me participate in when I was a child without really understanding it, and the name of the temple, the name of the lodge, and the content of the training all match my memory.
- [Omine, sacred place for mountain priests, mountain of asceticism, guide to climbing Mt. Omine](http://oomine.gozaru.jp/)
    - I think I climbed up there in white after I was done with the water stains.
    - Participating in [[Taimeikyo (sect of Shinto)]] for 3 years starting next year is not a bad option.

It wasn't until I got to Nagoya that I realized I couldn't go down the stairs normally.
- If you chop it up, you can get off.
- Walking half a step at a time with the right foot down first is OK.

- I had passed it by thinking that a proper massage parlor had appeared again since it was in the site of a nearby massage parlor that had gone out of business, but after hearing about someone who had been there, I'm a little more interested, so I'll go there next time.
- Massage is the exclusive business qualification of the national "anma massage shiatsu practitioner", so I was wondering if that was the case, since there are often cases of people practicing massage under the name "this is not massage", even though it is in fact a massage.
- They're really going to stretch.

I'm sleepy, so I'm going to bed.
- Going to bed at 25:00
- Some of them are going running tomorrow at 7:00.
    - I can't. I'm going to bed.
- Check-out time is 12:00 p.m.
    - Tomorrow I have a bullet train leaving from Nagoya at 11:26 a.m.
    - Some risk...
    - Well, maybe he'll wake up at 9:00.
    - I'd love to wake up, but that's the problem with capsule hotels...
        - If I set an alarm on my Apple Watch, will it vibrate to wake me up, I don't know, I don't usually do that...

# Day 4(9/28)

Go to bed at 25:00, wake up at 8:00
- Natural wake-up alarm (neighbor snoring) @ [[wellbe prosperity]].
- After all, birdsong and insectsong are the sounds of life made by natural creatures, so it's a rather refreshing feeling to think that the snoring of your neighbor is just the same.
- I've heard people say that insects sound like noise to people in other countries, but I'm not sure that's actually true.

take a sauna
    - [[ice sauna]] Oh, man.

- All that's left to do is to go home, give them a souvenir, pick up the wallet that was left at the inn on the first day and mailed by registered mail to their home, and go for an eye exam, and the whole mission is complete.

Apparently, taking a nonreserved seat on an earlier train with a reserved seat express ticket is not allowed.

- > In principle, it is not possible. For example, this is stipulated in Article 172 "Validity of Express Tickets" of the East Japan Railway Passenger Service Regulations.
- I have an ophthalmology appointment at 3:30 p.m.
    - I decided to wait because it was a reserved seat that would allow me to get home with plenty of time to spare.

- successful

- Sweat dripping while waiting for the train.
