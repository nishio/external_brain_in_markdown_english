Atoms are changeable and subscribeable units

The [[Regroup]] I'm working on now is also characterized by "many atoms, often with multiple components depending on one atom, or components depending on multiple atoms, and I want to redraw only some of the components when the atom changes", so Recoil's approach seems to be very applicable.

- [[partial update]] I'd rather incorporate Recoil's results than do the design myself right now.
