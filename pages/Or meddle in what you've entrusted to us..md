[If you are not sure whether you should interfere in what you entrusted to us｜Yuki Fujisaki｜DeployGate Inc.](https://note.com/tnj/n/n2a6f17a54de5?sub_rt=share_h)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This article is based on the author's experience in dealing with product defects when he discovers them on behalf of his company.
The main points are as follows
- I discovered a defect just before release and wondered whether to report it to the development team. It is not good to meddle in what is entrusted to us, but we cannot overlook a problem that affects our customers.
- When I reported it, the development team asked me to make a straightforward decision. Despite my hesitation, I asked them to fix the defect for the customer.
- Analyzed the cause of his hesitation. I was afraid of disturbing the team atmosphere and inhibiting [[autonomy (philosophy)]].
- However, I realized that [[raising a question]] is possible in any position if the position is clearly defined as "user". Interfering with the how (means) of an organization is a problem, but anyone can raise the what (thing).
- At the next opportunity, I clarified my position, reported back, and left the decision to the team. The process went better than we could have imagined.
- If in doubt, clarify your position and if the content is What, you should actively raise it. However, it is also important not to reconsider deeply once you have made a decision.

The author has learned the importance of raising issues from the appropriate position and trusting the team to do the rest, while realizing the difficulty of striking a balance between product and team.
