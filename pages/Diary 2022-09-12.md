> Humans don't know the prompts, so "Oh, what's this?" That's a fun way to have some fun. I'm trying to make it appear when you click on it.
>  It's like a museum, first you see it in the distance, then it gets bigger as you get closer, then you see the description.
>  I think I'll make a virtual museum with an entire building filled only with cat paintings...
>  This technology can be used to paste arbitrary images into Microcosmos: [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers in Microcosmos]].

memo
- ‚úÖI have 1000 cat images generated by Stable Diffusion and 600 of them labeled "nice" by Mr. and Mrs. Nishio, but I have a feeling that it's time to let the computer create the prompts!
- Find the difference in speed between single precision and semi-precision with (PASS)A6000
    - See what difference the output makes
    - ‚Üí about 2 to 7 times faster, right?
        - [[Half-precision arithmetic speed]]
- (PASS) Add filter tool functionality
    - plan
        - "Move it all together to NOT GOOD."
        - Remove this prompt."
        - EDIT this prompt to add."
    - ‚ÜíPass because the automatic generation of prompts has reduced the need for manual operations.
- (pass) Is there a difference between "by X" and "in X style"?
    - I'll pass on that kind of thing, since the automatic generation of prompts absorbs it and eliminates the need for humans to understand it.
- Mastering the art of inpaint
    - I was able to ‚úÖ.
- ü§îAutomatically post to Insta.
- Create a painting style network in Scrapbox.
    - Automatic submission to Gyazo
    - JSON Generation
- It's like using Thompson sampling for automatic prompt generation...
- I have switched the output folder by the date of generation, but I have not been able to solve the problem of "adding to the folder while reviewing" when I want to "review today's minutes" at 9:00 p.m. (I can just wait a day to be okay with this).
    - Need the ability to give instructions that say, "We're going to start the review now, so write in a different folder next time."
