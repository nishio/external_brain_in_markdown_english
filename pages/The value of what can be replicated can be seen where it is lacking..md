title: "The value of what can be replicated can be seen where it is lacking."
---

- [The [[value]] of something [[duplicable]] appears to be zero in an environment where it is frequently replicated and plentiful
- You only know when you take it to a place where it hasn't been replicated yet and is [[lacking]].

When knowledge in a community follows a development process of "replicate and improve, then replicate and improve it again," the value of that knowledge within that community is underestimated
- The value of this knowledge is only understood when it is transported to a community that does not have that knowledge.

relevance
    - [[Knowledge Traders]]
    - [[Time Machine Management]]
- [[Excess, not deficiency]]

There was an argument that this composition would disappear because of the accelerated distribution of information through SNS (specifically X/Twitter).
- but in reality, it is divided into information that flows to SNS and information that does not, and the former has become excessive.
- Information overload makes it difficult to find valuable information among a lot of information, but it's difficult to discover it.
    - [[Attention is a scarce resource]].
        - [[connoisseur]] power needed
    - Can broad listening solve the problem?
        - The "buzz" and the "people who copy the buzz and talk about it" become one cluster.
            - I know it will stand out with the current TTTC, but if we put in a more aggressive "being talked about a lot has no value" algorithm...
                - I came up with [[originality filter]].
