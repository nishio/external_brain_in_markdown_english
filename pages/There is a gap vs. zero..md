- Mr. A says, "There is a [[gap]] between P and Q," to which Mr. B responds, "No, P is [[Not zero.]] too."

concrete example
- Ms. A.: "Women feel strong anxiety when they walk down the street at night."
- Mr. B: "Even men are insecure."
Ms. A noted that there is a [[gap]] in perception between men and women, as in "women are more anxious than men" or "a higher percentage of women are anxious."
Mr. B, on the other hand, interpreted Mr. A's statement as an assertion that men have no insecurities and refuted it.
