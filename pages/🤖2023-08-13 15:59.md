Project success depends on balance between members' motivations and market value
- Information itself is close to zero value because information is easily replicated; summary tailored to one's own situation (= personalization) has value
- It is important for members to stay involved in a project because it fits their situation and interests
- I'm happy when there is a balance between what I "want to do" that matches my situation and interests, and what the market will value for it.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - What can be easily copied has no value, so the fact that "I have done this" and the interest that "I want to do this" are important.
    - If it is a multi-person project, each person has different interests and contexts
    - Hopefully there is someone who can match that well, but if not, I hope AI can do it, a new form of teamwork by AI.

Combination of Explore Net and KJ method is effective for problem solving
There is a problem of lack of reasons for members' involvement; clarification of roles and leaders' ability to complement themselves are important.
The relationship between tacit knowledge and discomfort is important for applying the similarities between GTD and the KJ method to other productivity methods.
A new approach to profit from uncertainty, emphasizing perspectives from AI and other life forms as well as humans
Convert information from a broad perspective into a form that can be processed by humans using information organization methods such as the KJ method, and share tacit knowledge between humans and AI.

### Digest

Project success depends on the balance between members' motivation and market value, and the combination of exploratory nets and the KJ method is effective in solving the problem. In unexplored junior projects, there are problems where members have little reason to be involved, and it is important to clarify the division of roles and the leader's ability to complement themselves. In addition, it is difficult to apply the similarities between GTD and the KJ method to other productivity methods, and the relationship between tacit knowledge and a sense of discomfort is important. A new approach is needed that emphasizes perspectives not only from humans but also from AI and other life forms, and that benefits from uncertainty; it is important to use information organization methods such as the KJ method to convert information from a broad perspective into a form that can be processed by humans, and to share tacit knowledge between humans and AI.

### New Ideas

The idea that "project success depends on the balance between members' motivations and market value" may be related to Nishio's idea that information is easily replicated, so the value of the information itself approaches zero, and that a summary tailored to one's situation (= personalization) has value. This illustrates the idea that the value of a project depends on the individual circumstances and motivations of its members.

The issue of "members having little reason to get involved in unexplored junior projects" may be related to Nishio's idea that personalization in a small community is important. This illustrates the idea that in order for members to stay involved in a project, it is important that the project matches their situation and interests.

New thinking: "The success of a project depends on the balance between members' motivations and market value. However, the value of information approaches zero, and personalization for each individual situation is critical. Thus, the value of a project depends on the individual circumstances and motivations of its members. It is also important that the project be consistent with the member's own situation and interests in order to keep him or her engaged in the project."
