I will extract a few thoughts from this journal that have long-term value and comment on them.

- Equality of Currency and Credit and its Impact
    - It is interesting to note the expression "equality under the measure of gold." It points to a characteristic of modern society in which the credit of the currency outweighs the credit of the individual. One consideration in response to this is that the development of the monetary economy has changed the relationships between people, and individuals are now valued on a monetary basis. This has led to a critical perspective on the current neglect of non-monetary values such as social value and contribution in the community. The power of money and its impact is a thought that has long-term value in considering issues of social inequality and distribution.

- Modes of Exchange and Social Change
    - The perspective that "[[the invention of better preserved food]] changed the forms of labor and the structure of society" captures the link between historical changes in modes of production and social structure. The understanding that agriculture facilitated settlement and even influenced subsequent trade and the formation of cities is important in terms of considering social evolution in terms of modes of production. This perspective is also relevant to the social changes brought about by modern technological innovations and global economic trends.

- Different Intentions of "[[equality]]"
    - The contrast between "equality where those who have much share with those who have little" and "equality where those who have little seek to share what belongs to those who have much" illustrates that the same word "equality" can have different motivations and intentions. This distinction is very important in discussions of social welfare, taxation, and redistribution. Considering which equality is justified under which social circumstances provides a perspective from which to build sustainable social institutions.

- The meaning of rituals and traditions and their transformation
    - Questions such as "[[Ritual Reversal]]" and "What is [[tradition]] in traditional Buddhism?" prompt a reevaluation of the value of [[tradition]] and culture, as well as thoughts about its sustainability and transformation. Traditions and rituals are often accepted uncritically, but by questioning the significance behind them and the process of their formation, it is possible to find new perspectives and values. How to situate tradition in a changing society is an important topic and requires a long-term perspective on the balance between innovation and conservatism.

These perspectives offer important insights into the state of contemporary society and change, and are of long-term value.
