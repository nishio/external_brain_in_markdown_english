- It's only 1:00 p.m. and there's a heavy rain and flood warning in Tokyo,

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1571173587398307841): I started a 7-day trial of Palmy just in time for the date change, and I've already done the "Oh, really?" thing 3 times, so it's a free trial. I've already had three "Oh, I see" sessions, so I'm getting a lot out of this free trial. My wife advised me to write it on a sticky note and put it on my PC right now.
- Crysta stands for CLIP STUDIO PAINT
- The style of "painting a picture by layering many fine lines" that I had assumed is not a good idea because it is time-consuming and slow.
    - What did I misunderstand, or did I overgeneralize the pencil drawing method?
- Trying to stop the line at the goal slows it down and makes it dirty, so the goal is penetrated.
- Practice Results

- [[Folder overwrite content disappearance issue]]
- After a night's sleep, the deleted 0915 and 0916 were restored.
    - However, as expected from the results of the experiment at hand, the behavior is that "the contents of 0916 are overwritten by 0917," so the lost data is in 0917.
- 2468 folders in 0917
- Folder 4197 of 0914
- Deletion of 0916 23:12 on 17th
- Deletion of 0915, 16th 21:25
- First, make a backup of 14 and 17 at this time.
- Rewind this folder."

    - The folder is being deleted before the move takes place.

    - I see that you can specify the restore point by looking at the file operations performed instead of specifying the time of day, which is convenient.

    - I could rewind.

- Huh? Your hands are much easier to move even though it's only been a day?

- Photo tracing.

It seems like a good idea to keep it simple and do the beginner's stuff without taking any tall courses.

I heard the second day of the course and went back to day one.
