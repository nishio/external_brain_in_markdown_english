Background processes running unaware

The Walking Experiment,
Maybe there are background processes in humans that are operating unknowingly.
That is, of course, a limitation of resources, but in any case, we are not aware of it, so we can't grasp it.
Usually it's in equilibrium, with usage increasing and decreasing.
If you overuse it, it will fill up and problems will surface.

Maybe originally, as resources become scarce, the frequency of "noticing" and "coming up with" them decreases.
The frequency of "forgetting" goes up and automatically adjusts itself.
When the management system is external (not only AI systems, but also when someone else manages tasks and assigns tasks that are beyond your capacity)
I don't think anyone knows the person's capacity, which is why they put in a collapsing amount of tasks.
