title: "I can't write steadily."
---

A journal I wrote when I was working on the first book I ever wrote in my life.
- At that time, I wrote that I hoped to be able to run a full marathon in the future, but 14 years later, now that I think about it, I am not yet able to run a full marathon...
- I realized differently after I wrote, "I seem to have become selective about the races I compete in that produce results in the shorter races."
    - I'm not in a race, I'm running in a direction where no one else is running I'm running on a road where no one else is running.
    - Let's put it on another page: [[I'm on a road where no one else is running.]]

- >  I think it was a mistake to try to imitate the type of person who writes continuously and persistently when I don't have [[continuity]] to begin with. What would happen if I suddenly ran a full marathon now and tried to follow a veteran runner? I think that's the situation I was in.
- >  I would like to be able to run a full marathon in the future, but for now it's not possible. And the constitution can't be changed overnight. So you should solve the problem in a way that works for you.
- >  In other words, I can't write in a way that [[untiringly]] builds up to the point where I can't do it now, and I should do something more savage. By "[[savage]] things," I mean that I was asked to make a calculator, and since it is no fun to just make a calculator, I made a function calculator that can define functions, or I was asked to make a rock-paper-scissors agent, and since I thought that with random OK rules I might not win even if I did my best with the algorithm, I ran with the story and made it a one-liner. Or, when asked to talk about Jython in 5 minutes at the beginning of a session in the early afternoon when you feel sleepy, you make Fibonacci audible with MIDI to wake up the audience. Why don't you do a few more cases of that kind of savagery and write about it? And then, after you've done those wild things, why don't you make a chewed up commentary on it?
- >  I mean, you're already emulating class inheritance with hashes, outputting Fibonacci music to files, and doing other pretty barbaric things...
