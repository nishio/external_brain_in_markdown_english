- At [[ScrapboxSQUARE#2]], I don't remember what prompted me to mention [[Takaaki Mada]], and he told me that he had had a conversation with me at Scrapbox.
    - [Loose contact points and knowledge sharing to foster culture in startups - - Conversation: Takaaki Umada, Hongo Tech Garage, University of Tokyo & Tomoji Nagasawa, Scrapbox [https://medium.com/@scrapbox/](https://medium.com/@scrapbox/) nagasawa-umada-116653e71b6b]

> Umada: I myself use nouns such as industry names as tags, but I think one direction is to take the approach of basing connections on the relevance and similarity of predicates and verbs. People tend to tag what they see, but I think we could use something like Christensen's [[job]] as a tag. If the connections between jobs are visualized, we might be able to notice, "Oh, here's another job or issue like this.

Oh, this has to do with [[active bracketing of verbs]].

- [[Christensen.]] noted [[job-to-be-done]] ([[errands to be taken care of.]]).
This is not much of a new story, but what was told in "[Sell the hole, not the drill.
