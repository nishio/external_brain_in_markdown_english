[What is the @mentions feature for GPTs? | OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8908924-what-is-the-mentions-feature-for-gpts)

For example, if you have "GPTs with different knowledge" with different books loaded, you can call up another GPT in the middle of a conversation with one of them and use it.
