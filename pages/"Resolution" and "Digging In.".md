title: '"Resolution" and "Digging In."'
---

from  [[Enhance resolution]]

- Some people use the term [[delve into]] for the concept explained in [[Enhance resolution]], and when talking to them, I interpret the term as being used synonymously with "enhance resolution" or "increase resolution".
- On the other hand, when I use it, I use it unconsciously.
- Digging down" assumes the vertical axis of "[Above is abstract and below is concrete.
- There is no such nuance in "increasing resolution."


- [Similarity -> What is the difference?
