title: "Share what you don't know"
---

I thought at [[ScrapboxSQUARE#2]].
- It is useful to be able to share the feeling of "I don't know" without shame
        - [[Selling the Red]]
    - In Scrapbox, all you have to do is bracket [[Words you don't understand]] in someone else's writing.
        - With many tools, when you don't understand a word in someone else's statement, you ask, "What does that X mean?" is a psychological hurdle to ask the question.
            - But to leave it unacknowledged lowers the [[Quality of Communication]] very much.
            - The person using the word thinks, "Of course it should be understood without explanation," or "It should be understood because no questions are asked."
                - I wrote about this story in [Abbreviation survey needed
                - [[Afraid to say, "I don't know."]] Some people
                - Mechanisms to alleviate fear are important.
    - In the culture of a well-run Scrapbox team, there appears to be a shared perception that bracketing words in other people's sentences is a "good thing"
        - A page can be created at the end of a link.
        - You can write a messy description.
        - What matters is gradual improvement.

    - [[Scrapbox is good for studying.]]
