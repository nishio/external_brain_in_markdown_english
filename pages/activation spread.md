The short version--
- Spreading activation ([[spreading activation]]): A term in cognitive psychology that states that when a concept is verbalized, neighboring concepts are activated in the semantic network, and peripheral verbalization proceeds.
- [Priming effect: A phenomenon in which the immediate preceding verbalization facilitates recall and comprehension of related words.
    - [[refinement]] ([[elaboration]]): A process in which relevant information is detailed and structured, triggered by verbalization.
- (Gendlinian) carrying forward: a process in which a word pushes a "feeling" forward to the next expression, and the surroundings become words one after another.
If you want to say it in a practical way, "[[Chain of verbalization]]" or "[[Linguistic cascade]]" is also easy to understand.
E.g., "When you verbalize A, activation diffusion occurs, and the surrounding area becomes a chain of verbalizations."

Roger. I'll bite the bullet and sort out the "verbalization calls for verbalization" phenomenon in the Gendlin system.

What is happening in the Gendlin framework
- Felt sense (felt sense)
    - A "thick feeling" of an entire situation that has not yet been put into words. It is neither a mere feeling nor a concept, but a "totality of experience and circumstance.
- [[direct reference]] ([[direct reference]], [[direct comparison]]) / [[handle]] (handle)
    - A small word (metaphor, word, sound, etc.) that can be reconnected to the felt sense. This becomes a "handle" that allows you to reconnect with the felt sense as many times as you wish.
- [Resonance check
    - Apply the candidate phrase to the felt sense and listen for a slight "fit/difference" response from the body. This is the criterion for judgment.
    - Related: [[uncomfortable feeling]].
- [Carrying forward
    - When exposed to a word that increases the degree of fit, the felt sense is micro-displaced and the next aspect becomes "reachable.
    - → Whenever this [[displacement]] ([[felt shift]]) occurs, the linguistic possibilities of the surrounding area expand.
- [Explication
    - It is not only a process of "copying" into a pre-existing vocabulary, but also a process of remaking the felt sense side through words. Words are not the result, but a step in the process of creation.
- [Crossing
    - When two or more felt senses/contexts are crossed, a new precision emerges. This is the catalyst to expand the "verbalization" of peripheral areas at once.
    - Related: [[Story intersections become atoms...]].
- [Circumlocution
    - The core is "surrounded" by multiple modalities such as definitions, metaphors, examples/counter-examples, and diagrams. The surrounding itself causes carrying forward.

In short: Appropriate phrasing takes the felt sense one step further, thereby opening up the horizon of "what can be said next. This is the core of the "verbalization promotes verbalization" mechanism.

Differences from cognitive psychology terminology (why gendlinistic?)
- Activation diffusion/priming is an explanation for the spread of associations.
- The crucial difference is that the "transport" is selected from the expanse by the "sense of conformity of the body" and the situation itself is remade ("generated" rather than merely recollected).

Practical mini procedures (one round of 3-5 minutes)
- Spatialization: Put the noise of the head to the side and pay attention to the "overall feeling" of the object.
2. handwringing: come up with three different candidates, such as one word, metaphor, sketch, etc.
- Resonance test: Apply each candidate to the felt sense and listen for "yes, a little better" or "no".
4. observation of micro-displacement: note the looseness, street, and direction at the moment of matching (this is the next clue).
5. wrap around: definition/metaphor/example/counter-example/figure, enclose one more layer and retest.

Recovery when things don't go well
- [[Empty word]] check: Words for which the description is respectable but the body does not work are marked with a hold mark (△).
- Insert intersections: try to intersect with another context (user perspective, time frame, constraints).
- [[Modality switching]]: words -> rough diagram -> words. Often a step forward when a diagram is inserted.
    - Related: [[Format Change]].

Example (uncomfortable design meeting)
- Felt sense: "The specifications feel sticky".
- Handle -> Resonance: "The evaluation axes are mixed up" -> hits a prickly spot.
- The result of the process: The following sentence "Quality, speed, and fairness are mixed in the same layer" can be "said".
- Go around: draw a 3-axis relationship diagram -> further "axis priority reversed before/after release" emerges (more language around the periphery).

A small checklist
- (Does your body feel a little more comfortable/feeling like you can move on? (If yes, go forward)
- Can you surround the same nucleus with three points of definition, metaphor, and example?
- Have you tried crossing (different viewpoints, different times, different parties) at least once?
- One figure or table in between? (Modality wraparound)

Summary phrases (for use)
When the carrying forward occurs in this phrase, the felt sense is reorganized, the crossing works, and the periphery can be said one after the other."
If necessary, take out a specific subject (such as the current project text) → do a resonance test together.
