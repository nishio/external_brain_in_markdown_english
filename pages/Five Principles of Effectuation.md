<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Effectuation is a systematized process of decision-making and action that successful entrepreneurs use to overcome the uncertainties they face. The concept, proposed by Professor Salas Sarasvathy in 2001, advocates a way to create the future using [[available resources]] as a starting point, as opposed to the traditional [[business plan]] based approach. The five principles of effectuation are explained below.

### [[See Pawns]] ([[Bird in Hand Principle]])
- Entrepreneurs start with [[the resources they currently have]] ([[who they know]], [[what they know]], [[who knows them]]) and leverage them to explore new opportunities. This means [[initiating action without a clear goal]].

### [[Consider the Affordable Loss Principle]] ([[Affordable Loss Principle]]):
- The principle is that when taking risks, one should focus on the acceptable extent of loss (loss) rather than [[potential return]]. This encourages decision-making in situations of high uncertainty.
        - [[tolerable loss]]

### [[Lemonade Principle]] ([[Lemonade Principle]]):
- Emphasize the importance of viewing unexpected events and surprises as opportunities. Even when things don't go as planned, we should have the flexibility to turn them into advantages.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It means turning sour lemons into lemonade.

### [[[Patchwork Quilt Principle]]
:]
- We encourage the creation of new markets through cooperation, not competition. Entrepreneurs build relationships with stakeholders (investors, customers, partners, etc.) to jointly work toward their goals.

### [[[Pilot in the Plane Principle]]
:]
- The idea is that the future is shaped not by projections, but by the entrepreneur's own actions. Based on the belief that one's actions have a direct impact on the outcome, one must proactively shape the future.

These principles provide a practical guide for entrepreneurs to identify and realize new business opportunities by offering creative and effective problem-solving methods in an uncertain environment. Effectuation is a useful approach not only for entrepreneurs, but also for innovators and leaders in all fields.
