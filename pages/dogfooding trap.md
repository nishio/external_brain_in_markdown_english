title: "dogfooding trap"
---

- We use our own product X ourselves on a daily basis ([[dogfooding]])
- Since everyone in the company is a user, the accumulation of know-how occurs much faster than the market average.
- This results in a situation where most people in the company have "knowledge N that has a high cost of acquisition for most people in the market".
- To achieve a certain goal:.
    - Low cost to use X for those with knowledge N
    - Low cost to use another product Y for those who do not have knowledge N
        - Because knowledge N is high cost, "obtaining knowledge N and using product X" is also high cost.

continued: [[Dogfooding hinders knowledge acquisition...]].

    - > The people who are dogfooding, so to speak, are paralyzed by the difficulty of the subject.
    - You're not going to be able to recognize the "difficulty" that the majority of the market will perceive.
    - The "difficult-to-learn knowledge N" is assigned the word "[[Vertanshaun]]" meaning "worldview".
