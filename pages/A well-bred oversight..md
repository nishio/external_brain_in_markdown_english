title: "A well-bred oversight."

> If you don't experience something like [[well bred person]], [[exquisite and elegant, with a witty sense of humor and a wry sense of humor]], you may be left with something [[something overlooked]]... I guess...


> [Doragonsyoten](https://twitter.com/Doragonsyoten/status/1637619606935465985) [[Grave of the Fireflies (Japanese horror movie)]], that is a well-bred child. That's why they are so insensitive to the poverty of the aunt's family and the [[envy]] feelings that are directed toward them there. Well-bred people don't guess other people's feelings without their permission, and they don't ask people's opinions because it's impolite.

> [kansu68](https://twitter.com/kansu68/status/1637952334235058176) > I think so.
>  From my grandson's own perspective, he lacked "something" for those around him.

>  I went by "elegant and kind grandmother" (WW)

> [kansu68](https://twitter.com/kansu68/status/1637954596772675585) > If you ask me, ...... grandmother's outings were definitely accompanied by someone (mainly my grandfather) I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not.
>  You must have been worried in many ways...

But if she doesn't have a chance to experience the outside without a guardian, she won't be able to get "the perspective of someone who can see everything from a holistic point of view".
