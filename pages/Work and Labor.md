- Mr. [[Jun Kuikei]] says
>  [[work]] to do with [[spontaneity]].
>  [[toil]] to do it with [[peer pressure]].

Things that have developed a bit in my mind after a day.
    - [[want to do]]" that you are doing [[spontaneous]] is [[work]].
    - What we "[[should do]]" in [[sense of duty (obligation)]] and [[peer pressure]] is [[toil]].

- [[What is work?]]
