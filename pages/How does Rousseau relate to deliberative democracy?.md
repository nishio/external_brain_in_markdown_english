[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] was an important influence on later thinkers such as Habermas and Rawls in the ideas of deliberation and democracy. The concept of "[[the general will]]" in [[Rousseau.]] and the idea of [[consensus building]] in [[social contract theory (e.g. Rousseau's)]] are closely related to the theory of deliberation.

- General Will and Consensus Building
    - In The Social Contract, Rousseau proposed the concept of "[[the general will]] ([[volonté générale]])," which seeks the good of the whole rather than the selfish will of the individual. [The general will is formed as a result of deliberation of the public interest by all citizens" and aims at an agreement that contributes to the well-being of the whole. This idea is connected to the foundation of deliberative democracy in that through deliberation, individual opinions and positions are reconciled, ultimately leading to a decision that serves the interests of society as a whole.

- The ideal of [direct democracy
    - Rousseau believed that true freedom is achieved through the direct participation of citizens in decision-making. Therefore, Rousseau's philosophy includes the ideal of direct democracy, in which all citizens participate equally and reach consensus through deliberation. The model in which individual opinions are sublimated into the general will through the process of deliberation is one foundation of deliberative democracy.

- Rousseau's association with Habermas and Rawls
    - Habermas and Rawls interpreted the deliberative process in a way that was based on Rousseau's idea of the general will, but applied it to modern social structures. Rousseau's ideas have influenced contemporary ideas of deliberative democracy in the sense that deliberation creates harmony between the individual will and the public will. However, Rousseau's direct democratic ideal differs in that it envisions discussion and active political participation of citizens on a small scale, whereas Habermas and Rawls focus on consensus building in a modern, large, diverse society.

As such, Rousseau's concepts of the general will and direct democracy can be understood as a theoretical precursor to deliberative democracy and can be seen as laying the foundation for modern deliberative theories by Habermas, Rawls, and others.
