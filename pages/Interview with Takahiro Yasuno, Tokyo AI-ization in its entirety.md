- We propose a "broad listening" approach that uses AI, GitHub, and other technologies to gather a broad range of voter opinions.
- Our goal is to use technology to improve the efficiency of government and promote economic growth.
- We have a vision to use AI and digital technology to improve services in various fields such as healthcare and disaster prevention.
- We also want to focus on childcare support and education, and to increase Tokyo's competitiveness through the use of technology and the development of human resources.
- We also recognize the need to ensure that no one is left behind by technological advances.
- We aim to create a society where people can participate in politics and entrepreneurship according to their abilities and aptitudes, regardless of age.
- It advocates a "middle path" between centralization and anarchy in order to achieve digital democracy.

Yasuno emphasizes the significance of having people with knowledge of technology participate in politics, and proposes a new form of politics that combines traditional political methods with technology.
