title: "New people grow in new areas with potential."

> [Psychs](https://x.com/Psychs/status/1899716267172614162) If AI continues to get better, there will be fewer and fewer training opportunities for junior people because the work will be almost entirely done by senior people alone. It may become more and more difficult to even get the first job in the first place unless you originally like and are interested in the job.

> [Nkzn](https://x.com/Nkzn/status/1900005201853243598) This was a similar discussion recently among senior people in my company. We already have the design capability to give instructions to AI, so we don't feel that much of a sense of crisis and just need to adapt accordingly. What we need to think about is what kind of [[growth opportunity]] we can give to the younger generation in such an environment.

I think this is just a "decreasing need for manpower" as far as "this senior can see," and new people will grow up in new areas with more potential.
    - [[The move appears to be a reduction to those who focus on the old]]

Maybe it's essentially this way.
> As someone who has a certain amount of responsibility for the training of junior staff in the field, I have an obligation to take action in reality (even if posterity may say it was a waste of time).

Being tied to this job, it's like, "How do I educate them [[in this area]]?"
- The organizational structure has become trapped in the assumption that work will come from senior people and that growth opportunities will be provided within this organization.
- If it's not there, you'll have to go outside to get it.

[There may also be a problem on the recipient side, who does not grow unless given the opportunity to grow.

The seniors who stay in an organization will take care of the juniors, the type who don't jump out of an organization.
