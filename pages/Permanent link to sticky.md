Permanent link to sticky
    - When a sticky has [[Permalink.]] and you jump from there to the map where the sticky is used,
    - I want that sticky to appear in the center.
    - Assumption: [[I want to include the initial camera position in the URL.]]

- Q: Will each sticky have its own URL?
    - A: In the future, it would be nice to have a permalink to the detailed information page of each sticky, where you can see "[[List of maps where the sticky is used]]" or something like that.
