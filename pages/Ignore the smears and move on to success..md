- Ignore people's slander.
- Silence them.
- Do not appeal to the power of the pen to clear your name.
    - What is written will remain forever, so rather than punishing the enemy, it is helping to perpetuate its name.
        - [[There is no revenge better than oblivion.]] 。

- [[Do not fight with others]].
    - Few fight fairly.
    - The enemy will try to use whatever is available, even resorting to sneaky tactics that should not be used.
    - He has nothing to gain by doing so, but it is enough for him to feel a sense of satisfaction that he was able to get back at them.

- [The most ingenious punishment is to make your success a poison for your opponent. [The most ingenious punishment is to make your success a poison for your opponent.

- [[Don't fight what you have nothing to lose]].
    - Even if you defeat your opponent, you cannot get back what you have lost.
