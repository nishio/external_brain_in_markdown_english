title: "Risk Aversion and Innovator Theory"
---

- there appears to be a connection
- I can experiment #Experimentation required
- What about the linear case?
- What about S-curves?

- Think about the decision to buy or not to buy a certain product.
- If the utility x obtained by buying a product is known, you don't have to worry about it, but in reality, it is unknown.
- Let's express uncertainty and say N(x, e)
- In this case, too, if the relationship between the amount of profit loss and utility is linear, then buying at x is correct.
- But as [[prospect theory]] points out, there is a large coefficient on the loss side E(x) = x if x > 0 else k * x
- In a situation where the price of the same product is decreasing or the utility x of the product is increasing with the same price, the larger the k, the more delayed the timing of the purchase #Experiment needed
        - [[innovator theory]] is reproduced.
- 'others are buying' raises the estimate of x [[principle of social proof]].
    - Is this a factor that causes bubbles to occur #Experiment required
- Utility of "buying what others have not yet bought

- The negative utility of losing x amount of money depends on the amount of money you have.
    - I hesitated to buy a $3,000 technical book when I was in high school, but I am less hesitant now that I am working and have a comfortable income.
