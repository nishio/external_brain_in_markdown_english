This time, knowing in advance that the population would be the winning point and that the divine beast would be Pegasus, I thought about the strategy in that case.
- Pegasus's special ability is "to place workers only once a year, even if there are others in the same district."
- I decided to consolidate my building in the same district to reduce the possibility of "I can't take action because people have taken it.

Era 1
1st year
- Temple construction → Pegasus summoning
2nd year
- Public Hall Construction
    - When I tried to use the "Poseidon's Order" morale restoration here, it was pointed out to me that I couldn't use it because it was a Period 2 action.

Era 2
- In this era, increasing the population is a top priority.
    - Everyone understands the benefits of increasing the population and increasing the number of actions, and the gap is not widening...
- Often play mistakes in deciding what resources to take after resources are available from morale.
    - "Can I change it so it doesn't affect other people's play?" "Can't I just change it after seeing where the new enemy appears?" Yes, indeed.
- Harassment of a red player constructing a building in front of an enemy in a plot where my buildings are densely packed.
    - A tsunami would be too hard indeed.
    - We managed to defend by putting Pegasus on top of it.
- Six in three years to Era 3.

Era 3
- 1st year
    - The amount of resources was enough to increase the number of people, but the red player's "Reserved land: players other than yourself will not be able to place" skill stopped the public hall, and it was not possible to increase the number of people.
    - The family's special architectural "monument" was built, but was ruined when it was stopped on the reservation to do a study on how to utilize it.
- Year 2: "Isn't this the end of the year?"
    - scoring behavior
    - T1: More people in the Auditorium (+2 victory points)
        - Research: Anthropology (2 victory points from morale)
        - Research: Medicine (Morale +2)
    - T2: Temple
        - Dedicate wood 7 to benefit 20.
        - Benefit -15 and +25 victory points
    - T3: Pegasus
        - Resource Collection Lumber +10
    - T4: Temple
        - Dedicate wood 8 to benefit 13.
        - Appropriate research
            - 5+2+2 victory points for achieving 7 studies
    - T5: Pegasus
        - Placing people at the waterwheel
        - resource acquisition
    - T6: Water wheel
        - Two times you get 6 resources in one action.
        - Convert all resources 15 in deposits to 10 win advantages
    - T7: Benefit +2 in worship, make it 15 (double bonus at end, effect of +23 final victory points)

The top player was the yellow x minotaur player, about 10 enemy destroyed? Was the bonus for
- Did the number of buildings of the red players who were competing with the green players for the top position not increase because everyone did not destroy many enemies and a tsunami was generated so that the red players did not receive much of a clan bonus when calculating the final score?
- I'm +14 points because my family bonus is population.
- We talked about the disadvantage of not having +1 morale recovery at the top, so maybe there is an advantage to having something that adds up in the form of a bonus at the end of the day.

funny talk
- If you did the "morale 1 -> victory point 2" study, wouldn't you rather have a higher victory point if you didn't use up all your actions?
    - I guess it is better for society not to work than to be unhappy with inefficient labor as civilization develops, so let's all be NEETs with AI taking our jobs (...)
- We'll use "national glory" to restore the morale of the workers in the same block.
    - Oh, people who were exhausted by black labor are now smiling ......, it's worthwhile exploitation (...)

Next time, play both the clan and the divine beast differently this time.
