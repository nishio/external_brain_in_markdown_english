The story is that the Sanskrit in the Buddhist scriptures he studies (8th century) tends to have rounded letters because they are written on leaves (paper made from leaves). This is because vertical lines are difficult to write on surfaces with many vertical fibers. It is an interesting story that "the medium (paper) defines the shape of the letters.

Apparently (because the composition of the leaves, the material of paper, changes depending on the climate zone). I imagine that the relationship between parchment and pen, or between Japanese paper and brush, is actually similar, i.e., the type of paper (composition, fibers) determines the writing style, writing order, and shape of letters, which is a more universal phenomenon than one might think.

The reason I am creating [[Kozaneba digital stationery to organize your thoughts]] is that I believe that some stationery is easier or harder to represent than others. I believe that this bias affects the way we think.
