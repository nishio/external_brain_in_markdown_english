[X user Motoyama📚, author of the book "Reading as an Investment": "There is a book that got me when I was saying "Managers and leaders are too typa bad, I don't ever want to be one", so I'm going to introduce it (long story)" / X [https://twitter.com/ysk_motoyama/status](https://twitter.com/ysk_motoyama/status) /1782710286694453694]
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This is an introduction to the contents of the book "The Moment We Meet Leadership". The book states that leadership is about "influence" and has four stages.

Stage 1 "[[Ego Leader]]": He sees others only as a means of satisfying his own [[needs]] and cannot read the air.
Stage 2 "[[a flunky]]": cares about how others see them and is skilled at [[read the situation]].
The third stage "[[Core Leader]]": The core leader sees others as [[collaborators]] and [[friends]], understands the atmosphere, and can choose not to [[dare not to read the atmosphere]].
Stage 4 "[[Supercore Leader]]": sees others as contributing to [[the transformation of self]] and has a sense of being one with the environment and the world.

The author recognizes that he himself is in the first stage after reading this book and feels that he is now a little closer to core leadership as he has become more aware of how others see him. We strongly recommend this book as a book that helped him improve his leadership skills.
