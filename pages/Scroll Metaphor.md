title: "Scroll Metaphor"
---

Asked people who use notebooks in portrait orientation why they use it that way.
    - [[scroll]]
    - Infinite up and down
    - [[Jumping Gaze]] is missing.
        - [[writing horizontally]] So [[turning one's body to the left or right and standing (when leaving the presence of nobility, etc.)]] is better

- Vertical writing
    - Endless right to left.
    - Image of scroll
        - This is another "scroll."

question
- Is it better to go on endlessly vertically or endlessly in all directions?
    - You want "[[end of a notebook]]"?
        - Could be, for example, a style of taking class notes from top to bottom along the left edge of the notebook and writing associations and small notes on the right.
        - Style where the notebook has a top edge and you write downwards from there
            - Clear starting point and chronological direction from there
    - Is "[[Giant paper]]", which goes on endlessly in all directions, too flexible to use?
        - Is the default infinite only at the bottom, or is it better to add an infinite amount of paper in either direction by explicitly supporting it only when you want to add more paper?

memo
- When I heard "[[use a notebook horizontally]]", I misunderstood it as an assertion that a horizontal ([[landscape]]) field of view is better.
    - In reality, users were explaining different user values.
