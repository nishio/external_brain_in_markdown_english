> [uemura_HR](https://x.com/uemura_HR/status/1903431617143820328) The former head of people analytics at Google recommends three questions that leaders should ask their subordinates. These questions will help leaders openly admit weakness, and subordinates will feel comfortable asking for feedback.

- > If you had to pick one thing I am doing right now that you would like to see continue forever, what would it be?
- > If you had to pick one thing that I don't do much of right now that I think I should do a lot more of, what would it be?
- > What can I do to help you be more productive?
- > "The key here is to ask them to give you just one, not five or ten," Bock said. It's easier to answer that way. Besides, when leaders ask for feedback in this way, subordinates feel more comfortable asking for feedback. There's something contagious about that [[attitude of openly admitting weakness]]."
