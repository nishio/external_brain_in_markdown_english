- It is cheaper overall for someone to acquire and distribute than to [[knowledge acquisition]] individually, so [[global optimization]].
- However, it is not the best strategy for individuals because costs are concentrated on "the person who makes that acquisition"
- If an individual chooses "not to acquire knowledge from outside the company himself/herself" as the optimal strategy, the organization loses a lot by no one acquiring knowledge from outside the company.
    - Similar to [prisoner's dilemma
