- [[Ryunosuke Akutagawa]]'s short stories for children
summary
- In an attempt to rescue Kandata from hell, the Buddha lowered a single spider thread toward Kandata.
- Kandata began to ascend the thread. However, on the way down, he looked down and saw numerous sinners following from below him. Kandata thought that the thread would break under the weight, so he shouted downwards, "This spider thread belongs to me. At that moment, the spider thread broke right above Kandata's head, and he fell back into the depths of hell.

- I said, "Go away, this thread is mine," and the thread broke.
    - In the first place, Buddha's teaching is "Let me pass on my enlightenment and lead many people to the right path.
    - The more people who follow you, the easier it is to reach the right path.
    - And yet you got caught up in [[obstinacy]] and claimed "it's yours," so you broke the thread.
