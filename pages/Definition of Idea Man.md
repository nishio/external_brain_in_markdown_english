title: "Definition of Idea Man"
---

- There are two definitions of [[ideas man]].
- People who come up with [[IDEA]] that no one else has come up with.
- People who have a high probability of coming up with good ideas.

People who have a high probability of coming up with good ideas have a high probability of saying something that is not new.
- Most problems are derivatives of problems solved in the past
- I'll say the obvious again and again.
    - I'll say it again and again if it's a good idea.
        - Do not emphasize [[novelty (patentability)]].

People who come up with ideas that no one else has thought of are new.
- There's no guarantee it's a useful idea.
- Because no one has validated [[usefulness]] for new things yet.
