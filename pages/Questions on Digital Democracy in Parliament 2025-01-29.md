Taiwan has a policy advocacy platform called JOIN, which requires the government to consider and respond in writing within two months to proposals that have received more than 5,000 endorsements in 60 days. The KDP has been reflecting the public's opinions received on social networking sites in its policies and activities, and on January 16, it used AI and digital technology in reference to Taiwan's system to visualize the opinions received, which were made public on January 24. Prime Minister, we would like to ask you about the possibility of a new digital democracy that makes full use of AI and digital technology to promptly gather the voices of the people and apply them to policy making.

The part of the PM's response:.

Regarding the use of digital technology in applying the public's voice to policy, AI and digital technology may make it possible to use more information more efficiently and to perform advanced information processing. On the other hand, there are some issues that need to be sorted out in order to utilize AI and other technologies while ensuring security, such as costs, handling of data, and whether it is appropriate for the government to develop AI on its own. In light of these issues, we will deepen our discussions on how to proceed with the use of AI.
