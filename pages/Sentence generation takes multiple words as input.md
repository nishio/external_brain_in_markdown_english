title: "Sentence generation takes multiple words as input"
---

- LSTM internal states generated by one word are far from the distribution of internal states in training
- Should be able to type multiple words
    - Ignore words that are not in your vocabulary.

- It might be interesting to learn a function that returns a scalar value [[Whether the internal state of LSTM is close to the state being learned]] separately.
