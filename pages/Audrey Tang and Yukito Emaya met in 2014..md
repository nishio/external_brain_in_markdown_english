> I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Emaya at an event in Taiwan in 2014 and 2015. I was very happy to see that our perspectives were similar when we talked, and it was very helpful for me to hear Emaya-san organize his own angle on the philosophers so far.

[[Audrey Tang]] and [[Yukito Emaya]]

2014,15 means right after [[Sunflower Student Movement]], which is not yet a digital minister at all. Neither has [[RadicalxChange]](2018) yet.
For his part, Mr. Emaya has written [[Structure of World History]], but not yet [[power and modes of exchange]].

"Exchange Model X" by Yukito Emaya was a major influence on Audrey Tan
- The four exchange models that Emaya considers can be summarized as follows.
    - A: Quid pro quo exchange with someone you know (government, state, etc.)
    - B: Acquaintances and exchanges without quid pro quo (e.g., family)
    - C: Quid pro quo exchange with a stranger (e.g., at a market)
    - D (Model X): Quid pro quo exchange with a stranger

- This Model X is an open and free replacement relationship
    - A relationship with an unspecified number of people who, like a family, help each other when needed without asking for anything in return.
- Audrey Tan wonders if digital technology can be used to achieve this Model X
- Trying to apply the framework of Emaya's philosophical exchange model to modern society.
- The power of digital is opening up new possibilities for social relationships.


Decentralized exchange models such as cryptocurrencies and exchange model X
- Whether the decentralized exchange model is a realization of Model X
    - The key issue is how to ensure trust among participants.
    - In exchanges between strangers, the question is how to gain basic trust in the system

- Especially in cases like knowledge exchange, it is essential to have a relationship of trust that the knowledge provided will not be used in a way that is unwanted.
    - The method of building this trust has not yet been fully resolved (Mr. Emaya).
- On the other hand, Audrey Tan sees the concept of Model X as "building trust with every person in the process of sharing with everyone"
    - Vector reversal, as in Wikipedia, where you publish first and then make edits over and over

- Positioning the digital space as a "testing ground for future possibilities" and exploring the feasibility of a new exchange model
    - How to build trust based not only on technology but also on human nature is key.



Realizing exchange model X could eliminate the struggle for resources (Audrey Tan).
- Mr. Emaya's Model X complements the values of liberty, equality, and fraternity
    - Audrey Tan strongly shares this view.

- Also, Glenn Weil of the RadicalxChange Foundation's philosophy is in the same vein as Emaya's
    - Weil redefines the purpose of economics as "creating more value through cooperation among people."
    - This is in line with the Model X concept.

- It's a struggle, though, given that resources are limited,
    - Working together, we can create more value.
    - Audrey Tan interprets Model X's assertion to mean that

- And if this Model X can be realized digitally, he foresees that it could be applied to real-life politics and could eliminate resource conflicts. Furthermore, he hopes that it may lead to the birth of a new democracy that is not bound by capitalism.

For Audrey Tan, the digital space is a testing ground for future possibilities. It is an attempt to explore new social models and create a better world through the power of technology. It is an ambitious attempt to apply philosophical concepts to the real world.
