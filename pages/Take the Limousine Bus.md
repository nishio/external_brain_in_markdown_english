title: "Take the Limousine Bus"

from  [[Diary 2023-09-24]]

Get to the airport early.
    - =I haven't decided when I'm going to leave home.
    - = I kind of procrastinate.
- I worry that I'm forgetting something.
- Departure!
- no PC, no iPad, no Books from now until Thursday evening

There are members already working at the airport due to differing interpretations of "early."

I don't have any particular rationale for doing so, but I would go to the Shinjuku bus terminal and take the [[limousine bus]].

- [[Rational" is an ambiguous term.]]

The train to Haneda Airport leaves in 5 minutes, will it make it in time?
- Ticket vending machines are crowded.
- I made it in time, it was the last seat.
- Well, if you miss it, it comes back 20 minutes later.

- [[Rational" is an ambiguous term.]]
I don't see anything on the limo bus ticket about when it's scheduled to arrive.

- I entered the [[Yamanote Tunnel]] and now I can't get a location.

    - I see.
        - [[Fog of the World]] was crashing, so maybe it's a very unexpected environment?

    - [[Haneda Airport]]

- Will Terminal 2 be the first to arrive?

Huh? The fog hasn't lifted since the last time I was at the airport.
- I wonder if the fog of the world has stopped...
