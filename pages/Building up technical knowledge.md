title: "Building up technical knowledge"

- [[technology]] is built step by step [[understanding]].

When the buildup of that understanding results in some catchy outcome, there will be a large number of people X who only want to understand about the catchy outcome when they have no buildup of understanding within themselves.

Often those people X are not willing to invest the time in doing the building up of the foundation.
So explanations are created that reach the objective with minimal understanding (1).
- Deep Learning is like the least squares method, and so on.
- Deep Learning doesn't include division as a component, so it's not a dominant player in all existing calculations, and so on.

These explanations are "Good job piling it on!" which is a commendable feeling,
Even if X hears this kind of explanation and thinks he understands it, his understanding will collapse at the time of the next technological advance.

I'm struggling with this type of explanation.
- Should we think that it is right to provide because there is a customer need?
- Should we consider that it is over-quality to guarantee even future understanding to a customer whose only goal is to get a feeling of understanding, and that this is fine?
- Should we assume that since there is no benefit in "feeling understood," it is not right to pay the cost of creating it?
- Is there no benefit in releasing this type of explanation for the large number of people who do not act, and should it be used to encourage action or improve the choices of those who do?
