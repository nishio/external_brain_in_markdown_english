<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I've read Merleau-Ponty's commentary on Husserl's phenomenology and want to see how well I can explain it without looking at it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "hussar" is this "hussar"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>A philosopher famous for his phenomenology, who, according to Merleau-Ponty, introduced the discussion of language, which was not so mainstream in the philosophical genealogy.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "Merlot Ponti" is this "Merlot Ponti"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Merleau-Ponty is also famous for his philosophy on language, the contrast between institutionalized language and the language that is being born.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about this "Merlo Ponti"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Now I want to talk about Hussar.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I would like to verify the extent of my understanding of Husserl by answering the question.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about this "hussar"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Early on, I was interested in the unifying nature of language, but later I came to believe that language becomes a unified system when people try to use it to express themselves.

- >  Merleau-Ponty is also famous for his philosophy about language, the contrast between institutionalized language and the language that is being born.
- Where is this "Merlo Ponti" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>👎 Merlo Ponti
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  I would like to verify how well I understand Husserl by answering the question.
- How do you know this "hussar"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I read the commentary.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "read" is that "read"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I chopped and arrayed them in Kozaneba, this as an experiment in assisting the process of reading.

- >  I would like to verify how well I understand Husserl by answering the question.
- What do you hope will happen regarding this "hussar"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I hope that now that I know a lot about Husserl, I'll read Heidegger next.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to the "hussar" for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Hussar will never change, so I hope I can answer your questions.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>As for "hussar," can it be done?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I'd like to do a test to see if I can answer that question.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  Hussar will never change, so hopefully I can answer your question.
- Where is this "hussar" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Listen first.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Yes, sir.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Let's see, if we consider that language is the accidental result of various past events, it is incomprehensible that it should be a unified system of meaning, it would be chaos!
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Hussar."
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>And so, instead, we approach a unified system by trying to express what people want to say about themselves.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Hussar."
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Well, I can't explain it anymore, I don't understand much.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Hussar."
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>the end
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I wanted to verify how much I understood, but it was still hard to explain without seeing anything.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "verify" is that "verify"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>If you understand enough, the words will come out, if not, you don't understand yet.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  Hussar will never change, so hopefully I can answer your question.
- Where is this "hussar" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>That's before Merleau-Ponty.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>You're talking about why I'm trying to understand Husserl, because Eugene Gendlin's ideas were very much in line with my practical purpose, which was to focus on how to put the unverbalized into language, so I was studying that, and I was studying the Merleau-Ponty text that he was introducing me to. I ordered and read the Merleau-Ponty text that he was referring to, and it was a commentary on Husserl and then a development of Husserl's commentary, so I decided to experiment with that as a test bed and try to use Kozaneba to go through the process of reading and understanding a difficult book.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What does that "hussar" look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It's a source, I don't know if it's useful per se, Eugene Gendlin and Merleau-Ponty both developed a lot of things based on Husserl's story, so it would be good to know where it's Husserl-derived.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Where does this "hussar" come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I was interested in it because Eugene Gendlin introduced it, and I originally went through my "phenomenology" thinking "hmm, I don't know, it doesn't seem useful for my life", but I'm finding out that it's actually quite relevant in regards to my current interests.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>

- What "language" is this "language"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Language used as a means of expressing what you want to express
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between its "language" and "hussar"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Husserl paid a lot of attention to language, rather philosophy is the beneficiary of language.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is that "language" the same as "Hussar"? Is it different?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Language Encompassing Philosophy?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to the "hussar" when its "language"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>The philosophy he does is itself done using language, a process that Merleau-Ponty argues should be repeated

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Ummm, I don't know.

- >  The philosophy he does is itself done using language, a process that Merleau-Ponty argues should be repeated
- Where can I find this "Merlo Ponti"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Between Hussar and Eugene Gendlin
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between this "Eugene Gendlin" and "Hussar"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>So Eugene Gendlin himself tried to formalize philosophically the concepts that Carl Rogers was using practically, and then he realized that half of it was phenomenology, and he put one foot in Husserl!
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is that "Eugene Gendlin" the same as "Hussar"? Is it different?

- How do you know this "Merlo Ponti"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Maybe you should read the rest of the article and figure out Merleau-Ponty's argument.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between this "Merleau-Ponty" and "Hussar"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Yes, so far I don't see the difference between Merleau-Ponty's and Husserl's arguments, I don't think they are equal, but what is the difference?
