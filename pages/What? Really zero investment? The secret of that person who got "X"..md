title: 'What? Really zero investment? The secret of that person who got "X".'
---

'It's nice you have an X! How did you get it?"
I didn't do anything special.
'What, you can get that much without investment, or did you work some magic?'
No, no, it really was just a coincidence."
'Hmmm, I knew there was no way I could get it without investing anything... I'm jealous and a little bewildered...'

What would you think when a conversation like this unfolds?
"No, of course not!" Maybe I'm just lucky," or "Maybe he's hiding something." There may be a variety of reactions.

But the fact is, no matter what "X" is, some form of "investment" is necessary. Of course, "investment" does not only mean putting money into the company. Investing time and effort, acquiring new knowledge, expanding your network of contacts - in short, everything you put "your energy" into can be considered an investment.

That is why if you just say, "I want X," and don't move, or if you naively think, "I can do that easily, too," your life may become more and more hard mode before you know it.

People who are told, "You are good at having X" are usually the type of people who "look like they are doing nothing, but in fact they have been steadily investing without being noticed. They are like "investors in the shadows" instead of "hard workers in the shadows.

However, we do not all need to aim for the same goal. Some people may think, "I am not invested in X because I am focusing on something else right now," or "Y is more important to me.

The important thing is that if there is something you want, think again, "Well, what am I going to invest for it?" The important thing is to think again, "Well, what am I going to invest for that? It may be money, time, or personal connections. Once you have clarified this point, you will be able to say, "It's nice that you have X! You can proudly say, "I'm so glad you have X!

Yeah, well, I'm a little invested.

Wouldn't that be much cooler?

### Explanation
I tried to explain a concept and came up with a conversational style, but I thought it was not very interesting, so I told [[o1 Pro]] to "make it a little more interesting for the average reader," and he came up with an unexpected sentence ("a little" is...).

> [[You have to invest to get it]].
>  "Nice to have an X."
>  "What kind of investment did you make to get X?"
>  "Not particularly."
>  "I can't do it.
>  ---
>  Make this a little more interesting for the average reader.

I said, "Give me an interesting title," and this is what I came up with.

impressions
- The average person wouldn't say, "What, you can get that much without investment?"
    - I'm talking about people not realizing that "there are things you can't get if you don't invest..."
