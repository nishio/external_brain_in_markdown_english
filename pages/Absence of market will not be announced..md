title: "Absence of market will not be announced."
---

I thought it was obvious, but maybe not so surprisingly, so I'll write about it.

Absence of market will not be announced.
- Just like a failed experiment doesn't make the paper.
        - [[publication bias]]

When some business is announced in a business context
- A: There are barriers to entry
    - If there were no barriers to entry, the only barrier would be to go unnoticed, so common sense dictates that you wouldn't go out of your way to make an announcement that would increase competition.
- B: It is an advertisement to attract customers
- C: It's not even made yet to begin with, it's an [[observation balloon]] to see if there are any potential customers.

In case B, only in small-scale cases where the technology is easy to imitate and the presenter cannot afford the cost of advertising, a large company can take it away by copying the whole thing and dropping ads.

Large companies are at a disadvantage because they need to make quick changes in stage C, where they haven't found customers.
