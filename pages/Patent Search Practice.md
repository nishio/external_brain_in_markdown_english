- [Deduce the number of the patent on which Nintendo based its lawsuit against Coroplast (Kiyoshi Kurihara) - Personal - Yahoo! News](https://news.yahoo.co.jp/byline/kuriharakiyoshi/20180111-00080329/)
    - Difficult because the patent number is unknown.
    - Search J-PlatPat to narrow your search to 199 results.
    - Checking from the oldest to the newest, thinking that a wide range of patents means that they must be old.
    - Interesting to see the referee info.
