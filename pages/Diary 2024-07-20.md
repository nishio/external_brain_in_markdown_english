> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1814458970851160551) I'm developing a disease that makes me want to create something completely new, even though it's far easier to prepare for a talk by cutting and pasting what I've presented once.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1814470099757346985) I wish I could just make it, but it makes it harder to coordinate time!

I'm on holiday, but I'm working on my lecture materials.
