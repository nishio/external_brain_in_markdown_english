title: "A story that only those who act can get."

Even in an age when language models create stories, only those who act can get the "I did this in the past and it has led me to the present" story.

It's still [[Connecting the Dots]]. Looking back, the dots are connected.

Context: "Nishio-san's story about connecting Scrapbox and ChatGPT has been getting a lot of attention, but this is a story about storing a huge amount of data in Scrapbox, seeking an entity that can interact with you whenever you want, and trying to replicate yourself, and all of these directions have been bundled together. It's all a bit of a bundle, isn't it, emo?

I think that episodes of actually acting and what happened as a result are an important weapon in a world where the starting line has been radically changed by ChatGPT.

- > The giant language model is a new highway, taking us fast through the zone of "what has already been written" to the front lines of confronting "what has not yet been written." It is like a forest. There we work to clear the forest of "what has not yet been written.
