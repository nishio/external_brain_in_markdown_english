The center is [[average]].
Population density is higher near the center. (more people per unit area).
But since [Periphery is larger in area,
The number of people living on the periphery is larger.
- The [[average group]] is not necessarily [[the majority]].

----- Conversation that triggered
- [[Freaks become the majority.]]

Q: Then the local [[oddball]] is now an [ordinary person

No, there is a difference between having a large number of people and being [[usually]]
- Usually means [[average]] here.

Q: Is the image of the convexity of the distribution flattened?

That distribution, I think you're thinking in one-dimensional space,
For example, when a 3-dimensional sphere is divided in half by distance from the center, the outer half is 7 times larger
Mean is in the center.
Even if the number of people per unit volume was greater in the center.
Since the volume of the denominator is larger in the periphery
The "oddballs will be the majority."

To use a more neutral phrase, "the average person becomes a minority."
I have a bias against the words "weird" and "normal.
weirdo → a person whose [[sensor]] output deviates from the average output.
Normal -> average output person
