Thread 1
- I wrote this in [[KJ method study group @ loftwork pre-map comment #638dc07eaff09e000090104a]](case 14):.

    - Think about whether you can draw a line between each label in this large group and the outside labels, so that it becomes a mesh!
    - Supplemental:.
        - There is another group above with a large number of elements, but this one is connected to the outside world a lot, so it's not much of a problem.
        - The group below has become isolated.
            - It's like having a group of people from the same high school all talking at a college freshers' party.
            - If you don't talk to more people outside the group, you're just extending past relationships and not creating new ones.

- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>Q: "How exactly do I disassemble and place them?" and my hands are stopped!
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>A:
    - Make a copy of the current one and keep it nearby, and only use the sticky note in the center!
    - I think we've become so tied to the structure of the labels we already have that we can't change them to a new place.
    - So, I will leave it by once.
    - and make "words that come from the central sticky note and associate them with it".
    - The placement of these will be around the center sticky note.

    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Let's draw a line from the central theme, which of the labels we have now are connected to the central theme?

    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's looking good!

        - Red is "good."
        - Blue says, "There's a valley here."
        - Green is "unclear where it leads."
- (Final state)

    - I noticed it when I was painting the final state.
        - The original had exactly the same thin black lines connecting the labels and the enclosure.
        - I felt "difficulty in distinguishing" and "[[cognitive burden]]" in this.
    - The center sticky, "What do you want to do with X?" was mentioned that the "X" was changed to "X".
        - What do you want to do?" he said, "I feel that if I put 'what do you want to do' in the answer, I will only get a list of answers that already exist.
        - I had to go through...
        - Basically, "change it to make it easier to do" is a good thing.
        - I was a little curious as to why all the answers were lined up that were already there.

Thread 2
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>I have a delicate problem where to place the first sticky from the center sticky,..,
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>At first, it's fine if it's appropriate. From the second sticky, the influence of "positional relationship with already placed stickies" becomes stronger and stronger.
- relevance
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>Sharing of my realization: I found myself trying to extend the arrows in four directions from the center due to the square shape of the sticky notes. By thinking of the theme in three dimensions, I would like to connect the two-dimensional preconceptions.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>In that sense, it would be a good idea not to align them perfectly horizontally or vertically, but to dare to place them at an appropriate angle.

Thread 3
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>I'm not sure if I'll be able to extend the sticky note from the center with a sticky note in front of it, but my hand is pretty much stuck.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Well, you are all very skilled, and if this were the case, I would not have needed to have the labels prepared in advance.
    - Making stickies in advance is just "to extend the work time that may be missing".
    - So I think it is better to leave it by your side once than to let it stop you.
- Supplemental:.
    - If we do a second session, maybe instead of "please go make 25 labels," the advance preparation should be "put the theme in the middle, add the associations as labels, draw a line, repeat 25 times, and leave it with a branch growing.

Thread 4
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>I'm not sure whether to connect them with a line or just keep them close together since they have the same content.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>If it's not an exact match, let's make it an [- if it's not an exact match, let's make it an exact match line.
    - Supplemental:.
        - By not being used to "drawing the line," we tend to unconsciously avoid drawing the line!
        - So the intent was, "If you're not sure, let's make it a line.
        - The "if it's not an exact match" was superfluous, but that's not the rule.
            - It's rather worthless to put labels side by side with exact matches.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/川喜田二郎/icon' alt='川喜田二郎.icon' height="19.5"/>is expressed this way in [[let the chaos speak for itself]] p.289. ([[How to use clips on Explore.net]])
            - ![image](https://gyazo.com/77dcddc698ec321c5dd5ce1fbbbfbf18/thumb/1000)
            - This was the age of no computers, so I made a tearful effort to use clips to display the relationships while allowing the labels to be moved later!
            - I think the following interpretation would be easy to realize this with the current tools
                - Generally, "relationship" is "one line."
                - The "conflict relationship" is "two-headed arrow ↔."
                - Similar relationships, sets, and sequences are arranged without lines.


Thread 5
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>It's hard to choose a theme that doesn't seem to have the right answer for me...
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Shift the question a little, "What action do you think you should take next to find the right answer?" And?
    - (I'm saying this at random without looking at the map)

Thread 6
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>Q: I try to draw conclusions quickly from a few labels...
    - Is it important to start with a rough label without a goal in mind?
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>A: The first step is to create a tightly connected net.
    - Because the "conclusion" you made before it was made was just what you originally had.
    - So it's not "new".
    - The bicycle is not moving forward.

Thread 7.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>When I have a feeling that distant stickies are connected to each other through different routes, I feel the limitation of two dimensions.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I try to avoid intersections as much as possible, but there are limits to two dimensions, so there are times when intersections do occur.
    - It's a real downer when you say, "I don't write what I think to avoid crossings."
    - So, we try to avoid crossing as much as possible, but if we can't help it, we will cross.

Thread 8.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>1: When connecting from the center sticky, there is a sense that the lines you choose (- / →, etc.) "determine" the relationship,
    - I have a feeling it won't lead to "new insights."
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>2: I don't know if it's a...
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Stop using one-way arrows.
    - Jiro Kawakita did it with just two things: a simple line and an opposing arrow.
        - Tip: [[How to use clips on Explore.net]].
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>1: Does this mean that everything will be done with "-"?
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Yes, everything that is not a "conflict" out of anything that might be related is just a line.
    - As a general rule, "If you're stuck worrying about trying to do something complicated, you might as well not try to do something complicated and do something simpler.
    - It's easy to get stuck trying to do something complicated, like worrying about changing line types or trying to color-code sticky notes!
    - Supplemental: Reduce [[cognitive burden]].
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>1: I see! So it's not a matter of → is absolutely NG, but the most important thing is to be able to proceed comfortably!

Thread 9.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>I'm not sure if the sticky closest to the middle one is what I ultimately want to do, or the action (or activity) that seems to be the most key to what I want to do...
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>We do not know in advance where the concluding notices will appear on the map

Thread 10
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>1: I felt that in some cases, words that you might want to write as labels could look a little different by daring to write them out and place them flat with other sticky notes
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>2: I know what you mean. I think it would be better not to label it immediately.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>: Interesting statement, but probably not well understood by many people, I didn't catch it well either.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>1
    - When you look at a group of several sticky notes, a word that sums them up quickly comes to mind
    - I'm going to resist the temptation to label them as a group, and treat them as a single sticky just like any other sticky.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I see! Let me put it another way.
        - For a group of stickies, it comes to mind, "This group's nameplate is X, right?"
        - But instead of making it a table-top at one level higher than the elements of the group, dare to make it a sticky at the same level as the elements of the group.
        - There's something nice about doing that.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/4a59c1351074fa7b8ee1f34c6d1d8c37/thumb/1000)
        - 1: Every element of the group is a little different from each other, even the same family has different personalities.
        - 2: To put nameplate X on that group is to ignore individuality and make it "X family".
        - 3: On the other hand, if X is the new label
        - 4: Bring coordinate axes into the group, such as "labels that are close to X" and "labels that are not so close to X
        - 5: Provides a means to get a more complete picture of the group
    - I got the impression that

Thread 11.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>Q: What if it becomes a sticky with only self-explanatory phrases?
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>A: If you're asking yourself the question and getting the answer, why not?
    - (looking at the map) I see, that there are many labels for questions.
    - If you compare it to fishing, it is the stage where you can put the bait on the hook and throw it in, but the fish is not biting yet.
        - We're clearly making more progress than we were at the stage where the hook wasn't ready yet.
        - You can't predict when a fish will be hooked.
        - Questions that can be answered quickly are not important questions.
            - I just posed the question with what I originally knew the answer to.
        - Dangling a lot of fishhooks with questions that don't get answered right away.
            - And then you leave it and do something else, and then you think, "Oh, that's the answer to the question I just asked.
            - This is a fish on a hook.
            - It's worth it to catch this fish.
        - Related: [[Hooks to fish for what has not yet been verbalized]].
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>If you have a question, you can answer it at the right time (some questions are not answered) while keeping it honest.

Thread 12.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>Q: Would you have liked to have had 2-3 enclosures that were not grouped together anywhere so that there was one lone wolf?
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I'll go take a look.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/9fbf5e828a907f2922f501b291dce850/thumb/1000)
    - No problem!
    - You mean the red not surrounded by yellow, which is fine.
    - That said, the group doesn't have a nameplate on it.
        - Label red and yellow groups with an explanation of "what that group is"!

Thread 13.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>When you start to surround yourself with people, you start to develop an ego that says, "I want to put it all together like this.
    - As a result, I surround myself with the feeling that "new insights" are not being generated.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>That "this is how I want to put it together",
        - Is it something you had before you started making maps?
        - Is it newly born?
    - is the problem.

- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I think that's a good thing.
        - New insights gave me a new perspective.
        - → I'd like to look back at the past with that new perspective.
    - I thought you meant...
        - [[Parable of the Hills]]
        - It's natural to want to look back the way you came.
        - The view you see when you look back from the hill is different from what you saw before you came to the hill. But what's important is the new view.

    - > If it's something you've had for a while, the bike isn't moving forward.
    - → I didn't have it before I started making maps either, but I still feel somewhat bewildered.
        - You have a fixed idea of how to tie stickies together.
        - I wonder if it is not well enclosed...
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I saw the map.
    - For now, I think it would be good to put the yellow group on the front page as planned and work on enclosing more yellow groups, of which there are still many!
    - (I felt that there were many parts of the tree that were not reticulated and remained just a tree, in case I have to do it again in the future.)

        - (In the original, the enclosing lines were thick blue and conspicuous, and the related lines were thin black and unremarkable.

- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>A: Well, there is a KJ-like "create a group and put a nameplate on it" at the beginning, but there is almost no net-building going on!
    - Even where the lines are connected, they are almost a "tree" and not a mesh.
    - I feel much less "done".
    - It's hard to recover in the last 25 minutes, so we should try to "tie the line" instead of trying to finish in time.
        - I imagine only doing the first half.

Thread 17.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>It's as if I'm adding more stickies from what I've noticed around them!
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It is good!

Impression 1
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>It's exciting when stickies with completely different thought paths stick together and make sense:boom:.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>That's it! That's what I wanted you to know!
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>When it is done, it just feels good! LOL!

        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/4ccc51de74762aee67f5d53015a6305a/thumb/1000)
        - Connections are discovered between "different branches" with different thought paths.
        - It's fun to pay attention to this "awareness" and to notice even more!
        - If you rearrange these red "newly discovered connections" to shrink them, you will see a different structure than you had previously assumed

Impression 2
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>1: It's interesting that stickies created through a game of association can unexpectedly turn out to be the core part of the game. It's interesting.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>2: Sticky notes are sometimes the key because you don't think you have to write properly!
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>That's good! What?" Isn't this what you were looking for?" That's what you're looking for, isn't it?
    - Supplemental:.
        - The first label that repeats an association has a relationship with the "immediately preceding label," but is far removed from the root.
        - You can move much more freely away from the "structure" you have and assume beforehand.
        - Like a morning glory vine, it can move around and attach itself to another

Impression 3
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>It's interesting that there are unexpected places where things come together and are connected (and conversely, things that I thought were related are not so related).

        - 1: At first, we implicitly assume that these are one group.
        - 2: But if you draw a line and visualize the relationship...
        - 3: "What? I think we'll get along surprisingly well here." It's going to happen.
