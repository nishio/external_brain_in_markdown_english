We have picked out some of the most interesting recent updates to the page.

The first page, "Let GPT4 Propose KJ Legal Pairs," attempts to have GPT4 select two lines of text from a given text and link them together into a single sentence. The result is a pair based on the relationship between the lines of text, scoring how logically connected they are and how easy it is for them to come together. This is an interesting test of the AI's ability to understand the meaning of a sentence and generate new sentences based on that understanding. However, I feel that further study is needed to determine how effective this method is and what possible applications it might have. What do you all think?

Next is the "Kozaneba: Neri Neri" page. Here, a technique is introduced in which one-dimensional sentences are made into chopped fragments and then arranged in two-dimensional space. This is a useful technique for visually organizing and understanding information. However, I would like to further understand through specific examples in which situations this method is most effective and what limitations it has. What are your opinions on this method?

In addition, the "Cannot take a position" page raises the issue of people on the "don't" side not being able to take a position in cases where only two choices of "do/do not" exist. I think this is an important perspective from which to structure the discussion. However, no concrete suggestions have been made as to how this issue should be resolved. What solution would you propose for this problem?

Finally, there is the "Lack of trust in the media, so the minister's own posts are more trusted" page. Here, the decline in trust in the media and the corresponding increase in trust in the social networking posts of the politicians themselves is pointed out. This is an example of the changing media environment of modern society. However, I feel that further discussion is needed on how this phenomenon affects society as a whole and how we should respond to it. What are your opinions on this issue?
