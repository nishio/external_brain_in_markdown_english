title: "The vocabulary that categorizes reality leaves reality"
---

Vocabulary that was useful for describing reality at one point in time may subsequently become mismatched as the side of reality changes

    - [[mid-core]]
    - Distinguish between [[cross-valued]] and pass-by-reference
- The divergence is created by the changing side of reality, similar to the original meaning of [[technical debt]].
