Q: Why do gifts occur p. 138
A: There has been a fear of the natural state of Hobbes since the time of the [[nomadic]] people.
- When you meet another band, you give them a gift before you fight them.
- [[creating peace through giving]].
- This relationship will not last, because the nomadic population will move on.
- Fear of the natural state, urge to leave the natural state
- Hobbes conceived of an escape from the state of nature in the form of everyone submitting to the One "[[Leviathan]]."
        - [[social compact]]
    - This is based on violence.
    - There is a social contract that is not based on violence, which is [[reciprocity of gifts]].
        - Kula trade in the Trobriand Islands
        - This is a small "[[world system]]"

    - [[principle of reciprocity]] is assumed.
    - Give first and be assured that your gift will be returned.
    - If attacked, fight back.
    - In the long run, belligerent bands became exhausted and disappeared, thus establishing a society based on reciprocal gift-giving.
    - The historical fact is that that equilibrium state was not maintained.
    - At some point a cycle occurred in which the stronger became stronger, and a single strongman "[[leviathan]]" was born
