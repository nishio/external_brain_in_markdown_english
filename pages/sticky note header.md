- There are about three ways to group [[tags]].

When you have a group of stickies and want to move them to another location due to space limitation, etc.

(1) Simply move those stickies to another location
(1') Put a nameplate for the group ("Group A" in the figure)

The original KJ method would not be hindered by this method because it spreads out everything when it should be listed.
However, when I try to apply the KJ method to task management, I don't open and list all projects on a regular basis.
- (I should, but I tend not to.)
Looking only at the list on the left, we forget about Group A (=Project A) and see only minor tasks that have not been turned into projects as a priority.
This is undesirable from the standpoint of "[[Prioritize important matters]]."

(2) Add the nameplate to the list on the left as well.

This solves the problem of forgetting that Project A exists. We thought this was fine, but we realized that there was a problem with this as well, which is what prompted this article.
In this way, tasks that are one level of abstraction are lined up alongside highly concrete and detailed tasks. For example, "write a paper" and "port software ZZ to iPad" will be lined up next to "do XX to YY".
This can cause demotivation due to the task not being specific.

(3) Add the project name to the list on the left, and also move the "[[Next Steps]]" task there.
Although this concept is specialized for task management, it is ultimately important to break down tasks into "[[A clear next step]]," and it is not good to hide them away on a separate sheet of paper after they have been broken down.

The nameplate works to express that "this specific task A1 is for the purpose of achieving project A".
Also, when task A1 is finished, even if you immediately discard A1 or move it to the completion zone, "[[A nameplate with an empty space next to it]]" will remain to remind you, "Oh, I have to get the next task from the A summary sheet.
