title: "outcome oriented"
---

> [@mah_lab](https://twitter.com/mah_lab/status/1667039179795214337?s=20): it seems that saying outcome oriented instead of [[agile]] conveys the intended meaning. When I say agile, there is a sense that it is only conveyed as a process, like [[scrum]]. What I intend is to switch from [[output-oriented]] to [[outcome-oriented]]. If it is outcome-oriented, there is no other choice but Agile.
