[nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1636412574672781315): I was disappointed that my friend didn't get it when I said "ChatGPT is [[smart-ass]]", but I'm glad to know that at least Dr. Rekimoto will get it. I was relieved to know that at least Dr. Rekimoto would get the message.

[[ChatGPT]] is [[bright]] [[fool]].

- I was talking to ChatGPT4 and I was thinking that it looks like something... deja vu... I'm starting to get the feeling that there are guys like this out there.
- With this kind of guy.
    - He's quick-witted and babbles words at high speed.
    - I know a lot of terms and scatter them as appropriate.
    - When you talk like that verbally, most people can't follow you, so they feel "huh, a smart person is talking about something difficult that I don't understand".
        - So I'm sure this behavior is reinforced by the benefits of usually doing that kind of activity.
    - But if you read the recorded statements carefully and in writing, they don't say much.
        - It's just a bunch of random words you came up with.
            - Well, that's how LLM works, so that's how it is, I guess.
    - The stories are connected topically, but there's no big picture as a whole.
        - I feel like I'm just embellishing a poor assumption with clever vocabulary because I don't know what I'm talking about.

I was transcribing and summarizing the above on 2023-03-18 and a picture came to mind.

- 1 people have a hard time putting what they want to say into words, and even when they do their best to verbalize it, the story can be twisted.
- Compared to that person, a person who can tell a straight story is perceived as "smart.
        - [[fluency]]
- If we consider this axis as "smart", GPT4 would be "smart".
- However, when I actually talked to GPT4, my feeling was the opposite: "This guy is an idiot acting like he's smart.
- What gave rise to this sensation?
- Possibly related to
        - [[Ideas inspired by a single stimulus]]

- Maybe it's because the topic is just rolling along and no [[convergent move]] is being made?
- It appears to be just running around at high speed in a lower-order space, since there is no such thing as multiple things being [[comprehensive]] and [[becoming higher-order]].
- Think carefully [[Stack boxes on top.]] People feel smarter.
