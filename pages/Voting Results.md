Some people think that the "result of voting" in the case where "it is no use putting in a candidate whose [[result]] is the same whether [[voting]] is done or not" is implicitly "who [[will]] be elected. However, there are others who think that "it is only a [[short-term]] result" and consider the result of [[long term]] activities after the election.
