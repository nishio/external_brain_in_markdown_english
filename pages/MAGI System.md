<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT/icon' alt='GPT.icon' height="19.5"/> The "MAGI System" (マギシステム, [[MAGIシステム]]) is a fictional supercomputer system from the popular science fiction anime "[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]." This explanation is for those unfamiliar with Japanese culture or the specific anime series:

- Concept in Anime: In "Neon Genesis Evangelion," the MAGI System is a highly advanced and integral technology within the story. It consists of three independent but interconnected supercomputers named "[[Melchior]]," "[[Balthasar]]," and "[[Casper]]."

- Unique System Design: The system employs a form of [[collective decision-making]], akin to a council. Unlike regular computers, it's designed to replicate [[human-like dilemmas]] and decision-making processes, making it a unique blend of technology and human psychology.

- Developer and Human Element: The MAGI System was developed by Dr. Naoko Akagi, who is also the mother of Ritsuko Akagi, a key character responsible for operating the MAGI in the series. What makes the MAGI System particularly unique is that it incorporates elements of Dr. Naoko Akagi's own personality. It integrates her thought patterns as a scientist, a mother, and a woman into each of the three computer systems, making it the first of its kind to have a personality transplant OS (Operating System).
