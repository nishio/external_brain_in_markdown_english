- The problem with using spot instances is that they might be killed in the process, so if you send the intermediate or final product to some persistent storage, you can be assured that it will be terminated
- The next problem is that the process is finished but the instance is allowed to play without realizing that it is finished. Is it possible to send a notification when the process is finished or if the instance commits suicide?
