<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Find out about criticism of [[Apple]]'s new "Crush" ad for the iPad Pro.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Apple's new iPad Pro ad, "Crush," depicts the destruction of creative tools such as music instruments and art supplies and their transformation into the new iPad Pro. The image was intended to symbolize the iPad Pro's inclusiveness of all forms of creative expression, but it was perceived as a disregard for traditional creative tools and sparked significant backlash on social media and among the creative community.

Critics felt the ads were inappropriate and contrary to the values of sustainability that Apple often promotes. In particular, the destruction of an iconic creative tool was seen as wasteful as it lacked respect for the art community. In response to the backlash, Apple acknowledged that the ad "missed the mark" and issued an apology, canceling plans to air it on television and expressing its commitment to supporting creativity worldwide.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>There are several reasons for the criticisms critics have had of Apple's "Crush" ads. The main points of criticism are summarized below:
- DESTRUCTION OF CREATIVE TOOLS: The ads depicted the physical destruction of musical instruments and art supplies. Critics felt that the destruction was wasteful and disrespectful, as these tools have been loved and respected by artists for many years. In particular, it was emphasized that these tools are symbols of individual art forms and are essential to many creative tasks, so the iPad Pro cannot completely replace them (9to5Mac).
- Contradictory to sustainability: Apple has long emphasized its environmentally friendly image, promoting, for example, the use of recycled materials in its products. However, the destruction of creative tools shown in the ads was criticized as being inconsistent with such sustainable values. It was felt that for an environmental company to promote an image of deliberately destroying things was at odds with the brand's beliefs (MacRumors Forums).
- IMPACT ON CREATIVE: The visual representation of the ad's message to those in the creative industries, that traditional tools would be destroyed and replaced by digital devices, was seen as a symbol of technology overwhelming creativity. Many creatives reacted against the ad's message because they value the inspiration and feel that physical tools bring and do not see these as objects that should simply be digitized (AppleInsider ) (Gadgets 360).

These criticisms prompted Apple to strongly reconsider its advertising strategy, resulting in Apple's public apology and the cancellation of the broadcast of its ads on television.

Although the above arrangement by GPT4 as of 2024-05-13 did not tie to a specific culture or region, there were some statements in online discussions, especially early on, that tied to a specific [[culture]], "[[Japan]]," as seen in the MacRumors title.
As one of the Japanese who actually criticized it, I have mixed feelings about this reaction.

In the Japanese-speaking world, there were not a few claims to the effect that "only Japanese people are criticizing.
As of 5/8
- ["Disappointed in Apple" New iPad Pro Video Firestorms Instruments and Camera Destroyed by Press Machine - ITmedia NEWS](https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/2405/08/news118.html)
- > A promotional video for the new "iPad Pro" released by Apple CEO Tim Cook on May 7 at X has been criticized by Japanese users.

- > [kouta_hikichi](https://twitter.com/kouta_hikichi/status/1787994551648768346) Isn't this ad particularly difficult for Japanese to accept? Japan has a spirituality in which objects have life in them in an animistic worldview. It is easy to imagine that crushing it from above with a huge force (as seen in Apple, the tech giant) would cause considerable rejection.

- > [koyori_zZZ](https://twitter.com/koyori_zZ/status/1787989023673504193) I thought the promotional video would never be popular with Japanese people (I don't want to see the instruments smashed either), and I was right.
- >  I wonder if this feeling is not conveyed at all due to differences in national characteristics, or if Apple no longer has much faith in Japan as a market and has decided to make Japanese popularity a secondary concern.

- > [takeruko](https://twitter.com/takeruko/status/1788103733668409609) A video of an Apple event crushing musical instruments is "Only in Japan is it critical? Why?" Many people are looking for answers to the question "Why is it only Japan that is critical? During the bubble era, there were variety shows in Japan that showed people taking care of things roughly, right?

- > [Sonehara07](https://twitter.com/Sonehara07/status/1788071680864346340) You seem to be criticized, but shouldn't you criticize Apple for not being born in Japan in the first place? It's the same with Windows.

5/9
- > [zeriyoshi](https://twitter.com/zeriyoshi/status/1788229427870273647) Since it's seriously almost exclusively Japanese who are complaining about Apple's iPad Pro promotional movie, you should realize that it's based on cultural context. I think you should be aware that it is based on cultural context, and that it was caused by the popularity of Hydraulic Press videos in the US, and should be respected in the same way as other countries' food culture.
