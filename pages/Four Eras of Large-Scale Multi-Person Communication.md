> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1755618325508636744) The current emerging innovation is to improve the quality of communication by stopping direct human interaction and let computer (statistics, algorithms, or AI) mediating information transmission.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1755632838198915169) In detail, there was a mixture of many factors in every era, but here's a quick and concise version. Large-scale communication was first opened by "broadcast" with the invention of radio. Replies in this era were "letters to the radio station" and the station decided whether to read them or not

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1755634279265210650) Then with the birth of the Internet (via newsgroups, mailing lists, HTML handwritten text sites, etc.) the blogosphere was born. Blogosphere was born. It was a time when blogs hosted on distributed servers connected with each other by sending trackbacks to each other. (I won't talk about the centralization of what started as decentralized.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1755634704039243961) At that time, in the early days, most of the comments from readers were set to appear immediately, but later, due to the flood of spam comments, more and more authors decided to "close the comments section. Later, due to the flood of spam comments, more and more authors decided to "close the comments section". I am one of those who used to leave the comments section open and then closed it.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1755637642199527906) The stories in this area are not neatly arranged in chronological order, but rather, small births and gradual spreading are occurring. In this area, what would later be called "social media" was born, and that is "mini-blogging". As the name suggests, this was born as a "small and handy blog.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1755637949633622252) There was a time (already at this point) when "social networking services" were created, i.e., when "creating social networks" was considered a value. I'm not going to talk about the fact that there was, because it's off-topic this time.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1755638699357073801) Miniblogging has expanded through a strategy of increasing the number of users by essentially making less capable people users. Tumblr has added a "reblog" feature. This is a feature that allows people who cannot write their own articles to put other people's articles on their own timeline, which would have been mere plagiarism if done by copy and paste when the feature was not available.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1755639142808252595) By systematically making it "OK to do", it became easy to duplicate other people's articles, and even users who cannot write their own sentences This was not yet the case with the retweet function at that time. This was brought to Twitter, which at the time did not yet have a retweet function, and was later systematized.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1755639636767240518) Another major innovation is Twitter's character limit. This was to create a culture in which it was acceptable to post fragments of text in a public forum without proper contextual explanation, destroying the preconceived notion that "this is the amount of text that should be published" that blogs had at the time.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1755641042228179162) The third important element is "fast feedback" and "one-click 'like' feedback", but we can skip that this time I guess.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1755641589756727475) These elements meshed well together to create a system that is used by an unexpectedly large number of people. The important point is that this process was not designed with the idea of "creating a place where people can have calm and productive discussions. It was always "let's make something fun that even idiots can use and increase the number of users.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1755642252746256506) As a result, "fragmented statements that are wordy due to word limits and lack contextual information" are transmitted by RT to "a lot of idiots who don't understand the context", and the The emotional comments of the assholes are "fast feedback" to the posters and their fans, and hell ensues!

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1755643316040069193) (I foresee that the post "stupid" will be taken out of context and people who are emotional about the word "stupid" will bite, but now Twitter has a mute function. This mute function was added much later, when it became clear that this function was necessary.)

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1755644329094508789) and here we go to Era4. What do we need to create a forum for productive discussion and what needs to be removed from the current social media?
>  If you want to engage people who can't write their thoughts in writing, then you can't do without a one-click way to express your opinion. If you want to increase people's engagement, you can't do without fast feedback,

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1755645126121230727) You need to get rid of the "human X directly contradicts human Y, which is then notified to Y" part. If that is removed, the opportunity for online battles to occur will be much lower.
>  (As I was writing this I was thinking that we might also need to mute certain speakers for after the outbreak?)

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1755758682246443037) The point of this story is that asymmetric communication, where "someone speaks and others listen" scales easily, but communication does not scale to more than a few people. Humans cannot understand 100 people talking to each other.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1755759476035170557) So, in order to achieve "discussion with a large number of people on an equal footing," the pre-digital practice of "[[talking directly to people]]" needs to be avoided once and for all. Therefore, it is necessary to avoid the pre-digital practice of "talking to people directly.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1755760655741911230) If we abstract the word "communication" by removing the image of "talking to people" from it, we can see that the methods of "[[voting]]" and "[[buying]]" as a way for a large number of people to participate and produce output We can see that "[[voting]]" and "[[purchase]]" are two examples. Voting is consuming the given right to vote and putting a piece of paper with a politician's name written on it in a box. Purchasing consumes money to move goods.
