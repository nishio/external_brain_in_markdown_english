The argument of aMethod is an instance of NSTimer, which is called when you do

>|objc|
[NSThread detachNewThreadSelector:@selector(aMethod:)
 toTarget:self withObject:aInfo];
||<

The argument of aMethod is aInfo itself.

So, for example, if aInfo is an NSDictionary at the time of NSTimer
>|objc|
NSDictionary* info = [timer userInfo];

I'll do something like that.

Also, NSTimer is a main thread that schedules an event to occur later, while NSThread is a separate thread, so it is necessary to create a separate autoreleasepool at the beginning of aMethod.
For example.
>|objc|
NSLog(@"enter aMethod");
NSAutoreleasePool pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];

I get angered that "I'm not sure what to do. You created a thread but did not create an AutoreleasePool, so you say, "You tried to autorelease an NSCFString when there is no pool!" So you're saying.
