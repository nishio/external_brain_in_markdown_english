I searched for "words I don't understand" and found all kinds of interesting pages, but surprisingly, there were no pages with this title, nor were there any links to them.

It is important to feel free to express "I don't know" in communication within the organization.
    - [[Share what you don't know]]
    - [[Communication as Knowledge Transfer]]
The system should help create a common language within the organization
    - [[Dictionary creation assistance]]

Words in other people's statements that you don't understand need to be researched.
    - [[Abbreviation survey needed]]

- [[Intellectual Production BOT]]
    - [[Subjectivity and Emotion]]
    - [[Find out what you don't know]]
