title: "Unlike chat, Scrapbox is overgrown."

from [/villagepump/best-well-kept](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/best-well-kept).
- When communicating synchronously in Scrapbox, unlike in chat-like tools, you can go back and reconfigure before
    - Go back up and edit
    - change the top and bottom of a line
    - cut out a page
- I think it's important to be able to go back up.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

    - Chat is "one long vine" when it gets going, but when Scrapbox gets going, there is a "[[grow thickly]]" feeling #even if

    - When I first saw the picture, I didn't recognize it as "a plant growing out of a flowerpot" and thought it was "a figure of multiple lines gathered in one place.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/issac/icon' alt='/villagepump/issac.icon' height="19.5"/>

            - The best of the best from each region will gather for the national competition. ...... Like.

                - Lots of information is being pulled from the pages of the past, present, and future.

                    - This diagram itself is from inside to outside because I drew it as a direction of development of the flow of the story, but in the actual Scrapbox, "links" like fruits are formed here and there on the growing branches, and they connect with other plants, so it's bidirectional.
                    - The bigger the plant that grows, the more likely the link is to be connected, and the more likely it is to be dug up again, even if buried.
                    - [[blue link]] is a [[convergent move]].
