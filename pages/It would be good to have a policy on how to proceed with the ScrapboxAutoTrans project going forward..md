<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It would be good to have a policy on how to proceed with the ScrapboxAutoTrans project going forward.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "ScrapboxAutoTrans project" is that "ScrapboxAutoTrans project"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>A project to bridge and interconnect the Japanese project, which is the main editing project, and the English project, which is a translation of "The Art of Intellectual Production of Engineers," with machine-translated content.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "intellectual production techniques of engineers" is this "intellectual production techniques of engineers"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>A coherent amount of interconnected knowledge systems output and published. It has been observed that it fulfills the needs of many people in Japan. Since it does not contain anything specific to Japan, we believe it will fulfill the needs of many people around the world. That is why I am translating it into English.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "mutual" is that "mutual"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Hmmm, they are connected, they are related, and it is more helpful to be aware of the connection to understand them.

- Is there anything else you can tell us about this "mutual"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>As for interconnecting with Japanese projects, the current division of Scrapbox projects makes it difficult to connect, so we felt that a system to help connect was needed, which is one of the reasons for the existence of the ScrapboxAutoTrans project.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>How do you know its "mutual"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I couldn't know if the projects are separated, so I thought it was necessary to group multiple projects together for a view. But earlier, I asked, "Why don't we just put the projects themselves together and create a view for English speakers by narrowing it down?" I realized that
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "project" is this "project"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>The container in which the pages are contained.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  As for interconnecting with other Japanese language projects, the current division of Scrapbox projects makes it difficult to connect, so I felt that a system to help connect was needed, which is one of the reasons for the existence of the ScrapboxAutoTrans project.
- Where is this "mutual" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>In Scrapbox, a page can belong to only one project. However, there are often pages that cannot be clearly identified as belonging to more than one project, and it is a loss to lose the connection by dividing them appropriately.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Obviously, it's a "connection". There are two kinds of connections about this: connections that help me think about it, and connections that help the reader read and understand it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "connection" is that "connection"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>When I think about which of the two types of "connections" is the more valuable "connection," it's the former, the "connection for me." The latter, "connections for the reader's understanding," cannot achieve their purpose if they are machine-generated in large numbers in the first place. They must be a small number of useful links that have been selected and discarded by the author. The former connections for their own sake are useful in making sure that the latter connection choices are not overlooked
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that "connection"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>With that in mind, we conclude that it is better to merge the Scrapbox projects in terms of providing a connection for authors.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that "project"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>The reason why we separated them in the first place is that Scrapbox did not have a function to create a card view page narrowed down to English content. So we can create that part in Scrapbox Reader.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "Scrapbox" is this "Scrapbox"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Memo app to store connections at low cost
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is this "connection"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It's stored in each project in the form of a link. I don't think there's any explicit information about which English corresponds to which Japanese across languages.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is this "project" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It exists on Scrapbox in two separate pieces, but I'm thinking it would be better to merge them.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that "Scrapbox"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It would be good to flag the English version with the icon notation since it is difficult to Undo the merged one.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  I have two separate entities on Scrapbox, but I'm thinking it would be better to merge them.
- Where does this "Scrapbox" come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Putting that question aside, here's the policy summary: merge the two projects, create a view focused on the English version only
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is this "project" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>So then the whole "static hosting of machine translated Japanese projects" story completely floats away, but hmmm, maybe that's something that should be lowered in priority because it didn't come up in the process of translating something valuable into the language, naming ScrapboxAutoTrans and What we're going to do in the future is a mismatch, so this is a pause.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between that "Scrapbox" and "Project"?
