- > Scrapbox data is not technically a book or a book because it is not "bound." The image is that of a large plastic bag filled with loose leaves, but humanity does not have a name for the media format that fits it, so we call it a book for now. There is no other way to describe it.
    - Interesting that you implicitly think that being bound is important for a book to be a book.
    - What is "[[Binding]]"?
            - [[Books are a tool for finitization]]
- It was mentioned from the [[Scrapbook]] article

### Research Digest

We discussed the new concept of using Scrapbox to provide book data: a Scrapbox book has the characteristics of being able to copy and paste full text and to append directly to the text. However, since Scrapbox data is not "bound," it is not strictly speaking a book. Nevertheless, it can be pseudo "bound" by including the order assumed by the author on the table of contents page and by placing links to the "previous page" and "next page".

There are two ways to import Scrapbox books: by creating a new project and importing it, or by importing it into an existing project. However, if you are reading a large number of books, creating a new project will cause the number of projects to increase too much. Therefore, the method of importing into an existing project seems to be a better choice.

Nishio's research notes "[Are you satisfied with the Scrapbox version of your phone?" and "[[Intellectual production techniques of engineers and physical education-type classes]]," the hypothesis is that the customer value of Scrapbox books is that they are "connected with keywords here and there. Also, experiments with placing books in Scrapbox suggest that the lack of links is a problem.

In light of the above, it is important to ask the questions "What happens when the number of books read in Scrapbox increases?" and "How can we make use of this increase by intertwining it with our existing knowledge?
