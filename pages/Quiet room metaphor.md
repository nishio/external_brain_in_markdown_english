title: "Quiet room metaphor"
---

2022-01-23
After immersing myself in [[side of well]] for a while, the metaphors "[[Quiet room]]" and "[[busy room]]" came to mind.

The well is a lively room, waivering, buzzing, and donning. Stimulation abounds. It is fun.

But if you play there, you will not be able to make progress. A lively room is also a [[noisy room]].

I am tempted to return to my quiet, self contained room to work.

What is "[turbulent (era, etc.)"?
- Stimulation comes in.
- Activity is driven by that stimulus.
- Stimulus exceeded [capacity

The stimulus itself is favorable
- If it's in a place with a lot of undesirable stimuli, they're not going to stay, they're going to leave.
- An uninteresting stimulus would simply be ignored.
- I guess I get tired when the stimulation of interesting topics of interest appears more than I can process.

- [[I can't connect scrapbox projects to each other.]]
- Whether it should be connected or not.
- At the very least, I'd like to turn it off when [Desire to work quietly
- Because when the stimulus comes in, it's not "[[quiet]]".

When I tried to understand it properly instead of somewhat, I ended up having to take it back to my room and reorganize it myself, instead of just leaving it there.
