title: "Meaning of expanded in Talk to the City"
---

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>The "expanded" state is used to manage the display state of tooltips (hover tooltips).
In code,
- Normally, tooltips are displayed by mouse hover etc., but when "expanded" is false, tooltips disappear when the cursor is moved.
- If "expanded" is true, the tooltip can be made visible by the user by clicking on it, and then hidden again by clicking on it again.
and other behaviors.

In summary, "expanded" is used as a flag to indicate whether the tooltip is in a fixed expanded view rather than a temporary hover view.
