Audrey Tang, Taiwan's first Minister of Digital Development, and Glenn Weil, Microsoft Chief Scientist and economist, visited Japan today to celebrate the publication of their new book, PLURALITY. At the workshop, they gave a proposal-oriented lecture on the future digital democracy driven by Japan, focusing on PLURALITY. Afterwards, it was an excellent opportunity to deepen understanding through a question-and-answer session with the participating Diet members. A summary of today's proceedings will be made available immediately after the meeting, with the aim of improving the policy-making process and reducing the administrative workload. #Takuya Hirai #PMT Study Group #audreytang #glenweyl #audreytang #glenweyl

> About 30 lawmakers attended the PMT Study Group (chaired by [[Shinjiro Koizumi]]), which was launched by young members of the Liberal Democratic Party to improve the efficiency of policy-making through technology. In his speech, Tan pointed out that "viruses" such as division and hatred are spreading in democracies. He expressed the view that if a system is designed in Japan and Taiwan, where the situation has not yet become more serious, and more voices create better options, it will be possible to "prevent" and "cure" the divisions. After the meeting, Koizumi said that the message he received was that Japan can become an advanced example of a democratic country through the use of AI.

>  The "PMT (policy making tech) study group," started by LDP members Hideto Kawasaki and Masanao Ozaki, has been working to improve the speed and quality of policy making by soliciting opinions from young fishermen across Japan, transcribing and summarizing them in real time using AI, and other efforts. The PMT (policy making tech) study group has been working to improve the speed and quality of policy making.
>  This time, Glenn Weil, whom I met last year, invited me to meet with him and Audrey as they were visiting Japan, and I asked him if he would be willing to give a lecture at the PMT Study Group so that we could all learn together.
>  Although AI has been the subject of some concern about the spread of fake news and lies and its use in the military, both Audrey and Glenn reiterated optimistic and positive messages. On the contrary, they expressed their hope that Japan can be a leading example of how technology can be used to improve democracy.
>  The meeting was a meaningful time, with active questioning exchanged with the council members in attendance.
