The idea that "a work of art is not a representation of an object" is an assertion that is discussed primarily in the context of contemporary art and philosophical aesthetics, and involves multiple backgrounds and interpretations, including the following

1. heidegger's point of view
- [[Heidegger]] stated in "[[The Roots of the Work of Art]]" that "a work of art is not merely an imitation or representation of an object, but a disclosure of its existence."

Point: Art does not simply "reproduce" an object, but serves to reveal its essence and relationship to the world.
Example: Vincent van Gogh's "Shoes" is interpreted as disclosing the nature of peasant life and labor, not merely a depiction of shoes.
2. the context of abstract and conceptual art
With the advent of abstract painting and conceptual art, art was freed from the "representation" of the subject itself and began to take the following directions

Exploration of pure form and color: For example, [[Mondrian]]'s geometric abstractions abandoned the representation of physical objects in favor of the unique order of color and form.
Emphasis on ideas and concepts: works such as [[Joseph Kussuth's]] "One and Three Chairs" do not depict "the chairs themselves" but rather question language and the concept of objects.
3. postmodern perspective
In postmodern thought, art is often said to aim at "generation" or "dialogue" rather than "expression.

Disappearance of the object: According to Jean Baudrillard and others, the object itself has become a "sign" in contemporary society, and art is a place to critique these signs.
Role of the viewer: Postmodern art emphasizes the interpretation and participation of the viewer, and the work itself often has no fixed meaning.
4. the viewpoint of Yuk Hui
In relation to Yuk Hui's "[[Cosmotechnics]]," art is not merely the imitation of an object, but the process of creating new meaning in communion with technology and culture.

Relationship between technology and art: Works of art are considered to play a role in creating new worldviews and values within the context of technological methods and cultural backgrounds.
Conclusion.
The phrase "a work of art is not a representation of an object" indicates that art is more than mere imitation or depiction; it is an act of questioning the essence, concept, and cultural context. This idea transcends traditional views of art and has become an important discussion in contemporary art and philosophy.
