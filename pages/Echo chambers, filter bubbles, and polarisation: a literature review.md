<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This literature review summarizes online [[echo chamber]], [[filter bubble]], and [[polarization (light, radio waves)]] studies. The main findings are as follows
- It is estimated that around 6-8% of people in the UK are in [[politically biased]] online news echo chambers.
- In many countries, people use a relatively diverse range of media, with only a minority in echo chambers.
- [[Algorithmic personalization]], contrary to the [[filter bubble hypothesis]], leads to somewhat [[diverse news contacts]]. On the other hand, active [[selective contact]] by some people may produce echo chambers.
- In the long run [[ideological polarization]] is decreasing in many countries, while [[emotional polarization]] is increasing in some countries. News media polarization is not as high in European countries as in the US.
- Similar trends may be observed in online discussions about science, but empirical research on the presence or absence of echo chambers is still limited.
- The messages of the political elite have a significant impact on news coverage and public opinion on scientific topics.

Overall, the results suggest that echo chambers and filter bubbles are not as wide as one might assume. However, polarization varies widely from country to country, and there does not appear to be one clear trend.
