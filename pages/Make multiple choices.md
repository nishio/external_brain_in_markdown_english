> If we are not careful, we tend to talk about "let's get someone [[starting a business]]," so it would be better to set a goal of "making multiple choices.
>  Show those who don't have the option of starting their own business the option of starting their own business, while those who only have the option of starting their own business are shown the option of joining a company that will support their project, or licensing their intellectual property.

>  Since no one knows the correct answer as to which option is appropriate, the outside world, which cannot take responsibility for failure, should not tell you which one to choose.

>  If we remove even the [[assumption]] that "you can't choose that option," things will go in the right direction because we are all capable of moving forward on our own. There is no need to be in charge or in control.
