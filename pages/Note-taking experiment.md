title: "Note-taking experiment"
---

I tried taking notes while watching the video, but halfway through the video I couldn't save it because it was oversized...
    - [[Shuji Hamaguchi's Idea Generation Method]]

About two pages of A4 notes written after watching a dozen minutes of video.
- There were about 1,400 passes,
- Maximum document size is 1 MB
    - Several hundred bytes per pass.
- You'd be surprised how much data you can create by taking notes.
    - I think I could have written more before.
        - The fact that each path has information on line styles, etc., also eats up space.
    - You can save some percentage by working out how to hold the data.
        - but not essential.

The size issue can be eliminated by nesting the items in a sub-collection, though,
Assuming 90 minutes of class notes, the number of passes would be over 10,000.
It's at a level where you shouldn't receive the whole thing every time.

If you're using it for note-taking.
Save only the portion you have added, not the entire document.
Rendering of only the last few pages, not the entire document
Rendering and caching of old pages as images
We need to make per

But note-taking isn't a priority that goes that far.
The most important thing is to do the KJ method digitally and more comfortably than on paper,
It's already more convenient than paper thanks to after-the-fact expansions and such.
So it seems like we should hold off on the note-taking and make a more solid use case here.
