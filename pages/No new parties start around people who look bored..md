Context: [[IT got boring.]] / [[party's over, middle age begins]].
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1826175482150400038) A new party never starts around someone who looks bored and says "the party is over".

> [MobileHackerz](https://x.com/MobileHackerz/status/1826417545844597185) When you get to middle age, you can start your own party. If you have fun, people will come. Thanks to you, that's how it is around here.


from  [[Boredom" is a "mirror."]]
You don't start a new [[party]] around someone who looks [[bored]].
