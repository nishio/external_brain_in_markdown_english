- [[Apologize and you'll die]] people have a theory that they are suffering from "the disease of killing people who apologize" first.

> People who have the common disease of "if you apologize, you will die" are actually suffering from the disease of "it's OK to kill the person who apologizes" first....
> So he's willing to kill the person who apologized, so he can't apologize and be on the receiving end of being killed himself....
