title: "To express is to be aware"

> "For the subject who speaks, to express is to be aware. He does not express himself merely for the sake of others. He expresses in order to know for himself what he is aiming at" ([[Merleau-Ponty.]], Takahashi (trans.), [[Challenges of Phenomenology]]).

I write for myself to know, not for others, but [[you may read]].
- That's why I write so much in this Scrapbox [[Half, but not all.]]
- Sometimes I write a summary article with a feeling of "[[Since I have received charity from the world, I should also give charity to the world]]".
