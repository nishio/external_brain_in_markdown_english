### About Unit Ownership
- [[Unit ownership]] refers to a situation in which a thing or right is shared by several people, each of whom owns a part of it. For example, if you own a room in an apartment building, that room is owned by an individual, but the entire building is shared with other residents.
- [[Smaller]] means that large assets are divided into smaller portions to make them more accessible to many people.

### About "Life"
- The term "[[life]]" does not merely refer to biological survival, but includes the broader concepts of [[(human) life (i.e., conception to death)]] and [Hours. It often implies personal experiences, feelings, memories, and the value and meaning of an individual's life.

- This reflects the idea that a person's life is shaped by family, friends, and society, as well as by his or her experiences and actions.
- In other words, our "life" is not entirely our own, but can be interpreted as "compartmentalized ownership" with the people and society around us.

This metaphor could be said to indicate that human existence does not exist in isolation, but in relationship with others. Our actions and decisions affect not only ourselves but also many others, and conversely are influenced by others and society. Thus, "compartmentalization of life" offers a profound insight into how our lives are part of a complex network of interconnectedness.

    - I was assuming a more realistic story that being [[employed (long term)]] is like [[sectional ownership]], where you get money in exchange for recognizing the rights of others to control part of your life time.
