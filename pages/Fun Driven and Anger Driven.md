context
    - [[Anger is a driving force]]
    - [[Anger is a form of self-pity]]

I used to think anger was toxic.
- But the claim that "anger at the gap between the ideal and the reality is what drives improvement."

So what drives me to avoid anger?
- I think it's an "interesting" emotion.
- There is a gap between the ideal and the reality in the world.
    - Anger-driven people get angry at gaps and try to change reality.
    - Interest-driven people say, "That's interesting," and try to look at it more closely.
        - For example, my [[human bug]] collection is a collection of cases where real people are not behaving ideally.
        - When you happen to see a discourse on social networking sites that you think is strange, most of the time you don't directly try to correct the person's behavior, you just collect it as an example.
            - I was right when I was young: [[How I stopped throwing masakari.]]
    - After careful observation in an interest-driven manner, we often wonder, "What if we did this? What if we do this here to solve this problem? and "What if we did this?
        - Then you'll want to give it a try.
        - This is not a desire to improve the status quo, but a desire to validate understanding
            - So when you say, "I tried it and it didn't work," you may be satisfied with "Oh well, this method doesn't work.
            - Lacks the ability to tackle problems with persistence
        - You're fun-driven, but there are [[tenacious]] people out there? Why is that?
        - → [[Interesting if you stick with it.]] and I know empirically that
