title: 'Not "useful," but "helpful."'
---

- The question "Is X [[be useful]] or not?" is a strange one.
- Not automatically helpful.
- You [[make use of]].


- Similar to [[False dichotomy]] in that it asks a dichotomous question and it is wrong, but [[How to take the axis of confrontation]] is a strange pattern
