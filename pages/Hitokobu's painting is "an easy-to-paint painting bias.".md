[The bias of easy drawing"

It is the "easy picture bias" that makes it possible for "one person to belong to a diverse and homogeneous community" and each person needs to be multimodal to make this possible.

    - A and B can share and converse on advanced topic X; B can take advanced Y from his specialty and relate it to X; A cannot understand Y by itself, but can understand it by relating it to X
    - Even if not comprehensible, a verbal conversation can detail the link between X and Y by asking questions
        - T: Do I need to be verbal?
            - I think chatting is fine if the exchange is brief enough that you don't forget what you're talking about.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - If I forget, I lose my link to X.
    - I get the feeling this is what you want AI to do.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
