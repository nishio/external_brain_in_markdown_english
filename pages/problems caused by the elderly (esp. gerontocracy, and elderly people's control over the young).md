title: "problems caused by the elderly (esp. gerontocracy, and elderly people's control over the young)"
---

There was once a time when humankind naturally acquired the concept that some people are treated as slaves and took it for granted.
Later, the concept of "that idea is not correct" was born and human civilization was upgraded.
This is the process of applying corrective patches through education to the thought patterns that humans in their natural state tend to have.

Similarly, there are harmful thought patterns that people in their natural state tend to have as they age.
While some elderly people act in harmful ways due to their thought patterns, others act in beneficial ways.
So this thought pattern is not inevitable.

I would like to clarify what causes this harmful thought pattern and how it can be avoided.

remarks
- Although correlated with age, age is not a necessary condition
- So the phenomenon of "young but old thinking patterns" can happen.
    - It would be good to observe how the young person fell into the old-age thinking pattern to better understand it.

relevance
    - [[human bug]]
