title: "You can read it as you want it to be read."
---

Some texts shared with others are "readable" and some are "readable".

People who have a high psychological cost of publishing their thoughts presume that others will feel the same cost. As a result, they believe that "anything published at a high cost must have a reasonable intention," and they falsely assume that the text is something they "want" to be read.

- [[I want you to read it.]] and [[You may read]].

relevance
- There's also a difference between "I want certain people to read it, but others can read it," and "I want a lot of people to read it."
- There are sentences that pretend to be sentences that I want a lot of people to read when I want certain people to read them.
    - People who write that way seem to have some kind of internal condition that is not good.
    - On the other hand, some people are self-conscious enough to assume that a text not intended for a particular person is about them.
