leave

I thought about looking back, but haven't done it.
- Monday was a holiday, but I was working on materials, presented on Tuesday, and then went home in the morning on Wednesday, so I took the rest of the day off.
- I'm guessing the pattern will continue to be a 2-week changeover in the weekly journal.
- When the weekly journal changeover is not stable, my spirit is not stable either because I'm too busy.
