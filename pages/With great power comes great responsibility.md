1793 French National Council (Revolutionary Period) " une grande responsabilité est la suite inséparable d'un grand pouvoir " (Great responsibility comes with great power) (great responsibility comes inseparably with great power)
1817 British House of Commons, William Lamb (later 2nd Earl of Melbourne) "the possession of great power necessarily implies great responsibility"
1906 Winston Churchill "Where there is great power there is great responsibility ..."
1945 President F. D. Roosevelt (unpublished draft of speech) "Great power involves great responsibility."

An ideological lineage that goes back even further
- [[Gospel of Luke]] 12:48 "To whom much is given, much will be required."
- Islam [[Hadith]] "Every man is a shepherd and responsible for his flock."
