title: "Why Blog"

> I've recently gone back to the drawing board for my learning research and am learning new areas by blogging about them, and it reminded me of why and what my old self used to write about in [[Blog]]. I was writing to help my old self, something I already knew a little bit about and something my old self didn't know a little bit about. I'm researching and adding details as I write.
