Identity politics
It refers to a position or movement that forms political demands and solidarity based on the "identity group" to which one belongs, such as race/ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religion, and class. It is characterized by starting from a sense of belonging that "we are a party to ____" rather than conventional ideologies (left/right, labor- capital conflicts, etc.).

historical background
- The starting point was the [[U.S. Civil Rights Movement]] and [[Second Wave Feminism]] of the 1960s and 1970s. Because the existing mass movements were white male-centered, the [[Black Liberation Movement]] and [[women's lib]] emphasized the need to "speak with their own voice.
- The 1980s saw the rise of "minority studies" and queer theory in academia, mutually reinforcing political practice and theory.
- Since the 1990s, in conjunction with [[multiculturalism]] and [[postcolonial]] theory, there has been an expansion of frameworks that call for "[[recognition of]] difference" and institutional considerations (e.g., [[affirmative action]]).

Main Purpose
- Ensure representativeness
    - If there are an unreasonably small number of parties of the same group in parliament, business, and the media, demand a [[quota system]] or [[recruitment targets]].
- Correction of systemic inequalities
    - [[anti-discrimination laws]], [[same-sex marriage legislation]], etc., to eliminate the structural disadvantages suffered by certain groups through legislation.
- CULTURAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT
    - Emphasis on "[[symbolic justice]]" such as countering stereotypes and [[hate speech]], revising history textbooks, and establishing memorial days.

Criticisms and Issues
- criticism of universalism
    - There is a danger of fragmenting solidarity by prioritizing partial interests over the "whole of society" (e.g., [[Francis Fukuyama]]).
- essentialist criticism
    - When we speak of "women," "blacks," etc. in a single category, we tend to ignore the inherent diversity (see [[Kimberly Crenshaw's]] discussion of [[intersectionality]]).
- [[Populism]] Criticism
    - Emotional [[victimization]] may create over-mobilization and weaken rational discussion.
- backlash
    - Pointing out that white workers and majority males feel "[[reverse discrimination]]" and reinforce [[right-wing populism]].

summary
While identity politics has the power to put the invisible voices of those involved on the political agenda, it also entails the risk of fragmenting society and deepening conflicts. In practice, the core issue is how to balance the "recognition of difference" and the "construction of the common good.
