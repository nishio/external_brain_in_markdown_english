title: 'New high school subject, "Public'
---

context:  [[Good story about the "Public" textbook from Teikoku Shoin.]]
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1822795981081206856) I didn't know there were more subjects like "[[public]]"

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1822863513767055506) "The curriculum for public subjects in high schools is based on the new Courses of Study that began in April 2022... lowering the voting age to 18 or older. In response to this, the aim is to learn about elections and other political participation, as well as to learn about social security, contracts, family systems, employment, consumer behavior, and other things that are necessary in society." I see!

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1822864012553674773) It's more like the old curriculum, where you didn't learn about the public by age 18 and were somehow expected to understand the public by age 20.
