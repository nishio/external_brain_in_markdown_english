title: "Output doesn't last for approval."

> [kentaro](https://twitter.com/kentaro/status/1723921677334306828) Some people look at people who [[output]] all the time on the internet and say, "I don't have that much [[person who craves the limelight]]. Some people say something like "I don't have that much [[person who craves the limelight]]," but it's not true at all. If you are just doing it out of [[desire for approval]], it won't last. There is only continuity through habituation, desire for the production itself, and other things that are outside of you or that you put outside of yourself.

> [kentaro](https://twitter.com/kentaro/status/1723923446030303288) The question of what "maturity" means has been on my mind for a long time. I could never get into the Jun Eto style of talking, let alone simply internalizing the norms of society. Now I think it is about being able to deal with one's externals, like continuing to do so.

> [kentaro](https://twitter.com/kentaro/status/1723925035155665155) Such concern for the self = the letting go of the self should save one from being consumed by personal sense = evolutionary constraints, desire = the desire of the other, The whole of such a thing may be called cultivation in the Goethean sense. Of course, there is a danger in doing so. But if we go that far, we are far away from self-expression.

I completely agree with you that the output does not last because of the need for approval.
- It's important not to feel negative even if no one responds to what you write.
- That means zero expectation of "other people's reactions".
        - [[It's easier to write if you don't expect others to respond.]]

    - [[Parable of the grumpy toddler who doesn't get attention.]]
