I think it's the most efficient and time-effective way to improve the completeness of the code based on error feedback, rather than making sure the code is correct word for word. If the premise is to debug on paper for the entrance exam, it seems to me that a different ability is required from that.

If the term "[[vitality]]" refers only to the body [[flesh and blood]], that may be fine, but modern society no longer allows us to live by that alone.

    - [[a flesh-and-blood person]]
- [[Tools are an extension of the body.]]

### digest
.
In programming, it is important to begin by typing code roughly and then improve the degree of perfection based on error feedback. In addition, in today's society, tools have become an extension of the body, and the ability to live includes not only the living body but also the ability to use tools.

### Relevance
.
It has relevance to the "flow to stock conversion" fragment. The note emphasizes improvement through rough trial and error feedback in the early stages of programming. This is consistent with the processes described in the fragment, such as "increasing the probability that useful ideas will be generated" and "nipping out chunks of meaning".

### deep thinking
This note will make you think about the definition of the power of living in today's society and how to proceed effectively with programming. The power to live should include the ability to use tools as well as the living body. Also, in programming, it is more efficient to emphasize trial and error and feedback rather than perfection.
