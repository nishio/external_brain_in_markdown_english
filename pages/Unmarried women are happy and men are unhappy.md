Hypothesis 1
- There is some kind of "knowledge that makes single life happy" that is actively shared among unmarried women, but not among unmarried men.
    - Side note: There are many cartoons and essays by single women, but few by men.
Hypothesis 2
- Women have higher [[Cognitive Resolution]] of what makes them happy.
    - Side note: Many how-to books like "Notebooks for Happiness" are geared toward women.
    - Further Hypothesis
        - Men's magazines are more likely to present a miscellaneous "form of happiness" such as "If you become rich, you will be popular with women, yay! and some people are easily imprinted with such a miscellaneous "form of happiness" in advertisements and so on.
