title: "Humans are a drag"

> [r_ima](https://x.com/r_ima/status/1874465499444330780) In the case of chess, there was a time when AI+human was stronger than AI alone, even after AI became stronger than human. But that was only until the mid-2010s, after which AI alone became stronger (humans were a liability). Humanity is likely to experience the same thing in many fields in the future.

Humans [[are]] a drag.

[[human bottleneck]]
    - [[Creating a system in which humans do not become the bottleneck]]
- [[The human side is going to be the bottleneck.]]
