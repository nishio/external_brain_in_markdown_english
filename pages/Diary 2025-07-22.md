>  He also referred to Japan's House of Councillors election, noting that "I note the election of AI engineer Takahiro Yasuno.
- > --SNS has been influential in the House of Councillors election that was held in Japan on March 20. Do you have any suggestions on how to create a system to promote mutual understanding?
- > "We note the election of AI engineer Takahiro Yasuno to the upper house of the Diet. Mr. Anno has stated that he will build a 'broad listening' method, which uses digital technology to listen to a wide range of public opinion, as a public infrastructure, referring to the example of Taiwan. By seeking common ground and repeating dialogue to prevent some people from becoming complacent, the human rights of minority groups can also be protected. To some extent, it should also solve the problems of existing social networking sites, which tend to lead to radicalization and division.

Is it pro-rated?

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1947577625385287744) What is happening in Japan today is really attracting attention from all over the world.
>  >nishio: A film crew came from Germany and France to film the Digital Democracy 2030 Meetup to document the ongoing digital democracy movement in Japan.
>  The Japanese people are now experiencing events that are attracting worldwide attention.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1947575027232354313) I was showing my friend from Taiwan around, and he was confused that the orange Chuo line, the yellow Sobu line (the sign says ChuoSobu line) and the blue Metro Tozai line run in the same place. It's very confusing, isn't it?

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1947504673952567781) If you specifically state "what you are doing", I think it will be easier for other parties to imitate you and more efficient to realize the future that Team Mirai wants to achieve.
>  >Kinari_ne: Um... I know you're really happy about Team Mirai winning and all, but...
>  Supporters sometimes say, "Mr. Anno OR Team Mirai supporters are great! I wish the rest of them could learn from you!" I'm afraid of some people who argue like that.
>  Let's not be elective, not haughty, restrain ourselves, and interact constructively! Hey!

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1947489224833499287) Yasuno, you seem to be seriously busy, YouTube-ing from the waiting room in between appearances. The process of running for office was tough, but the procedures associated with being elected and the party being formed seem to be tough as well. In the long run, I want to release more and more information so that everyone can participate in things, but at this moment, I feel like I have to wait a bit.
