    - People who create solutions don't always create things.
    - Well, the "creator" doesn't necessarily make the "thing" either.
    - I still think these two are [[independent]], because there are people who say, "I can only make textbook stuff."
    - [[An approach to make ChatGPT remember Ctrl+F]]
