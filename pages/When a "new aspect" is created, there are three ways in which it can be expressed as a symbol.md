    - Expressed as a relationship between one meaning and another
    - expressed as a new aspect of a certain meaning.
    - Expressed as a new aspect of another meaning
    - (To make it easier to distinguish as a figure, it is drawn as a "gray circle with clear boundaries that do not overlap," but of course the boundaries are blurred and spread out.)
