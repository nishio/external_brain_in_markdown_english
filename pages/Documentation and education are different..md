title: "Documentation and education are different."

- Based on [[There are two types of genus elimination.]], then is "maintain documentation to eliminate genus" the former or the latter?

I think it is the former. Based on the [[SECI Model]], maintaining documents is a process of [[expression]] of tacit knowledge within people.

To restore this knowledge to someone else's tacit state of knowledge again, someone else needs to take the time to learn it. [[internalization]] work is needed.

To use it otherwise, for example, to create a situation in which "anyone can work while looking at this document," is not to train people who can do the same thing as the person who created the document. If you can do what is written in the document, you can do it. If something happens that is not written in the document, then nothing can be done.

The environment around a company changes. Documented procedures will eventually become obsolete and need to be updated. If we want to ensure the survival of our business, we need to nurture people who can do the same thing as "creating" the procedures, rather than having the people who created the procedures document the procedures.
