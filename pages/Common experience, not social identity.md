[[Audrey Tang]]
- [[Philosophy in the Age of AI, where empty spaces create value]] p.28
- [[identity]]
- Social Identity
- How society perceives you
- I am a graduate student at 00 University, male/female."

- We want to replace [[common experience]] with social identity."
    - Specific example "I have [[experience]] doing this kind of research with this kind of teacher."
    - With whom is the common experience shared by you?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - If you look at the example above, it's "the teacher and myself."
        - But in the second half of the talk, "you and your listeners."
- Identity" and "identity" are "exclusion."
    - Once a certain framework is chosen, anything outside of it is excluded.

- [[Community]]
    - Express with [[connection]], not [[belong to]].
    - [[Expression of connection, not community affiliation]]

- [[unexplored list of names]]
- Policy that "the focus should be on the [[cooperation]] of multiple people, not on individuals.
