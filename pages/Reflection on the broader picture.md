Until now, humans have looked back once a week, but if AI assists with that once-a-week review, it will be possible to calculate the difference between a given week and the week before that.

We tend to narrow our perspective from a human perspective.

Yes, that's right. Humans tend to have a narrow perspective, but by providing an objective viewpoint, AI can help us look back with a broader perspective.

- I think it would be good to switch between [[ant's point of view]] and [[bird's point of view]] by [[looking back]] against the [[wide field of vision]] report.
- PS: I used the expression [[eyes of a bird]] / [bug's eye
    - see  [[Walking eyes and airplane eyes]]

Certainly, by looking back while switching between broad and detailed perspectives, it is easier to find both the big picture and specific areas for improvement. I believe that this balanced look back will lead to effective improvements.

For the time being, I think it is fine for a human to do the look-back in a craftsman-like manner for a while, but I hope the system will eventually be able to support this as well.
