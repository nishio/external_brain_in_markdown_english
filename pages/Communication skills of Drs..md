> [MitaSaori](https://x.com/MitaSaori/status/1818936762338582552) I've seen it written in Japanese a few times that "[[PhD]] is not a communicator," but when I was doing my PhD in the UK, I heard the advice "In corporate employment for Ph. I often heard the advice that "communication skills are a selling point for PhDs in corporate employment". I guess the meaning of "[[communication skills]]" differs from country to country and region to region.

>  If by "communicative skills" you mean "[[read the situation]]" or something like that, that's not necessary. In academia, one must not read the air. You must communicate only with clearly verbalized information.


> [koutakky0112](https://x.com/koutakky0112/status/1819045689932083218) I thought it meant the same thing depending on the comparison. If communication skills are a selling point when compared to people without PhDs, then PhDs are generally more communicative, but if communicative skills are a selling point when compared to people with PhDs, then "PhDs are not communicative".
- This point is interesting.
