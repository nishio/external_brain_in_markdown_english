title: "If you're misguided, you'll be ignored."
---

from  [[An old man telling an old story]]
It's more likely to occur in the elderly, but it's not unique to them.
- [[People who don't feel that their statements have been received repeat the same statements]].
- People who keep insisting on the same thing at meetings.
- [[They are]] being ignored because they are misguided on the subject,
    - The person does not feel that his/her statement has been accepted, so he/she repeats the same statement
- Interpret "not being accepted" as "not having the ability to accept."
    - [[Insanity of doing the same thing over and over again and hoping for a different result.]]

It is not beneficial to say the same thing to the same person when they don't accept it, so it is better to say it to a different person
    - [[Find someone who understands.]]

If you say something [[misguided]], you get [[ignore]].
