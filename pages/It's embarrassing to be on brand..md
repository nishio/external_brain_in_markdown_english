title: "It's embarrassing to be on brand."

> From the history of [[Keio University]], it is not good to be riding on the [[brand]] created by the world.

>  As President Kohei Ito has often said, Keio has always valued the spirit of being a [[minoritarian]]. [[Fukuzawa Yukichi]] was a man who fought all his life for individual independence and gender equality in an era of strong Confucianism. I would like people to know what Mr. Fukuzawa expected from the younger generation at that time, and how President [[Shinzo Koizumi]] protected the school from being scorned by the military and the then Ministry of Education as a Western-style liberal school before and during the war. Keio has never been afraid to be a [[minority]], and has always insisted on what it considers truly important to society. We should not be riding on the "Keio brand" image that comes with a parenthesis.

>  It is important to make people realize that it is embarrassing to be on the brand. Since 2001, when the School of Nursing and Medical Care was established, I have been teaching a class on the history of Professor Fukuzawa and Keio to the three faculties at SFC. I don't say the above straight out, but every year some of the students who have taken the class write to me saying, "I was happy to be pampered by my parents and friends when I entered Keio, but I realized how [[Embarrassing]] that was.
