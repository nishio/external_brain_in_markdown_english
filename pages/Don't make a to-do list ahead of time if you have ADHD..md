<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>Yes, this article offers an interesting perspective on task management for people with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). To summarize the main arguments and insights:.

To-do lists may not be effective for those with ADHD tendencies:.
- Difficult to prioritize
- Concentration is more easily dispersed.
- Listing itself requires training

Alternative Approach: Decide "what not to do" first
- Eliminate distractions, such as looking at your cell phone, to focus on the task at hand
- Avoid unnecessary interruptions (e.g., going for a drink)
- Put low-priority tasks on the back burner.

Advantages of this approach: 1.
- Improved concentration
- Clarification of priorities
- Preventing Procrastination

Practice Tip:.
- Periodically check your "to-do" list.
- Focus on one task at a time.
- Break it down into smaller steps and proceed.

Based on the insights of this article, when designing a task management system for ADHD, you might consider the following features:.
    - [[Proposed design of task management system for ADHD]]
This design proposal builds on the approach proposed in the article and suggests features of a task management system specifically tailored to the needs of people with ADHD tendencies. Key features include the introduction of [[List of "Do's and Don'ts"]], simple prioritization, and [[Focus mode]].

These features are intended to help users maintain focus, clarify priorities, and manage tasks effectively. We also propose design principles that include a simple and intuitive UI, minimal visual stimuli, and positive reinforcement.

Such a specialized task management system could be a more effective tool for people with ADHD tendencies who have experienced difficulties with traditional methods. Of course, the actual development of the system will require further refinement through user testing and expert input.
