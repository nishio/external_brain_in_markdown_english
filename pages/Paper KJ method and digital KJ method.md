title: "Paper KJ method and digital KJ method"
---

Q: Nishio, you do a lot of KJ methods on paper, and you are creating Kozaneba, which does KJ methods digitally, but is the digital experience going to be closer to the paper one?

A: I don't think we are getting closer.
- The essential aspects that make the KJ method valuable are covered in both ways.
    - (I think this essential part is also realized by [[Excel-based KJ method]], [[outliner]], and many other various methods in the world.)
- On the other hand, each method has its own strengths.
    - We should develop what we are good at instead of doing what we are not good at at a cost.
    - As a result, the direction of development was not "in the direction of similarity" but "in the direction of being different with each individuality.


Where paper excels
- Easy to make picture stickies
    - Able to express in pictures what text cannot express well.
- Easy to illustrate
    - Drawing enclosure lines and adding relationship lines.
- High resolution is easy to achieve
    - Cost Ratio of Giant Monitor to Imitation Paper
- Easy to realize multi-person collaborative editing


Where digital excels
- duplication
    - If you can copy and keep the current version, you can make major changes without "worrying" about breaking it.
    - In Kozaneba, you can do it by "Select Range -> Copy -> Paste".
- Move multiple objects at once
    - In Kozaneba
        - You can select a range of items and move them around.
        - Rotating and
        - It is possible to create space by increasing the distance between too many densely placed objects while maintaining their relative positions.
- Low cost of inter-conversion, such as creating stickies from digital text and converting stickies to digital text
    - Kozaneba's standard sticky addition adds each line of multi-line text
    - In Kozaneba, selecting a range of text and Copy Text copies the text so that the text is as close as possible to the selected text.
