> [kensuzuki](https://x.com/kensuzuki/status/1931928278291620129) [[Spread the word]] I spent 3 days with Audrey Tan for the publication of Plurality in May and listened to Audrey's lectures and other things more than 10 times. The highlight was an interview with Ms. Takeshita of TBS CROSS DIG. I was shaken to my core in the studio. Mr. Takeshita's excellent questions bring out the best of Audrey in this video interview. You should definitely watch it.
