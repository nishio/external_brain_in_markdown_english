- I was writing in the context of my work that the future direction of [[Keichobot]], which currently has no memory across conversations, is "to have a memory of a multi-person team" beyond "to have a memory of an individual", in which case it will contribute to creating a common language for the team...I was writing this in the context of my work in my company. I was writing in the "Chatbot" section, and I had a sudden inspiration that "a chatbot that has a memory of the contents of the well and the contents of the public personal projects of the people participating in the well" would be a rather interesting route to try this out....
    - Looks interesting.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/yosider/icon' alt='/villagepump/yosider.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/erniogi/icon' alt='/villagepump/erniogi.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I have no idea how to implement it specifically! ([[Expected value control]] )<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

    - [[Aged pages are more likely to be edited.]] +Topics where anyone can speak are more likely to be lively ([[Discussion of bicycle parking]]) =?
    - Unimportant things take up brain resources!
    - It seems to me that having a page where anyone can write and hang out is good for [[warming up the place]] effect, but let's see....
    - The fact that a page has been updated is displayed on the home page and streamed regardless of what the update is about
        - When you think about it as a mechanism of [[notice]], is it a situation where the receiver can't mute, or is it a situation where the receiver can't mute?
        - Conversely, is a mute enough?

- I've been using note-taking tools regularly and then quitting, but joining [[side of well]] has revived the habit of keeping notes on my wiki (maybe for a day).
    - Results [[side of well]] nothing to write home about
    - I make use of paper diaries and other things when they are booming in my mind, but they disappear from my habit at some point.
- Is this what [[2 hop link]] is? (I checked it works...)
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/bfb985a0def9852e3de2ef3463975816/thumb/1000)
        - Yesterday this or that [[2022/01/23#61ed2dcd1280f0000026ee50]].
            - When linked from the table of contents.
        - Is the reason why Ehime is not shown in Wakayama in the example below to avoid the table of contents issue?
            - If you link to each item from the table of contents, each page is all related.
                - Does this add too many related pages?
        - Should the basic idea be to make it a reciprocal link?
    - Yes, things that trace back to a common topic.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/kuuote/icon' alt='/villagepump/kuuote.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I'm sure [/masui/2 hoplink discussion](https://scrapbox.io/masui/2 hoplink discussion) has more details, but the fact that you're choosing that word means you've already seen it.
            - After all, that's where it's at.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - I didn't see it.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - Normal link and Kiai link." Isn't this interesting?
                    - Looks good in Scrapbox.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/kuuote/icon' alt='/villagepump/kuuote.icon' height="19.5"/>
