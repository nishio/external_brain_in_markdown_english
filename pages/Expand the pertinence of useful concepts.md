- [[Scrapbox Best Practices]]
Abbreviation: "[[Expansion of pertinent judgment]]."

I thought of mentioning a certain "idea F" but don't know what page it is called.
Suppose you try link suggestions with keywords X and Y that seem to be related, but you cannot find them, and you find page A that describes them, e.g., by searching.

I recognized the act of adding keywords X and Y to this A page "so that they will be connected when I do the same thing in the future" as an "expansion of [[CD]]".
- I had been doing this unconsciously but had not named it before.
- As for the similarities in notation, I recognized it as "notation shaking" absorption.

    - [[I first realized on 2022-02-12 that it was a hit-and-run expansion.]]

Occurred Phenomena
- On one page B, I tried to mention concept F.
    - I couldn't remember the phrase, though it is in Chapter 33 of Lao Tzu's Dao Te Ching, "What dies but does not die is longevity".
- I tried linking to "immortality," "die and be not destroyed," etc., but couldn't make the connection.
    - "I will never die."
- I found it in a search because I remembered the word "corporeal" being included on the page.
    - This page itself is titled "Knowing what is enough".
- Subsequent additions.

    - Obviously not a "footnote shaking" notation.
