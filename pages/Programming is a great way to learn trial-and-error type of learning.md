title: "Programming is a great way to learn trial-and-error type of learning"
---

Making things digitally lowers the psychological barrier to trial and error by allowing undo if you make a mistake. This is true not only for programming but also for digital drawing and composing. On the other hand, physical creation makes it easier to notice the gap between the expectations in the brain and the reality outside the brain. If you make a box the wrong size, the lid won't close; if you make a candy in the wrong quantity, it won't set. Programming is also easy to notice this gap. A subject that combines both of these characteristics is ideal for trial-and-error type learning.
