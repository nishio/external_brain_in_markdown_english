title: "X is not available."
---

Suppose Mr. A says, "X is not available."
Is it universally "X is useless"?
- If so, then the perception that "X is not available" would be shared.
- Unless you have a very limited opportunity to try out X to see if you can use it.
There are those who can use X and those who cannot, and Mr. A is the latter.

'Usable' is [[Attributes of relationships rather than single attributes]].
- Relationship between tools and users, challenges and solutions
- Only "usable" when well matched.


- [[Useless.]]
