- Bazaar and clubs in the sense of [roti
- Logic on the part of the private club to make decisions on important matters.
    - It's important, and people who don't know better shouldn't be allowed in.
- Logic on the part of those who bring important things to the bazaar.
    - There's not enough [[transparency]] to make decisions in a closed room like a private club.

Audrey Tang's transparency work in Taiwan is advantageous for China and [[foreign]] for Taiwan, I've heard.
- I think it's unreasonable logic, but the critical side has that point of view... so I made a note of it.
- So increasing transparency appears to be a subversive activity of the existing order.
- Being able to see, having an opinion, and being involved in decision-making seem to be different from each other.
    - I think "transparency" is first and foremost "visibility."
