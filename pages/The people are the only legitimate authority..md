- Draft Declaration of Human Rights."
    - In the early days of the French Revolution, the private drafts of the Constitution prepared by some legislators, including [[Robespierre]], included an expression to the effect that "the people [[the people]] are the only legitimate sovereigns. For example, one draft purportedly states that "[[the people]] are the only legitimate sovereigns, and their power is not transferable.
    - These drafts have been cited and discussed in complete works and research books, for example [[Œuvres complètes de Maximilien Robespierre]], and their wording has been analyzed in specialized books and articles (see: JSTOR, CiNii Research, etc. to find the discussion. (Reference: You can check by looking for the discussion in JSTOR, CiNii Research, etc.).

- Private Draft [[Constitution of 1793]] (Robespierre Draft, etc.)
    - At the National Convention of 1793, many private drafts of a constitution were submitted, among which was the principle that "the people (the people) are the only legitimate authority. In particular, the Robespierre draft emphasized the absoluteness of the "people" as the source of sovereignty, and this phrase is specifically cited in academic research materials [[Reference: CiNii Research and university repository article materials]].
