- 190 GST as of 10/5, so 472 GST more in 18 days.
    - If I had walked the full distance, it would have been 900, so I just took it easy. It was raining, too.
- Picking up a mystery box.
    - This opens over time, you can pay GST to open it faster, but I've never done it.
    - A shabby box will lose like, you pay 5 GST to open it and get 2.3 GST.
        - However, we cannot throw it away.
    - I don't have any special ideas, but it seems like I'm getting better and better boxes.

My main sneakers have fewer hit points.

- 363mSOL for a Lv2 comfort gem used to recover about 30%.
- However, I don't want to have to recover until it's below 20% because there doesn't seem to be any disadvantage other than not being able to trade in the market.
- Looks good to use until 0% as the sneakers will increase in mint from now on, and then sneaker burns without recovery.

I got four gems.

- Sometimes they come out of the mystery box.
- It's sold at 0.01 SOL, so it's not a big deal.
- Rough Approximate Amount
    - 1 ETH = $1349
    - 1SOL = $34
    - 1mSOL = 1GST = about 5 yen
    - 20mSOL = 1GMT = about 200 yen
- 472 GST and 4 gems, roughly $2,500 income.

I was going to mint it, but I didn't raise the level.

They said I'm missing a scroll, even though I bought one?

Ah, I see. That's how it works.

- Scrolls of commons cost more than scrolls of uncommons.
    - Common was probably more consumptive and reversed.
    - Opposite of naming...

The diary ends here (added 2024-02-22)
