When I saw a situation
- A: Those who think that since the left is low, it should be as high as the right.
        - I want to eliminate [[disparity]].
    - [[unfair perception]].
- B: Those who think that the left was originally zero and was made non-zero to make it better.
    - [[Expanding the base]]

When it is impossible to widen the gap without
- I'd say non-zero is an improvement over zero, since the gap is closing.
- On the other hand, for those who "don't even notice," it's an opportunity to realize they're receiving less.
    - If you're going to be offended by this, it's easier to manage it if you don't give them a chance to find out in the first place.
