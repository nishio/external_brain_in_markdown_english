    - [[two dimensional standard normal distribution]] is difficult to draw by hand

    - I'd draw it in circles.

- Drawing a set of people in a circle leads to the misperception that "[[boundary]] clearly exists.

        - [[Organizational Boundaries]]

- This can also be called "[[false dichotomy]].
    - There is no clear boundary between "inside" and "outside," yet we assume there is.

- Associations: [[Ease of Explanation and Stop Thinking]].

    - Hmmm, the implicit assumption that you drew a circle in explaining this is also incorrect.
        - Actually [[Spiny spikes in higher dimensional space]].
        - Related: [[Assumption that it is a circle]].
