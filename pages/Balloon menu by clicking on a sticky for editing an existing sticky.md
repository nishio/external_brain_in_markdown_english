Balloon Menu] by clicking on a sticky to edit an existing sticky.
To edit an existing sticky
I'd like to have a balloon menu or something when clicking on an existing sticky.
If you make it so that a single click brings up the edit screen, it's going to be confusing with a single click to open and close the front cover sticky.
