> The Tai Xuan Jing or Tai Xuan (太玄経) is a book similar to the I Ching (易経), compiled by Yang Xiong at the end of the Former Han Dynasty. While the I Ching is based on the 64 trigrams, which are composed of six yin-yang yao (two yin-yang lines), the Tai Xuan consists of 81 hexagrams, which are composed of four yin-yang yao (three yin-yang lines), and four yin-yang yao (three yang lines).
