>  The implementation I liked was
>  (I thought again that this exhale is very effective in determining the turn of real-time dialogue between humans).
>  ・If you keep quiet, they will wave things at you from over there.
> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1896032780792054277) ・Mix in a lot of slang (contributes to a natural feel, but non-native speakers like me don't understand many expressions)
>  ・I thought that a chill, casual, casual characterization would work → AI characterization still has a lot of dusting to do.

> [teramotodaiki](https://x.com/teramotodaiki/status/1895781338147627288) I'm not sure if it's because I don't understand English or what, but is it really that different from what we've seen before (ChatGPT Advanced Voice, Gemini etc.)? I'm not sure if it's that different from the previous ones (ChatGPT Advanced Voice, Gemini, etc.)?
> [kyasbal_k](https://x.com/kyasbal_k/status/1895785746952569137) * Reaction spacing is so fast that it's pretty close to human.
>  * Intonation, etc., is more like an emotionally charged utterance rather than a speech produced by generating letters and then speaking them.
>  (I have a feeling that they tend to overreact a bit)
>  * There is no sense of connecting time with filler, as is common with conventional speech-based AI.
> [teramotodaiki](https://x.com/teramotodaiki/status/1895806356172783645) I see! That looks awesome. Thanks for the clarification.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1896028539574722993) I'm not sure what part of this people are saying is great, ChatGPT Advanced Voice has been available in Japanese for about 6 months now I've been using ChatGPT Advanced Voice in Japanese for about 6 months now, but this only works in English, and the part where it talks to you even when you're silent is definitely a difference, but it only initiates a conversation even with silent tokens.
> It was the case at the time of Advanced Voice that the AI side was picking up sounds from the human side while the AI side was speaking, and it was possible to interact with the AI side. I already feel that "talking with AI via Advanced Voice while taking a walk" is an option in my daily lifestyle, so what's new about it? I felt like, "What's so new about this?
> [blu3mo](https://x.com/blu3mo/status/1896034475978682699) It's hard to verbalize, but I thought the naturalness of the conversation was a step above. GPT has an announcer-like unnaturalness to it, but Sesame's demo is usually indistinguishable from a human. Sesame's demo is indistinguishable from a normal human being.
>  Both tone of voice and content of speech seem to make a difference. As for the latter, it may just be a matter of prompting.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1896039941991481775) I see, so maybe I won't know until the Japanese version comes along.
> [teramotodaiki](https://x.com/teramotodaiki/status/1896044907602866462) I feel the same way as Nishio-san, but since people who can speak English are amazed, I think "It must be amazing - I don't understand this excitement. It's so frustrating!
