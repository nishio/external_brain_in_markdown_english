There was also a suggestion to have ChatGPT write an information product that will survive the AI era. He wrote that `.
- A mixture of relevant and irrelevant themes.
- I looked at the original text and thought that since it was a diary, it just happened to be written side by side.
    - [[Evergreen notes should be atomic.]] So I cut out the current chunk.
    - Here's a cutout: [[When the world changes so rapidly, it doesn't look like it's changing.]]

It's editable, so [[Afford editing]].
- [[Search results do not afford editing]]

- [[Cutting]] in [[topic-oriented]] from [[time-oriented]] descriptions

Case 2
- [[the "obviously good" trap#64f58d02aff09e0000259c0b]].
- Hit a passage in the diary
- cut out
    - [[Cut out after needs are identified.]]
