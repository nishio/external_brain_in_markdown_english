Examples of bad cleanup
- Take things from the clutter pile, throw some away, and sort the rest on the floor.
- Time limits come and go as holidays run out or you get sleepy.

What's wrong?
- Time is a limited resource, but we design tasks under the assumption that it is infinite.
- We need to design it so that progress is made in a limited amount of time only.

Example
Cleaning up an entire room" is a big task that can take hours.
Therefore, divide and conquer.
One pomodoro, clear your desk." Then, one pomodoro and it's over for sure.
If you throw away trash, you make progress as much as you throw away.
