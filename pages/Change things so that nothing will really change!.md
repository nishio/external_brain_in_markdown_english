This article, a political commentary by Slavoj [[Žižek]], discusses the relationship between contemporary right-wing [[populism]] and left-wing [[walk culture]]. The main points are as follows:

- 1.[[Right-wing populists]] portray themselves as advocates of "[[usually]]" or "[[normal]]" and claim to be opposed to the overly progressive left and corporate media.

2. this rise of the right is not merely an ideological maneuver, but reflects a layer of discontent that liberals have overlooked.

3. the new right-wing populism gives a paranoid interpretation to patriotism and focuses on [[external threats]].

4. on the other hand, the leftists in the Walk culture are actually acting oppressively in the name of protecting the excluded.

5. right-wing populism and left-wing walk culture are two ways around the fundamental problems of contemporary [[capitalism]] and are deeply complicit.

6. Žižek points out the paradox that the right is "not patriotic enough" while the left is "not radical enough."

7. Žižek criticizes both sides for ignoring the conflict inscribed at the heart of global capitalism.

Through this analysis, Žižek underscores the complexity of contemporary political polarization and the need for real change.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The "complicity" between right-wing populism and left-wing walk culture, as Žižek points out, is characterized by
1. superficial conflicts and fundamental similarities:.
Although on the surface they appear to be at odds with each other, they are actually two sides of the same coin.

2. contribution to the status quo:.
Both avoid addressing the fundamental problems of the contemporary global capitalist system and consequently contribute to maintaining the status quo.

3.[[Logic of Exclusion]]:.
The right excludes those who are not "normal" and the left excludes those who do not agree with their definition of "diversity and inclusion."

4. simplified worldview: the
Both simplify complex social issues and offer an "us versus them" [[dualistic worldview]].

5. avoidance of real change:.
The right seeks to maintain the existing way of life, while the left argues for superficial changes, but both avoid fundamental social structural changes.

6. interdependent relationships:.
The existence of one is the reason for the existence of the other, and both sides justify themselves by criticizing the other.

7. eurocentrism: the
The right is clearly Eurocentric, but the left is also formally Eurocentric in that it seeks to "protect" others from a privileged position.

Through this "complicity," Žižek argues, the two sides avoid addressing the fundamental problems of contemporary society and justify each other's existence. This, in his view, prevents real social change and maintains the status quo.
