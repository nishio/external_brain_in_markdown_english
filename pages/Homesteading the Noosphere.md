- Original: [http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/)

[[John Locke]] and [[land ownership]].
- > [[Cultivating]] ([[homesteading]]) can lead to [[ownership]].

[[The culture of giving is an adaptation to excess, not scarcity]]

> I could write another sentence about the harm of self-deception in believing that we truly have "[[selfless]] motives" (despite all the psychological and behavioral evidence to the contrary). I could write, but I don't need to, about destroying "[[altruism]]" and reducing it to a clearly unconscious self-interest (among other shortcomings), which Friedrich Wilhelm [[Nietzsche]] and [[Ayn Rand]] have already done quite admirably.
- [[Ayn Rand]] of [[Atlas Shrugged]].

- [[Moore's Law for Everything]] will usher in a [[post-rare age]] / [[Post-Rarity Era]].
