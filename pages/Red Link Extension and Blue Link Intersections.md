title: "Red Link Extension and Blue Link Intersections"
---

In the [[Red Link Extension]], I consider a state where the linked page is empty, and LLM generates that page.

It's not appropriate to call it a "[[Red Link]]."
- It's actually a [[Blue Link]] sometimes
    - Even if the page is empty, the link to the page is blue when
    - the linked page is empty.
- Red Links are like dead-end empty lots.
- Blue Link empty pages are like empty lots at intersections.

Aren't their natures different?
- Intersections are already connected to many pages, they are established keywords.
    - There are already multiple descriptions about them.
    - The linked page is important, followed by text search, and then vector search.
- Dead-ends are not connected to anything yet.
    - Attempting to generate these through vector search is what we call [[Red Link Extension]].
    - Searching from one's own Scrapbox or from other sources was tried, and the feelings were different.
        - For Red Link Extension, searching my own Scrapbox for 'recently thought-up keywords' is not appropriate because it usually hits what I just saw.
        - But on the contrary, wouldn't it be good for filling in Blue Link Intersections?
