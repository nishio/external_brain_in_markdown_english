The last time I did this was a whopping 12 years ago.
- [[Hatena2010-02-11]]
- Expansion is when "Conspiracy" and "Seaside" are out and "Alchemy" is not out yet.

According to [strong man](https://youtu.be/eTCDRhcxDdc) ([[long bowl of rice with cooked meat (esp. beef or pork) and eggs on top]]), since the expansion "Adventure", the card power has increased and the value of the silver coin has decreased The value of silver coins has decreased.
- So in 2010, [[stero]] had the advantage in many cases?
    - I didn't know the term "stero" at the time, but I remember being excited when I heard that the right thing to do was to buy silver coins in many cases, even though there were lots of action cards!
- Now that the card power is stronger and the balance has been adjusted to be more competitive between steroids and combos, it's going to be more important to look at the supply and decide which side of the field is better suited.
