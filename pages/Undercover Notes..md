I'll never forget the feeling of brain juices when the manual I had worked so hard to compile was updated and utilized by the next person who joined the company.

It's so versatile that it's really a must-have!

>  Conversely, it is not really necessary to prepare the documentation in advance.

>  very understandable
>  Summarize what you don't know and leave the answers.
>  I believe this is the best solution for new employees to contribute to their place of employment.

>  Good company!

Interesting to see some opposing views.

I said "a technique that is universally useful when you join a new community or something."
- So, of course, we're not doing it for compensation, but because we want to contribute to the community.
- This technique is useful for "when you want to contribute to the community," so it's useless for people who don't want to contribute.
- That's a given.
