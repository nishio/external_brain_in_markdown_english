title: "to write all out"
---

In original Japanese, I use "[[書き出し法]]"(KAKI-DASHI-HOU) as a noun, a name of method.

- [[書]] = [[write]]
- [[出]] = [[out]]
- [[法]] = [[method]]

Google Translate says "export method" but I think it does not fit. (I have [[IWAKAN]])
This method is not formal, solid or ritual method. We should feel it easy.
So, "to write all out" looks nice. It is easy to understand what to do.

- As a method name: [["to write all out" method]]
- As a verb: [[write all out]]
