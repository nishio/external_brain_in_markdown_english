Individual project feedback loops and aggregated feedback loops
![image](https://gyazo.com/9d24b8b9e1bade23a4106be83756f4e1/thumb/1000)

- Now there are individual feedback loops for individual projects.
- I think we need a place where we can suck it all in, [[nerf]] it, and then the humans can take what comes out of it to other projects.
- This also sucks in PRIVATE stuff, so it must inevitably be PRIVATE.
        - [[Eventually, you won't be able to see it.]]
        - [[As quality improves, it becomes invisible.]]
        - [[Talk about putting books in Scrapbox.]]

→The [[omni-private]] was created (2023-09-20).
