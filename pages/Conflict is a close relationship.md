Conflict is one relationship, "closer" than unrelated ones.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/omni/icon' alt='omni.icon' height="19.5"/>
- The idea that confrontation is a distant thing hinders [[sublation (philosophy)]].
    - Focusing on [[antagonism]] can bring about new perspectives and ideas.

- [[Conflicts arise and develop as they are resolved.]]
- [[There is more than one conflict.]]
- [[False dichotomy]]

from  [[Corrected differences for the 4th printing]]
- > While the NM method focused on conflicts, the KJ method can be used for any relationship, including conflicts.
- >  It is also not necessary to be able to explain what the relationship is at the stage of creating the group.
- I would like to separate the clauses between these two sentences and include the story [[There is more than one conflict.]] in between, but I will not be able to make that correction in a non-expanded revision, so I will just add "also".

## digest
.
From the perspective that conflicts are in close proximity to each other, we will explore the idea that there is more than one type of conflict. Conflict is a source of development, and opposites are in close proximity to one another. Conflicts are diverse, and there are conflicts in various attributes, such as black and white, smooth and spiky, and so on. Opposition is one relationship and is "closer" than unrelated ones. The idea that the opposition is something distant hinders cessation. There also exists a false notion of dichotomy. Focusing on the opposites will give rise to new perspectives and ideas.
