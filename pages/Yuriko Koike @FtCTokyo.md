Koike welcomes participants to the "Funding the Commons" conference and encourages them to enjoy their stay in Tokyo.
This section describes the major initiatives of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government:
- Climate change measures: Promote the use of [[hydrogen energy]], aiming for [[zero emissions]] by 2050.
- Measures to address the declining birthrate: Provide seamless support from marriage to child rearing.
- Promotion of digitization: full digitization of administrative procedures, use of AI, establishment of "[[GovTech Tokyo]]", etc.

To promote the use of open data, we hold events such as hackathons.
He cites the coexistence of tradition and innovation and the large number of Michelin-starred restaurants (183, more than in Paris) as Tokyo's attractions.
The event is a start-up event called "[[Sushi Tech Tokyo]]" and announces the next dates (May 8 and 9, 2025).
He concluded by expressing his hope that the conference will be productive, and his expectations for the collective wisdom of the participants in working toward a sustainable future.

This speech introduces Tokyo's efforts to welcome international conference participants and showcase Tokyo's attractions.
