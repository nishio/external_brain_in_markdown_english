- GitHub Organization for Team Mirai Volunteers
    - Team Plan
    - It is sometimes called tmv because it is long
- Q: Why was it created separately from [[team-mirai repo]]?
- A: I found out that I couldn't connect Devin, who is in the volunteer slack, to team-mirai.
        - [[Multiple DevinOrgs cannot be connected to a single GitHubOrg.]]
- No rules are set for which org the project repo is placed in, and the Project Owner decides.
    - If you try to directly tweak team-mirai's repo from volunteer slack's Devin, you won't be able to do repo setup and your knowledge of Devin will be poor, so if you want to utilize Devin, I think you have to put it on team-mirai-volunteer.
    - You can put the main body in team-mirai and fork it to team-mirai-volunteer.
