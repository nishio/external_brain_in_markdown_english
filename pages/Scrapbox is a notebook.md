title: "Scrapbox is a notebook"
---

- The [[metaphor]] that "[[Scrapbox]] is a notebook" is very [[beneficial]].
- I feel that "[[groupware]]" should be used by a group of people, and using it by one person seems to be an exception.
- If it is a "note," it is used by [[first of all, individuals]], and it is important to be comfortable using it alone.
- Then, after the information has accumulated in the course of personal use, it is shared with others after the fact.
- Co-editing.
- As ideas are exposed to the eyes of others, they are transformed into something more useful.
