- ![image](https://gyazo.com/396926629757a721d3d74f2e65f3521a/thumb/1000)
- Due to reasons such as [[Narrow Observation Range]], [[Unconsciously Ignoring Inconvenient Things]], or low cognitive ability, we may [[Simplify]] by assuming something is 100% when it is not.

- This leads to a mismatch in assumptions with those who are aware of the "existence."
