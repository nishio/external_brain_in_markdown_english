Comments on the usefulness of the stock
- Luggage is basically attached to the back of your back, so the same posture as in everyday life will cause a pulling force behind you.
- Therefore, when climbing, it is necessary to lean the upper body "so much that it falls forward as it is".
- Those who are used to walking on mountain trails know by feel how much they can lean and still get their foot out before they fall, but those who are not used to it do not. They will lean back.
- It is important to move the center of gravity forward with the stock in front of you, eliminating the "fear of falling forward".
- I thought I needed to learn more about how to use it better on the way down.
    - It seems important to prevent knee and back pain by preventing the body from becoming unstable and landing with a "thud"!
