title: "Definition of work"
---

- You must define for yourself what your job is.
    - and especially [[Drucker.]] and others say
- You can't do that in the early stages of your life.
    - Cases that cannot be defined in the first place
    - Cases where the definition of "this is what I do" does not fit the need.
- The bosses know you can't do that early in life, so they define it and give it to you.
    - It is more productive in the short term.
    - But when and how on earth do you acquire the skills to define your own work?
    - In the long run, aren't there significant disadvantages by undermining opportunities for skill acquisition?
