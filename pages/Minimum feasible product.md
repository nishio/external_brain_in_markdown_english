[[Minimum Viable Product]], [[MVP]]

Lean Startup says: "An MVP in this book refers to a product that can begin the learning process using a build-measure-learn feedback loop. For more information, see (link below)."

The word "viable" is a synonym for feasible and means "realizable. see: Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary

It is the customer who decides whether a product is valuable or not, not you as a creator. Therefore, in order to verify "whether the customer thinks the product is valuable or not," the creator should make a minimum viable product and learn from the customer's reaction.
