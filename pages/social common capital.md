[[social common capital]]

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Social Common Capital is a concept that refers to resources and values shared by society as a whole, including goods and services such as the natural environment, social infrastructure, and public services that provide benefits enjoyed by society as a whole rather than by individuals or specific groups. This concept is often addressed in modern economics and social policy that aims for sustainable development and equitable resource allocation.

Social common capital may include the following elements
- Natural capital: resources and services provided by nature, such as forests, oceans, atmosphere, and biodiversity. They have a direct impact on ecosystem health and human well-being.
- Human capital: investments that improve people's skills and health, such as education and health services. Knowledge, skills, and health increase economic productivity and contribute to the overall well-being of society.
- Infrastructure: Public infrastructure such as roads, bridges, public transportation, parks, and water and wastewater systems. These form the foundation of daily life and economic activities, and support the function and efficiency of society as a whole.
- Institutional capital: institutions that ensure social order and justice, such as laws, policies, and administrative systems. They provide the foundation for social stability and development.

The management and protection of social common capital implies a shared responsibility that goes beyond the interests of an individual or a particular company. Properly managed and used, these resources can continue to provide long-term benefits to society as a whole. However, when these capitals are undermined by overutilization or mismanagement, there are social and economic costs that can adversely affect the welfare of future generations.

This concept is an important tenet of sustainable development, environmental protection, and social justice, and calls for an approach that prioritizes the common good in policy-making and economic activities.
