title: "Tests that can be brought in"

> [@yamada___asuka](https://twitter.com/yamada__asuka/status/1667371495096717318?s=20): In a lecture course for undergraduates that used to be graded by a paper test, once we made it "bring your own paper test", the highest score and the average score The reality is that "knowledge is good if you check it when it is necessary". In reality, it was not a case of "you can look up knowledge when you need it, you don't need to memorize it".
> [@yamada__asuka](https://twitter.com/yamada__asuka/status/1667374034332549120?s=20): I was wondering if "bring your own" was allowed, the peaks of the score distribution would be higher around the mean, and the base in the direction of low scores would be smaller. I thought it would make the mean score higher and the base of the distribution of scores lower. However, when the average score, and even the highest score, drops, I can no longer judge that "bring your own" has a reasonable educational effect.

The questions were about knowledge and its application. The questions were: (1) Explanation of terms, (2) Organization of historical background, (3) Proposal of a plan under certain conditions, and (3) Higher ratio of (3) when students were allowed to bring their own papers. The order of emphasis on knowledge is (1) > (2) > (3). However, the percentage of correct answers for (1) also dropped.

Well, of course it depends on the design of the test.
I thought you meant that "having written knowledge at hand" and "being able to utilize knowledge" are two different things.
The student did not understand this and assumed that he/she could answer the questions without preparation by bringing in a textbook or something with the answers written on it.
- But it didn't.
- If it is true that "if you have a textbook at hand, you can use it", then you don't have to go to college and buy textbooks.

Maybe different mental models about learning.
- When you think it's "owning knowledge," you think it's OK to own a book of written knowledge.
- Correct: "Train them to retrieve knowledge as needed."
- Is the former image attached to the test because of the fact that elementary through high school tests are not allowed to be brought in?

- [Duplicating knowledge from a book in your brain does not lead to value.
- This case was not even copied.
