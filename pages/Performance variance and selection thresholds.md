title: "Performance variance and selection thresholds"
---

- The first half of what I said in [[How to come up with good ideas]] at [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15k-sLm55P04_HGVzHFe9-mpHUlG2-BhT).

While those with high performance variance are 81% more likely than those with low variance to win a high-stakes competition in which only the top 1/4 win, they are 17% less likely to pass a test in which the bottom 1/4 fail. [[New Product Development]] and competitions in general are situations similar to the former, while [[School Tests]] are situations similar to the latter.

- [[decentralization]] under [[performance]] and [[threshold (amount, dose, etc.)]] under [[selection]].
