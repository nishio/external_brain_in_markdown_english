Comments for users who have finished [Polis

What I'm about to say is also a point of improvement in the UI, as I don't think the user will understand it without an explanation:.

- First, click on a cluster, and at the bottom you will see a list of questions about "what people in that cluster claim to do differently than people in other clusters" (the mysterious list of numbers is an ID, hard to understand).
- Select a question to see how people in each cluster are voting on each question
    - (Green is for, red is against, gray is neutral and white is not voted on, we should give that legend...)
- It would be interesting to see which questions were the factors that separated the clusters.
- Polis ([[Polis in "Ideologies for the 21st Century."]]) is closed to questions from users for personal experimentation, but essentially allows people to submit their own opinions for others to vote on.
    - At this time, the game is not to simply write what you want to say, but to post "what more people in the cluster might agree with, based on what people in different clusters than yourself are saying.
- The "opinions agreed by many clusters" that won the game appear in the "Major Opinions" section.
    - This is not just a majority vote, but a "product" of support from each cluster, so the ranking is based on the "degree of [[consensus]]" that if even one cluster strongly disagrees, it is not selected.
