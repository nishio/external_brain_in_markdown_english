I was curious about this image circulating without indicating its source, so I looked into it.

> [@_Hero_Hei_](https://twitter.com/_Hero_Hei_/status/1233575672737480705?s=20&t=voDj2gUe1uOjtjzOhIsSxw): A short comic created by @GPrime85 ( check out his work! ) has been translated to JP and is trending with Japanese people! The comic depicts a short but very accurate scene mocking outrage culture. It's hilarious!

- Can I join?
- Go ahead.
- The rules are too difficult. Let's change them.
- No, we've been playing by these rules for years.
- Why are you excluding me?

![image](https://gyazo.com/7aa08058016a9fc0a9fb7eeb67474786/thumb/1000)
- You people are not inclusive!
- Let's play a game that "everyone" can enjoy with simpler rules!
- Oh, no.
- Then you don't have to participate.

- The group encounters a band of ferocious orcs who demand that they hand over all their possessions.
- Oh my God! Aren't you angry?
- separately
- Then I'll be angry on your behalf.

- Orcs are humans, too!
- No, no! Their race is literally "orc."
- Then, as a fan of this game, I call for the elimination of the term "race."
- You didn't even know this game existed until five minutes ago!
- If you don't like these rules, go away and play another game!

It's so bad, it's hilarious.
