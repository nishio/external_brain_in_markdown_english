The term [[PSF]] as it relates to [[SIB]] usually refers to [[Pay-for-Success Financing]]. This is part of the [[Social Impact Bond]] (SIB) framework and is a generic term for financing models that pay for results.

PSF Features:.
- [Outcome-based Payments: Project outcomes are predetermined and payments are made to investors and service providers based on the achievement of those outcomes.
- Risk diversification: Public agencies pay only if results are achieved, so risk is spread across investors and the private sector.
- Flexible Financing: This is a new financing method for solving social problems that facilitates access to a variety of funding sources.

PSFs are widely used within the SIB structure and applied to social issues in various fields such as education, health, welfare, and environmental protection.
