title: "✅ Free response on/off"
---


    - [[Create ✅empathy writing mode]]
    - After 🤔last message, no input accepted

- Also returns "Is it ready to accept input?" as a response.
    - It would be nice if we could make this false in certain states.
- I put it in the same place because I thought it was a variant of the mapping between state and action.

- The current implementation stops not only free-response but also choice-type responses.
    - Let's modify that when it becomes necessary. We can control the choices, we just need to empty the choices.
        - [[Accept only 🤔choice answers]]
