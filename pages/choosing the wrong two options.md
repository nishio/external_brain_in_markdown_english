title: "choosing the wrong two options"
---

    - Mistakenly thinks there are two [[options]] when there are not, and tries to choose one or the other.
    - Not trying to find a third option.
    - The quality of decision making is 7.7 times better when there are two choices versus three choices. see [[Quantity of choices and quality of decision making]].
    - [[opposition]] Mistaking what is not for opposition.
    - He says, "A or B."
        - Isn't there an option for "both?"
        - What about the "combination" option?
    - With regard to planning, "both" is often interpreted as "do both" and then cut down to "it's not cost-effective".
        - It's "impossible to do both or neither", not exclusion.
        - Lack of ingenuity in how they are combined.
    - There are many ways to combine them.
        - Example
            - Value Passing or Reference Passing? Passing by reference? → Passing by reference by value
            - Regression? Classification? →Solve classification problems by using regression to find the probability of entering a class.
                - see  [[Is logistic regression regression or classification?]]
    - By assuming that they are antithetical, the two options are mistakenly thought to be "[[confrontation]]"
        - This often leads to conflicts, especially in multi-person organizations, with separate groups pushing each option.
        - Visualizing and trying to resolve this is [[Conflict Resolution Diagram]].

- Related: [[False dichotomy]].
- Related: [[integrative thinking]].
