Context: a bot came to live in Scrapbox in the style of a bot that has a memory in the form of "notes", vector searches Scrapbox by note content to find related articles, and updates the notes. Words that came out of my experience with it.

Connect with Vector Search
If you write "A and B are related" in Scrapbox, there is a possibility that AI will pick it up by vector search and say "A and B are related" in the future, which is similar to the [[link to an unexpected destination]] effect in Scrapbox.
