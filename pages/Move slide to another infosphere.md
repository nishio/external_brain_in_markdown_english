- Move slide to another [InfoSphere
- I'd have preferred to have fewer slides to move already in demonstrating the operation.
- In the infosphere after moving, the slides you release move away from each other, and the physics between slides are subtle, which is a bug.
    - The core of the infosphere interferes with the physics, exerting a repulsive force on all the slides and pushing them to their limits where the physics stops after a certain distance from the camera.
