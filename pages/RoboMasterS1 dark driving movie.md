- I saw a piece once that was shot with LEDs on a Roomba with a long exposure.
- [[RoboMaster S1]] has LEDs and can be programmed to control them, so it should be easy to do something similar.
- I was discussing this, and I was told that [[comparative bright synthesis]] can be used instead of long exposure.
- I think they should have run with colorful flashing LEDs anyway.
