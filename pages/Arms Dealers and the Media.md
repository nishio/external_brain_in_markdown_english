title: "Arms Dealers and the Media"

Media "[[arms dealers]] don't sell [[arms]] because there is a [[war]]! They start wars to sell [[arms]]!"
People who saw it, "Isn't [[the media]] not [[reporting]] because there's a [[social problem]], but because they're creating a social problem to report on?"
