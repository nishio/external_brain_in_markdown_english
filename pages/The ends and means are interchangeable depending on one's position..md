The ends and means are interchangeable depending on one's position.

I think that there are many things, not only programming languages, that remain the same because "the disadvantages of continuing to use an old one are small.

I remember hearing somewhere that there are countries, including Japan, where the cashless system has not been promoted because of their high security.

If everyone thinks that "selling to them is neither profitable, rewarding, nor cooperative," optimization and acceleration for them will naturally fall out of consideration, so, well...
- > [dmikurube](https://twitter.com/dmikurube/status/1712730430682861784) For example, if all computer shops give up/stop maintaining FORTRAN or its processing systems, what will they do then? I wonder what they will do after that. I don't mind if we are each other's means to an end, but I would like us to respect each other.
- > [dmikurube](https://twitter.com/dmikurube/status/1712730884108083303) Computers are a means to an end from the perspective of other fields, but not the computationalist.

In the case of a company, I think the most recent profit is the priority. Well, I think it is natural for a company to give priority to immediate profit, but as a person in academia, I would like you to have a broader perspective.
