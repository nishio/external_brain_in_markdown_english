> I don't see the significance of all people, just as you don't see the significance of interviews on the street. And every person can be significant, and I don't deny it.
>  [[track record]] is a very [[subject]] explanation masquerading as objective, and so is significance.

This is so true that some people say "this is significant" as if it were an objective thing, but it is just a subjective [[values]] statement of "I find this significant"!
