Formation of early adopter groups
- Moving from zero [[first penguin]] is rare
- Humans have limits to the range of observation, what they can see and what they can't.

- t=0 More "close or distant" due to existing relationships ([[human network]])
    - I think in general it's a higher dimension, but for illustration purposes, I'm lining it up in one dimension.
- t=1 First penguin A [movement
    - Only those nearby observe it.
- t=2 [[early adopter]] population is created by following the observers
    - Related [[Movements are created by followers...]].
- t=3 Some of the observed people move and some do not.
    - Person B, who does not move, blocks the transmission of information so that people beyond him cannot observe his movement.
- t=4

    - A new [[human network]] is formed among this "group of early adopters" that appears here and there.
        - [[Early adopter enrichment effect]]

Independent of whether the destination of the move is correct.
- Just look at your surroundings at the destination and if you think it's not good enough, just move on further.
- This "two-step-ahead world" becomes full-blown [[Difficult to observe]] from those in the original world.
    - =  [[Torn of the world]]
- It is rather less important whether the world is better one step ahead, and the value of maintaining information connections with [[cheerfully working]] people may be more weighty?
        - [[Why do social networking sites rise and fall?]]
        - [[People on the move]]
        - [[weak ties]]

    - [[The goddess of bad luck is slow on her feet.]]
