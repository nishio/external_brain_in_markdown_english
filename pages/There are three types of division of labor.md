old title:  [[division of labor]]
I've been thinking about how the division of labor can be good or bad, what's the difference, and I realized there are three kinds of things that are described by the term "division of labor."

- There is a "good division of labor" between a "no division of labor at all," where everyone does the same job, and a "division of labor at the desk," where everyone shares the necessary work without duplication.
