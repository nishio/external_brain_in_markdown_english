>  Stuck reading and erased. I don't remember how I bought it, but somehow Hannah Arendt has always stuck with me.
>  The For Beginners series of illustrated introductory books has been a favorite of mine for a long time. I also have "The Human Condition" and "The Origins of Totalitarianism" written by himself in my stack, but I read this one first.
>
>  I wasn't really expecting this, but it turns out to be a thinker who is very much in line with what I myself am trying to capture in the flow of symbolic emergent systems = collective predictive coding, language as other, and the top-down bias/control it gives to perception and behavior.
>  The attached diagram at the end of this article is "exactly" what I was thinking, and I thought that Arendt and Jaspers would be one of the reference points when extending the discussion to political philosophy. (I'm sorry for my ignorance.)
>
>  By the way, the discussion on labor, work and activity also seemed to have some implications regarding the position of creative activities in the Attention Economy and AI, and the "excessive" and also "cut down" (sorry for the subjective expression) nature of entertainment today. Kashiko.
