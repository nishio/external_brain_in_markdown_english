Talk about what is Plurality?
- 2024-07-26

from [[Audrey+Glen+Halsk@Cybozu]]
- > Audrey: We coined plurality instead of calling it inclusive diversity or digital democracy, because these terms are already very heavily colored in specific sectors. So if we say digital democracy, even though it can be applied in the workforce, people are still think of electronic voting machines and it's no, it's just that right when we say inclusive diversity, people immediately think of gender or race or things like that, which is an important part of the differences, of course, But it is not the primary focus of this great smoothing technologies.
- >  And so, like all the words, needs more adjectives to kind of go into places where we want to go into. But at some point, if you have too many adjectives, it becomes a mouthful and nobody wants to listen to you anymore. Right? So I think one part I think Glen tried polycentric collectivism or something like that, but it's like two multi syllable that are even harder to communicate and.
- > Glen: Even better than the word plurality is this overlapping mix.
- (Nishio translation)
- * Audrey]: We coined the term "[[Plurality]]" instead of calling it "[[inclusive diversity]]" or "[[digital democracy]]". Instead of calling it "inclusive diversity" or "[[digital democracy]]". The term "plurality" has been coined because these terms already have a color in certain areas. For example, if you say "digital democracy" for Plurality, people think of electronic voting machines, even though Plurality can be applied in the workplace. When you say "inclusive diversity," people immediately think of things like gender and race. That, of course, is also an important part of difference, but it is not the primary focus of this highly coordinated technology.
- That is why, like any other language, we need lots of adjectives to describe what we want to describe. But if we have too many adjectives, the words become too long and no one will listen. There is also Glenn's attempt at "[[polycentric collectivism]]" and others, which have too many syllables and make communication even more difficult.
- Glen: this overlapping mixture is better than the word "Plurality".
    - The "this" refers to the picture on the cover.

supplement
- I'm confused because when I pull it up in the dictionary, I get hits that are different than what these Audrey's are using.
- I think it's good that they made it clear that "it's a newly coined word."
    - I can see that it's no surprise that a literal translation or dictionary-like translation doesn't help us understand the meaning of the word.
