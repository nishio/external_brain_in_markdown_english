<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>nishio and Glen Weyl collaborated on the mapping of keywords and page numbers in the index using Google Spreadsheet.
The main contents are as follows
- Created a mapping to change a person's name from "first name, last name" to "first name, first name".
- Unify aliases of the same person. For example, Curtis Yarvin and Mencius Moldbug are the same person, so they are written as "Yarvin, Curtis (aka Mencius Moldbug)".
- Unified abbreviations and formal names. For example, "GPT" was merged with "Generative pre-trained transformer".
- Fixed case distortion.
- Unify plurals and singulars. For example, merge "social network" and "social networks".
- Ensure that movie, book, and magazine titles are in italics and article titles are in quotation marks.
- Final confirmation of the notation of terms related to China.
- nishio and Glen Weyl used Spreadsheet to streamline these tasks and worked together to improve the quality of the index.
