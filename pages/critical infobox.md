- Technically, this "give me something that's not in the text" prompt is clearly incompatible with the infobox mechanism, which tries to concentrate on extracting from the text to prevent halcination in the first place, but aside from that, there's something quite interesting about a UX where if you add a hashtag, it will criticize you! That's something.
