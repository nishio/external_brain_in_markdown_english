- [[GeoGuessr]]の4対4チーム戦にいきなり参戦してきた<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - More prep is needed!

- Google Earth at a random location is displayed.
- Guess where on earth it is.
- [https://geoguessr.com/](https://geoguessr.com/)

- I bought the iOS version.
    - Random across the globe free of charge
    - Famous Place, Major Cities, etc., you can pay $360 or buy them with points that you accumulate by playing.
- Personally, I would recommend buying Famous Place with a quick charge.
    - 'Oh, this is the Louvre!' It'll feel like a play like that.

Considerations on Game Structure
- Quiz game with image +α as input and position as output
- Unlike typical quiz shows, the interesting point is that the output is not "words" but "positions".
    - The distance from the correct location determines the score.
    - A: "Oh, it's in South America, what is it? In the "word quiz", B>>A), but in the "location quiz", C: "Machu Picchu is in India, isn't it? A's score is higher than B's (A>>C).
    - Even if you know that the Leaning Tower of Pisa is in Italy, if you don't know where Pisa is, you won't get any points.
    - So it's interesting to see how "non-linguistic knowledge" grows during repeated play!
        - Pisa is in that part of Italy."
        - Due to Google Map specifications, the more minor a location is, the more you have to zoom in to see it.

        - If you know approximately where it is, you can zoom in on that area to find it.

        - Mont Saint-Michel is in France, but where is it now?
    - Conversely, it is interesting to note that in some cases "positional knowledge is verbalized and stored
        - Where is Machu Picchu?"
        - It's in South America."
        - It's in Peru, not Chile."
        - It's in Cusco, Peru."

        - It's in Aguas something, northwest of Cusco.

        - There it is!"

- It's hard to remember where the square monastery is.
- I can't remember where the semi-circular castle is.
