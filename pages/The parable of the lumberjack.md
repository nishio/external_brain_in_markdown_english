    - > [metatetsu](https://x.com/metatetsu/status/1081861461440266240) We play a game where the winner is the one who cuts down the most trees in three days. You can do anything you want, but all you will receive at the beginning is a rusty axe and a whetstone.
    - >  Fools continue to cut with a rusty axe because they don't have time to sharpen it. A somewhat sane man will sharpen it properly every day. The smart ones work part-time or go to the bank to buy [[chainsaw]] until the second day.
