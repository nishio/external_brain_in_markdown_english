title: "Efficiency and Equality"
---

> Taro Kono, Minister of State for Administrative Reform, apologized on a TBS program on the evening of January 12 for the flood of reservations for inoculation of the elderly with the new coronavirus vaccine, saying, "Many local governments placed more importance on the equality of residents than efficiency. This is completely my fault," he apologized.
> He also mentioned the procedure for approval of vaccines by countries. The government approves vaccines according to the same rules as in normal times, which is vulnerable to emergencies. The government must change as well," he said, stressing the importance of a flexible response to emergencies.

I'm not sure what you mean by "there were too many municipalities, it's my fault." Where is the source before it was cut out?

Dialogue begins at 4:20, this talk at 7:20.
- I had to strongly urge them to "phase out the vaccination tickets."
- I should have said more strongly, "Don't be in a hurry" and "You'll hit it."
- Vaccination operations vary depending on the number of people to be vaccinated, so we thought it appropriate to leave it up to each municipality.
- Many municipalities valued [[equality]] more than [[efficiency]], perhaps because they were in contact with residents on the front lines.
- This is my failure.
In other words, by not telling them in advance to "issue vaccination tickets in phases," the local government accepted reservations all at once instead of in phases, and this "not telling" was a failure, he said.
