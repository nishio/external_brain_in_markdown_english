> A professional's "Thinking Space" contains a mixture of "Segmented Information Groups" and "Implicit Information Groups. This state is called the "Knowledge Nebula," and professionals are expected to use their experience to restructure this information group to fit the context in which they find themselves when necessary. Liquefaction of knowledge" is the process of extracting this segmented information and other data that exists externally and storing it in the Knowledge Nebula Crystallizer in a form that is as closely aligned with actual business operations as possible. Nebula Crystallizer is a system that reconstructs and presents the accumulated information fragments from a certain perspective (Contextual Keyword). The process of "[[Crystallization of knowledge]]" is the creation of "new knowledge that fits the current context" within a professional's thinking space through interaction with the presented information and its information.
