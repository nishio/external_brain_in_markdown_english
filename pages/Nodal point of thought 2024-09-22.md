- I feel that those who say that people's lives do or do not add up to a story are trying too hard to find a story to tell about people's lives.

    - [[Nodal point of thought 2024-02-21]] を読んで、「腑に落ちる」気持ちが増した<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/blu3mo/icon' alt='/villagepump/blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Do you feel more understanding because you have a glimpse of the macro policy (independent of the company's requirements) as a researcher?

- Recently<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/blu3mo/icon' alt='/villagepump/blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/> has been trying to build a coherent theme that can explain his own past/future R&D
    - reason
        - I find it interesting to research and develop under a consistent theme ([/blu3mo-public/going back and forth between abstract and concrete](https://scrapbox.io/blu3mo-public/going back and forth between abstract and concrete)-like motivations).
        - I think it is easier to be recognized and interested if there is a theme/story that is easy to understand externally.
            - I expect to be remembered like a "00 person."
        - I think it's cool to do research and development under a consistent theme.
- In the process of working on that, maybe you wondered because <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> didn't seem to be thinking much about macro policies.
    - （<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>は<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/blu3mo/icon' alt='/villagepump/blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>を説得する必要がないので、疑問に思うのは当然  [[Don't persuade people you don't need to persuade.]] ）<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/blu3mo/icon' alt='/villagepump/blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>

- I see. Interesting.
- [As for ""trying too hard to find a story in people's lives,"" I felt that it was not "too much.
    - In some professions [[storytelling]] is a source of competitive advantage.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/blu3mo/icon' alt='/villagepump/blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>understands that and is trying to design and build his own [[story]].
        - It is easier to be recognized and interested if there is a theme/story that is easy to understand externally.
    - I understand that when I observed the surroundings during the process, there were cases (<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>) that I was not sure how they were designed to work, so I was curious about them.
- I, on the other hand, ask, "Can we design that story in advance? [[We don't know in advance.]]?" I'm thinking.
    - from [[spreads its stain as water soaks into a cloth]].
        - > The metaphor in my mind is [[Connecting The Dots]], where the "dots" are first and then "connected" later.
            - > "I wonder if this connects to any past dots?" the more past dots you have, the more likely you are to discover a connection.
            - > so I'll hit a lot of dots and publish promptly.
    - from  [[planned contingency theory]]
        - > Counselors need to guide clients to engage in [[exploratory activities]] to increase the probability of finding [unexpected career opportunities
    - from [[Connecting The Dots]]
        - > You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.”
    - [[Trade-offs between use and exploration]], people become under-explored when left alone (especially as they get older), so they must be aware of their exploratory behavior
    - That search is so far removed from our previous achievements that it is difficult for outsiders to see the connection.
            - [[Take a position before others see the value.]]
        - We're trying to open up places where we don't have connections yet, so of course we're trying to open up places where we don't have connections yet.
    - Often it even seems irrational.
            - [[Decisions supported by multiple perspectives of different observation ranges]]
    - Why are you keeping track of the cost to tailgating and [[name-your-price conference]]?
        - Because we believe it could be the DOT that leads to the future.
        - When you compare the [[recording cost]] you pay now with the value you will get when you connect in the future, the latter is considered to be greater, so it is done as a [[long-term investment]].
