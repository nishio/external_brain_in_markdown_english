Change the style of behavior
xvii

Not always in the same way to divert attention, especially if you have rivals. Not always from the first impulse, they will quickly recognize uniformity and anticipate and frustrate your plans. It is easy to kill a bird that flies straight, but not so with a crooked bird. They can discern a plan the second time around. The enemy is always watching, and it takes great skill to evade them. The gambler never plays the cards his opponent expects, much less the cards he wants.
