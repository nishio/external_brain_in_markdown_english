## simple summary
.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>This series of tweets criticizes certain misconceptions and prejudices against the study of the life and dress of common people in history and folklore. The author points out that those who feel that there is a lack of research on the clothing and lives of peasants and common people in the past are actually complaining about inadequate research methods and based on their own ignorance and prejudices. In particular, they address the false belief that only poor peasants wear certain clothes and the prejudices that arise in the process of seeking historical realism.

## summary with Nishio's point of view
.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It is interesting to point out that "when you look for something and think you can't find it, it may be because you are making an unconscious assumption," and "you may be overlaying a systemic other-blame assumption that it is not recorded, even though that personal assumption is a factor in your not being able to find it."
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Based on Nishio's impressions, sakana6634's tweet series can be summarized as follows.
    - sakana6634 strongly refutes common misconceptions and prejudices about "invisible" dress and culture in history. In particular, in response to complaints that information about the dress of poor peasants is not recorded in history, sakana6634 points out that such information does in fact exist and can be found in abundance, especially in the field of folklore. sakana6634 criticizes the assumption held by some people that "there are special clothes that only poor peasants wear, argues that it is based on unjustified prejudice.
    - sakana6634 also criticizes culturally biased people who believe they are good and intellectually curious, but in reality have a distorted view of reality due to their lack of knowledge and understanding. They stress the importance of moving away from simplistic fantasies by developing a deeper understanding of history and culture, embracing diversity, and increasing resolution.
    - The series reveals and critiques prejudices based on shallow understanding of culture and history and false assumptions based on that understanding. sakana6634 calls for deeper knowledge and understanding and emphasizes that modern academia should play a role in removing prejudices and providing a broader perspective.

## original tweet

> [sakana6634](https://twitter.com/sakana6634/status/1755313718542688479) I saw this on Twitter a long time ago, and it made me so angry that I can't even verbalize it properly. I saw this on Twitter a long time ago, and it made me so angry that I couldn't verbalize it well. I want to know those things, but they don't appear in history." ......

> [sakana6634](https://twitter.com/sakana6634/status/1755315231746908566) First of all, you are not doing your research. If you look in the folklore section, not Japanese history, you'll find plenty. Even if it's just the wild clothes, there are more variations with subtle differences in shape and names from region to region than you can handle. To add to that, even peasants have their own culture of sundresses.

> [sakana6634](https://twitter.com/sakana6634/status/1755315625092932022) You just wear the same clothes as the non-poor peasants. The ugliness of the assumption that only the peasants who don't eat and drink would have clothes to wear. What's with that "If you're not a poor person wearing rags, you're not real, but you can't find it. The realism I'm looking for is buried in the darkness of history. It's too grotesque.

> [sakana6634](https://twitter.com/sakana6634/status/1755317477205303657) I guess the "Museum of Humanity" and others like it were for people like that, who think they are good and intellectually curious and rather sincere to the weak.
>  However, I also think that one of the proper roles of modern academia is to lead us one step further from there, to provide a broad perspective based on facts and to remove prejudice. No, I hope so.

> [sakana6634](https://twitter.com/sakana6634/status/1755319274573619460) No, really ...... in the first place, because you have a low understanding of rural society, you have a low resolution 'your I can only have 'my idea of realism' and I'm not afraid to have prejudices that are so ugly that they don't make sense if you're cool with them. It's not the darkness of history that hides it (although I'm sure that's the case), it's the fog of the person's own ignorance that covers their vision.

> [sakana6634](https://twitter.com/sakana6634/status/1755319976402313300) If only I could take one more step, one more step, I might have a clearer view. The frustration was also intense, but unfortunately I was too angry at the time to be a very good meddling advisor.

> [sakana6634](https://twitter.com/sakana6634/status/1755322048065528040) Because that's the same thing as saying that refugees shouldn't have smartphones or that homeless people would smell bad if they wore clean clothes. It's not about the difference in status at the time, it's the person's own do-gooder prejudice. ...... Don't blame it on the "darkness of history." ...... You don't have to go to a big museum, just go to a local folklore museum or something. ......

> [sakana6634](https://twitter.com/sakana6634/status/1755326061137846728) In hindsight, there were extenuating circumstances, and I probably should have just provided the information I had in a straightforward manner ....... I'm still having trouble sorting out in retrospect why I was so outraged at the time that I couldn't even have that thought. Maybe it was partly because my mother's hometown was, if you can call it that, a poor farming community.

> [sakana6634](https://twitter.com/sakana6634/status/1755328580845003128) Yoo, when my mother was a child, it was after the war, but in the Showa era, there was still a life "like an old tale". I think there are still some things that are the same today. There are many local government archives that have donated so many folk tools and stray clothes that they are having trouble preserving them, and they are struggling to find ways to preserve them.

> [sakana6634](https://twitter.com/sakana6634/status/1755329384368738731) People often say that people are the same now as they were then, but I hate that phrase. Because for someone who says that so easily, how many people can think of themselves and the connection between a while ago, a long time ago, a little while ago, a long time ago, a long time ago, a long time ago, a very long time ago, a very long time ago, and a very long time ...... or less?

> [sakana6634](https://twitter.com/sakana6634/status/1755330020405633222) You are just acting out your own sympathy by separating "now" from "then" and assuming that they are completely different, then picking up only a few commonalities while ignoring many differences. They are just acting out their own act of being surprised and sympathetic to each other without any regard for the many differences between them.

> [sakana6634](https://twitter.com/sakana6634/status/1755333994873524615) Or, rather, they are consciously trying to make it a simple, low-resolution, fluffy fantasy by separating it from the rest of the world so that they can eat it up as they please. I think you're trying to make it into a simple, low-resolution fluffy fantasy.

> [sakana6634](https://twitter.com/sakana6634/status/1755334822787166593) I want to do the exact opposite. I want to divide into complexity. I want to know diversity. I want to increase resolution. So I want to resist fluffy fantasizing.

> [sakana6634](https://twitter.com/sakana6634/status/1755336527293616581) Well, the places I usually dig are generally niche, but compared to them, Yoshiwara and major contents are really, well, fantasized. I'm not saying it's a new thing, but it's a very interesting experience. It's not a new thing, but the cultural soil where basic understanding is possible only with passive experiential knowledge is only getting thinner and thinner. ......

> [sakana6634](https://twitter.com/sakana6634/status/1755337003351367851) If you don't try to fertilize that thin soil and only nurture fantasy for pleasure and enjoyment, then you are the ones who are the current stranglers of culture! [] We've come to that point of impasse, though.

> [sakana6634](https://twitter.com/sakana6634/status/1755338391905067172) I hope that people will realize that those who say they are expanding the front door by lowering the threshold are "only" expanding the front door, but without putting anything at the entrance or inside the house, they have become just another business to make people enter a different gate. I wish they would realize that they have weakened the humanities to such an extent that they have strangled their own people by not being able to nurture the recipients of their business. Look at the reality.

> [sakana6634](https://twitter.com/sakana6634/status/1755365293617270859) Cultural history, including the history of clothing, has always been close to folklore, and there was a time when the study of the common people, including rural villages, was neglected in Japanese historiography. The reason for this is that Japanese historiography had been neglecting the study of the common people, including rural areas, and that ethnic groups were trying to compensate for their blind spots and to glorify the lives of the common people who were trying to be buried under the waves of time. So it is indeed a "thin part of history (historiography)". x.com/sakana6634/sta...

> [sakana6634](https://twitter.com/sakana6634/status/1755375062432280663) The story of the Oyoshihara exhibition is here↓ yesterday
>  I was still persistently blurting it out, and this is what I got up this morning.
>  >sakana6634: However, I don't think there are many people who like Yoshiwara who love only the glamorous part. Rather, I think many people think they have become connoisseurs by loving the gruesome, grotesque, and sordid "backstory" as a set of dramatic extremes of "light and shadow" while laughing at the "humanity" and sarcastically laughing at the "humanness" of it all.


> [sakana6634](https://twitter.com/sakana6634/status/1755377866240630857) And I'm not sure about this early morning tension bigmouth is getting around. I won't turn it off because I think about it all the time, but I will turn off the notifications.
>  In addition, please take care of our first guess, Mizura. She's coming up in the current Taiga as a wakamiya tying, but in reality, she's a much older child character.
