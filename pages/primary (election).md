- > In this paper, first, the types of preliminary elections and the issues of previous studies are reviewed in terms of democratization, and the relationship between the introduction of preliminary elections and the strength of political parties is discussed using Australia as a case study. Then, through the case of Taiwan, which deviates from the scale of "participation," and the case of California, which has gone so far as to deny the very act of nominating party candidates, the paper discusses the imperative of "opening up" the nomination system of by-elections. Finally, based on the cases of Nigeria and Argentina, I will present new perspectives on the study of preferential elections suggested by the legalization of the party candidate nomination system and the mandatory practice of preferential elections for all parties, respectively.
