<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>He discusses why he has been writing more GPT output to Scrapbox lately.
- From an engineering perspective, errors from command execution are "observed facts," but speculation about their cause is not guaranteed to be fundamentally correct, so we consider both human- and AI-written errors to be of equal value.
- The AI is now asked to write explanations of Japanese culture and philosophical concepts, impressions of articles, and explanations of words. Since these contents are a mixture of facts and interpretations, and [[the correctness of interpretations is subjective]], we judge that AI-generated contents are as valuable as [[those written by humans]] if they are accepted without discomfort and if the AI corrects the parts that differ from its own ideas.
    - [Building a network of knowledge with AI is beneficial for thought resolution.
    - Related: [[folds of understanding]].

- I've been writing more and more GPT output to Scrapbox lately.
    - Think about why it happened.
    - As an engineer, when you execute a command and you get an error, it is an "observed fact"
        - I saw that and said, "I'm sure this is what caused it." interpretation.
        - There's no guarantee that the interpretation is fundamentally correct, so it's the same whether it's written by a human or an AI.
    - Started having AI write Japanese cultural commentary in English.
        - Explanations have facts and interpretations.
        - Interpretation of all but specific factual findings
        - If I, a native Japanese, can read the commentary and feel comfortable with it, it is as correct as if I had written it myself, whether it was written by an AI or by me directly, so it is the same thing.
    - We also started having AI write explanations of philosophical concepts.
        - In philosophy, "who wrote what in what book" is a fact
        - The writing itself is the philosopher's worldview and interpretation
        - If there is no correct interpretation of the world, then what is written by a philosopher and what is written by an AI are the same thing, are they not?
        - As for acquiring vocabulary to increase the resolution of thought, wouldn't it be more beneficial to let the AI generate guns and create a network of knowledge?
    - I've even started having AI write down my thoughts on some articles I've read.
        - There is no such thing as correctness because opinions are not facts.
        - If the output is not different from what I think it is, then it's the same thing as what I wrote.
        - If something different is written, just add "I think not."
    - I also started having them write explanations for words.
        - So far, I've left it blank or quoted from Wikipedia.
        - What meaning you find in the word is subjective, so if I look at the generated content and feel comfortable with it, it is fine as an explanation of "what meaning I am using the word for.
        - Same thing I wrote.
