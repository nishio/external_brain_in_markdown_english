<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3-mini-high/icon' alt='o3-mini-high.icon' height="19.5"/>For example, it can be calculated as follows

- Seconds of life
- If the average life span is 80 years, one year is about 31,557,600 seconds, so,
80 years ≈ 80 × 31,557,600 ≈ 2,524,608,000 seconds (about 2.5 billion seconds).

- number of human beings.
- Let us assume that the current world population is approximately 8 billion.

- seconds per person.
- 2,524,608,000 seconds ÷ 8,000,000,000 people ≈ 0.315 seconds

This means that the estimated time is "approximately 0.3 seconds per person.

If you're stuck in a country of 0.8 billion people, that's 30 seconds per person.
800,000 people would take 3,000 seconds, 50 minutes ([Population rank of Japanese cities - Wikipedia [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E3%81%AE%E5%B8%82%E3%81%AE%E4%BA%BA%E5%8F%A](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E3%81%AE%E5%B8%82%E3%81%AE%E4%BA%BA%E5%8F%A) 3%E9%A0%86%E4%BD%8D] about Hamamatsu City)
8,000 people would be about 80 hours for 5,000 minutes.
