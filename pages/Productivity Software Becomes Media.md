title: "Productivity Software Becomes Media"
---

> One of the largest and most profitable business models, pursued by corporations like Microsoft and Slack, is selling productivity software, which often includes social media-like components, to companies to boost productivity. These companies have no interest in "engaged" or polarized employees; the goal of the tools is to bring employees together to accomplish shared goals and adjust to change. A new, pro-social media model could thus naturally be incubated in such settings and then sold, in broader social contexts, to other organizations interested in solidarity and dynamism.

- [[Increased productivity]] software sales is a large and profitable business model pursued by companies like Microsoft and Slack. This type of software often includes a [[social media]] component and is sold to companies to increase productivity. These companies are not interested in "[[engaging]]" or "polarizing" their clients' employees. The purpose of this software is to bring employees together to achieve [[common goals]] and [[adapt to change]]. Thus, the new [[pro-social media model]] will be naturally nurtured in such an environment and then marketed to other organizations interested in solidarity and dynamism in a broader social context.
