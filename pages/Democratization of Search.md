- > We propose a DemocraSearch system that allows access to all types of information with the same interface by extending and "democratizing" the search engine to allow customization of search behavior for given keywords.
- [Democratizing Search](https://democrasearch.com/)

- [[democratization]] of [search (e.g. for someone using a search engine)

nishio: there are two types of searches: "[[search to find something unknown]]" and "[[search to recall something previously seen]]" and I thought this system was talking about the latter
- → [[Three-step search]]

I didn't think the audience had a common knowledge of what masui has done regarding various searches before this update.
- [/masui/"space" app](https://scrapbox.io/masui/"space" app).
- nishio: to supplement the context, for example, Masui-san also assigns IDs to physical objects so that they can be searched online
    - [/masui/box-organizing method](https://scrapbox.io/masui/box-organizing method).
- nishio: Searching for something you can't remember the keywords for is like following a potato vine
    - [/masui/promotion of potato vine search](https://scrapbox.io/masui/promotion of potato vine search).
- Keyword expansion in [[Helpfeel]] for keyword shaking
    - nishio: The context of Helpfeel may not be clear to viewers, but it is a service that allows you to expand your keywords so that you can get hits for various keywords!
    - This is a toB paid system, so there's no reason to expect the audience to know about it.

Q: What is democratization?
- nishio: "democratization" seems to mean "individual people can control what they want to see in the search results
