    - [[linear function]], there is almost always only one solution.
    - Given [[quadratic function]], most of the time there is either "no solution" or "two solutions".
    - Quadratic functions "have only one solution" is as rare as linear functions "have no solution"
    - Similarly for general functions, "there is only one solution" is a rare case
- In other words, linear function behavior is rarer in the whole function, but humans tend to misinterpret things as if they were linear functions

- [[The correct answer is "there is no solution."]]
- [[Not necessarily one.]]
- [[non-linear]]

- [[blind spot card]]  37
