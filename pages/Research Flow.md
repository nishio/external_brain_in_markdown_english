title: "Research Flow"
---

> [kaityo256](https://x.com/kaityo256/status/1791802600112984071) The material on "How to Read Research Papers" published by people at Keio University is useful, so I shared it. It explains with specific examples how to understand the "flow of research" which is not often mentioned, and how to read the structure of a thesis, especially the introduction. It will be a good study on how to write a thesis.
