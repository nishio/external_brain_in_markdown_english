title: "Think about solving social problems."

Teacher: "Let's think about solving [[social problem]]."
Student: "Can you tell us what kind of social problems you are thinking of solving?"

I think we need to solve the social problem of "some people using their superior position to force others to do what they cannot do."
    - I think it's hard to see clearly that the teacher is saying something funny as a [[boomerang joke]], so I think it needs to be brushed up a bit more.

Instead of asking, "If we have the resources available to solve the problem, how can we distribute those resources to solve the problem more efficiently?", asking people to do something without giving resources is like saying, "[[not enough is not enough]].
