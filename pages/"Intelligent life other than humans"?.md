title: '"Intelligent life other than humans"?'

> [stdaux](https://twitter.com/stdaux/status/1453199174648823811): when I see the phrase "other [[intelligent life]] than mankind" I ask myself "is mankind intelligent?" question comes to mind.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1453208794368937986): It is not a dichotomy of intelligent or not intelligent, but a continuous gradation with degrees of intelligence, and humanity is only treating itself at its own level of intelligence to put itself in the intelligent life form. Human beings are only treating themselves as intelligent at their own level in order to be included in the intelligent life forms. So from the point of view of a more intelligent life form, it's possible that humanity is not an intelligent life form and can be slaughtered like a cow.

I think there is a minority of life forms more intelligent than humans that would say, "Don't kill dolphins because they are [[intellectual]]! I think there is a minority that says, "Don't kill dolphins because they are [[intellectual]]!

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1453210158906023940): The "we should protect them because they're intelligent" line doesn't work because the majority thinks they're "not that intelligent compared to us", so they suck on sticks thrown by aliens and show their obedience. So, it would be better to go along the line of "It's against the spirit of [[animal welfare]] to kill such a cute pet! It might be easier to protect the human race if we go the route of "It's against the spirit of [[animal welfare]] to kill such a cute pet!

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1453211534297993220): If they perceive you as a dog that bites, they will shoot you before you even get close to them, so I think it would be better to first show them that you have no intention of attacking them, then draw out their desire to protect you, and then have them perceive you as "surprisingly smart". (I'm trying to figure out what to do if a [[space alien]] that is actually more intelligent than humans and doesn't consider humans intelligent comes to earth.)

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1453212249674424324): If a human being who is obsessed with a movie that features a human being as the main character does resistance activities against aliens, the other humans who are appealing to their obedience will say, "Hey, stop it! And then the other humans who are appealing to their obedience say, "Hey, stop it!

- [[intelligence form]]
