- A [[PDCA cycle]] that can be turned by one person can be turned smaller and faster.
- Need [[output]] to engage others
- Others don't move the way you expect them to, so they tend to move big and slow.
    - Rarely do you get someone who responds with more enthusiasm than you, but that's just luck, and median people are all less enthusiastic than you.
        - Tends to be a long wait for results
    - You never know how others will react to your output (Do) unless you try.
        - So this cycle is also a PDCA cycle of experimentation and verification

- [[output]]
    - [[Social Triggers]]
