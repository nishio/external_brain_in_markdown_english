title: "A place to create the future"
---

When the owners of "Thinking to create the future" are gathered to create a highly concentrated "scene (of a play, movie, etc.)", that "scene" will create a "future tense". The "scene (of a play, movie, etc.)" is created by the owner.
This "field" is [[The Big Presence]] more than any one individual, and no one individual, no matter how good, can foresee what the "field" will produce.
