> [kazushi_takagi](https://twitter.com/kazushi_takagi/status/1387361650248863744): I've been thinking about the term "job type" that I've been hearing a lot lately, and how it relates to the [[Cybozu]] corporate structure and personnel system. I have been thinking about it in relation to the company organization and personnel system of [[Cybozu]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387407050028683267): It is a [[false dichotomy]] to think that employment in the world is divided into two types: "membership-based" and "job-based".

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387575152242683907): wrote [[Membership-based or job-based employment is a false dichotomy]]

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387575834366550016): this is exactly what I'm talking about [[drawing on past dichotomies]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387585322133774337): In a job-based "post first" system, if the need for a certain job decreases and a management decision is made to reduce the number of positions, the current workers are In contrast, in a membership-based system, people are decided first, so another post is decided first. On the other hand, in a membership-based system, the person is decided first, so a "personnel change" to a different post takes place.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387587021976133635): Then what will Cybozu, having given up [[the right to transfer personnel]], satisfy this need? This is the liberalization of the internal labor market. The market principle will work within the company by [[individuals are free to transfer between teams]].  [[Individuals are free to transfer between teams.]]
