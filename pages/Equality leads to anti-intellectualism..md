Equality leads to anti-intellectualism.

[According to Hofstadter's "[[American]] Antinomianism," excessive pursuit of the ideal of "democratic equality" leads to "[[antinomianism]]" in which "intellectual authorities" such as "[[elites]]" and "[[specialists]]" are increasingly opposed and expertise and critical thinking are downplayed. When democracy takes the idea that "[[all]] opinions are equal" to the extreme, emotional [[empathy]] and [[majority intuition]] take precedence over [[objective facts]] and [[professional judgment]], favoring emotion and [[simple messages]] over reason.

From this perspective, there is a danger that "[[techno-optimists]]" who believe too much in the potential of technology, and who insist on democratic equality to the extreme, will spread simplistic claims that "technology can easily solve all social problems" without knowledge or expertise. As a result, deep understanding of complex social problems and professional and critical reflection may be downplayed, and blind trust in technology may reinforce an anti-intellectualist climate.
