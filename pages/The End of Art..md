The End of Art.
In his aesthetics lectures at the University of Berlin in the 1820s, Hegel developed the "end of art" theory. He argued that ancient Greek art had realized the ideal unity of truth, goodness, and beauty, and that in modern times art had lost its supreme status and philosophy and religion had become the means of expression of higher truths.

This "end of art" theory was perceived as a downplaying of the value and role of art, and it provoked a backlash from artists and critics. Romantic artists, in particular, emphasized the expression of emotion and individuality and were critical of Hegel's theory.
