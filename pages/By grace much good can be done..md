title: "By grace much good can be done."
---

By grace we can do more good than others. Those who dare to act without grace are those who turn their backs on God's grace.

from [[The Art of Worldly Wisdom]]
To have a reputation for elegance.
xxxii

To be noble is the greatest glory of the noble, and to conquer universal favor is the privilege of kings. This is the great advantage of the position of commander, to do more good than others. He who does friendly deeds becomes a friend. On the other hand, there are those who expose themselves to a lack of grace, not because they are difficult, but because of a bad temperament. In all things they are the very opposite of God's grace.
