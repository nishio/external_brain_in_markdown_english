### deep thinking

The translation of the Scrapbox into English is an important step in providing users with the information they need in an efficient manner. However, the approach of translating only those articles that users want to read, rather than translating all articles, raises issues of information selection and prioritization. The need to consider the quality of the translation and the degree of editorial freedom also indicates that the translation process requires an understanding of culture and context, rather than mere language conversion.
