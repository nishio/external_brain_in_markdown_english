---

The main points are as follows
- She thought it was strange that an ordinary woman could not live on her own earnings, so she chose to make her own decisions and live her own life.
- In a society that discriminates against women, she feels that she did well until her retirement from her position, even though she worked at a lower status and salary than men.
- He realized the importance of fulfillment and self-confidence, hobbies, and the emotional refuge that comes from not having married around age 50.
- While she has gained a sense of accomplishment and confidence, she feels that the company owns the results of her work and that it is difficult for a woman to survive on her own.
- She points out the happiness of living a life of one's own choosing and the lack of role models for women working in various professions.
- She is happy that she was able to overcome the prejudice against women and continue working.

>  "Let's look normal and work normal until retirement" is ongoing along with "Let's live as a nonmarried nonproductive single person" as I will work 5 more years until retirement.

> [castellabolo](https://twitter.com/castellabolo/status/1785483665327485022) I decided to live as a non-married non-baby singleton because I thought it was strange that a normal woman could not work a normal job, earn a normal income, and live a normal life on her own earnings. It's not right, even though there are many normal men who do so. I wanted to try to make my own living with my own earnings.

It seemed to me that many married women left their independence to their families and handed it over to their husbands.

>  I simply wanted to try out what I wanted to do if I only had one life to live, and to do that I needed to spend the majority of my resources on myself, and I knew I couldn't do that if I got married.

> [castellabolo](https://twitter.com/castellabolo/status/1785486291129499704) Surprisingly, I'm happy about my position retirement. People say congratulations to those who are retiring, but I wonder if it's congratulations all the way? Is it a congratulations because retirement is something that comes due in the middle of the road? I was thinking.

> [castellabolo](https://twitter.com/castellabolo/status/1785486737445442035) But when I reach the retirement age for my position, this is nothing but congratulations. I am not sure if I can do this without an end to it. I am repeatedly in a state of "Thank God it's over" and "I can't do this without an end.

> [castellabolo](https://twitter.com/castellabolo/status/1785488738669494301) I think you did incredibly well, along with being extremely tired. I think it's a bit of a misogynist thing to do, but in a society like that, I think you did really well.

> [castellabolo](https://twitter.com/castellabolo/status/1785489820808315149) No matter the position, women are discriminated against and will be exploited for as long as there is discrimination against women.

>  The strategy is to keep this level of status and income if you are going to be exploited anyway. If you want to get the job or position you want otherwise, you have to have higher skills and achieve higher results than men.

> [castellabolo](https://twitter.com/castellabolo/status/1785491170828980286) The more you continue to take a job or position further up the ladder, and the further up the ladder you go, the more you will be exploited, so the more you do it, the more you will be exploited. The more I did, the more I was exploited, and it was really tough, and it took a toll on my body and mind.

> [castellabolo](https://twitter.com/castellabolo/status/1785494072704282869) The other interesting and surprising thing was that I was fulfilled from about age 50. It was a period when I was able to continue to produce results with proficiency or stability, and I developed a rock-solid confidence that I was in good condition and could do most things if I tried. It was unexpected and interesting to think that I, an ordinary person, could come to a situation like the one that a great person wrote about in a column in a business magazine.

> [castellabolo](https://twitter.com/castellabolo/status/1785497944998977686) Then I'm glad I kept the hobby going. When you live and work, a lot of things happen inside and accumulate, and you need a place where you can turn to your heart's content.

>  Of course, just a change of scenery, just for fun, is enough, and it can be a refuge.

> [castellabolo](https://twitter.com/castellabolo/status/1785499791814017190) Speaking of shelter, many times I was glad I didn't get married, especially when work was tough.
>
>  It was necessary for me to be able to go home and not be discriminated against, to be able to go home and be away from discrimination against women for a time, and I would not have had it very much without this room where I live alone.

> [castellabolo](https://twitter.com/castellabolo/status/1785501877687513390) I feel like a stuffy, empty-handed creature.
>  While I feel a strong sense of accomplishment and confidence that I have done it and done it well, I also feel that in the end I have nothing left, that the results of my work belong to the company, and that I have not done a job I like, so they are not memories or treasures.

> [castellabolo](https://twitter.com/castellabolo/status/1785503435095478483) I guess in the end I just survived and my goal has only been to survive on my own. I think that I have only survived and that my goal was only to survive on my own. Why is it so hard for a woman to survive on her own? I wonder why such a thing is not so obvious that it becomes a goal.

> [castellabolo](https://twitter.com/castellabolo/status/1785505668621013458) In a word, it's empty and comfortable. It's full of accomplishment, but life is still empty and meaningless, and that's comforting.

>  I think there is this kind of happiness that comes from making your own decisions and doing things on your own, moving toward what you want to be, and having your ideas and lifestyle match.

> [castellabolo](https://twitter.com/castellabolo/status/1785508058657124401) I have written before that when I was a child, the only working women I saw around me were kindergarten and school teachers and nurses. The rest were adult women. The rest of the adult women were someone's mother, and the piano teacher and the shopkeeper at the mall were all mothers of someone at elementary school. So I grew up not knowing any other working women.

> [castellabolo](https://twitter.com/castellabolo/status/1785510380980392349) I grew up being told that women can't do this and women should do that, but I've made it to this age, I've been able to work and manage in the workforce, I've mastered responsibility and authority, and I've been able to make a fair amount of money. I've mastered the use of responsibility and authority, and I've even been able to make a fair amount of money. I'm glad that it was me, and not someone else in the article or someone I know, who pushed through it all. I'm glad I did it, as it turned out.
