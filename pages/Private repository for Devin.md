Merging into main was a mistake.
- I read it when I start a new project.

I should have put only what should be common reading in MAIN and left the rest in the branch.

Hmmm, that's subtle too.
- I keep thinking that what I've implemented hasn't been merged yet, and I keep thinking, "I've implemented what you asked me to do." or something like that.
- Let them create a new repository or...

I didn't have the ability to create a new repository, so I had them create a script to create a repository with GitHub tokens.

When you start working, a branch is created and you work on it.
- Eventually, the branch gets long enough that it tries to branch out and forces you to merge.
- That timing is when a new repository should be created.
