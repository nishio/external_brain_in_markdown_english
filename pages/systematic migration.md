    - > Referendum on whether the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, which has been a part of Ukraine since its independence in 1992, should belong to the Russian Federation.
    - > According to Article 73 of the Ukrainian Constitution, territorial changes can only be voted on by referendum, and on this basis the interim Ukrainian government, the United Nations, and the G7 (Japan, the United States, and Europe) have questioned the legitimacy of the referendum, whose voting rights are limited to Crimea residents, and while the G7 has stated that it will not accept the results, Russia has indicated that it respects the results. The G7 has stated that it will not accept the results of the referendum, while Russia has indicated that it will respect the outcome of the vote. The referendum has revealed a decisive confrontation between the West and Russia, and relations between the two sides are now facing the biggest crisis since the end of the Cold War.
    - > On March 16, the referendum was held as scheduled, and the majority of the votes were in favor of incorporation into Russia, as was widely expected in advance. On the following day, March 17, the Supreme Council of Crimea approved the results and resolved to grant Crimea independence from Ukraine and incorporate it into Russia. On the same day, Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized Crimea as a state, and on the following day, March 18, Russia, Crimea, and Sevastopol signed a treaty under which Crimea and Sevastopol were incorporated into Russia.... On March 27, a resolution submitted by Ukraine and the United States to the United Nations General Assembly, denying the legitimacy of the referendum and urging countries not to recognize the annexation by Russia, was adopted by a vote of 100 in favor, 11 against, and 58 abstentions (24 absent).

    - > Aum Shinrikyo, which entered the village in 1989, built facilities where many ordained followers, called Satyans, lived in various parts of the Fujigamine area on former state-owned land given up by pioneer farmers, and the area became a base for the Aum Shinrikyo crimes, including sarin gas production.

>  >komakomappp: By the way, the lowering of the voting age to 18 reminded me of Choumanbe. There, it seems that all boarding school science students are supposed to transfer their residency, but from now on, 1/10 of the electoral population will be science students, which means they can easily flip in the mayoral and town council elections, and wow, there are going to be a lot of people in trouble...
