If you tell someone who doesn't know X to look for it because X is in Y, they can't find it.
- If you are given a cardboard box and told to "look for a buba in here," you can't look for it because you don't know what a buba is.
- I suppose the same could be said for "[[The right answer is]] find it inside you."

We need to verbalize how to find them.
