<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I hope the idea of private to public transfer in Scrapbox develops.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "Scrapbox" is this "Scrapbox"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Listen first.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Yes, sir.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Because we have been using the system for a long time with the private and public separated, we now have 300 pages of private and 8,000 pages of public.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>「private」
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Private has become a place for fragmented notes that can't be made public, and it doesn't feel like it promotes intellectual production anymore.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>「private」
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I think the design of transferring a page with a specific tag from private to public assumes that it will be primarily active in private.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>「private」
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>So introducing it into my current environment would not be very effective.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>「private」
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>the end
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I hope to discover a configuration where private to public transfers or similar techniques will have a beneficial effect on me.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "PRIVATE" is that "PRIVATE"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>A place where you can write about things that you can't publish without hesitation.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  I hope you can find a configuration where private to public transfers or similar > techniques will have a beneficial effect on me.
- Is there anything else about this "PRIVATE"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>What I can't write about, even though I write a lot on public, is information that is other people's copyrighted material, trade secrets, or information that will damage others by writing about it, etc.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It is good when unexpected connections occur, but the fragmentation makes it difficult for such private information to be connected, and I want to solve this problem.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is this "PRIVATE"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It is farther away than PUBLIC in my subjective view now. It should be closer to my center.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  It is good when unexpected connections occur, but the fragmentation makes it difficult for such private information to be connected, and I want to solve this.
- Where does this "PRIVATE" come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Public information comes from public sources, and there is information that comes from within you that you are willing to make public. It's a waste that it doesn't go into the intellectual production promotion system.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>How do you know its "PRIVATE"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>There are non-public sources. Then there are publicly available sources that can be problematic if reprinted in their entirety. (The contents of a book, for example, should be put into Scrapbox to promote intellectual production, but copyright issues prevent us from writing until it is in a form that is appropriate for quotation.

- >  Public information comes from public sources, and some information comes from within me and I am willing to make it public. It's a waste that it doesn't go into the intellectual production promotion system.
- What do you hope will happen regarding this "private"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Right now it's a bunch of dead notes, it needs to become a fish tank for live fish.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  Public information comes from public sources, and some information comes from within me and I am willing to make it public. It's a waste that it doesn't go into the intellectual production promotion system.
- Where is this "PRIVATE"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Maybe we should build a new one in a different location than the current un-crowded memo storage project?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  Public information comes from public sources, and some information comes from within me and I am willing to make it public. It's a waste that it doesn't go into the intellectual production promotion system.
- What does this "PRIVATE" look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Right now it is dead. It needs to be a place where it is busy, where page interaction occurs and new things are created.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  Public information comes from public sources, and some information comes from within me and I am willing to make it public. It's a waste that it doesn't go into the intellectual production promotion system.
- What kind of "public" is this "public"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I want information that I am willing to make public to be made public as soon as possible, and I mention it on social networking sites, etc. Writing it in private and having a bot publish it at the appropriate time does not satisfy this need.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  Public information comes from public sources, and some information comes from within me and I am willing to make it public. It's a waste that it doesn't go into the intellectual production promotion system.
- Is there anything else about this "PUBLIC"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>There are already a few people besides me searching my Scrapbox for ideas. Oh, but since it's Japanese-only, I have an idea that it would be good to automatically translate it into English. I don't know why I haven't done that... because I don't really feel I get any value out of it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  Public information comes from public sources, and some information comes from within me and I am willing to make it public. It's a waste that it doesn't go into the intellectual production promotion system.
- How do you know this "PUBLIC"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Even before Scrapbox, I've been publishing a lot of technical trial-and-error and notes when thinking about things, so I'm very familiar with it, and it's always open in several tabs.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between that "Scrapbox" and "private"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Wasn't there once a page limit only for PUBLIC? Now private is fine for non-commercial use.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between its "public" and "private"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I know it's now a fragmented and unrelated project, but I really think they should work closely together, like the front page and back page of Wikipedia?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  Wasn't there a page limit only for PUBLIC in the past? Now private is fine for non-commercial use.
- Where is this "PUBLIC"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Public.

- >  Wasn't there a page limit only for PUBLIC in the past? Now private is fine for non-commercial use.
- Where is this "public" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Some people Google it because it's public, and others come in from social networking sites. Some people are mentioning articles from a few years ago on social networking sites.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  Wasn't there a page limit only for PUBLIC in the past? Now private is fine for non-commercial use.
- What does this "public" look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Where social triggers flow in. When people mention it, it creates an opportunity for improvement. This is important for Scrapbox to be a fish tank.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is that "Scrapbox" the same as "private"? Is it different?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Another. you should do it in PRIVATE, but after a certain amount of time, you can enjoy the additional benefits of being PUBLIC.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is that "public" the same as "private"? Are they different?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>They are different and have their own advantages.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  another. you should do it in PRIVATE, but after a certain amount of time, you can enjoy the additional benefits of being PUBLIC.
- What do you hope will happen regarding this "public"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>PUBLIC needs to be available as before. We cannot wait for bots to update because of the benefits of immediate updates.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to the "PUBLIC" for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>PUBLIC needs to be used as it has been.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Can you do that with respect to "public"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It can be done. In fact, if you don't come up with something new, you'll still miss the PRIVATE.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  public must still be used as before.
- Where does this "public" come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Ummm 🙁 .
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  I can do it. In fact, if you don't come up with anything new, you'll still miss PRIVATE.
- What happens to "public" at this "private" time?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>When the private is crowded, the public is also crowded after the fact.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to "private" when its "public"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I wonder if a human could update the public immediately and the bot could reprint it in the private, but I'd have to be careful about overwriting it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the difference between its "public" and "private"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The bot will relay the information. There is room here for a smarter mechanism than just copying.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between that "bot" and "private"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Bots are not human, so they can show information that others cannot.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is that "bot" the same as "private"? Is it different?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>No, sir.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  Where social triggers flow in. When people mention it, it creates an opportunity for improvement. This is important for Scrapbox to be a fish tank.
- Is there anything else you can tell us about this "Scrapbox"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The other thing about Scrapbox as being a fish tank ... the fish need to move around and interact. Not sink to the bottom in a state of suspended animation. A well-linked and nurtured Scrapbox will support this by connecting links and suggesting them in ambiguous searches.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to "private" when its "Scrapbox"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Now private is sinking, and we need to float the sinking private by writing things in public.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>

- Where is this "Scrapbox" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>We want it to exist in a way that connects PRIVATE and PUBLIC, but right now it exists in pieces.

- How do you know about this "Scrapbox"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>How do we know that the private and public links are connected, Scrapbox can't know that now, so we need a way to assist there. The bot could read the recently updated public article and tell us the private article that might be connected to it.
