Summary: In a fast changing world[[状況認識]]の違いが生まれる。他人との議論よりも自分の認識を信じ進むべきである。<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>

When the world is changing at high speed, the situational awareness or [[world view]] of "what the world is like" varies greatly from person to person. This is because there is not enough time for convergence.
At this time, it is natural that the perception of the situation will often differ from that of others, and the question arises as to which perception of the situation is to be believed in such cases.
The other party is not responsible for our life for the most part, so we have to trust our own perception of the situation and go on with our own life.

So, in light of this, I think it is better to just take it as "this is how this person perceives the situation" and let it pass.
There is no point in arguing about which perception of the situation is correct. Arguing is something that people who are unsure of their perceptions tend to do. They want to gain reassurance by arguing. However, situational awareness is ultimately a worldview, and since it is the premise of the argument, one's worldview cannot be proven by logical argument. In the end, the two insecure ones will only fight each other and exhaust each other's spirit.
- If you think [[tsunami]] is coming, you should [[flee to higher ground]] quickly, not argue with people who think tsunami is not coming. After that, the tsunami may or may not come.
