Lyrics with a "married life feel"
Glue[[僕は恋の歌にはあまり興味を持ってない]]<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- I feel like there are a lot of songs like this that make sense when you get married, but isn't this a love song?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I tried to write it, but it's not "love."
        - A phrase that might be in a lyric, like the following (attempting an unfamiliar oracle)
            - What to protect
            - What's important
            - We'll live together.
            - help each other
            - Two is better than one...
            - A world I never knew existed...
- something like this[[結婚生活感]]ある<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - >  [[I want to protect you, but I'm protected by your warm eyes.]]
    - >  [[Let's not let strength be our strength, let's let it be in the back of our minds.]]
        - --- [[Lively Motion]]
            - And is this a baby born? I have a feeling.
                - >  [[I'm protecting you, but you're protecting me, so let's support each other.]]
    - [[これぞ結婚生活感という歌詞]]を出すことでその人の[[結婚観]]を探れそう<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - [Barabara ~Balance 2 Variance~ / Ken Washizaki lyrics (958857) - Petit Lili](https://petitlyrics.com/lyrics/958857)
    - Ring a bell?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - > [[both living with a gap]]
        - This of this.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I did it!<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - It's emo how at the beginning it was "weird and ugly when we do it together" but by the end it's "weirdly good when we do it alone".<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - This feels like a "married life feeling" to me too.
    - I feel it is difficult to get sympathy if you like minor songs because you have to be quite curious about a song you don't know to watch it.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - It would be communicative to have another song with lyrics that are close to the text vector.
        - I know JASRAC is very strict about lyrics, but can we use lyrics as data for machine learning because it is an exception to copyright? Will JASRAC come out when it's time to present the data to the user...<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- [[わかることと興味を持つことは関係ない]]という説もある<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
