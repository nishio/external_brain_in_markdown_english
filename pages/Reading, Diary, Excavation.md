    - [[reading]] is to read what has been written
    - [[diary]] is a written record of my daily thoughts.
        - [[If you don't write it, it disappears.]]
    - If you write it, it accumulates.
        - [[If you don't accumulate, you go around the same place.]]
    - [[excavation]] is digging through the "strata" in which my past writings are accumulated and stacked, and discovering what might be of value to me now
    - Read this again.
- These three complete the cycle.

> If I were to fill in the blanks, what would it be?

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1453904262962896897): write what you think before reading others and then compare!
> "Reading, journaling, rereading."
> These three complete the loop.

> I thought when I pictured it, "reading back" duplicates the "reading" element, the purpose of which is that you need a process to discover what you have written and make it the subject of "reading".

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1453906174185598979): the first word that came to me was "read back", but when I sorted it out based on the picture, "excavate" seemed to fit better
