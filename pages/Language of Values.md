title: "Language of Values"
---

At [[CUMOT2018]], I was asked, "It's amazing that you can verbalize what you feel [[value]] in. How can I do it?". At first, of course, I was not able to verbalize it, but even in that state, "feelings" such as "this is fun and interesting" and "this is not so fun and interesting" occur. If you pay attention to this and gather information about what you find interesting, you will see it later.

- [[verbalizing]] in [[values]] occurs in [[posterior]].

- [[Values are verbalized bottom-up.]]
- [[Values are verbalized after the fact.]]
