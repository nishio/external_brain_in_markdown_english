title: "Have them verbalize the difference between what is similar to LLM"

Similarity -> What is the difference?
This can be accelerated by LLM.

example
    - [[Difference in nuance between "voluntary," "independent," and "proactive."]]
    - [[The nuanced differences between "autonomy," "self-discipline," and "initiative."]]
