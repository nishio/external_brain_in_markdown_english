Consider this Scrapbox [vector search
- Using a UI for humans to do it is not very interesting.
    - Loading prompts and answering questions has become less and less interesting as people have been trained to "don't answer what you don't know" more and more as a halcyonation measure.
- First, create an API
    - As a tool for my future self to use.
    - Vector search and return the corresponding page
        - Cross-search Scrapboxes, blogs, etc. other than your own
    - Vector search and return a picture
        - This looks interesting.
            - For example, loading a request with "false dichotomy" will return `https://gyazo.com/80d45ec33ca8cbb138108d71ad7eec02` in the response.

                - [[blind spot card]] can be drawn in a vector search in the sentence I'm writing, rather than randomly.
            - This is possible because of the accumulation of "image" and "text" pairs in the form of "pages" in Scrapbox
                - [[The image and text pair has value.]]

    - [[Vector search your own Scrapbox and follow the 2hop link]]
    - Examples of vector searching and looking at images

- It would be interesting to [[collect questions and improve]].

- A system that recognizes speech when you are speaking and automatically queries it to search this Scrapbox and display matches.
- Related Pages" for speaking
    - At first I thought "search only images", but then I thought I could just use Scrapbox's related page format to display pages without images.

    - [[Interaction of personal knowledge networks]]
    - [[I want to search other people's Scrapboxes for vectors.]]
- Maybe it would be good to be able to do a "vector search including things other than yourself" based on this area.
- I can't really relate to the "Scrapbox by Yasukazu Nishio" vector search function, because it makes me see things differently from the way other people see them, and I have no sympathy for what they should be.
- The visibility of search queries is a [[Social Triggers]] for improved writing, etc., a feature that is clearly focused on the benefits to the provider.
- Therefore, unless I experience the side of a user who searches, I cannot understand "what value other users find in search.
        - [[one must see with one's own eyes]]
