title: "Do we keep dead texts?"
---

Q1: To keep or to throw away?
- Electronic information is not bulky, so storage costs are low.
- If the return exceeds the cost of storage, it is reasonable to store it.

Q2: Where to store them?
    - [[One pocket principle]]
- Shouldn't be more than one place to look.
- I prefer to store them in Scrapbox considering

Q3: Is this consistent with "[Not a warehouse to put dead text in.
- Does "not to be a warehouse for dead texts" mean "not to be a place to put only dead texts" or "not to put a single dead text?"
- I think it's the former.
- If the "living text" is adequate, there's no real harm if the dead text sinks beneath it.
