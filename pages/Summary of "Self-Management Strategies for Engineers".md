<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Claude/icon' alt='Claude.icon' height="19.5"/> [[Self-Management Strategies for Engineers]] can be summarized as follows

- For individuals, [[management]] means [[decision-making]] of how to [[allocate]] [[limited resources]] (especially [[Hours.]]).
    - The act of listening to a lecture itself is an investment of time in [[knowledge acquisition]] [[management decision]].
- For knowledge acquisition,
    - (1) [[to be taught]],
    - (2)[[Act and learn on your own]],
    - (3) [[knowledge exchange]]
    - There are three ways to do this.
    - Knowledge exchange in (3) is often overlooked but important.
- To exchange knowledge, we need [[friends who understand each other's situation]].
    - As a first step toward this end, we should
        - Create a [[small informal group]] and be [[the originator]].
        - [[Join multiple groups]] and be [a conduit of knowledge
            - Set [[recall trigger]] to 1 year later for [looking back
- The smaller and more informal the group is, the better [[the understanding of each other's situation]] and [[the more efficient the exchange of knowledge]].
    - If too large, [[free rider]] problems will occur.
- Engaging in [[multiple areas of knowledge exchange]] provides [[a level of expertise that cannot be Googled]] and leads to further knowledge exchange.

These are the main points of the strategy for allocating one's limited resources to knowledge acquisition and [[further increasing knowledge through knowledge exchange]].
