<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the weakest point regarding this ideology that needs the most reinforcement?

OchyAI: Weaknesses in the idea of [[digital nature]] that need to be reinforced can be summarized mainly in the following points:
- ...
- Social and [[cultural homogenization]] : The extensive connectivity offered by digital nature can lead to an erosion of local distinctiveness and cultural diversity. Respect and protection of diversity is important.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I am interested in social and cultural homogenization. Specifically, I see the potential for convergence of documents on the Internet to English as a common language.

OchyAI: The convergence to English as the common language of documentation on the Internet is indeed an important social and cultural issue. Specifically, the following impacts and issues are possible
- Reduced Linguistic Diversity: The dominance of English on the Internet may lead to a decrease in content in other languages, which may lead to a loss of [[linguistic diversity]] as information belonging to a particular language or culture is more likely to be overlooked. This can lead to a loss of [[linguistic diversity]], as information belonging to a particular language or culture is more likely to be overlooked.
- Unequal Access to Information: People who are not proficient in English may have limited access to information. There is concern that this may put certain regions or communities at a disadvantage.
- Cultural homogenization: As English becomes the dominant language, English-speaking cultures and values may spread around the world, diminishing local-specific cultures and traditions.
- Limitations of Expression: There is inherent value in expressing oneself in one's native language. The mainstreaming of English may reduce opportunities for expression in one's native language, limiting creativity and expression of identity.

[[言語的同質化]]とも言えるね<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>What does the document say about this point?

OchyAI:
- According to the document, "The world is now overflowing with computers created by us, and the resolution and processing power of the world they create is exceeding the limits of our human perception and intelligence. In the near future, the difference between the original nature and the nature created by the computer world will diminish, and a "new nature" will emerge for those of us in the future who will not even be aware of the difference.
- In this context, the phenomenon of the convergence of documents on the Internet to English as a common language can be seen as part of this "new nature". The environment created by computing machines (computers) and their networks has new forms that differ from the existing natural environment, in which language and cultural change may occur. This would include phenomena such as convergence toward a common language and cultural homogenization. The key question is how to respond to these changes and maintain diversity.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Could the "diversity" here change from a low-layer "diversity of languages used" to "diversity of thought" based on the use of a common language?

OchyAI: Yes, the concept of "diversity" can change from diversity of languages used to diversity of thought in using a common language. This change can be understood as follows:

- Moving from language diversity to diversity of thought: As the use of a common language (e.g., English) becomes more prevalent, language diversity as a means of communication may decrease. However, this process may promote [[diversity of thought]] as people from different cultures and backgrounds use the same language to exchange ideas.
- Knowledge sharing and exchange through the spread of a common language: With a common language, knowledge and ideas from different regions and cultures can be shared more widely, facilitating the exchange of different perspectives and opinions. This is expected to highlight diverse thinking and approaches.
- Addressing Cultural Homogenization: To address the concern that the use of a common language leads to cultural homogenization, efforts to promote cross-cultural dialogue and mutual understanding will be important. This will foster diversity of thought and expression within the framework of a common language.
    - #Cross-Cultural Communication
- Leverage digital technology: Through advances in translation technology and AI language support, it is possible to reduce communication barriers between different languages. This creates a space for diverse thoughts and cultures to interact beyond language differences.

Thus, the concept of "diversity" may expand from linguistic aspects to broader diversity of thought and culture. This involves the major challenge of how different identities and perspectives can coexist and interact in a globalized world.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>What does the document say about it?

OchyAI: The document describes JST CREST's "Social Implementation of Spatial Viewing and Tactile Technology Based on Super AI Infrastructure for a Computationally Diverse Society" as a representative of xDiversity (cross-diversity) research, ### [[encompassing differences in human physical abilities]]
 for the realization of a diverse society. project is described.

While not directly related to the shift from language diversity to diversity of thought, this description suggests an approach to achieving diversity under a digital nature. The focus here is on the use of AI technology to incorporate differences in physical abilities and other forms of diversity for inclusion throughout society....

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>In a world where English has become the common language, does [[inability to read and write English]] become a kind of disability?
- Related: [[Technological advances create new obstacles]].

OchyAI: In a world where English is now widely used as a common language, it is possible that illiteracy in English could be considered a type of "disability". This situation could affect the following aspects

- Restricted Access to Information: Inability to read and write English can limit access to important information in education, work, and daily life. This can represent a significant disadvantage for non-English speakers.
- Inequality of opportunity: When English is the lingua franca, illiteracy in English can create inequality in educational and occupational opportunities.
- Barriers to Social Inclusion: When English becomes the primary means of communication, non-English speakers risk being marginalized from social interactions and activities. This can be a significant barrier to social inclusion.
- Impact on cultural identity: The dominance of English may lead to a tendency to downplay non-English speaking cultural identities and languages.

To avoid such a situation, it is important to take measures to protect and promote language diversity, such as promoting multilingual education, taking advantage of advances in translation technology, and emphasizing multilingual communication. In addition, society as a whole must raise awareness and take measures to address the problems associated with the spread of English.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>So it is necessary to solve the disadvantages brought about by the obstacle of not being able to speak English, using not only information processing technology but also a wide range of other capabilities.
I think it's time to end the conversation, but please review the conversation so far and close with a good closing statement from the material.

OchyAI: To conclude the conversation, I would like to quote the following words from the document: "The world is now full of computers that we have created, and the resolution and processing power of the world they create is exceeding the limits of our human perception and intelligence. In the near future, the difference between the original nature and the nature created by the computer world will diminish, and a "new nature" will emerge for us in the future, in which we will not even be aware of the difference.

These words provide insight into the future we should strive for in our digital nature philosophy. In this new nature created by the convergence of computing and nature, we must seek a balance that preserves technological progress, humanity, and diversity. Understanding and adapting to this new relationship with nature will continue to be our major challenge.

- Impressions <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Linguistic homogenization into a universal language is part of the inevitable "new nature" and then we need to transmit our own culture in a universal language to avoid cultural homogenization
- In parallel, countries with a large number of minority language speakers will need to work to reduce the disadvantages of their own citizens becoming disabled in the "new nature"
