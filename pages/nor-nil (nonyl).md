> Norn (Old Norse: norn) is the goddess of destiny in Norse mythology. The plural is Nornir (Old Norse: nornir).... usually refers only to the three sisters of the giant race, the eldest Urs, the second Verzandi, and the third Skuld. It is said that the arrival of these three women marked the end of the golden age of the Earthgals.
[Norn - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%8E%E3%83%AB%E3%83%B3)

Some interpretations say that it refers to the past, present, and future, while others say that they are all future.
