> [@yugui](https://twitter.com/yugui/status/1574237751586611200?s=21&t=MmddqFyretCi5cmm87UvrQ): ah, I see. Is the deficit smallholder dual-income farmer the most straightforward example of the distortion of the system?
> If we do not issue an invoice and remain a tax-exempt business, we will be charged double consumption tax in the total distribution process, and we will probably be cut off by clients who do not like it. I don't have the strength to do the calculation according to the main rules or ask a tax accountant to do it. If you use simplified taxation, you will be charged extra consumption tax on your losses.
