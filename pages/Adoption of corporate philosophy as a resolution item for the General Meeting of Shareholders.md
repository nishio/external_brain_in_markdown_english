> Corporate Philosophy to be a matter for resolution at the General Meeting of Shareholders
> The realization of our corporate philosophy is the first priority in the management of our company.

It is interesting to consider what it means to clearly state in the Articles of Incorporation that "[[Corporate Philosophy]]" is a matter to be resolved by the General Meeting of Shareholders, rather than something that is decided by the founder or others and made to be followed as if it were a golden rule.
