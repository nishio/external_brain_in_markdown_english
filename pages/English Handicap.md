English [[handicap]].
[[English weakling]].
    - [[the weak]]
[[low English intelligence]].
- [[low intelligence]].

I don't object to "working harder" as a personal way of life.
I think "work harder" to others is anti-Pluraity.
The ideal situation is that everyone speaks in their native language.
- Technology to cooperate across differences
    - Language differences must also be transcended.

At [[Audrey+Glen+Halsk@Cybozu]], we were able to have Mr. Seki speak in Japanese with simultaneous interpretation in both directions, and I think we had a very useful discussion.
