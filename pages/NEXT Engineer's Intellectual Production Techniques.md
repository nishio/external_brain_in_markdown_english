- [The Engineers' Intellectual Production Techniques English Translation Project is now complete, and we are in the process of gradually improving the quality of the translations.
So it is necessary to accumulate energy for the next discontinuous improvement

Trigger: Need a trigger
Social Triggers
Rewards: Rewards are required
INVESTMENT: investment required
Appropriate difficulty adjustment

untidy
What does "tidy up" mean?
Be able to see where it is located.
- Classification.
Humans cannot create perfect classifications from the start.
bat problem
One pocket principle
Strategy to give up classification and put it in one place
Difference between objects and information
Location limitation = Index
Database indexes are a mechanism to reduce the time spent finding "where is it" by enabling efficient determination of "not here".
The index works in the same way in organizing physical objects.
All the receipts are in this box."
The requirement for effectiveness is to be sure that it is not elsewhere.
bottom-up
How to create an index, build from the bottom up
time axis
Time axis is a handy index
search (e.g. for someone using a search engine)
Things are difficult to search. This is an approach to make it easier to search.
Masui method of super-organization, potato search
Chaos and Creativity
Does chaos increase creativity?
There is a difference between "chaos" with 100 sticky notes spread out on a desk and "chaos" where you can't find the tools you need.
Jiro Kawakita of "Let Chaos Speak."

Highly agitated
Gap between ideal and reality
Aiming for an ideal beyond what can be done (reality) creates frustration.
Impatience is the engine of ambition, but it must be controlled to the extent that it does not overheat and burn itself out.
The Problem of Perfectionism
Suffer from striving for perfection from the start.
incremental
Repeated improvement and gradual betterment.
default zero
If we don't do it, it's zero, so let's try everything.
Failure is also an opportunity to learn
corporeality
Maybe physicality isn't the right word, I can't think of a replacement right now.
It is strange to ignore the "body" as irrelevant when discussing the "spirit" of motivation and agitation.
The human spirit is affected by the body more than he or she realizes.
With regard to agitation in particular, caffeine intake is known to have an effect.
Beware of caffeine
Caffeine causes agitation.
Theanine in green tea eases agitation.
Introduction to an experiment in which both caffeine and theanine are ingested.
Temperature, moisture, oxygen, blood sugar

stop thinking

- [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]] focused on the intellectual production of a single individual.
When thinking about multi-person organizations
- [[framework]] has the effect of creating [lingua franca
Form with added benefits
- [[(6.2.2.2) Advantages and disadvantages of frameworks]]
- [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]] concentrated first on what was feasible for individuals
- Because we believe in [[originality first before co-creation]].
On the other hand, there are various means that are useful in situations where there is more than one person.
- [[listening closely]]
- [[brainstorming]]
- [[Problem Solving Case Studies]]

Multiple people think
The Intellectual Production of Engineers] focuses on what can be done alone. This is because it is difficult to use methods that require others from the first step. On the other hand, there are cases in which efficient intellectual production can be achieved through discussions among several people. We were interested in when this happens.
- It's easier to think with more than one person than it is to think alone, which is why we do [[group work]]."
- But the observational fact is that some people don't see the benefit of group work."
- 'Can't you see the benefit of thinking with more than one person if you don't first think until you hit [[the wall]] alone?"
- "The advantage of multiple people is that you can force [[A Fresh Look]] by [[changing one's point of view]], thereby breaking down walls."
- 'So first you have to think to the limit alone.'
- If you listen to something very difficult early in the lecture, and you can't figure it out on your own, then you do group work, there's more incentive to talk to each other about what you don't understand."
- 'There's no incentive to discuss things when you're listening to something you can understand on your own, when you're doing group work.'

For programmers using multiple artificial languages, it is empirically clear that different languages have different ease of expression

What is distinguished in one language is not distinguished in another.

Temporal memory overflows when using representation techniques with high representation costs.
Bias to choose the lowest cost

keyword extraction
Output by applying to a template of question text
Estimates "which are the most important keywords" rather than randomly, and selects the highest scoring ones
Prioritize basic 2 questions, aim to develop symbols first at a basic 5-question pace, and ask questions of value when you determine that they are sufficiently developed.
Unleash the relationship question after asking the value question.

- This relates to Scrapbox as well.
- The first step is to keep a diary in a private Scrapbox, considering the principle of "one person first".
    - No need to be Scrapbox.
- The author had blogging experience before Scrapbox.
- Axis shift to knowledge that is less likely to become obsolete?
- No. Did it just go viral on social media?

Keichobot doesn't seem to be very voluminous now, so I'll put it in as a column after the Clean Language section on p. 197.
Kozaneba adds a postscript after page 177 and proceeds to say "I actually did the digitization described on p. 176 after the publication of this book.
It would be good to get an explanation of the Kozane method on p.173
- That's after the "omission of steps" in 171, [[knee-swing (gymnastics)]].
