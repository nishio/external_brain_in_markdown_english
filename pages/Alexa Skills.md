- If it's something like "hello," the system's activation word is triggered first, so you have to find the words "I don't know" to make it the activation word.
    - It became known as "My Skills."
- I got a custom skill to talk to Hello World.

- [Understand Smart Home Skills | Alexa Skills Kit](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/smarthome/understand-the-smart-home-skill-api.html)
- The difference seems to be that the smart home skill only works with a single command, but Amazon provides a lot of notation shaking keywords, etc.
- So it looks like my custom skills are good enough for me to do a lot of things.
