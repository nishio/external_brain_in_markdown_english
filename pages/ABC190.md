- It's a seemingly tricky problem, but since K is at most 16, it's not a problem to search 2^K times.
python

```
def main():
    N, M = map(int, input().split())
    AB = []
    for _i in range(M):
        A, B = map(int, input().split())
        AB.append((A - 1, B - 1))
    K = int(input())
    CD = []
    for _i in range(K):
        C, D = map(int, input().split())
        CD.append((C - 1, D - 1))

    ret = 0
    for i in range(2 ** K):
        xs = [0] * N
        for j in range(K):
            cd = CD[j]
            if i & 1:
                xs[cd[0]] = 1
            else:
                xs[cd[1]] = 1
            i >>= 1
        r = 0
        for j in range(M):
            if xs[AB[j][0]] == xs[AB[j][1]] == 1:
                r += 1
        ret = max(ret, r)
    print(ret)
```

- Interesting question
- The sum of a sequence of length i is $a, 2a+1,3a+3, 4a+6, 5a+10, 6a+16, 7a+21, \ldots$ if the first number in the sequence is a
- That is, we can count the number of integers i,a such that [$ N = (i + 1) a + i (i + 1) / 2
- $2N = 2a(i+1) + i(i+1) = (i + 1)(i + 2a)$
- If we write i+1 as k $2N = k (k + (2a-1))$
- We only need to determine if $2N / k - k + 1$ is even for k, the divisor of 2N
python

```
def solve(N):
    ret = 0
    for x in get_divisors(2 * N):
        if (2 * N // x - x + 1) % 2 == 0:
            ret += 1
    return ret
```


E
- K as small as 17
- Searching for a tree? Not necessarily a tree.
- Depth-first tracing is not optimal.
- Minimum number of moves to follow the graph?
- DP？
- Once you see F first

- I tried to update the difference with a phoenix tree, but when I thought about the update part carefully, I didn't need the phoenix tree operation.
    - Only use it where you seek it first.
- Removing the leading x reduces the number of falls by the number of those less than x
    - Since it is sorted from 0 to N-1, it is x
- Adding x at the end increases the number of tumbles by the number of things larger than x
    - N-1-x
python

```
def main():
    N = int(input())
    AS = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ft = FenwickTree(size=N)

    tento = 0
    for i in range(N):
        tento += ft.sum(N) - ft.sum(AS[i])
        ft.add(AS[i], 1)

    for i in range(N):
        print(tento)
        x = AS[i]
        tento -= x
        tento += (N - 1 - x)
```
