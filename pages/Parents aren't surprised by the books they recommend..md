I want them to be surprised. If a parent recommends a book or an illustrated book to a child, the child is not surprised because the child already knows the contents of the book or illustrated book, and if the child tells the parent about the contents of the illustrated book, the parent will say, "There is a deeper story behind that," and the child will have to go along with the parent's [[boasting of knowledge]].
- I see
- When parents of programmers try to get their children to do this or that and they say, "My child is not interested at all," it's because the parents know so much about it that when the child is active in that field, the parents think they are doing the right thing [[advising]], and it's the same as getting [[mounting]] from the child's point of view.

I feel uncomfortable about this. It is possible that the advice is simply not good enough.

They are "different in size and strength," "financially dependent," and "routinely monitored and prohibited from doing things," and they unconsciously have an [[inferiority complex]] and therefore have a strong desire to relieve their feelings of inferiority by "doing what adults can't do.

[[Desire to be told I'm great]]


Context note:.

Many may think, "I was never told to study because I could study to begin with." That may be true. But at the same time, I also think that they may have enjoyed learning because they were never told to study.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1711926127881847216) In fact, they enjoy learning, so they read a lot of books and illustrated books, not just school textbooks. I have learned what is written in the textbooks "on the side".
>  You may think, "Well, I should just let them read books and illustrated books" when you hear this kind of story. But at the same time, the old Imperial University students are.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1711927066990702883) I have never been forced to read a book. I read because I want to read. I read because I want to know. It seems that I read books because I enjoy reading them, not because my parents forced me to. Come to think of it, some people might think, "I was always a book-reading child, so I didn't need to tell them. That may be true. But.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1711928539149414648) Maybe you enjoyed reading because no one forced you to do so? This is the hypothesis that comes to mind. Without a proper investigation, it is not certain whether this is really valid or not. However, after observing children and conducting "experiments" with my own children, I think that children may enjoy reading and learning more if they are not forced or expected to do so by adults.

It seems to be because they are sensitive to the fact that their parents stop surprising them. When a parent says to a child, "This illustrated book is interesting. Read it and you'll see." From these words, the child

I want them to be surprised. However, if a parent recommends a book or an illustrated book, they are not surprised because they already know the contents of the book, and if they talk about the contents of the illustrated book, they will have to go along with the parent's boast of knowledge, saying, "There is a deeper story behind that.

>  That, and the way we treat them in everyday life may also be providing. It is said that children tend to become bored when there is an attitude that emphasizes print knowledge, such as illustrated books and books, instead of focusing on everyday discoveries. When they have the experience of surprising their parents with everyday discoveries and then rediscovering them in illustrated books and books.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1711931168764178700) The experience of surprising a parent is recreated. I want my parents to be surprised by explaining it to them. When they are surprised, they will try to find what they experienced from picture books and books again. In the process, they also acquire new knowledge. These also accumulate as stories that surprise their parents. This process seems to have become a fun way of reading illustrated books and books.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1711931653256515587) It has been my experience, even as an adult, that the more strongly someone recommends a book, the less likely I am to read it. I think even adults have experienced that the more strongly a book is recommended to them, the less likely they are to read it. It is as if the credit for discovering something interesting has been preempted! You found it interesting, didn't you? or "You found it interesting, didn't you? Even adults have this psychological reaction.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1711932012943298636) Children are more honest, so they react bluntly. It seems to me that they don't read books and illustrated books because their parents expect them to and force them to, and they don't study. Dislike of books and study seems to be a phenomenon caused by people who expect or force them to do so.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1711932481870667990) Adults also sometimes get angry when children do not respond as they would like and retaliate by "labeling" them. The child hates books, doesn't study, doesn't do his/her homework, etc. The child doesn't like books, doesn't study, doesn't try to do his/her homework. They try to relieve their own frustration by putting labels on their children out of spite.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1711932995475759372) But the child on the labeled side also retaliates back. If you're going to label me like that, I'm going to be exactly what you want me to be," he said. Labeling and labeling behavior. Many parents and children seem to fall into this vicious cycle. And the starting point of this vicious cycle is parental expectations.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1711939856786764159) When I was tutoring, I made a point of having a three-way meeting with parents and children. The parents would enumerate the things that were wrong with their child, perhaps with the intention of showing humility. The child would turn away with a bitter look on his/her face. I would read all the bad things the parents said into the child's strengths and be amazed, "You have such an interesting point! I was surprised.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1711940424217280960) "Mom, that is not a weakness of this child, but a strength. Let's develop that more," and the child's face comes up. Parents are told that what they thought were their child's shortcomings are strengths, and gradually, wonderful episodes start to emerge, such as, "Now that you put it that way, this child has such and such a part to play.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1711941294803845610) I was amazed at those episodes and said, "Mom, she is that solid. Don't worry. She will grow up. So please wait a little longer. He has many good points. Let's keep developing them." When I say this, they are surprised and say, "I thought they were only weaknesses, but I didn't realize they were strengths.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1711941822975483950) When a third party says something like that to them, they are motivated to reevaluate what they had labeled them and observe their children again dispassionately. I have heard that when a third party says such a thing to a child, it makes the child reevaluate the label that had been attached to him or her, and he or she is motivated to observe the child again calmly. When you observe, you realize that this child is often doing his/her best in his/her own way. They also realize that they had been frustrated with their own expectations of their own child, who was not able to keep up with them.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1711942570220404999) One of the complications of human psychology is that we sometimes think of expectations of others as a "gift". It seems that if a person does not deserve our expectations, we do not expect them from the beginning, and if we do expect them, it is because we recognize them, and we should be grateful for the "gift" of recognition.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1711943128410997194) Of course, there are cases where people are happy with the expectations and try harder and harder to meet them. But in more than a few cases, the expectations make us feel overwhelmed. What if we don't deliver what is expected of us? The anxiety often precedes the expectation, and the mind often becomes overwhelmed. They may lose their energy and motivation.
