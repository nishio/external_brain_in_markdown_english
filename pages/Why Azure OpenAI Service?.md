title: "Why Azure OpenAI Service?"

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the reason for the decision of an organization that says it is not allowed to hit OpenAI's API, but [[Azure OpenAI Service]] is OK?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT-4.5/icon' alt='GPT-4.5.icon' height="19.5"/>The main reasons are as follows

Differences in security requirements
- Azure OpenAI Service runs on [[Microsoft Azure infrastructure]] and allows integrated management of data and [[security policies]] on Azure. This makes it easier to meet an organization's security requirements.

Control the region where the data is located
- Azure allows data to be restricted to specific [[regions]], making it easier to meet [[GDPR]] and other regulatory requirements; OpenAI's direct API makes it difficult to specify data management regions.

Compliance and Regulatory Compliance
- Azure is compliant with various [[Compliance]] ([[ISO 27001]], [[SOC 2]], [[HIPAA]], [[FedRAMP]], etc.) and can meet compliance audit and regulatory requirements.

Contractual stability and support system
- If you already have an Enterprise Agreement with Microsoft, it is easier to coordinate the legal aspects of the agreement via Azure. It also has the advantage of a clear support structure.

For these reasons, the organization may allow the use of Azure OpenAI Service and limit the direct API use of OpenAI.
