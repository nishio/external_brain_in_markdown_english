title: 'Not "X" is an interpretation.'
---

- Isn't "not X" [[interpretation]], not [[fact]]?
        - [[abstract concept]] created in the brain by an observer of concrete facts, rather than [[concrete]] facts.
- Shouldn't the question be, "What exactly do you mean by 'not X'?" I think the question should be, "What exactly do you mean by 'not X'?

Example
- Something's not working with the program!"
    - What exactly do you mean by "stuck?"
    - You're getting an error message when you compile.
    - Is the program you executed behaving differently than you expected?
        - What was the expectation and what was the actual behavior that occurred?
- Mr. A has no communication skills!"
    - What exactly do you mean by "lack of communication skills?"
    - Did Mr. A not understand what the speaker said?
    - The speaker didn't understand what Mr. A told him?
    - What exactly are these "things we talked about"?
- No masks."
    - This is pretty concrete and factual.
    - But I dare you to ask, "What exactly do you mean by 'no'?" Let's think about it.
    - Until last week, drugstores had plenty of masks, but now they don't."
    - So that mask no longer exists?
        - Not even at the factory?
        - It's at the factory, but it hasn't reached the store?
        - It's arriving in the store, but promptly sold out?
