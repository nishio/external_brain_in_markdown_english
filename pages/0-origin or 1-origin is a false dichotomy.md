[[0-origin]] or [[1-origin]] is [[False dichotomy]].

A: Lua has array indexes starting from 1 (1-origin), right?
B: So does BASIC.
C: No, BASIC would be 0-origin
D: It was both, and later a switchable specification became standard!

[Minimal BASIC - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_BASIC)
> Minimal BASIC is a dialect of the BASIC programming language developed as an international standard. The effort started at ANSI in January 1974, and was joined in September by a parallel group at ECMA.
> ...
>  The lower bound for arrays is typically 0, but using OPTION BASE 1 can change the index to 1.
Can be switched with `OPTION BASE 1`.

Properly implemented in VBA, etc.
