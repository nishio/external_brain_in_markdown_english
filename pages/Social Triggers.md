---

This term is used by <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> to refer to the [[social]] mechanism such as [[reference]] on [[SNS]] that triggers [[trigger]].

- [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]]  p.141  [[(4.5.3.3) Teaching others]]
> Also, if the materials are published on the Internet, they will be mentioned on social networking sites from time to time, triggering recall. The higher the social demand, the more frequently it is mentioned, and thus the more frequently it is reviewed and improved.
Surprisingly, I did not put it in the index. We had not put the term "social trigger" in the paper.

- [[Hook model]]
    - I use the word "trigger" in this sense.
