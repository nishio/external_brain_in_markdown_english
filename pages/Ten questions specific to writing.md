- Based on the questions introduced in [[Six Minute Writing]], modified by Nishio to fit the concept of [[clean language]].

- Q1: What do you hope will come of the writing?
- Q2: Imagine someone who is excited to read that sentence. What would that person say?
- Q3: How positive does he/she feel?
- Q4: After such a positive feeling, what action would you suggest the person take?
- Q5: What words would you say to that person to help them feel that positive?
- Q6: If you had a negative feeling, the exact opposite of the positive feeling you answered in Q3, how would you feel?
- Q7: Imagine a person with that negative feeling. What would that person say?
- Q8: Where do these negative feelings come from?
- Q9: What would you say to someone with that negative feeling?
- Q10: In a word, what is the theme of the text?
