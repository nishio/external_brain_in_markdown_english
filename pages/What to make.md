- If you try to explain to others why you are making it before you make it [[I would pick something that is easy to explain.]]
- I think we should do [[underground research]] until it takes some shape.
- I think what you really want to make is what you still want to make even if you are opposed to it.
- But that's something you can carry through because you're confident in yourself, and many people wilt when they disagree.
- Is that really the best system for explaining to others in advance what you want to create and get it adopted?
    - I would choose a theme to be adopted.
    - I prefer someone who "intends to make it even if it doesn't get adopted."
    - I'd rather have someone who's already made it.
    - In the end, does it matter if [[prototype]] exists or not?
            - [[Judged by our actions]]

- Concern that if we do a "people who have already made it are better" style of selection for elementary and middle school students, there is a strong bias that "people whose parents have created the environment" are more likely to be adopted.
- The world is full of cheap or free means, but we fail to realize that there are
    - Is it necessary to distribute the know-how to create what you want to create without spending a budget?
        - [[Preliminary Unexplored Jr.]]-like community?
