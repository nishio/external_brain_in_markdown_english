title: "All data is a lie"
---

>  All [[data]] are [[Japanese river otter (Lutra lutra whiteleyi)]]. Use data with the knowledge that it is a lie. And from that, we can determine the more correct truth. That is the path to [[judgment]]. But how can the truth be determined from a lie? It is because, from a different point of view, every data also has some trace of [[truth]] in it. ([KJ method Let the chaos speak for itself p.71)
