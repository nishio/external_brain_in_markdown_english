Summary: The
The [[social problems associated with the development of AI]] raised by Sam Altman will not be believed by many [[until they actually happen]]. Therefore, it may be difficult to [[realize countermeasures before the problem occurs]], and only those who understand [[will escape]]. But is it right for the wise to simply run away? This situation is like Atlas supporting the mythical world, but in reality Atlas is a life-size person, who would support if he could afford to, but would not if he could not. It may be an agrarian bias to blame them for running away. The result is a social network that continues to flee, and the good ones move on. One can imagine what the world will look like after the world is divided, with those who move serving as the link between those who settle down.

## input
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1640274967765065729) I was thinking about Sam Altman's [[American Equity]], and the problem he's concerned about happens, and most people in the existing state actually If you don't believe in their occurrence until they happen, and the problem occurs before the measures he proposes are realized, then the only people who understand [[escape]] are the ones who know

> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1640275685016227841) seriously this is it!

> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1640275829321256960) I think it's also true that [[effective altruism]]-like ideology doesn't catch on at all. The problem is that only the smart people understand it.

> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1640275980664336386) and I'm suffering from a [[categorical imperative]] kind of pain, like whether it's ok for smart people to just run away.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1640284460532002816) [[atlas]] is talking about whether or not he will continue to support the celestial sphere, but since atlas is not a god but a life-size human being, if he can afford it, he will support it, but if he can't afford it, he won't. If he can afford it, he will support it, but if he can't afford it, he won't support it.
    - [[Atlas, who happens to be able to afford it, is propping up the celestial sphere.]]

- [[Blaming the run is agrarian bias.]]
- → [[The social network that keeps escaping]] → [[Move the good stuff.]]
- → [[People on the move connect people who settle down.]] → [[After the world is torn apart]]
