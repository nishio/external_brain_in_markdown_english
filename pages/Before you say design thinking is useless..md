    - [[design thinking]] is good at [[discovering the challenges]] that you may not have been aware of
- Larger organizations often have issues to begin with.

essence
- 1: Always [[Focus on people]].
- 2: [[Integration of different disciplines]] by [[sensitivity]]
- 3: Repeat [[verification]] many times

1 is closely related to what is called [[Human Centric Design]] or [customer-orientation
3 is simply put [[PDCA]].
It is interesting to note that 2 integrates through sensitivity, not logic.
