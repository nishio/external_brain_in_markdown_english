> [masa_0083](https://x.com/masa_0083/status/1902828367407353871) I couldn't sleep for some reason, so I made some strategy notes for Farming Simulator 25, which I've been playing lately anyway.
>  I have no idea about agriculture and forestry, so I was groping. But this game is the world's best-selling agricultural simulator, so the specifications are decent.
>  If you can figure it out, you can play endlessly.
> [masa_0083](https://x.com/masa_0083/status/1902831298110165374) It's basically a game about agriculture, but the essential game is about how to work efficiently and find the steps to achieve the desired tasks. [masa_0083 I think people who can understand and enjoy the game by themselves, e.g. players of Fromgame, will enjoy it.

>  Modern agriculture is mechanized in all areas and can do an amount of work that a single person would normally never be able to do alone.
>  (All the farm machines in the game are real!)
>  But on the other hand, without machinery, it would be impossible to produce the bulk of agricultural products needed for business.
>  So we have to borrow money to buy or lease machines to maintain them.
>  So, since simply producing agricultural products is not profitable, the argument goes, why not just buy raw materials, process them, and sell them?
>
>  This is a game and that's fine, but in real life someone has to produce produce produce at a low profit to make food.
> [masa_0083](https://x.com/masa_0083/status/1902838375062933980) This is also true for forestry and livestock farming, and the fact that primary industries are not very profitable in the game (to the extent that it is a game) is reproduced.
>  From an economic standpoint only, the return on primary industry is not commensurate with the risk.
>  Everyone says that rice is expensive and vegetables are expensive, but as long as the original cost is spent on machinery, fertilizer, and land, there is no advantage to offering prices at a level that the producers cannot survive.
>  When you try farming, albeit fictitiously, you realize how cheap commercial agricultural products and processed livestock products are.

> [ED0JP](https://x.com/ED0JP/status/1902912030555902066) It's a good game that really makes you realize how hard primary industry is! I was only pursuing profit, and as a result, I covered my cotton fields with cotton, and leased a lot of fertilizer spreaders, highly efficient seeders & tillers, and cotton harvesters during the harvest season to increase yields.

> [masa_0083](https://x.com/masa_0083/status/1903215003353878659) I like it!
>  I'm hittin' it until harvest, so I cut the trees and sell them as building material at the sawmill. It's a pretty good income.

> [Temp002a](https://x.com/Temp002a/status/1902883036519338366) There are videos on Youtube accounts like Old Farmer of colorful tractors hauling stuff and running on a track, among little kids near me. It's a boom among the little ones in my area.

> [Q98VtSimoK41741](https://x.com/Q98VtSimoK41741/status/1902981044451807264) Small farmers are now forced to invest in machinery and are unable to continue making money.
