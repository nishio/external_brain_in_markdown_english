Investing in growing things that money can't buy
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1675718378676428801) Some goods have a backing of goods that increase in value over time and some do not, and attracting investment money to those that do not ultimately comes down to a ponzi scheme. It's the same with Pokemon cards, tulip bulbs, and value-added stocks, not just NFTs.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1675726974361415681) The fact that there are more options for derivatives other than equity is in itself a good thing because it gives entrepreneurs more options. On the other hand, in the start-up phase of a "project that could grow", the resources needed are not always cash, so in such cases, the "derivative" will be something that money can't buy.

They will be in the same position as those without gold in the market for things that can be bought and sold with gold.

This argument addresses the point that while some goods that increase in value over time have "[[backing]]," investment money may flow into those that do not, which ultimately comes down to [[sponge scheme]] (one of the [[fraud]]-like investment techniques). Specifically, [[NFTs]] (Non-Fungible Tokens), but also [[Pokemon cards]], [[tulip bulbs]], [[overvalued stocks]], etc.
Having more options other than equity also gives entrepreneurs more options and helps them launch new projects. However, if [[the resource needed is not cash]], then the project [[cannot be bought with money]]. Finally, it is stated that [[investors looking for something they can buy with gold and get more money back]] cannot participate in [[trading in something that cannot be bought with gold]]. This means that he would be in the same position as "[[a person without gold in the market for something that can be bought and sold for gold]]."
