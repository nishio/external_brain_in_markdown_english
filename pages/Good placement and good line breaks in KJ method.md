title: "Good placement and good line breaks in KJ method"
---

- Good arrangement] and [[good line break]] in KJ method
- Both are rather easy to make with machine learning.
    - Good line breaks are now made on a rules basis, but can be somewhat adjusted.
        - [[Automatic layout of single stickies]] has not been implemented yet.
- It would be nice if you could tick [[Moderate length]] when you type a long sentence.
        - [[voice input]], etc., can be used for lazy input.
