title: "The Intellectual Production of Engineers Author's official page"
---

The author's official page of a book is generally created in static HTML. The reason for this is that the distribution period of a book is longer than the lifetime of a web service, and it would be a problem if the URL on the paper is disconnected for reasons on the web service side. However, as of 2018-07-26, I am very interested in networking knowledge using Scrapbox, so I dare to experiment here.
