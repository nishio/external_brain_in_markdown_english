title: "Should not be made."

2024-09-29
I saw the description of the situation in the question, "[[How should I make it]]?" and thought, "You shouldn't make it," but since it doesn't seem like that's the kind of answer I'm looking for, I'll just shut up.
    - [[You don't have to stand in your own way.]]
    - [[Let the market do the criticizing.]]

[[You want to make it, so make it.]]
