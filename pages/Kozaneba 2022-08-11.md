The small text in the group title is unreadable when zoomed out, but
If the group title is too large, it will not fit in a small group and will be omitted, making it useless...
I'm torn... how it should be...

I put in a one-step expanded Kozane without using the group title feature, but I have a feeling that this is the right way to go.

Crashed when I titled and closed the group.
When several pieces are grouped together and titled, the title is not fully inserted and is omitted, which makes no sense.
