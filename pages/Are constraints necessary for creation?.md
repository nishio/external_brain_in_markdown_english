title: "Are constraints necessary for creation?"

from [/villagepump/constraints create creativity](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/constraints create creativity).
- Not so far as "constraints are necessary for creation?"
    - If there are no constraints, you can "create something new" just by randomly changing arbitrary parameters.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Humans don't place much value on such creations.
            - An example of 575 without the restriction of "meaning comes through" is "Aiueo, kakiku-keko-kokeko, sasissusse-so."
        - So I think it's "[[Constraints get in the way of creativity]]" and "[People perceive value in creations that overcome constraints.

- [[creation]]
- [[value]]
