title: "Those who get a title after they act and those who want to be after they have a title."
---

- There are people who get a [[title]] after [[action]], and there are people who want to be after the title is created, and these two types of people may seemingly have the same title, but their behavior may be completely different.


[[who wants a title]].
    - Similar to [People who make community affiliation their identity.
- They think they are worth more in "titles" and "community affiliations" than they are in themselves, so they want them and are proud of them

The type of person who acts first, then they talk about "putting on a title," and then they get it because it's easier to act if they have it.
- If your title gets in the way of what you want to do, throw it away.
    - [[Retired from the Board of Directors of General Incorporated Association Unexplored]]
