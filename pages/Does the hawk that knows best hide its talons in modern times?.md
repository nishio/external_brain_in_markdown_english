title: "Does the hawk that knows best hide its talons in modern times?"
---

Is it [[inefficiency]] that "[[a wise man]] keeps some of his talents in reserve," that is, "a wise man does not hide his talents in reserve," even today, or is "a wise man hides his talons" itself an old-fashioned idea that has not adapted to the changing times, and is such an idea being held today? Is it inefficiency to think like that nowadays?
