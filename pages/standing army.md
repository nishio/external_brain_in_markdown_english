title: "standing army"
---

> A standing army is a permanently organized, often professional, military force. It may be volunteer or draft-based, but in any case it is composed of full-time soldiers... A standing army is usually better equipped, more highly trained, better able to respond quickly to emergencies, more effective as a deterrent, and above all, better prepared for war. The term was coined in Western Europe around 1600, but standing armies existed long before that.

- The first standing army in Mesopotamia was established by King Sargon of the Akkadian Empire (ca. 2334-2279 BC). Sargon organized a standing army of about 5,400 soldiers, including soldiers from conquered city-states. This is considered the world's first full-fledged standing army.

> King Sargon, founder of the Akkadian Empire, is believed to have organized a professional army. However, the oldest clearly documented founder of a standing army was Tiglath Pileser III of Assyria (r. 745 BC-727 BC). Diglato Pileser III disbanded the militia and instead paid salaries to professional soldiers. His army consisted mainly of Assyrian soldiers, but foreign mercenaries and gentry were also auxiliary forces. The standing army he created was also the most sophisticated administrative and economic institution in the world at the time, and was the driving force of the Assyrian economy, which used war (and looting) as a tool.
