<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Amazon's principle of "[[Disagree and Commit]]" is a philosophy that promotes [[rapid decision-making]] and effective action. This approach was popularized by [[Jeff Bezos]], the founder of Amazon. The idea behind this principle is the importance of team members supporting decisions and working together for the success of the project, even when there is disagreement.

The basic concept of "Disagree and Commit
- Embrace disagreement - Not everyone needs to agree, and in fact, diverse perspectives can enrich discussions and lead to better decisions.
- Respect quick decisions - Once a decision is made, you are expected to commit to and support it, even if your opinion is not adopted.
- Joint responsibility for results - Committing to a decision means taking responsibility for its outcome together as a team. Successes and failures are shared by the entire team.

Application to the way meetings are conducted
- Encourage open discussion - allow team members to express their opinions freely and respect different points of view.
- Clarify the decision-making process - After a thorough discussion, the leader or team will make a decision. This process should be clear and transparent about how conclusions were reached.
- Consistency of action after a decision is made - Once a decision is made, everyone acts in accordance with that policy and joins forces to ensure the success of the project.

Disagree and Commit" is an especially effective approach for companies and teams working in fast-paced environments. It allows for quick action once a decision has been made, rather than wasting time on lengthy discussions. By applying this principle, organizations can move more nimbly and respond more effectively to changing market conditions.
