Shirogane Chosha
- I forgot to take a picture.
- I heard that a platinum chief lived there.

    - Platinum chiefs" = "chiefs who have a lot of silver.
    - It is said that a wealthy family named Yagishita Kazunosuke, who founded this area in the Muromachi to Nanbokucho period, owned a large amount of silver (shirogane) and was called "Ginchoja" (chief silver merchant), which was the origin of the place name "Shirogane" (white gold).
        - > It is said that "Yagishita Kazusuke," who founded this area in the Oei era, owned a large amount of silver (read as "shirokane") and was called "Ginchoja" (silver chief), and the name "Shirogane" became the name of the area as it is today.
        - >  It seems that the town name should not be muddled with "Shirogane" as in the reading of "silver". In the "Odawara Shu Shokuryo Yakucho", the name was written as "Shirogane", but the reading was still "Shirogane".

    - The remains of the former residence are located in the area that is now the Nature Education Garden attached to the National Museum of Nature and Science ([[Shirokanedai]]), and the remains of the earthen mound that surrounded the mansion still remain. The history and explanation of the park mentions the site as a medieval mansion.



I walked 11.7km in total.
