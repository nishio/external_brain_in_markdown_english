title: "Confuse them, and the status quo will be chosen."

> This is a technique often used in [[authoritarianism]] countries, where information, whether false or true, is disseminated in large quantities through social media and other means. People do not know which information to believe, and they choose "maintenance of the status quo" over change. In other words, if those in power want to maintain their own system, it is easier to control people by distributing incomprehensible information to make them [[acting without thinking]] rather than to persuade them earnestly.
