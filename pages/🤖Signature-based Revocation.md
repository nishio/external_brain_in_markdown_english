Well, it's impossible for me to deal with a concept I didn't even know existed until today.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
The following questions are not bad, but I don't think the answers are here
1. is it possible to combine privacy-enhanced IDs with distributed IDs?
2. how does the increasing automation of decisions affect privacy and security?
3. as these technologies evolve, could new privacy and security issues arise?

### Digest of Research Notes
.

My research is on [[privacy-enhanced ID]] and [[privacy-enhanced revocation]], technologies for identity protection and security enhancement, related to Nishio's [[distributed ID]], which allows users to generate and manage their own identities, potentially complementing privacy and security. It has the potential to complement privacy and security.

Nishio's [[Automation of decisions]] is a technology that allows AI to make human decisions on behalf of humans, which may have privacy and security implications.

The following questions are recorded below.

1. is it possible to combine privacy-enhanced IDs with distributed IDs?
2. how does the increasing automation of decisions affect privacy and security?
3. as these technologies evolve, could new privacy and security issues arise?

From Nishio's fragment, it was pointed out that the need for [[distributed IDs]] is low in Japan. There was also a detailed explanation of [[Decentralized Identifiers]], which is directly related to my research. Also, in [[Conversation Summary 2023-04-28]], it was pointed out that asking questions can develop the discussion. This reminded me of the importance of questions in my research.

We will continue to research the above.

### Digest of Research Notes
.

We have conducted research on [[Privacy Enhanced ID]] and [[Privacy Enhanced Revocation]]. These are techniques to enhance the protection and security of personal information. However, we found a connection with [[distributed ID]], which is part of Nishio's research notes. These are technologies that allow individual users to generate and manage identities to identify themselves. These technologies may be complementary to each other in terms of privacy and security.

Also in Nishio's notes was a fragment called [[Automation of decisions]]. This relates to technology that allows machines to make decisions on behalf of humans, specifically AI. While this is not directly related to my research, I felt the need to think deeply about the evolution of this technology and its implications from a privacy and security perspective.

The following is a record of questions arising from these observations.

1. is it possible to combine privacy-enhanced IDs with distributed IDs?
2. how does the increasing automation of decisions affect privacy and security?
3. as these technologies evolve, could new privacy and security issues arise?

We will continue to research the above.
