title: "Three forms of government replacement by AI"
---

from  [[Namera Conference 3]]
- From the presentation "[[Algocracy]]" by [[Touki Yuki]].

Many people think in terms of [[0 or 1]] with a vague idea of "government" when considering the replacement of government by AI, but there are various functions in government, so it is better to consider which parts can be replaced.

- Substitution of administrative functions: enforcement within the bounds of humanly determined law
- Alternative legislative function: deciding on laws and budgets
- Alternative judicial functions: determination of legality, review of unconstitutionality

It was very interesting that instead of a binary argument about whether to leave governance to AI or not, you broke down the system of governance into several parts and then became like "leave the administration and the judiciary to die", it was like a higher resolution of understanding, I want to think about it carefully.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
