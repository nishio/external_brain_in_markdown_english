- > I often heard that at RCA/IDE, "you can't plan for innovation, but you can nurture the people who are likely to create innovation". We used to talk about this with the faculty.
- > Let the [[pompous people]] discover pompous people, and cluster them together. Then [[innovation]] will happen on its own through [[mutual inspiration]] and [[cross-fertilization]].
- >  The essence of what both unexplored and IDE are doing is the same.

The challenge is how to [[connoisseur]] the "likely innovators.
    - [[Can you spot innovative talent in advance?]]
- It's not clear that the best and brightest who applied after the unexplored became famous are in the same cluster as the savages who applied when the unexplored was unknown.


- [[Pointy people gather!]]
