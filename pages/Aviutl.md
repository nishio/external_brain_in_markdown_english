I wonder if that's OK, if the author dies inadvertently, it means that it will be impossible to maintain forever.
> [windymelt](https://x.com/windymelt/status/1904849113575022994) I think aviutl is a binary distribution, so if it were to become unmaintainable, it would be the end of the world if the majority of either the OS or CPU instruction set were to change in a destructive way. If the majority of either OS or CPU instruction set changes destructively, it would be the end of the world (and dlls would stop working as collateral damage).

> [windymelt](https://x.com/windymelt/status/1904864253162446868) What I'm saying is this, if we keep this up, it's going to be a crazy blow if Aviutl ever runs out, so we might as well figure out a sustainable way to do it. I'm just saying that it would be better to think of a sustainable way.

> [windymelt](https://x.com/windymelt/status/1904868624252494144) ugh... (maybe [[opinionated]] individuals should promote it in the beginning)

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1905088483515080745) Interesting discussion. I think there is a structure where the cost of making a replacement is extremely high, but while the existing product exists, it is not used because the general public does not see the value in the replacement. It would be more heroic to release the product after the existing product stops working and the general public is screaming, saying, "This could happen.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1905090898704364012) It's similar to the problem that the emotional support staff who operate the system so that failures don't occur are not appreciated.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1905091130368360822) I wonder if [[Retrospective Funding]] or something like that is the only solution since the essential problem is that most people don't have the ability to evaluate the future?

> [hikalium](https://x.com/hikalium/status/1905261343923433793) A word that suddenly came out of my own mouth today and I thought it might be rather true:
>  "Re-implementing the whole thing is not a [[profit-and-loss arithmetic]] decision that an organization can make. It's just a matter of strong will and brute force to do it and replace it when someone comes up with the idea. That's how the world has turned."
