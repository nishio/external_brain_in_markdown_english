### [[Components]]
1.### [[subject]] ([[agent]])
    - Individual autonomous participants (individuals, small groups, etc.) work away from the existing [[centralized model]].

2.### [[connecting medium]] (intermediary technology/institution)
    - AI, blockchain, the Internet, remote work systems, and other mechanisms that directly and [[non-hierarchically]] connect entities to each other.

3.### [[interaction network]]
    - A network in which dispersed entities exchange information, resources, and knowledge on an equal basis and generate value through a [[co-creation process]].

4.### New value system
.
    - Unconventional value is created that includes not only economic benefits but also social and environmental aspects, bringing about a transformation of the existing system.

### [[Patterns of conjunctive relations]]
- mediation → subject linkage.
    - The connecting medium links entities directly to each other without the need for traditional centralized management.
    - This creates a foundation for individual entities to engage on an equal footing.

- Interaction between subjects → Co-creation network.
    - Connected entities interact with each other, sharing and spreading knowledge and resources within the network, and creating new value beyond their individual capabilities.

- Co-creation network → generation of new value.
    - Within these networks, traditional standards of value are reevaluated and multifaceted environmental, social, and economic values are created.
    - The results then become a feedback loop that encourages further technological innovation and institutional reform (evolution of connecting media).

### [Summary
.

In other words, each case has a structure in which ### [[equal interaction network]]
 is formed from the starting point of "[[subject dispersion]]" and "[[direct connection by connecting medium]]", and that network creates ### [[new value system]]
 beyond the conventional framework. This structure manifests itself as the same connection patterns in diverse areas such as career, lifestyle, investment, education, and business.
