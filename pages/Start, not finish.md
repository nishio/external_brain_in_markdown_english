There is a boundary between qualitatively different things A and B when they are continuous on a time axis.
At the timing of this boundary, A ends and B begins. Therefore, "it is the end and the beginning" is logically correct, but since humans often recognize the familiar A and not so much the unfamiliar B, the sense that "A has ended" becomes stronger.

Related and more specific
- You feel like things are complete when you've succeeded in taking the exam and getting into the school of your choice.
    - The entrance exam has been completed, but a new life at the university is about to begin, so it is more appropriate to have "the feeling of completion" rather than "[[the feeling of completion]]".
- You think "it's over" when the tutorial is over and the main game is about to begin.

- [[feel like it's over]]
- [[goal]]
- [[start]]
