title: "New information comes from the young."
---

As a student, new information often comes from "teachers" older than you.
- It is unique in that it means "[[teacher]]" when written as "born first."
- Learn from senior members of society for some time after entering the workforce.
- But as you get older and older, new information comes to you from older and younger people.
- Here, we think "new information comes from young people" and increase the weight of that.
    - Some do and some don't, I'm on the side that does.

case
- Yesterday at [[Anno Teramoto Nishio Devin Roundtable]], Yasuno-san asked me, "Nishio-san did the Devin thing early on, why?" He asked me.
    - It's from blu3mo ([/villagepump/2024/12/26#676ced7c79e1130000888ec3](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/2024/12/26#676ced7c79e1130000888ec3))
- I was writing a history of the LLM and looking back at what I was doing and when.
    - It was tried as early as the summer of 2022 (before ChatGPT's release in November, so earlier than that).
    - It originated from Okamura-san of Unexplored Jr.
        - [[AI's Vague Anxiety Study Group#6565659c96aff09e000098c1e6]]
- Plurality also originated from [[tkgshn]] in the first place.
        - [[Weekly journal 2023-04-17~28]]

I noticed in your case study that you're not just "young," you're all active overseas.
- Maybe the focus on "[[youth]]" was misleading and it's more about "seeing different things in different places."
- I'm consciously trying to lift weights.
    - Is this that, "There are people my age who unconsciously disregard what young people say, and I think that's a bad thing.
    - You talk about how some people have a mental model where they can only learn from their "teacher." [[Learning ladder model]].
            - [[Is the learning ladder model correct?]]
