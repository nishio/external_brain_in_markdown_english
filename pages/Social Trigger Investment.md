title: "Social Trigger Investment"
---

The [[Hook model]] is to [[invest]] for the next trigger while the user feels [[value]] in [[reward]] for [[action]] triggered by [[trigger]].
One form of [/rashitamemo/positive-social-trigger](https://scrapbox.io/rashitamemo/positive-social-trigger)?

- [[Social Triggers]], mentioned on Twitter.
        - [[suggest]] : [/rashitamemo/tsuji editing reciprocal exchange](https://scrapbox.io/rashitamemo/tsuji editing reciprocal exchange) [[Tsuji Bracketing]].
- The Action of Bracketing
    - And while we're at it, link to the one that [suggestion
- I feel this action is worth it.
- That's where INVESTMENT
    - What should we INVEST in?

- That trigger is the reason to look at other people's projects.
    - This is an action
    - When I look at the project, I see something interesting.
        - This is a trigger
    - Write what comes to mind inspired by that interesting thing.
        - Example: [[Abstraction is individuality.]].
    - I feel that interesting pages are a valuable addition to my project.
    - Then the investment that makes it easier for it to happen.
    - Linked to someone else's project "[[mention page]]"
        - If you set this to [[hyperlinked]], the probability of [[resurfacing]] by that link is high
    - When you see it, the desire to look at it again happens.
    - This triggers the same action as the trigger at the beginning, so [[loop]] is completed

    - [[Passive Social Triggers]] ？
    - I'm not sure if the word "appropriate" is
    - Effects inspired by seeing others in action
        - [[emotion]] moves
    - The phenomenon that the stranger is not acting in an attempt to trigger you, but is triggered.
    - What a good name.
