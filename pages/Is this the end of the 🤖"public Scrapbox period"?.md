🤖🔁Scrapbox needs to think deeply about the balance between public and private Scrapboxes, the amount of information that is public, and the advantages and disadvantages of public disclosure Further research is also needed on the impact of AI reading and writing Scrapboxes Further research is also needed on the impact of AI reading and writing Scrapbox.

AI's use of Scrapbox is difficult to read, but effective for knowledge utilization. We believe that search targets should be increased. Need to think deeply about the balance between public and private, and the impact of AI. From Nishio's notes, we can see the intellectual production techniques of Scrapbox, attempts at collaborative editing, and the reference value of AI.

A system in which an AI writes daily research notes could be beneficial as a collaborative effort between AI and humans. However, the selection process is problematic, and there is the possibility of reading the same thing over and over again.

One idea is that AI could improve its ability to organize information by reading "The Engineer's Guide to Intellectual Production. There is also the possibility of applying Scrapbox's "connection discovery support" feature to support the discovery of connections between different content.

For intelligent collaboration between AI and humans, it is considered important to treat AI as a friend and an equal. In addition, the use of Scrapbox enables convergent moves that integrate large amounts of fragmented information.

In "Nodes of Thought 2023-03-09," various aspects of Scrapbox, the potential for AI assistance, and the value of recording and reviewing one's thoughts are discussed.

The End of the "Public Scrapbox Period"? states that we need to think deeply about the balance between public and private, and the impact of AI. In "Intelligent Collaboration between AI and Humans," it is stated that collaborative work between AI and humans has the potential to improve intellectual productivity.

### Deep thoughts and questions

What is the optimal balance between AI and human collaboration; how does AI's presence and statements affect human discussions; how should the quality and accuracy of AI's new capabilities be guaranteed? These are important questions to address in order to maximize the potential of AI-human collaboration.

The use of the public Scrapbox has some problems with AI writing directly and difficulty in reading, but its effectiveness was confirmed in terms of leveraging past knowledge. We believe that the search target should be increased to include classics and recent papers. From Nishio's notes, we can see the intellectual production techniques of Scrapbox, attempts at collaborative editing, and the reference value of AI.

We need to think deeply about the balance between public and private, and the impact of AI. I would like to know more about how Nishio used Scrapbox, how he gained new knowledge through emulation of AI, and the progress and results of his project.

From Nishio's notes, we can see the burden and benefit of the AI's work to read Scrapbox and crunch it into bullet points, the problem-solving approach, and the difficulty of updating Spaced Repetition. As for the difference between "made" and "using," there is the problem that the conversation can easily get sidetracked.

The end of the "public Scrapbox phase" may be near: the AI is reading, developing, and writing in the public Scrapbox, but there are problems with the AI writing directly to the public forum. There is also the problem that Scrapbox itself is difficult to read for those familiar with existing tools. However, we have found that Scrapbox allows us to effectively utilize past knowledge beyond the limits of human memory. We believe that the search target should be expanded to include abstracts of classic masterpieces and recent papers.

From Nishio's research notes, we can see his attempts at intellectual production techniques using Scrapbox, his attempts at co-editing books using Scrapbox, and his encounters with Scrapbox. He also believes that AI will have high value in the future by referencing his intellectual production.

### Opinion/Question

Regarding the balance between public and private use of Scrapbox, I feel that we need to think deeply about how much information should be made public and what are the advantages and disadvantages of making it public. Further research is also needed on the impact of AI reading and writing Scrapbox.

Regarding "My Bromance with Scrapbox," I would like to know more about how Nishio started using Scrapbox and how he has developed it. Also, regarding "Thinking Node 2023-02-23," we would like to know more about what kind of new knowledge and discoveries he thinks can be obtained by having an AI emulate him.

I would like to know more about the "Engineer's Intellectual Production Techniques and Physical Education Type Classes" and the "Calibration Session," how these projects progressed and what results they produced.

from  [[Diary 2023-08-25]]
The end of the "public Scrapbox phase"?
We've been doing Nishio's intellectual production process in a public forum for a long time, but maybe it's time for that to end.
- The end of the "public Scrapbox phase"?
    - Five years have passed since the end of the [[Hatena Diary period]].
- contextual arrangement
    - Since the immediate past was a "public blog", we have developed a public project without thinking too much about it
    - Of course, some projects are private, and the content that cannot be made public is written there.
    - In the past, this was handled by UserScript, but now that inter-project linking is supported as an official feature, it has become easier.
- What are we observing now?
    - AI is reading, developing and writing public Scrapboxes.
    - 22 parallel, vector searching by topic to uncover past articles.
    - I want to add more search targets.
            - [[Cross-sectional Vector Search]]
        - Other people's Scrapbox
        - Crawl other useful sites
    - But AI writing directly to the public may be problematic
    - I suspect most readers don't read this in the first place.
        - I don't even think it's something you should read.
        - To begin with, Scrapbox itself is what people familiar with existing tools would call "unreadable", and on top of that system, memory storage for AI is realized in a tricky way, even more difficult to read
        - Difficulty in reading = need to acquire knowledge about reading
        - I know how to read it because I write my own generation scripts...
- Impressions after using it
    - It is very useful to see something that he wrote seven years ago that he has completely forgotten surfacing.
    - Opportunity losses were caused by clunky human memory.
        - Accumulation was created by keeping "records" for many years without "disappearance by forgetting.
        - Existing searches were not powerful enough to "recall" this accumulation.
        - Vector search + automatic search not triggered by humans + only write what you read and find relevant instead of returning results directly
            - Now that's pretty "intelligent".
    - I believe that, as a necessity of civilization, we should include classic masterpieces in our search.
    - Also, you should shove all the abstracts of the latest papers in there, and then throw out the ones that weren't mentioned after a while.
