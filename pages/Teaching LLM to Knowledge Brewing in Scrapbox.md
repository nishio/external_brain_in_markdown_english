>  1: Many short pages that can be packed multiple times in a prompt [[Scrapbox token/page]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1709153843165143533) 2: Incentive design is in place to create that "short enriched page"
>   [[Scrapbox is a purifier of ideas]]

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1709154320158167235) 3: "Unification of expressions" will be done to link to other pages, which will increase the similarity of vector searches and make it easier to hit related concepts. it will become easier to hit related concepts
>  With tools that don't have that functionality, shaky expressions remain shaky, and Scrapbox helps you to manually converge expressions on important concepts.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1709155143235858827) The combination of these things makes the "Scrapbox + Vector Search + Generative AI" system work better than expected, especially for those who aim to verbalize things that are not yet verbalized. Especially for those whose goal is to verbalize what is not yet verbalized, the acceleration effect is better than raw ChatGPT.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1709155663342186538) from my own research notes [[vector search serves as a tool for cognitive resolution]].
>  That's because the "similarities" presented cause us to observe what we're thinking about > from a slightly different direction.
>
>   [[Tools to enhance cognitive abilities]]

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1709156268148154556) Many people may not distinguish between the two, but the process of "verbalization" includes "increasing the resolution to describe the world" and "re-describing the understanding obtained by high-resolution observation in a form that can be conveyed to others. This is different from "increasing the resolution to describe the world" and "re-describing the understanding obtained by high-resolution observation in a form that can be conveyed to others", which are two different processes.
- Observing what you are thinking about from a slightly different direction" increases [[Cognitive Resolution]] by thinking "[Similarity -> What is the difference?

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1709156623225323716) What we talked about this time is that the former has a high acceleration effect. From the latter point of view, it appears to a third party that "you are piecing together an unfamiliar sentence in an unfamiliar language. That's correct, because by discarding the burden of the latter, we are developing it at a high speed.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1709157344381456647) I came up with a good metaphor, there is a clone of my intelligence that "uses the vocabulary I write without explanation" without explanation, and I can argue with it 24/7. This accelerates thinking, doesn't it? The "24 hours" is an advantage, but even more important is the fact that I don't have to say "This word may not be understood, so let me rephrase it..."

>  Maybe it would be more conducive to human progress if the LLMs learn this instead of trying to verbalize it?

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1709188329080828065) For example, in my Scrapbox, there are pages that are "Scrapbox-like" and pages that are "not Scrapbox-like", and there are "Scrapbox-like titles" and "not Scrapbox-like titles". titles that aren't".
