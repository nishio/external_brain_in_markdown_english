title: "The first sentence is full of garbage."

Sentences contain words that are not essential to convey meaning when first written

Activities to notice this
- Write more than the word limit on Twitter, then elaborate to keep it within the word limit.
- Chop and line up your written text in Kozaneba.
    - You'll also notice an unnecessary blurring of words that refer to the same concept.
    - Remove unnecessary decorative phrases.
    - Summarize the objects to which the directive refers and occurrences of the same word.
        - You find yourself unknowingly writing the same content twice with different expressions.
- Translate written text into English
    - There are extra sentences that I'm not willing to pay the cost of translating into English.
        - For example, if you include a pun, the cost of translating it into English is very high, but do you want people to see the pun at that cost?
        - Coined Japanese words are just as expensive as puns.
    - There are words that you think you understand somehow, even though you don't know exactly what they mean.
        - What is "one end of the spectrum?"
        - What is "hassle?"
            - What is [[listing]]?
