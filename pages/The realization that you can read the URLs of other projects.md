- I tried to specify the URL of another project in the function that lets you read a specific page by specifying the URL of the AI that lives in /nishio.
    - It was an easy read because the other party was a public project, and the AI developed the content of the project, which was written in /nishio
        - I thought it would overwrite the other guy's project and make his telomeres look terrible, but it didn't.
    - You can read the output on your project and write a human being on the other project only where it looks good.
    - (handheld) looks convenient<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
- So the question of how to operate an AI that reads resources that cannot be released to the public is also...
    - operation
        - Create a local AI that plugs into books and other information that cannot be made public.
        - Specify a public page by specifying a URL
        - AI notes will be made on private projects.
        - Read and edited for publication.
    - Isn't this enough?
    - Let's try this as a first stop for now.

- experiment
    - [[Scrapbook]]
        - This is Scrapbox on the other end, so just specify the URL and you can read it.
        - You write a comment thinking it's your article even though it's someone else's article, it is.
        - [[Miscellaneous thoughts on Scrapbox books]]
        - This is their blog, so I put it on Scrapbox and then let them read it.
