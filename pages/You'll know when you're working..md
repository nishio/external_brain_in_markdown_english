title: "You'll know when you're working."

When the statement "you'll know when you're in the workforce" is made, it is usually in a situation where the speaker cannot verbalize the reason, and it is doubtful that the person knows "something that you'll know when you're in the workforce" because the speaker who is in the workforce cannot verbalize the reason.
