> [KnYwebtno17_XX](https://x.com/KnYwebtno17_XX/status/1802959163913560275) A diagram of the relationship between quality and [[expected value]] that a senior colleague told me when I started at Kearney.

I remember being told, 'I am the type of person who is very much to the left of the left side of the intersection, so call out to them as soon as possible.
