attention power
When a person P has 1000 Attention Power and wants 10,000 Ps to listen to him.
- It is impossible to allocate Attention Power 1 to 1,000 people in the first place.
- Allocating 1 Attention Power to 1,000 people is not usually done.
    - The person who is asked is selected according to [[SOC]], such as past relationships, and receives mixed attention: one person receives 100 attentions, another 50, and so on.
    - Receiving 100 Attentions" and "discussing at length" are roughly equivalent.
    - When this "listener" is a politician, it means that many people's voices are not heard.
    - Consider this situation undesirable and improve it.
        - 10000 people discuss at length with the AI, the output of which the AI organizes and makes available for reading in 100 attentions.
        - This composition was in place before AI.
            - 10 assistants each paid 100 attentions to conduct interviews, which were summarized into a readable version with 10 attentions and feedback to P for a total of 100 attentions.
            - It was expensive because it required the use of a large number of smart people.
            - AI is causing price destruction.

- It used to be the norm to have 0, and we are trying to increase it by improving the system, thinking that it shouldn't be 0, right?
- In this situation, those who insist on "donating 100 by conventional means" are putting their efforts in the opposite direction from the direction of improvement.
