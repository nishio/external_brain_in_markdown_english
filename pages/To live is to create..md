> To live is to create.

What is creation?
- > To connect and order disparate and disparate things so that they make sense.
- In simple terms, "[[t]]o [[sic]]."

Example
- Combining wood and reinforcing steel to build houses
    - It is not meaninglessly assembled.
    - Assembled to make sense (= to be inhabited)
- Painter paints a picture from several paints
- Assembling parts to build a locomotive
- Locomotives are loaded with coal and water and run to a certain destination.

Each element has the following
- Qualitative specificity
- Direction of motion and force

> Human beings are creative agents.
- > Human beings are the subjects of such creation and the place where the traffic is organized.
- > To live is to create an orderly flow in this way [[chaotic]].
