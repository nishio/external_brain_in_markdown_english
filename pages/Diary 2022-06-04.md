    - I was thinking before about putting up [[rape (seed oil plant, Brassica campestris)]] stock one by one, but never did it after all.
- It's okay if you're a day behind, but if you leave it for a while and some time goes by, you'd rather take a new picture than put up an old one.

I've had a rather busy weekday, and I've got things to do on Sunday, so I'd like to take it easy on Saturday.
- Consideration of the integration of the KJ method and the Kozane method
    - The absence of an explanation of the Kozane method in Kozaneba.
- I also need to think about what form the KJ method study group should take.
- Isn't the title "KJ method study group" a mistake to begin with?
    - Since the KJ method is a means to an end, learning the KJ method is the end "[[making the means into the end]]".
- If you want to compare the KJ method with the Kozane method, [[Stable on three legs]] if you have one more leg.
    - What is it? I thought, "It's an outliner.
    - [https://rashita.net/blog/?p=12631](https://rashita.net/blog/?p=12631)
        - I did a search and the person who would be writing it was still writing it.
    - [[Kozane Method and Outliner]]

- Comparing the KJ method to the Outliner, the "bundling with a front cover" of the KJ method and the "folding the tree" of the Outliner would be the same
    - The problem is that it's hard to get the KJ method across to people who haven't done it to the fold.
    - This is, after all, a method of compressing and reducing the apparent volume when there is too much of it.
> The Outliner has three major functions.
>  Function of the outline display
>  Ability to fold outlines
>  Ability to replace outlines
>  Outliners can collapse outlines. What is collapsing?　It means to make it invisible. This is what makes them different from hashtags.
[One Outline Philosophy Part 1 | R-style](https://rashita.net/blog/?p=22302)

One-outline is an operation that does not erase each work, while the Kozane method discards the text once it is completed.

Type B writing, even in the KJ method.
