The moment the idea born, you will feel excited and got a wonderful thing. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the idea is valuable. Validation is required. [[Thomas Edison]] also said that "Many people think of inventions as coming on a man all in one piece ... Things donâ€™t happen that way, much." *40

Idea is not born in its complete form from the beginning, but it gradually improves by refining what was born in an incomplete form. Edison said that "I have never failed, but I just found 10,000 ways that did not work" . If you did experiment with your idea, and it did not work. It is not "failure" but "discovery of a way that does not work". You progressed a step towards the ways to work.

*40: [[Alex Osborn]] introduced it in his book [[Your Creative Power]] (p.253). I have not yet find where Edison wrote it.
