- Thoughts.
    - A naive search for a number that satisfies the condition is 10^10, no.
    - Calculated for each b
        - 0 if less than k
        - If larger, divide N by b â†’ q, r
        - ret = q * (b - k)
        - If r > k, ret += r - k
- Official Explanation OK
    - There's one discrepancy, but I'm sure it can be fixed quickly with a test case.
