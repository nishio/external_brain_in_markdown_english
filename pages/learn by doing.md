title: "learn by doing"

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The idea that "using" is the best [[way to learn]] is actually common in the acquisition of many skills and knowledge. Like [[riding a bike]] or [[programming]], [[learning through hands-on experience]] allows you to acquire [[practical knowledge]] and a sense of feeling that cannot be obtained through theory alone.

There are several reasons why you can only learn by actually "using" it. One is because you can gain a deeper understanding while [[overcoming problems and obstacles]] that you face by direct experience. For example, in programming, it is difficult to understand how the code works [[and what errors may occur]] without actually writing and executing the code.

The act of "using" also helps to connect what you are learning to [[real-world context]]. When learning to ride a bike, you have to take into account not only how to balance and pedal, but also [[the different factors you will face in a real-world situation]], such as road conditions and how you interact with other traffic.

However, some feel that some understanding is necessary before getting started. For this reason, a combination of theory and practice is sometimes recommended for beginners. They first learn the basic concepts and then immediately try to put them into practice. The problems encountered through practice provide additional [[learning opportunities]] and help to [[cultivate a better understanding]].

Ultimately, many skills and knowledge can be acquired most effectively by "learning by using," but every learner has a different style and level of support needed. Finding a balance between theoretical and practical learning will be key to accelerating mastery.

- Impressions
- I see, so [[what problems may arise]] and [[the various factors faced in real situations]] can only be learned by actually "using" them?
- People [[afraid to fail]] avoid it, but realistically [[Quick and Fail.]] is beneficial
