title: "Show the back of your foot in front of you"
---

- Improved rendering of [[hold one's head high]] and [standing on tiptoes
    - [[seam in the back]] When you try to extend [[seam in the back]], your consciousness goes to your back.
- When you try to stand on your toes, your legs twist and you end up "standing comfortably".
    - [[instep]] wobbly when trying to show the [[instep]] in front of it
    - I find myself twisting my legs to try to stabilize them.
    - Resolve this by [stand on one's back (e.g. one's feet)
            - It's almost like the feeling called [cut back on one's purse strings

- [[posture]]
