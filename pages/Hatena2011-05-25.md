What is the smallest puzzle with a 2x2 area that can be uniquely solved without any clues? Moreover, there is not a single 1x1 square in this puzzle. I was quite happy when I found this on the train this morning. I was going to challenge the question "What is the smallest puzzle that has a 3x3 area and the answer is uniquely determined without any hints", but this seems to be still difficult, so I am going to try a 3x3 puzzle by combining P-shaped pentominoes and L-shaped tetrominoes for now.
