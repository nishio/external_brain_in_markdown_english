- Difference between [[distributed]] and [[decentralized]] ([[decentralization of power]] type)
- There are three axes.
    - Centralized and decentralized architecturally
    - Political centralization and de-centralization
    - Logically centralized and decentralized

- blockchain
    - Politically decentralized (no administrator)
    - Architecturally decentralized (no single point of failure for any infrastructure)
    - Logically, it's centralized (there's a unified, agreed-upon state, and the system operates like a single computer).

        - Current computers are a form of many computers, with the computing and storage devices lumped together.
            - This is architecturally decentralized
            - Blockchain can be said to be the realization of a "centralized storage device" by connecting these disparate infrastructures together as a higher layer.
