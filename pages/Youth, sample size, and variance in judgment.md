title: "Youth, sample size, and variance in judgment"
---

Younger people tend to have less experience.
Less experience means a smaller sample size and therefore a larger variance of the mean of that sample.
So the percentage of radical decisions increases.

concrete example
- Observe the black and white stones out of a bag that's half black and half white.
- At the time of taking out three pieces.
    - All three were white! Everything inside must be white!" 1/8
    - All three were black! Everything inside must be black!" 1/8
- Each drops to less than 0.1% when 10 are taken out.
