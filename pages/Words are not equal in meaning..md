title: "Words are not equal in meaning."

The [[meaning]] of a word X when used with that word is [[It varies from person to person.]]
- I have often experienced as an observational fact [[A series of pictures of two people saying different things]].
- Assuming that they're different, for most homo sapiens, communication becomes a high-stakes task that's beyond their control.
- So it assumes as a working hypothesis that the meanings of the words are equal, even though it is clear from the observed facts that this is an incorrect assumption.
    - [[The Story of Your Life (Spoiler Alert)]]
        - [[Intelligent bodies that are not homo sapiens.]] may be using a language system that does not make this ludicrous assumption.
    - From their point of view, it looks like "you are making strange assumptions without acknowledging them when they are obvious from the facts of observation.

What language system is such a language system?
- For example, "some X and some Y initially appear to be in conflict, but then some Z appears, and it is better than either."

- The composition "XYZ" can be shared even with a partner who has a different concrete XYZ
    - In fact, I'm using variables as [[placeholders]] rather than concrete ones in the example here.
    - Even if no word is assigned to this composition, it can be used by analogy.
        - Related [[Allegory and Symbolism]].
- suggestion
        - [[anonymous function]] `lambda x, y: x + y` can be used without a name and without concrete x and y values
