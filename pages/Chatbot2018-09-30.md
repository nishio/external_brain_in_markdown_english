    - A [[chatbot]] that speaks with a [[direct quotation model]] based on the [[book corpus]].
- The [[keyphrase appearance]] in the user's input is a BoW-like vector.
- Transpose the matrix W_PK of keyphrase occurrences in the page and multiply by the input
    - The hidden layer has a strong association with the page so far.
    - This layer is Linear
- Multiply the output of the hidden layer by the mapping matrix W_PS between pages and utterances taken from those pages
- That alone is fine, but multiply by the matrix of key phrase occurrences during speech and add them together.
- Softmaxed against it will be the probability of utterance.
