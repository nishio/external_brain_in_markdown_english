    - I was given a case study from Taiwan.
        - When a young person receives a share of a link of false information from a parent, they could throw the URL to a LINE bot to receive a report that it is false information and share it with the parent.
        - I hear there's a website that lists disinformation news.
    - Pretty interesting, I wish we had one in Japan.
