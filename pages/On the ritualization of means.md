- [kur](https://twitter.com/kur/status/1024909048074792961) I've been looking at some Japanese information on design thinking lately, and I read something about [[using different colors of post-its]], and I'm thinking, "Really? I'm like, "Really? It seems to be effective, but I've never heard of such a thing... [[kur]].
- [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1024976983556468737) In my "[[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]]", I write that "color-coding is a hassle, and the purpose is to reduce cognitive load, so I don't separate them" (p.166 [[(Color of nameplate and fusuma]]) I don't separate them because I want to reduce cognitive load" (p.166 [[(Column) Color of nameplate and fusuma]])
    - When we are anxious about a task for which there is no guarantee that we will get results despite our efforts, we tend to engage in heavy-handed [[rituals]] and say, "[[It's]] not my fault because I worked so hard. Because there is no guarantee of results, we must rather cut costs, conduct many [[trials and errors]], and [[Learning from Results]].
    - The reason why I don't like to create "the best ritual I've ever thought of" (although I know that people who want to follow a ritual without thinking for themselves would be happy to do so) is that it causes [[acting without thinking]] if the ritual becomes a one-person show. [[Ritual is a gateway to thoughtlessness.]] and must be utilized, but sometimes destroyed!
    - [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1024992158158188544) This is also a kind of [ritualization of methods
        - > [taichi](https://twitter.com/ryushi/status/1024894087176962048) [[The curse of object-orientation]] is that we tend to waste time piling up theories endlessly when the technology is only a tool for [[problem-solving]] in the first place. It is a technology that is only a tool for [[problem-solving]] in the first place, but we tend to waste a lot of time with endless theories. It is difficult to quantify the quality of a design, so don't just sit at your desk and play with it forever.
        - Comments on this statement:.
            - uchan_nos But it helps to make programs more sophisticated, doesn't it? The world would be a hard place without object-oriented programming. I guess it is useful to have a moderate amount of rituals.
            - nishio When "[[methodology]]" is born, it is born to serve a specific purpose. However, as it spreads, some people forget about the purpose, mistakenly believe that simply following the methodology as told to them is "correct," and use it blindly. I called this "[[ritualization]].
            - uchan_nos I see. I see......................... It's the same with company rules. It's fine as long as the purpose is achieved without harm, but it becomes dangerous when the people who knew the original purpose gradually disappear and only the rituals remain.
