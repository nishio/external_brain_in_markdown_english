AI Considerations 2024-04-27

    - [[summary]].
    - I have a lot of book cutting scan data.
    - I have confirmed that I can get about 50 pages into Claude 3 Opus.
    - I had implemented it to the point of creating a Scrapbox page with 50 separate pages, and I was thinking, "Should I use the Claude API to add a summary at the beginning of this page?" I was thinking.
    - So, while things were busy and pending, [[Fractal Summary]] came out.
    - I think this is the right answer, at least as one view.
        - The current situation with book data in Scrapbox is difficult to use.
    - On the other hand, obviously this is not enough in some areas.
        - The "order in which the books are written" is a kind of [[time-oriented]].
        - But I want to "extract and compare the parts of several books by different authors that are relevant to the topic.
            - The one that often says, "Read three books and you'll be an expert."
            - This "read" is not "[[read through from beginning to end]]"
            - Then what is it? I think "[[Disassemble and reconstruct]]".
            - Seems to me that when it's supported, it reinforces intelligence.
    - I'm feeling that the [[KJ method]] is a bit like the [[KJ method]] in that you can bundle several small chunks together to form a higher-level structure.
        - It is highly doubtful that a chunk of input text is an appropriate chunk for a KJ method label
            - Concepts related to "[[atomic]]" in [Evergreen Notes

- Before finding the connections between books, we would like to first treat "spanning by topic within a book" as a smaller unit.
    - Well, I'm thinking of the Plurality book.
        - The desire to create a good intellectual production system and do international "wow, right?
        - Is it compatible with the "promotion of understanding in the Japanese-speaking world"? Or not?
        - Need a tool that can do both?
        - Are we making the story too big to move on?
    - There are a few people who respond to me in both the Japanese and English communities, so I guess I don't feel like I have to think, "Which do you prefer?" I don't know, maybe I don't feel like thinking about it.
        - First, I make what I think is most necessary as a user, and then I show it to people I think will enjoy it.
        - That's what I think the conclusion is.
            - Put Plurality aside for a moment and create an assistant to read your Scrapbox."
            - Plurality Assistant was useful and I used it many times when preparing presentation materials
            - An assistant that reads and generates my Scrapbox is definitely useful to me.
            - I'm giving a lecture on 6/6, so I hope to have it by then, and I'd rather make it as soon as possible and use it to prepare lecture materials.
            - Then there's the "assistant reading a cut and scanned book".
            - Where's the summary story?
