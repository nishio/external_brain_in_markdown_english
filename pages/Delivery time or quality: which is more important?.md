Delivery time or quality: which is more important?
Discussion of the trade-off between delivery date and quality and the importance of such an arrangement
- Discusses differences in values regarding project delivery and quality.
- Whether the emphasis is on delivery or quality depends on the project's objectives and the customer's needs.
- He also noted the importance of reaching agreement on these tradeoffs early in the project.

Tachikawa: For example, it is a goal to have this software completed and delivered by March 20, isn't it?
Nishio: 〓〓 01:32:41
Man X: Wait a minute yes, yes.
Tachikawa: 〓01:32:46〓, at the beginning of February, the customer will be satisfied with this. If we deliver the product as it is, we will get a big complaint.
Male X: No, that's, you know, I thought the same thing, I'm certainly not sure if it's an objective or a value to take the Q or the D in QCT.
Tachikawa: So, we already have no project team but the D team. So, there is a question of whether it is better to explain this to the customer and ask them to extend the delivery date, or whether it is better to just keep the delivery date and proceed with the project on time so that the customer will not complain. If it is the purpose of the project, for example, then the first thing to do is to absolutely keep the delivery on time.
Nishio: Purpose-based.
Male Y: Maybe this is all for a purpose.
Tachikawa: (laughs)
Male Y: It's all purpose. That is why it eventually falls down to customer matter. The moment it becomes a delivery date with respect to this project, the other party is the customer, so the demand for that objective just changes depending on which the customer values. So it is not a value.
Nishio: If the customer asks for higher quality even if it means extending the delivery time, we must improve the quality.
Male Y: Yes, it has to be enhanced.
Nishio: In some cases, if the customer does not appear at this time anyway, I need to issue a press release at this time, so I don't want the release to be extended without my permission in order to improve the quality.
Male Y: Yes.
Nishio: Another point I wanted to make is from a different perspective, but it is known that such trade-offs may occur when a project is started. It is known that a trade-off between quality and deadline will occur, and it is necessary for team members to agree on what to do instead. It's inherently there.
Tachikawa: Is there?
Nishio: In the [[inception deck]], we call it a [[trade-off slider]], which means that everyone on the team should discuss which trade-off they would prefer in this or that case.
Tachikawa: Talking about something intuitive, it is not intuitive. This is my opinion. I don't think there are people who talk about it together and reach a consensus. It's just an idea.
Man X: Interesting.
