title: "Avoid evaluation by sum and cross"
---

    - In [[Generalists are selected when evaluated by sum]], I wrote that if you want to adopt a specialist, you should not select him or her by summing the scores of several judges.
    - [[Niche Top Strategy for Cross-fertilization]] wrote about how multiple specialties can create value through cross-fertilization.

- The former is a phenomenon that in [[two dimensional standard normal distribution]], Mr. B is chosen over Mr. A, who is the sharpest in the total score.

- The latter is not the case.
    - Especially when the axis is widely known, many people will apply optimization in the direction of that axis
    - Then people will be distributed thickly around the axis.
    - The mixing area becomes a blank space.

    - Under these circumstances.
        - A, with his keen ability, is of course valuable.
        - Talk about comparing B and C.
            - Mr. C with average ability on X-axis
            - Mr. B, who is inferior to Mr. C on the x-axis but has moderate ability on the y-axis
            - In a comparison of the two, Mr. B tends to win in business terms.
            - While Mr. B can promote the value of "bridging the X and Y axes", Mr. C cannot.
            - Mr. C tries to appeal his ability on the X axis, but that's average, so he can't use it as a point of appeal.

- The statistically natural hypothesis is the former figure, where the X and Y axes are independently normally distributed, but observing reality, the latter is more plausible.
    - Why is that?
        - [[normal distribution]] Is it funny that I think it is?
    - Even in situations where it is reasonable to invest in the second axis, many people seem to stick to the first axis to which they are accustomed
            - [[Better off investing in a new S-curve.]]
    - Why does it happen?
