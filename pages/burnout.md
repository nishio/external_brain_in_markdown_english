> [rrr_kgknk](https://x.com/rrr_kgknk/status/1903777093294645333) [[Kaho Miyake]] "[[Why can't I read books when I'm working? Toru Mishiro]] "[[Only One Enthusiast]]" which I am reading at the same time repeatedly says, "It is good and interesting to work so hard that you burn out," and I read it alternately and it has become like a sauna.
- [[read at the same time]].

> [rrr_kgknk](https://x.com/rrr_kgknk/status/1903778086451356028) Higuchi's experience-based impression is that working a lot where there is no [[discretion]] is painful, but working a lot where there is discretion is interesting. Since the quality of work varies greatly depending on the presence or absence of discretion, the argument will continue to diverge if the assumptions here are off. Therefore, the first battle for workers is how far and how to acquire discretion.

- [[I'm going to overwork myself]].
- [[I'm going to indulge myself.]]
- I see
    - You're in the "[[try]] to apply a high-intensity load while being metacognizant of your intellectual production process."
    - I've been the one who tries to [[overuse]] it, but I've never really consciously indulged in it.

> [chihokojj](https://x.com/chihokojj/status/1903689022289092756) What I'm realizing when I see various mens rea cases in HR is that once you get one, your [[stress tolerance]] goes down tremendously.
>  The load that used to be bearable becomes unbearable and the depression recurs.
>  So you have to do it sloppily, but in the eyes of a healthy person, it looks like "slacking off".
