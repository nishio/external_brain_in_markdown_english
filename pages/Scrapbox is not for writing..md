title: "Scrapbox is not for writing."
---

- Using Scrapbox for "high-intellectual-productivity-intensive" writing, you can understand why Scrapbox is not suitable for this purpose.
    - It's like doing a load endurance test on a chair or something and observing where it breaks.

- So the topic of "Scrapbox and Writing" is gaining momentum among those who are familiar with Scrapbox
        - [[Writing in Scrapbox]]
- However, it would be unfortunate if someone unfamiliar with Scrapbox sees this and makes the mistake of thinking that Scrapbox is suited for writing.
- Don't use tools with extra overhead when doing a cognitively demanding task like writing

- Be clear about the intent of the phrase "Scrapbox is not for writing."
    - Scrapbox is,
            - [[finite time]] In,
        - Paper books with a finite number of pages,
        - Build in a tree,
        - To be completed in neat and clean handwriting.
    - Not suitable for

- finite time
    - Writing has a deadline set by the editor.
        - Or there is no deadline and "if you don't set your own deadline and move forward, you'll never get published".
    - Scrapbox, on the other hand, is "[[Always unfinished]]" and "[Not a warehouse for dead text.
    - Scrapbox is a way to keep text alive, writing is a way to kill text

- Finite number of pages
        - [[Books are a tool for finitization]]
    - Scrapbox is creating more and more unconnected links and spreading more and more.

- (Christmas) tree
        - The [[Scrapbox Information Organization]] describes the history of information organization in three stages.
        - The book [[tree structure]] is a tool oriented toward [[Information Organization 1.0]], and Scrapbox is a tool oriented toward [[Information Organization 3.0]] with [[network structure]].
    - In the process of transforming Scrapbox data into book form
        - Attaching pages that have been divided into small parts again.
        - I'm going to remove the links I've put there.
    - This is a torturous process, like "[Fill in the holes you dug for yourself.
    - Nowadays, it is a little easier because of the "Copy plain" function to remove links and copy them, but Mr. Kurashita did not have that function, so he removed them by hand.
    - The final editor receives it in text format and typeset it in InDesign.

- clean copy
    - The process of killing a living text

So what is it suited for?

- Books that do not need to have a tree structure [collection of essays
    - Specifically, for example, to coincide with the 500th anniversary of Ootaki Radio [/ootaki](https://scrapbox.io/ootaki), 50 selected articles from the past 500 will be published in a paper book.
- No deadline or specific project yet, and you want to write something but have not yet decided exactly what you want to write.
    - If you keep writing things that come to mind in Scrapbox and doing "[[Do not erase the manuscript.]]", you will gradually accumulate some things.
        - It makes it clear after the fact what you want to write about.
    - You may share that project with more than one person.
    - If you feel embarrassed to do it publicly, you can do it privately.
