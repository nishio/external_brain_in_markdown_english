Since stickies can only have [[One place]], the element of [[hierarchical classification]] appears, although there is no clear boundary. The equivalent of "[[Which one should I put in?]]" in [[bat problem]], "[where to put it?
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1468455136519667712): This is [[Finding the Structure]] for things that don't have any structure yet. yeah.]" or "I can only put it one way or the other, so I'll put it one way or the other" or "I'll put it one way or the other, so I'll put it one way or the other.

Because books are already structured by the author. You swallow it whole without distorting it first for understanding, but then [[Existing Structure]] gets in there and there is no room for [[Additional structure]].

- [[where to put it?]]
    - [[Where do I put it?]]
    - [[🌀Where should I write?]]

Think about the rationale for putting it down after you put it down.
    - [[Act somewhat and then think about why.]]
    - [[Linguistic after-the-fact]]
        - [[Structured after the fact]]
