> [rkmt](https://x.com/rkmt/status/1662660086161100800) BarabÃ¡si's researcher theory presented in the citation is interesting and intense...
>  "Great research is done when you are young" is a myth, and the probability of success of a paper does not depend on the author's age (you simply stop writing papers when you get older).
>  Good ideas are highly accidental, but "the ability to realize ideas" is person-dependent and does not change throughout life...

> [rkmt](https://x.com/rkmt/status/1662662191194185729) I see that Dr. Barbasi's original source is here...

> [rkmt](https://x.com/rkmt/status/1662687397841362944) Barabasi Formula says success S = Qr (Q is the ability to conduct research, r is the idea, and Q remains the same throughout life...) )
>  Then, if we can have an automatic Q-judging device by AI, we don't need schools? (Assuming that the AI can also teach the knowledge itself...)

> [rkmt](https://x.com/rkmt/status/1662687956761726983) Even in an application, the applicant may think they are writing r, but in reality they are being evaluated for Q...

> [rkmt](https://x.com/rkmt/status/1662660086161100800) This is a very scary theory H-Index increases with research career and must be factored in, but the Q-Factor is invariant per researcher... (Whether it is a mediocre hit or a home run is a probability theory, but the batting average can be calculated, and that "does not change" from researcher to researcher!) ) This has been verified by a vast amount of data...
