- About [[ScrapboxTranslator v1]] and [nishio/pUnnamed (temporary)
    - Rather than "translate the Scrapbox project into English."[[日本語のScrapboxプロジェクトを元に、与えられた話題について英語で話すチャットボット]]」を作る方が筋が良いかもと思い始めた<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/blu3mo/icon' alt='/villagepump/blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Added on 2024-04-28: After about a year[[⿻Plurality Assistant]]という形で作られた<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I wrote "chatbot," but the English interface could be considered for many things, not just chat.
        - Or a magic blog that automatically generates a page with any title.
        - If you want to create a page-turning reader experience like Scrapbox, you could talk about a certain topic and then make a suggestion like, "We can talk about X or Y."
    - Why does this one make more sense?
        - Not language dependent (can be used in Japanese)
            - Added on 2024-04-28: I actually use Plurality Assistant in Japanese.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - We can expect growth in LLM performance and it will keep getting better and better!
        - In the future, when LLMs get smart enough, this option might make sense, but then it's going to make sense for humans to write Scrapbox.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - I sympathize that the English translation of the Scrapbox article at this point doesn't look great, and I'm wondering how it could be improved.
            - The obvious option, "search for a vector and put it in the prompt and chat about it" is technically possible, but I'm not really motivated to do anything about it.
            - Most people probably wouldn't try it at all or would try it a few times and stop using it, even if there was a chat box where they could talk to my Scrapbox.
                - This tendency will be especially strong when you see it for the first time, because you don't know what it says.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>
                    - It might be useful to have this kind of search between projects in Scrapbox.
            - The next thing I can think of is "AI talking to me aggressively on Twitter, etc." That's pretty annoying.
                - I wonder if public opinion will form that this is a bad idea after a few people run it without worrying about the inconvenience.
            - In the long run, maybe it will be like a human being talking to an assistant AI at hand, and the assistant AI will suggest, "This person you were interested in might be related to an article you wrote the other day..."
