title: "Those who just arrived are more likely to leave."
---

Most people unconsciously assume that "newcomers are likely to leave soon," and do not give much [[attention]] to those who leave quickly.
- [[Not respected]], [[not trusted]], [[disrespected]].
- This is the cost that "[[People on the move]]" must continue to pay.
- This speculation is changing as we "[[stay]]."

[[unacknowledged condescension]] toward "[[those who came after]]."
- Some against youth and students.
        - [[Student Debuff]]
        - Student brojects and web services are disregarded because of the unconscious presumption that they are "something that won't continue."
        - Well, 99% of student brojects don't continue, do they?

Trust that "something good could come from respecting his ideas."
- Each time you move from one organization to another, the intra-organizational trust savings are reset to zero.
    - Yes, yes, because [[social capital is a resource that accumulates between people]].
    - Those who move have no choice but to operate at a disadvantage vis-à-vis those who do not move who use their "accumulated social capital".
- It is easier to move when decision makers are made aware of the possibilities.
    - [[transfer]], [[discretion]].
- The value of working well with an organization is that you can use intra-organizational peer pressure to spread awareness.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1919450093549228468) It cost me a bit to understand because the two of us have different concretions on which we base our abstracted stories.
>  I guess I could paraphrase your statement as I understand it, "If you want to create a [[Giver's]] [[Purpose Oriented Organization]], but you can only do it [[permissionless]], you will get the attention of those who will [[Give]] ahead of you".
