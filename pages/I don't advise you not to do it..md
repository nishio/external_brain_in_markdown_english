title: "I don't advise you not to do it."

- Never advise someone who says, "I do," not to do it.
    - Even when the probability of success is low, success can happen.
    - Even if the probability of success is high, it can still fail.
    - We are not gods and cannot predict success or failure 100% of the time.
