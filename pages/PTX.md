Instead of [[CUDA]], [[DeepSeek]] uses an intermediate language called PTX ([[Parallel Thread Execution]]) provided by NVIDIA.
PTX is a [[low-level]] [[intermediate representation]] generated from CUDA C/C++ code, which allows optimization in a form similar to GPU [[machine language]], thus enabling finer hardware control.
