title: "able to criticize but not to create (criticise)"
---

> Glance of eye high and hand low.
>  To have a discerning eye but little actual skill or ability. They have knowledge and criticize this and that, but they do not have the ability to actually do it. It also means that the person has high ideals but lacks the ability. The Japanese reading of the phrase is "me taka ku te hiru shi" ("eyes are high, hands are low"). ([Sanseido Shinmeikai 4-character phrase dictionary](https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/word/%E7%9C%BC%E9%AB%98%E6%89%8B%E4%BD%8E/))

I'm confused because "[[highly conscious]]" which is supposed to be positive is sometimes used negatively, like "[[person with a high level of consciousness]]", but I thought "[High awareness, low hands . High awareness, low hands .

relevance
    - [[Criticism is a refuge for the mediocre]]

> [hikalium](https://x.com/hikalium/status/1841367918757695573) I can't get over the feeling that my eyes are high and my hands are low... (Feeling that way is not bad in itself. The problem is how to bring my arms up instead of lowering my perspective by feeling that way (so don't beat yourself up, raise your arms (yes...)))

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1841368516177666521) hikalium makes me wonder if "[[lower]]" doesn't mean "negative" but "[[lower layer]]

> [hikalium](https://x.com/hikalium/status/1841371843284144558) [[thinking is high layers, making is low layers]]...that's it!!! (You've cheered me up! Thank you~)
