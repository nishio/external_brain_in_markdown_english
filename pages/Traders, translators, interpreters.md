title: "Traders, translators, interpreters"
---

    - [[trader]] just brings it from where it is to where it isn't.
    - The [[translator]] brings it from one place to another, translates it into a form that can be received and communicated by the people there.
    - Therefore, it is necessary to have an understanding of the receiver's [[knowledge structure]].
    - [[interpretation (i.e., oral translation)]] is the translation of questions raised by the receiver of knowledge into a form that can be understood by the sender of knowledge, and [[translation]] of the knowledge gained back into a form that can be accepted by the receiver.
    - So both people's understanding of knowledge structures is necessary.

- I have been calling them "[[knowledge]] traders," but if we are going to divide them in this way, it would be more appropriate to call them [[information]] traders, since what they bring is "something that has already been separated from people. See [[Information and Knowledge]].
