title: "Use of company property for duplicate business"
---

This was a [[blind spot]] for me.
The use of company property by an individual for duplicate work was subconsciously considered a "no-no" and excluded as an option.
However, there are cases where this is not a loss for the company, but rather a gain.
For example, verification equipment purchased by a company is paid for at the time of purchase, and the cost does not change depending on how the equipment is subsequently used.
Therefore, using it for duplicate work does not increase the cost borne by the company, and if it is likely to benefit the company, it is a "gain" for the company.
Of course, the person using the system must insist that he or she wants to use it for multiple jobs and that it is in the company's best interest to use it.

- sat> I tried to measure storage performance but I only have USB HDD and NVMe SSD at hand. I really want a SATA SSD as well, but what the heck.
- ymmt> you have a number of verification machines that you can use as much as you want 😗.
- sat> Unfortunately, it's for a private project (magazine series), so I can't use it.
- ymmt> I think it would probably be OK if you write in the article that "Cybozu, Inc. cooperated in the verification process" and submit an application for double employment.
- sat> Oh my god (tension maxed out)
