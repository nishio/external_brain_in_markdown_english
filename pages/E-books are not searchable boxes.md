title: "E-books are not searchable boxes"
---

>  [[e-book]] is also an unsearchable "hack" when viewed from the Internet, and that's the same with many of the unlimited reading services like Kindle Unlimited and O'Reilly Safari, and I had high hopes for Google Books in that regard [[src https ://twitter.com/golden_lucky/status/1345936544461246466?s=21]]
- This is exactly what it feels like to be [[sacrilegious]], to have spun out a sentence with great effort and then put it in "a box that doesn't get any hits in [[search (e.g., for someone using a search engine)]]"!

- The reason why I thought that the book form is not suitable for the atcoder strategy book is because it is important to improve the "ability to get there" including external sites that are linked to the atcoder.
    - It's not impossible to achieve this in the form of an e-book that retains the links, though.

    - [[It would be a shame not to be able to search.]]
    - [[Unsearchable boxes]]
