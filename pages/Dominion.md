Dominion
- [[Deck-building games]]. The concept of "deck-building games" itself was invented, and a new expansion, "Alliance," was released in 2022/3.

How to play digitally:
- There are two.
    - [Dominion on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1131620/Dominion/)
        - An Early Access version was recently released.
        - Only works on Windows.
        - It's pretty buggy, the server crashes, and the screen display is strange.
        - Free now with Early Access, will there be a fee in the future?
        - Buy extensions individually, about 10,000 if you buy them all.
    - [Dominion Online](https://dominion.games/)
        - The one that's been around for a long time.
        - run in a browser
        - Logs are displayed at all times
        - Ratings and matching are available.
            - = Can play against people of moderate level at any time.
        - Subscription, all in, is €3.9/month (about $500).

You can find explanations for first-timers by Googling
The expansion story is well organized in Dominion Online's "Card Pool" description.

When playing with a random mix of expansions, I wanted to know which card came from which expansion, so I made a correspondence chart with the marks.
