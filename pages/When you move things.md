title: "When you move things"

- When you move things
    - Maybe I'm not "in what" but in absolute coordinate position, "it's around here."
        - So when they are "put away", they appear to be "gone" subjectively to me.
        - Maybe they don't throw them away without permission, but whether they do or don't doesn't mean much of a distinction to me.
        - When it's no longer accessible to me, it's not much different than throwing it away.
    - Maybe my wife recognizes it as a box unit, so she doesn't even know what's in the box.
        - So I can't ask where the specific ones went.
        - For those who recognize it as a box unit, they just moved the box, so the search area wouldn't be that extensive.
- next day
    - 'Do you know where anything that was around here went?' I asked him and he said, "Check this box to see if it's not in here," so I guess my interpretation was correct.
    - I found what I was looking for.

    - [[It's as if there's nothing you can't take out when you need it.]]
