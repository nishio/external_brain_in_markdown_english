title: "Culture fit, not superiority"
---

> Maybe it is easy for many people to assume that they will be accepted in order of excellence, because their experience prior to job hunting may be taking an exam. In reality, [[culture fit]] is considered more important than excellence, and sometimes people are dropped because they are excellent.

- I wrote about this a long time ago in [Is the learning ladder model correct?
    - Some people have a mental model that there are superior and inferior people.
        - I called it the "ladder model" because it is lined up one-dimensionally like a ladder.
- I saw this tweet and thought [[culture fit]] was a good way to describe it.
    - This word was not in my dictionary.
        - [[matching]], a concept similar to "like-minded or like-disliked".
    - But there are still a good number of people who think in terms of a one-dimensional ladder model, whether it's job hunting or marriage activity.
        - 'I am superior and should be well liked/employed.'
        - This kind of thinking itself is the cause of bad outcomes.
