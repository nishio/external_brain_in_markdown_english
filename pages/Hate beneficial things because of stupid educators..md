beneficial ones [[hate]] because of stupid educators.

It's pitiful, but "[[hating]] useful things" is another form of [[stupidity]], so [[reproduction of stupidity]] is taking place.

- I haven't seen this in a while in connection with [[Complaints about bad education]].
I don't know what this picture means, and I'm not sure I've explained it well enough.
- There is person A who does not understand or cannot verbalize what is to be gained by doing X.
    - A forces person B, who is in a weaker position, to do X anyway.
    - I even use X when it's not beneficial.
- This will cause person B, who is in a weaker position, to have strong feelings of "I hate X".
    - Because they experience that doing X was futile.
    - They will also hold the belief that "X is futile": [[Pessimistic Misconceptions]].
- Person C, who understands that by doing X he gets Y, uses X when he needs Y and not when he doesn't.
    - So we can use X profitably.
    - B loses the opportunity to be able to use X beneficially due to the belief that "X is useless" or the feeling that "I don't like X"

Targets where this kind of thing is likely to occur, as observed on Japanese social networking sites.
    - [[PDCA cycle]] ,  [[Why-Why Analysis]] ,  [[copying of a sutra]]
- Some people have mysterious and strong repulsive feelings.
