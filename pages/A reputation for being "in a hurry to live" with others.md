title: 'A reputation for being "in a hurry to live" with others'
---

I was thinking about the difference in nuance between [[hurry to live]] and [hurry
- Seems to me there is a negative nuance to "rushing to live."
    - As in "inappropriately hasty."
- Hypothesis that people who cannot tolerate the perception that they are "relatively slow" when they compare themselves to another person and the other person is faster protect their self-esteem by recognizing that the other person is "inappropriately rushing".
    - I was curious about the relationship between "being on the move" and "[[self-assurance]]."
    - Given this hypothesis, "people with low self-esteem describe others as being in a hurry to live."

No wonder there are [[slow-footed people]].
- If you can afford it, I can help you.
- Sometimes we ignore them and leave them behind.
    - [[flood of tsunamis]], we can't afford to leave it at the time of [[flood of tsunamis]].
