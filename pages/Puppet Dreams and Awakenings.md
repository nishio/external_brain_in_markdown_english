["The bath has boiled" registered as a sound trademark, the first time for a voice containing classical music - Netsubo [https://nlab.itmedia.co.jp/nl/articles/2105/03/news020.html?fbclid=IwAR35eyRvqdsYIZmvHd07](https://nlab.itmedia.co.jp/nl/articles/2105/03/news020.html?fbclid=IwAR35eyRvqdsYIZmvHd07) wuPHeC2I0YiupTs9fhkJCVYAuoTUS-JKAl7U1yo]
> Originally, the idea of using sound to notify the user when the bath was ready to boil in order to solve the inconvenience of heating the bath for the visually impaired was given shape.
