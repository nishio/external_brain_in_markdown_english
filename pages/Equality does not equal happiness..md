title: "Equality does not equal happiness."
---

equality] does not = [[happiness]].
- > Equality is not happiness. For example, let's say you have a cake in front of you and three people share it. Normally, Japanese people would divide the cake into three equal portions, but in reality, those three people may be the one who is not hungry, the one who is on a diet, and the one who is starving. In this case, there is no need to distribute equally to those three people, and sometimes inequality can actually make people happier rather than dividing equally. That is the kind of management Cybozu aims for.
        - [[Yoshihisa Aono]]

In line with individual needs is more important than equality
