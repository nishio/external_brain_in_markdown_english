I put [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers Reaction Summary]] in [[Claude 3 Opus]] because it's interesting to put long inputs into [[Claude 3 Opus]].
> <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>In general, the book is useful not only for engineers but also for many people engaged in intellectual production, and many people evaluated it as a book in which what they had been doing empirically was systematically verbalized, and from which they learned a lot. On the other hand, some said that the contents were too dense to digest immediately. It seems to be a book that can be read repeatedly to further deepen understanding.
