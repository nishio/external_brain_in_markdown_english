- Etymology of the word "[[autism]]."
    - Translation of 'Autismus' by the Swiss psychiatrist Brohler
    - From the Greek 'autos-' (self) and '-ismos' (state).
    - Initially positioned as one of the four basic symptoms of [schizophrenia
- Origin of the Japanese translation "Jiken
    - First appeared in 1937 in a unified draft of terminology by the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology
    - It was later discovered that Yushi Uchimura advocated
- early infantile autism
    - 1943: Caner reports "early infantile autism
        - > The reason I used the name 'autism' is that I was considering the possibility that it is a type of schizophrenia that develops in childhood.
    - After that, I could think of it as something different.
        - > Since the 1970s, subsequent research has led to the widespread recognition that early infantile autism, as Kanner posited, is an innate developmental abnormality, distinct from schizophrenia, which develops at the earliest in preadolescence or later.
- Since the 1980s: changes in diagnostic criteria have resulted in the term "autism" no longer being used in the context of schizophrenia
- Conceptual Expansion
    - Classification by wing: "isolated," "passive," and "active and odd."
    - Establishment of the concept of "autistic spectrum" including Asperger's syndrome
        - > This is the origin of the current term "autism spectrum disorder.
            - Notation shaking: [[autism spectrum]].
- Contemporary Issues
    - The term "autistic" is misleading.
    - Misunderstood as "dark personality," "withdrawn," "depressed," etc.
    - In reality, many people have a rusty, back-and-forth personality.
    - A new and appropriate Japanese translation is required.

[[Conceptual Transition]]

- 1: [[concept]] A was [[side]] of concept B
- 2: Expanded concept B to include C, because A was common
- 3: But it was found inappropriate to make it part of B, so it was moved away from B and became C2.
- 4: It was considered inappropriate for B to be described in relation to A, so it was separated from A and became B2
- 5: The concept of C2 was found to be more expansive than it initially was, so it was expanded to become C3.
    - At this time, the portion of C4 increased by the expansion has no relationship to A
    - However, historical circumstances have led to C3 being referred to by a name associated with A
    - This is not desirable, right?
