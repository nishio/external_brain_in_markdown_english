The value of [[natural resources]] is not created by the natural resource itself, but by the entity that takes the natural resource and uses it for something artificial.

Some people say things like, "The value of human emotion is important in the age of AI," but the natural resource of [[human emotion]] does not have value just because of its existence; it has value only when the subject harvests human emotion and produces a non-emotional product. Therefore, emotions that are not proactive are simply objects to be harvested, objects.

Whether or not the emotion "I am valuable because I have valuable emotions" has value depends on whether you can harvest it and make a useful processed product out of it. Probably not worthwhile.
