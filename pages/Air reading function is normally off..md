Thoughts on a Game
> If you find this game enjoyable, it is a sign that all the players are good players who are skilled at reading the atmosphere.
> This work made me keenly aware of how I am surrounded by conscientious players playing madamis.

T: This feedback is interesting w

N: Nishio is a corollary to the [[Nishio can actually read the air]] theory. w
I didn't read the air and chose the protagonist, though!
- Supplementary note: I understood in my head that there was a participant (A) who said, "I wanted to play this game because I was curious about it because it has the same name as the main character," and I did not foresee that the participant would choose the main character in the character selection, and I chose it because I wanted to play it.
    - After observing that the choices clashed, he decided, based on (A), that "then it would be better for that participant to play the protagonist," and gave in.

T: That's true!

N: Okay.
If you understand "[[air-reading is required]]," you can read it, but it's set to "[[air-reading mode]]" by default under normal circumstances.
That's a convincing interpretation.

T: That's a surprisingly normal thing to hear.
It's more like normal or "yeah, right".

N: Right.
