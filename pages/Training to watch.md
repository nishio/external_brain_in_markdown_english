title: "Training to watch"
---

- I tend to think of [[meditation]] as a metaphor for becoming mindless, or eliminating distractions, or "stopping.
Stopping is action.
Training to observe.
First separate yourself as an observer from yourself as an object of observation.
Separation of principal and guest.
Next, it returns to one piece while maintaining the separated state.
The main guest is one and the same.

Observe yourself emitting emotions rather than letting your emotions take over.
Train yourself to identify whether you are in a state of emotional emission or not.
This training makes it easier to notice the occurrence of emotions in others.
Emotions have causes.
Causes and Effects.
