title: "Bridging synchronous and asynchronous communication"
---


- [[bridge]] of [[synchronous communication]] and [[asynchronous communication]]
- People [[are elicited]] or [[helped to formulate]] their opinions through [[conversations]] or [[(Internet) chat]].
- On the other hand, [[synchronous person-to-person communication is]] expensive and does not scale.
- There, AI and humans communicate synchronously, and the essence drawn from the conversation is used for asynchronous communication between humans and humans.
    - This was made possible by the creation of LLMs who speak the language fluently.
        - [[A system where you can get fast feedback at any time]]
    - Advantages of Keichobot

        - > <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>The effect of encouraging clean language language is very impressive, but it is too expensive to make an appointment with a human for coaching, so it is worthwhile to allow a machine to do it, even if it is somewhat less capable than a human.
