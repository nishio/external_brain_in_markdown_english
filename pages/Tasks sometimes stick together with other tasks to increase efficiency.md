Tasks sometimes stick together with other tasks to increase efficiency<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
When tasks are related to each other, processing them together can improve efficiency; AI can help increase overall task management productivity by automatically analyzing commonalities and dependencies among multiple tasks and suggesting the optimal combination and execution order.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>

The AI has an "indelible memory" and can concretize abstract tasks and optimize the combination of related tasks to increase GTD-like peace of mind and execution efficiency. Concretely,
- Persistent record: tasks and ideas can be retained and tracked outside of the LLM context by linking to external databases and note-taking tools.
- Concretization support: AI generates and presents a set of actionable steps and clear outcome goals from vague ideas entered by the user, lowering the hurdles to implementation.
- Task Relevance Analysis: Using natural language processing and clustering methods, commonalities and dependencies among multiple tasks are discovered, and areas where efficiency can be improved if they are processed together are identified.
- Iterative improvement: tasks can be reorganized and re-abstracted again based on execution status and feedback to maintain an optimal action plan at all times.
Combined, these functions go beyond mere "task enumeration" to create a practical and dynamic "indelible AI management system.


- [[Personal Information Management (PIM)]]
- [Externalized Information Repository (PIM) construction method ([[PIM]]): a metadata assignment, tagging, and filtering method that not only records tasks but also makes them easily searchable and reusable at a later time.
- [[AI Planning and Scheduling]]
- [[abstract goals are dropped into concrete actions]][[planning method]]: An algorithm in which AI takes the user's goals and tasks and converts them into concrete instructions by lowering the level of abstraction step by step.
- [[Idea organization and knowledge clustering]]
- Task clustering and relevance extraction: Clustering and graphing techniques that improve execution by extracting similarities and dependencies among ideas and tasks and summarizing them efficiently.

Overall, these past studies can serve as a stepping stone for building AI systems that support the process of assembling "idea and task management" as a digital "indelible information space" and further optimizing each task [[from abstract to concrete]].
