We are exploring the possibility of applying Scrapbox's "connection discovery support" feature across different content.
- This feature is,
    - Associate content that shares keywords,
    - By highlighting important keywords in the article,
    - Indicates that an article with that keyword exists
- Perform an ambiguous search against existing keywords with the keywords you started writing about to find related keywords with shaky notation and different perspectives.
    - Here it is.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Vector search against existing sentence fragments in a beginning sentence fragment to obtain relevant descriptions of different points of view
- Collaboration between Scrapbox projects edited by a single individual
    - When you search within your own Scrapbox project, a cross search is performed against the Scrapbox projects you have viewed, giving you the opportunity to discover other people's ideas about what you are thinking.
    - Here's another.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Searching for Scrapbox projects you've viewed also provides an opportunity to discover other people's thoughts on what you're thinking about

Collaboration between individual projects is strengthened and knowledge networks are fostered.
- How effective this application is and how it should be implemented
- To answer these questions requires specific implementation and evaluation.
- that's so, isn't it<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

### Digest of Research Notes
.

We are exploring the possibility of applying Scrapbox's "Connection Discovery Support" feature across different content. This feature associates content that share keywords and highlights important keywords in an article to indicate the existence of an article with those keywords. It also includes the ability to perform an ambiguous search against existing keywords with the keywords you have begun writing about to discover notational quirks and related keywords from different perspectives.

From Nishio's research note, "Interproject Collaboration in Scrapbox," we see a discussion of how collaboration between Scrapbox projects edited by a single individual can function as an intellectual production tool. Also, in the "What's this?" note shows that when you search within your own Scrapbox project, a cross search is also performed on the Scrapbox projects you have viewed, providing an opportunity to discover other people's ideas about what you are thinking.

These notes suggest that the application of Scrapbox's "connection discovery support" feature across different content may enhance collaboration among individual projects and foster networks of knowledge. However, further research is needed to determine how effective this application is and how it should be implemented.

### Considerations and questions

What kind of new knowledge can be discovered by applying Scrapbox's "support for discovering connections" feature across different content? And what technical challenges exist in applying this functionality? Specific implementation and evaluation are needed to answer these questions.
