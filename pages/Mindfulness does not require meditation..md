Lessons from the "Mother of [[mindfulness]]": "You don't need [[meditation]] to be "[[aware]]" by [[Ellen Langer]].
> Harvard University Professor Ellen Langer has been hailed as the "Mother of Mindfulness" for her work in scientifically demonstrating the benefits of mindfulness in numerous studies. In this article, she explains how the essence of mindfulness, "[[the]] process of becoming aware," is simple. It requires no meditation, just the act of "[[finding]] something new" in the subject.

> When we look at our own and others' behavior with a mindful eye, we realize that every negative trait combines opposite aspects that are influential to the same degree. His behavior can be described as stubborn, but it can also be described as coherent.

    - [[new aspect]].

> In a mindless state, we just assume that some event "must happen and would be terrible if it did"... Being mindful means looking for new reasons to show that the event "may not even happen in the first place, and even if it did, it might actually be beneficial".

> Many people also confuse mindfulness with meditation. Meditation can be used as a means to achieve mindfulness, but it requires training, which some people find difficult. In my research and that of my colleagues, mindfulness does not necessarily require meditation. It is a very simple process of "[[noticing]] new things. It allows us to focus on "the present moment" and to be sensitive to [[context]] and [[situation]]. Mindfulness is the essence of engagement.

> The process of "[[awareness]]" occurs naturally when you come into contact with things that seem unknown to you. It generates energy rather than draining it... When you come into contact with things that you assume you already know... You become [[mindless]], assuming that you don't need to pay attention to the subject.
