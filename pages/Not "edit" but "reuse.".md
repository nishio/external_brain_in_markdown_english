from  [[Implement adding stickies on Paper.js]]
Not "edit" but "reuse."
> I was wondering if the add and edit screens for stickies and the detail view screen should be the same thing,
> I was reading a past discussion and it said [Sticky notes are immutable,
>  Then it should be a "reuse" button, not an "edit" button, I concluded.
