title: "The Problem of Technical Figurative Expression"
---

- The technical term is sometimes used figuratively among those who know the technology.
    - Both parties know the technical meaning of the term, and both understand that it's being used outside of its original application.
- To someone who does not share that technology, it appears to be a technical term, not a figurative expression
    - Misleading as to technical support.
    - Words speak for themselves.
    - After walking alone, experts who know the technology and do not share the context point out that the use of the technology is wrong.
    - For someone who doesn't understand the technology, "Expert A says it's X, so I believed it, and then Expert B says it's not X. What does that mean?" What does that mean?
    - I sometimes feel like they're trying to "smoke me out with technical jargon."

I was about to say [[impedance mismatch]] in the context of trying to talk about the need to reconcile technology with existing systems, and then I thought, "Wait a minute, isn't this not what the reader is supposed to understand?" I thought to myself, "Wait a minute, isn't this not communicating to the intended audience?
