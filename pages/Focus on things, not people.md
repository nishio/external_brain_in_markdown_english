title: "Focus on things, not people"
---

> [kmizu](https://x.com/kmizu/status/1805461285670465688) Recently, I've been trying to train myself to look at things from the perspective of "why does this happen" rather than "why do people do this?  I think that if you focus on "people", you can't help but attack "attributes", but if you focus on "events", you can think in a "constructive" way to prevent "events" from happening.
