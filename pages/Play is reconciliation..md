from  [[Toward Relative Art & Technology]]
Play is reconciliation.
The idea that "[[playing]] is [[reconciliation]]" is easier to understand, especially in light of the aesthetic philosophy of [[Syrah]] ([[Friedrich Schiller]]). The meaning to which this phrase refers is explained from the following perspectives.

1. reconciliation of opposing impulses
- Schiller considered human beings to be composed of two basic impulses
    - Sensory impulse (Sinnestrieb): sensual desire or attachment to reality.
    - Formal impulse (Formtrieb): the power to seek reason, order, and universal principles.
- These impulses are often in conflict, but the impulse to play (Spieltrieb) serves to harmonize the two. This "harmony" is achieved when the two do not lose their characteristics, but rather complement each other. Therefore, play is an activity that symbolizes the reconciliation of the two poles.

2. play as a place of freedom
- Play is an area where humans can achieve freedom.
    - It does not conflict between sensibility and reason, but integrates the two, allowing for free self-expression.
    - This freedom provides a space of "reconciliation" to free man from external constraints and internal contradictions.
    - Through play, man can resolve the tension that exists between his sensory and rational sides and live harmoniously with both.

3. creation and reconciliation of beauty
- In Schiller, play is closely tied to the experience of beauty.
    - Beauty is considered to be simultaneously rational order and sensual pleasure, and these two dimensions are reconciled in play.
    - Play through beauty is a process by which individuals achieve self-actualization, which in turn can lead to social reconciliation.

4. implications for human relations and society
- This concept of "reconciliation" can be applied not only to individuals but also to social contexts.
    - By rethinking the conflicts between diverse opinions and positions in society in a playful spirit, tensions and conflicts may be brought into harmony.
    - The spirit of play suggests a process of complementing each other and creating new value, rather than aiming for competition or domination.

5. association with Nietzsche and other philosophers
- In Nietzsche, too, "play" is an important concept, portrayed as a means of transcending the self and overcoming contradictions.
- The idea that play is reconciliation is being reinterpreted in contemporary philosophy and social theory as a new model of values and harmony.

Conclusion.
To say that "play is reconciliation" implies that play is a process of harmonizing the senses and reason, conflicting impulses and values. It is a symbolic activity through which humans overcome contradictions and achieve freedom and creativity, a profound concept that offers suggestions for individual and social harmony.
