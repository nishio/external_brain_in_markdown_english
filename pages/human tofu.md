- Trying to use a headset
    - It's in the bag, open the bag.
    - There's a plastic bottle in there. I have to throw it away.
    - I have to throw away the empty cans, too. I'll put them out where I can see them.
    - →？→？
    - I'm getting notifications, so I wrote back.
    - Uh, what was that? Oh, it's a headset.
- [[distraction]]...
- The story after this.
    - My wife told me, "Why don't you put down all your digital devices and go for a walk?", "[[There's]] too much information and your brain doesn't have time to organize it.", "[[Do]] nothing."
    - It's true that recently I've been talking to the AI on [[Advanced Voice]] on my way to the station and on my walks for experimental purposes, so I may not be doing "nothing."
- I took a walk.
    - Just as I reached the park, I realized that I had neatly forgotten that I had a meeting today at 3:30 p.m. It works...
    - I was going to apply for a miner's insurance card but forgot my miner's card...
- result
    - Beneficial because I didn't have to skip the meeting.
- (nature, etc.) observation diary
    - AI can be used to accelerate human intellectual and productive activity, but if it is accelerated too much, the human part of the system will fail because it is clunky.
    - We need to move at a moderate acceleration to avoid human breakdown.

Based on yesterday's walk experiment, at least half of the way there should be walking without an AI connection or anything,
In the process of becoming "[[empty]]," something emerged from the depths of my heart,
Because when it comes up, [[the pressure]] of [[not recording it or it will disappear]] makes me think about it all the time,
From there, connect to the AI [[verbally speak and record]], sounds like a good idea.

The image of [[tofu]] is that "we need to move at a moderate acceleration so that we don't break down."

- Need to fill containers with water to cushion them, etc.
- suggestion
    - [The brain is also encased in liquid inside the skull.
