## Plurality and Polis Study Group
.
Plurality, meaning diversity, may be a framework for further discussion among people with interests or expertise in a particular subject; Polis has no implementation, but a trust system may be needed. This idea could be related to the "third force of technium is society's [[collective free will]]" in the Technology and Innovation Commentary.

## How to Read Mathematics
It is interesting to note the difference between reading a math book and reading a physics book. Mathematics is rooted in understanding definitions, while physics is more about understanding the big picture. This may have something in common with the philosophy of "don't worry about what you can't control". Mathematics focuses on the parts that can be controlled (definitions), whereas physics is willing to learn the parts that cannot be controlled (the unknowns of the whole picture).

## The transformation of a creator into a critic.
This term seems to point to a shift from the production side to the critique side as a sign of declining competence and energy. This perspective may also be related to the stretch method. The change to critique is a kind of "de-energization" that may require a "return" to the original state.

## Stretch Method
.
The idea of muscle properties and weakness may be relevant not only to physical health, but also to mental health and growth. The concept of stretching could be applied to participation in forums of interest.

## Technology and Innovation
.
Whether humans influence technological evolution or vice versa is an eternal theme. As an evolutionary concept, "technium" blurs the boundaries between life and machines and raises philosophical questions.

## Question to the future
What is the first of technology? Is this a question to be explored in the same way as the first life?
How does weighting opinions based on interest and enthusiasm affect fair discussion?
How should the relationship between technology and human will be reflected in future innovation?
This note can be co-edited and we welcome contributions from colleagues.
