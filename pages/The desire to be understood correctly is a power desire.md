title: "The desire to be understood correctly is a power desire"
---

The [[desire]] to [[understand]] correctly is [[lust for power]].

The feeling of wanting others to have "what you consider to be the correct interpretation" is
[[lust for power]], since it means "to control the condition of others to suit oneself."

Although it is difficult to separate this from [[desire to achieve]] when that misunderstanding of others is an obstacle to the accomplishment of your project,
It would be [[lust for power]] to point out the mistakes of random strangers on the internet who are not at all obstacles to your project.
