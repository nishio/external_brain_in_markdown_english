I don't see [/rashitamemo](https://scrapbox.io/rashitamemo) in there.
And [/scrapbox-drinkup](https://scrapbox.io/scrapbox-drinkup) is over 100 pages.

It appears that even if you specify more than 1,000 items in "limit", only 1,000 items will be taken.

I was going to crawl all pages to get them, but I used [[titles API]] and was able to do it easily.

→ [[link title suggestion]]

What we want to know
- What is the percentage of pages with no links?
- How many links per page?
    - And how is that disparate? (Maybe [[power distribution]])
- How many appear per link? How are they varied?
- Percentage of 1-word links
- Percentage of links consisting only of nouns
- Percentage of links consisting only of adjectives and nouns
- Those containing verbs
        - [[Active bracketing of verbs]]
- Anything containing a particle
