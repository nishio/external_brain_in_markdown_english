- Assume that when Mr. A sends an email to Mr. B, it is cc'd to Mr. C.
- When Mr. B replies to Mr. A, he needs to Reply All ([[Reply to all]])
- Otherwise the reply will be sent only to Mr. A.
    - Mr. A thinks "Mr. B responded back".
        - Often assume that "Mr. C has received a reply as well".
    - Mr. C thinks, "I haven't heard back from Mr. B yet."
        - There's no way to know the email is being returned until you check with Mr. A.
- This situation occurs because of the design of the email tool.
    - Not generated if you use a mailing list or group chat.
        - [[No-Email Workstyle]]
