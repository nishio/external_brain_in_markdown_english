At a meeting of parents, I said, "I'm thinking of having my son take karate when he turns 3. When I told the parents that I was thinking of taking my son to karate when he turns 3, the male parents responded, "Sure," but the female parents didn't seem to get the point.

>  I think you seem to have mastered the line of "put in a few incendiary words and a few points of disagreement to create a flame war and generate controversy but increase views without crossing the line too far. It's not natural, it's totally targeted.
> [kugatsu_main](https://twitter.com/kugatsu_main/status/1671095064888770560) You can get away with anything if you say "I didn't write it" or "That's not what I meant. I think you're bringing in too many unnecessary dichotomies like "men vs. women". All you think about is safely inflaming people and getting more views.

>  This is an artificial campfire. I don't need to agree or disagree. This is emptiness. It's nothing but emptiness.
> [kugatsu_main](https://twitter.com/kugatsu_main/status/1671099522511147009) Whether you criticize this tweet as "harmful masculinity" or agree with it as "a society of men that women don't understand", you are both being forced into a position of You are forced to be on one side or the other.

>  This is just "toxic Internet-ness". It is a recipe for division. So let's not talk about this. Let's cook for ourselves, take naps, read.

>  You are inciting a dichotomy! You are agitating from a safe distance with your judgmental attitude of "I'm agitating a dichotomy!

>  I don't like the composition of people who are clever in their choice of words ducking those around them, but I also thought it would be nice if I was the only one excluded from that and played the nice guy.
> [kugatsu_main](https://twitter.com/kugatsu_main/status/1671381213343522817) (Wow, that's really true, I thought. That's kind of pathetic. Oh, yes, I agree with you tremendously. I could have written it in a better way, and I thought I put some things in there that I shouldn't have. I'll think about it some more.)
