title: "Trade-off between non-public information and mental capacity"
---

It's easier to talk about whatever you want without worrying about anything if you don't have [[private information]], but there are opportunities and actions you can take for the first time that you can notice by having private information.
I feel like I'm [[trading-off]] with [[the capacity of the mind]].
Basically, I'm a person who discloses everything, so if my behavior changes mysteriously or time mysteriously melts away, I know there's some [[secret information]] (see below).
