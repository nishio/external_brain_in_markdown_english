<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>You are an expert researcher on the Japanese language. I am interested in the difference in nuance between the three words "[[spontaneous]]", "[[voluntary]]" and "[[proactive]]" in Japanese. Please explain.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The Japanese words "spontaneous," "voluntary," and "proactive" may seem to have similar meanings at first glance, but each has a slightly different nuance.
- Spontaneous
    - Voluntary" refers to acting actively on one's own initiative, without being told or directed by others to do something. The emphasis is on acting on one's own volition and motivation.
    - E.g. He volunteered voluntarily.
- Voluntary
    - Voluntary" refers to the state of making and taking responsibility for one's own decisions and choices, without intervention or limitation by others. It is an aspect of acting on one's own judgment and policy without depending on others.
    - Example: She chose her research topic independently.
- Subjective
    - Proactive" refers to an attitude in which one takes the lead and actively engages in something. It involves not only taking action, but also thinking about what that action will lead to and how it will affect you.
    - E.g., he participated proactively in the project and made many suggestions.

While these words can be interrelated in many cases, there are many situations where the difference between them is important depending on how they are used. Careful contextual consideration is the key to better understanding the differences between these words.

- I thought there wouldn't be a difference, but there sure is.
- > Example: He volunteered voluntarily.
    - I felt that even if this were "voluntary" there would be no difference in meaning.
- however
- > Example: She chose her research topic independently.
    - If this is "voluntary," the meaning changes.
    - I feel that "voluntarily chose" was a choice between "choose/not choose" and "do/don't do," and I chose to "do" before being told to "do."
    - When you choose "voluntarily," you feel as if you have chosen one of the themes from "Theme A/B/C" without being told by others to choose "A" or "Don't choose B," or asking others "Which one should I choose?" or "Which one should I choose?
    - I have a weak sense of discomfort that "I chose proactively" is, well, almost the same as "voluntarily," but "you still just chose it."
        - I would feel comfortable with "proactively executed the study."
