title: "broad listening"
---

The development of technology to duplicate and distribute information has made it easier for one person to communicate ideas to a large number of people.
However, when a large number of people transmit information, the volume of information received by one person becomes enormous, and the person drowns in the flood of information.
In a society and company where people actively communicate, technology that supports listening to the opinions of many will be important.

I am interested in improving human [[intellectual productivity]]. Broad listening is a technology that enables [[a flesh-and-blood person]] to "hear many opinions," which is impossible. Therefore, I am interested in it as a kind of [[human enhancement]].

My research focuses on improving human intellectual productivity. I am particularly interested in a technique called broad listening, which allows people to hear many opinions. I consider this a form of human augmentation.

Broad listening, thanks to advances in statistics and the relevance of AI, allows millions of people to hear the essence extracted from the distribution of opinions of their peers. This enables democratic deliberation on a large scale.

One specific technology is Polis. It is a system in which many people express their opinions on a question, which is then visualized; the AI can also play the role of a personality, thus providing multiple perspectives.

Better consensus-building" can be achieved by enhancing "the ability to recognize the opinions of many."

However, mastering the practical methods of broad listening remains a challenge. We intend to explore this in depth in future studies.

specific technology
- [[Polis]]
        - [[I want to do more Polis.]]

Regarding Polis, "Aren't you doing this because you want to change society?" I've been thinking about it again, and I don't think I want to change society that much.
- It's a system where multiple personalities express their opinions on a lot of questions, and those opinions are visualized."
    - [[MULTIPLE VIEWS]]
    - AI can do the personality, for example [/villagepump/Scrapbox ChatGPT Connector roundtable mode](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/Scrapbox ChatGPT Connector roundtable mode).
- It's expensive to get 20 people to vote on a [[raw, boiled-down topic]] that I'm interested in, who I think "might give me useful input".
    - But it would be nice if the AI could vote in various people's personalities while we sleep.
- If the [[section]] that says, "Hey, this topic is unexpectedly controversial, even though I expected to agree with it," is discovered, we can say, "Let's have an AI play the role of someone who disagrees with this topic and discuss it.
- That I am interested in this because it is a method of human augmentation.
