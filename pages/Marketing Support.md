- Need help with [[bracketing]], not [Auto Bracketing
- The process of choosing keywords has a positive effect, so it's not good for machines to take it away from humans.
- But the "good way" is so unknown that it's hard for people to learn.
- It takes time to get to the point where it's worth it.

Specific UI proposal
![image](https://gyazo.com/87b00bf53efc7eedfc6937701648ff85/thumb/1000)
- A link is suggested in the form of a list of checkboxes, tap on it and it becomes a link
    - Press the Copy button to copy the edited lines, go back to Scrapbox, paste, and you're good to go!
- Links in/out of the text
    - Links in the text
        - The link in the text is, in essence, "[[keyword extraction]]".
        - An approach to extracting keywords from text
        - Based on the list of strings that have already been made into links on Scrapbox, the approach determines if the string is included in the text.
    - Links not in the text
            - [[I'd like to associate "information sharing" with "information sharing."]]
        - If there is a page that is closely related to the word from which it appears, it may be a good idea to link to that page
            - People don't often recall similar sentences they have written in the past, so this is an opportunity to bring awareness
        - Suggestions that link to strings that are not in the text provide value that search fails to provide.

- It is important to let humans choose, not to automatically bracket them.

Lack of knowledge about the "goodness" of the bracketing
- Data should be collected on how people who are familiar with the system use it.
