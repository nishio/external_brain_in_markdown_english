Billy Lin's talk discusses the practices and challenges of online citizen participation in Taiwan. The lecture consists of three main parts
- Exploring and Challenging Online Citizen Participation in Taiwan
    - Through [[citizen participation]] projects such as "[[vTaiwan]]", "[[JOIN]]", and [[sunflower (Helianthus annuus) campaign]], in which Hayashi was involved, attempts at policy discussions and their challenges are shared. In particular, barriers to citizen participation such as "[[ignorance barrier]]," "[[participation method barrier]]," and "[[knowledge barrier]]" are discussed.
- Lights and Shadows of Tools to Support Online Discussions
    - The advantages and disadvantages of online discussion tools such as [[Polis]], [[Loomio]], and [[Discourse]] are explained. In particular, it is pointed out that Polis is effective for visualizing opinions, but is not suitable for dialogue and in-depth discussion. Issues such as vandalism and [[information overload]] are also mentioned.
- The Future of [[Online Participation]] and the Question of Democracy
    - It discusses the impact of online participation on democracy and ways to improve the quality of participation. In particular, it states that the involvement of politicians and the coordination of opposing views are critical to the success of the debate.
