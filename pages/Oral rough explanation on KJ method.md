Oral rough explanation on [[KJ method]]

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> I usually use the KJ method, or in other words, Kozane method. It is a Japanese traditional technique to create ideas. I think it is better, it should be better to tell the technique for

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Oral Keichobot/icon' alt='Oral Keichobot.icon' height="19.5"/> Using the KJ or Kozane method sounds intriguing. It's great that you have a traditional Japanese technique for idea creation. Can you tell me more about how this method works? How do you use it to help others verbalize their thoughts?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> At first, we make a small piece of information, it is a kind of ingredient of thought, and then combine them into groups.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Oral Keichobot/icon' alt='Oral Keichobot.icon' height="19.5"/> That's a neat approach. Starting with small pieces of information and then grouping them seems like an effective way to build thoughts. How do you decide which pieces to group together? What happens after you've formed these groups?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Sorry, I made you misunderstood. There is a point many people may misunderstand. To make a group is not a good thing.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Oral Keichobot/icon' alt='Oral Keichobot.icon' height="19.5"/> Ah, I see. So, the focus isn't necessarily on grouping the pieces together. What is the main goal when working with these individual pieces of information? How do you use them to help with the verbalization process?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> To find relationship between two pieces, it is a basic component of thought build-up process.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Oral Keichobot/icon' alt='Oral Keichobot.icon' height="19.5"/> Got it. Finding relationships between two pieces of information is key. This approach helps build a more coherent thought process. How do you identify these relationships? What do you do once you find a connection between two pieces?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> (It is nice question, I'll write more later)
- Use your feeling.,Often people tend to group items using [[abstract concept]]s, but it is not good way in the technique of KJ method. We focus on each piece, each [[concrete example]] of piece of thought, and then find the relationship between those pieces. It is important strategy.
- (Addition: Creating groups based on known concepts results in the [[reproduction of known concepts]]. This does not contribute to the [[discovery of new concepts]].)

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Oral Keichobot/icon' alt='Oral Keichobot.icon' height="19.5"/> That's an insightful point. Focusing on concrete examples and the relationships between them, rather than abstract concepts, seems crucial in the KJ method. How do you encourage people to stay focused on concrete examples? What makes this approach effective in your experience?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> In my experience, the [[concept of grouping is harmful]], so we focused on to make stories.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Oral Keichobot/icon' alt='Oral Keichobot.icon' height="19.5"/> [[Focusing on storytelling instead of grouping]] sounds like a powerful strategy. How do you use storytelling to connect these individual pieces of thought? What role do stories play in this process of verbalization and idea generation?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> At first, you fild somehow related pieces and then put the pieces close. Repeat the process. After that, you see the [[emerged structure]] of pieces and describe why they are in the structures. It is kind of a story-telling process. After that, the story will make a lot of new pieces or relationships.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Oral Keichobot/icon' alt='Oral Keichobot.icon' height="19.5"/> That's a creative approach. By placing related pieces close together and then describing why they are connected, you're effectively creating a story. This storytelling process helps make sense of the ideas. How does this storytelling impact the way people understand and communicate their thoughts?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Often humans tend to write a story from the beginning to the end, but...

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Oral Keichobot/icon' alt='Oral Keichobot.icon' height="19.5"/> That's an interesting observation. Writing a story from beginning to end is common, but it sounds like you have a different approach in mind. How do you suggest people should approach storytelling in this context? What's different about your method?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Sometimes, a good point to start is found after an exploration.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Oral Keichobot/icon' alt='Oral Keichobot.icon' height="19.5"/> Absolutely, that's a great insight. Often a good starting point emerges after some exploration and reflection. How do you usually begin your exploration process? What helps you find that good starting point in your experiences?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> At first, write anything which comes up with your mind and then organize them on the two-dimensional desk surface.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Oral Keichobot/icon' alt='Oral Keichobot.icon' height="19.5"/> Starting by writing down anything that comes to mind and then organizing these thoughts on a board sounds like a productive strategy. How does organizing thoughts in this two-dimensional way help you? What do you do after you've placed these ideas on the board?
