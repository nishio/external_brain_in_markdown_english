Why you started and your goals at each point in time
- (I saw a "I just started trying to be red for now" type of topic on Twitter [12/22/2020](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1341351263963738112?s=21))
    - I'm talking about what my goal was. At first, it was "there are a lot of people around me who are doing atcoder, so I'll give it a try anyway.
    - After I did it, I heard, "You have to do it about 10 times or it will come out much lower than your true ability," and I said, "Well, let's do it 10 times."
    - And 10 times later, three months later, I was in the middle of the green, and I was thinking, "I hope it's light blue."
    - After another three months of light blue from there, I thought I'd lost sight of my goal and was going to lose my tension.
    - is unexpectedly up to the blue eye, so the current goal is to make it blue anyway.
    - I also want to make PAST advanced. I'm thinking that once I'm done with those two things, I'll be less excited again.
