You produce 10, they produce 10 (which you cannot observe), and the composite result is 30.
- From myself, I'd say, "Working with this guy, I get 30 for 10 effort, he's giving me a lot, thanks!" I'm grateful!
- They feel the same way.

You produce 10, they produce 10 (which you cannot observe), and the composite result is 15.
- From my own perspective, it looks like I should be doing better.
- They feel the same way.

- I was thinking about [[Madamis (Japanese brand of haloperidol)]] when the above thought occurred to me.

The latter can be easily drawn.

- Looking at A+B on the scale of A, the contribution by B appears to be shorter than the actual length of B
- The reason this is happening is because the two vectors are not aligned.
- This is easy to describe, but I can't draw the former with this metaphor.
    - Even if they are perfectly aligned in direction, they can only be 100%, so they cannot express the synergistic increase in value.
    - There is a discrepancy between the axis of value that each individual perceives and the axis of output that he or she can produce.
    - But that's a little less informative when it comes to matching the "axis of values" with the other person's "axis of output."
    - Metaphors captured in vector synthesis seem inappropriate.

    - [[Do it right" is a mid-core philosophy.]]
