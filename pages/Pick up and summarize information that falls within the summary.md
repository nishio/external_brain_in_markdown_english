title: "Pick up and summarize information that falls within the summary"
---

- [Pick up information that falls under [[summary]].
- Summarizing is the process of taking out what you judge to be important along a certain evaluation axis and discarding the rest.
- [[GPT]] is rather good at [[concept subtraction]], so after summarizing a page with multiple topics mixed in, you can take out the parts that do not match the summary and then summarize it further
- If the evaluation axis is not clearly specified in the summary, a general (commodity, trivial) [[point of view]] summary is made, which may result in a trivial summary. In such cases, it may be interesting to take out "the part discarded by it" and summarize it
