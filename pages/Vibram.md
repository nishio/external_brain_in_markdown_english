- I bought [[shoes]] that let me feel the unevenness of the ground.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/7a5a1cae9d19682c0402ea63ebacd849/thumb/1000)
- This feels really good!

        - I wrote that this one feels really good, too, but I can't tell the difference in the picture.
        - I have [[green bamboo]] at home, but it is honestly boring compared to this. There are countless variations out in the park.
    - >  [[Kazuhiro Shiozawa]] :
        - > I'm glad you finally got the messageðŸ˜Š.
        - > So when you walk around in Vibram Five Fingers every day, you don't need a foot massage.
- In addition, there was the trap of not realizing that the hems of the trousers were now touching the ground due to the large change in shoe height, and getting covered in mud!
    - > Kazuhiro Shiozawa: When we tailor suits, we ask our customers to wear Vibram Five Fingers shoes to take their measurements, because we don't want them to wear leather shoes.

- I have been wearing Vibram Five Fingers for a little over a week now, and what used to be a rambling "my soles don't feel good, I want to step on green bamboo and massage them" has loosened up, and as a result, I have a clearer idea of where the problem is. It seems that the muscle crossing the sole of my left foot is tight.
    - see  [[plantar fasciitis]]
- The concern I had before putting them on that they might be cold is actually cold when I come out of the building on a winter night. As soon as I walk, they warm up. The blood flow in my feet feels much better. Even in a foot massage sense, I feel better on a daily basis as the blood flow in my feet has improved and the "lumps" and "lumps" have flowed away and I feel better.
    - How it is during the rainy season has not been tested.
        - Well, but even my previous MBTs didn't wear them in the rain, so there's no difference.
- I don't know how it is for runners, but for me, at the "too much exercise, let's walk once in a while" level, they seem to be better than the shoes I've been wearing.
    - Even when you're sitting on a bench instead of walking, it's easier to turn your ankle.
- Oh, and I'm talking about the fact that tree roots are good because, unlike green bamboo, they are not cylindrical, and you can step on a golf ball or something, but compared to that, they have the advantage of being "firmly fixed and not moving around if you step on them outside the center of your foot".
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/bd89717ede622a22b38cd5ee5e27081b/thumb/1000)
        - Stepping on the bump in the center of the screen has a golf ball-like effect, but it does not roll like a golf ball, so you can step on it without worry.
- > Kazuhiro Shiozawa:.
    - >  If you get pain in the arch of your foot, please take it easy and stretch it well. I sometimes get pain when I walk too much. If I stretch it, it will recover in a couple of days. I walk slowly until the pain subsides.
    - >  If you have been wearing shoes other than Vibram FiveFingers, your ankles and the joints below must be stiff and stiff, so it is important to stretch each joint sufficiently to make them flexible.

I bought another one with the same model number.
- The last time I bought it, I had to go all the way out to the pop-up store to get it, but it became available in the online store sometime during the Corona period!
- I ordered it on the 18th and it came on the 19th.

I went to wash my shoes and noticed a hole in them.
![image](https://gyazo.com/48b4e05fe259162ddc07410d5c233b2c/thumb/1000)
How many years has it been since I first bought it?

The new one also has a hole at the ring finger!

- I threw out the old one, but didn't buy a new one.
- If you think buying a new one is a hassle, it's because you're not ready.
- Where is the online store?
    - [Barefootinc Japanï½œThe only authorized importer of Vibram FiveFingers in Japan](https://www.barefootinc.jp/)
- What is "same model number"?
    - KSO EVO 14W0701 W40
        - [KSO EVO 14W0701 | Vibram FiveFingers,Vibram FiveFingers | KSO EVO | barefootinc](https://www.barefootinc.jp/view/item/000000000069?category_page_id=vibram-kso-evo)
    - I think this is the new KSO EVO.
        - [KSO EVO 24W0705 | Vibram FiveFingers,Vibram FiveFingers | KSO EVO | barefootinc](https://www.barefootinc.jp/view/item/000000000317?category_page_id=vibram-kso-evo)
- Payments are made through Amazon Pay

That's what I just realized.
- The >3mm outsole provides a super barefoot feel! The outsole has excellent grip and allows you to feel the ground with your feet to the maximum....
- >  This model has an ultra-thin sole that gives you the most barefoot sensation. Because the sole is so thin, those who move around a lot with a lot of rubbing need to be careful, but it is popular for training because it is easy to feel the sensation in the sole. Although this model uses a sole for indoor use, some people use it outside because they cannot experience this barefoot sensation with other models. The degree of wear and tear when used outside varies from person to person. If you can use your body enough to walk outside barefoot, you can use them for many years. The material is mesh, so there is little steam, and many people use it barefoot.
- Is it an indoor sole?
    - I was considering using it for climbing or something, but no.

- I'd like to go jogging, so maybe the KMD EVO 15W4001 would have more cushioning than the ones I usually wear.
    - They sell socks that dry easily.
