- [[Splitting links that are too large]] using [[text vector embedding]]

Embedded in vector
Clustering into 2-5 pieces by k-means method
    - Select K for which [[silhouette coefficient]] is optimal.
    - [[Polis: Scaling Deliberation by Mapping High Dimensional Opinion Spaces]]

Not bad, isn't it?

I would like to give an additional hint as to what we should call "each group".
- In addition to the page itself, the page title is also vector-embedded.
    - Maybe we could do the link strings used inside.
- And the one closest to the representative point of each cluster is the "string representing the cluster".
    - Maybe I can give you a Top 10 or so.
