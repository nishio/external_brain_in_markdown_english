In the European Union (EU), the European Parliament adopted a resolution in 2017 stating that the European Parliament should consider a special legal status for intelligent robots in the future (so-called "electronic human presence") and proposed a framework that would make the AI itself liable (in case of damage The resolution proposed a framework that would make the AI itself liable (e.g., make the robot itself a defendant in the event of damage, insure the robot, etc.). This is based on the practical idea that "if a robot has its own legal personality, it will be responsible for its own actions and can be the entity that compensates for any damage it causes.... In reality, however, such a bold proposal has been met with some caution from various quarters. In the EU, for example, more than 150 experts issued an open letter saying that the plan to give robots legal personality is unrealistic and inappropriate, and criticized the plan for blurring human responsibility. After all, the EU's AI Comprehensive Regulation (AI Law), which was passed in 2023, does not include a provision giving personality to the AI itself, maintaining the principle of human-centered responsibility.
