title: "time performance"

[[typer]] for short.
For me, "[[cost]]" in "[[cost performance]]" includes not only [[monetary cost]] but also [[time cost]], so it is an inclusive concept.
It might be useful to use a term that separates monetary cost performance from time cost performance. Raise [[Cognitive Resolution]].
When there is an abundance of free content, people will choose the one that consumes less time, even if it is also free.

It used to be [[etiquette]] that [[typer]] was bad. [[Courtesy 2.0]].
