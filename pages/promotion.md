A man was worried that the seedlings he planted were not growing well. He then pulled the seedlings, thinking, "Let's help them grow longer. As a result, all the seedlings died. Those who try to help the seedlings grow are not only not benefiting nature, they are hurting it.

- [[Mencius (Meng Zi) (371-289BCE)]] ― [[Sun Goddess]]
> The chief of the helpers is a seedling. It is not beneficial, and it is also harmful.

- Pulling on the [[seedling]] does not [[grow]] it, but instead weakens it.
- [[Growth takes time.]]

Might want to mention it in [[Growing Phase]].
- [[the good idea grows by itself]]

[[Jochou]]
