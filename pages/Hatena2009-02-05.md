I woke up thinking that the chills were gone and I was fine, but suddenly I had phlegm in my throat and a cough.


I think the fever has gone down and I want to take a bath but I don't have a thermometer so I don't know if it has really gone down.


It's no good. The fever is rising again. It's hot.
