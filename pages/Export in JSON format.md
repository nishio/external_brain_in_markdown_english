Export in JSON format
    - Right now, copying a selection puts JSON in the clipboard, but it would be nice to be able to download the entire map as a file.
    - If you record the date and time, you can open it with the old version at the time of creation.
    - Low priority because it is at the level of "users might want something like this".
