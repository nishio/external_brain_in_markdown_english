The [[knowledge accumulation model]] is not always correct.

However, I recognized one person in the "case that cannot be established" that I am thinking of now after I turned 40, following the path of "Nada Junior High School → Nada High School → Kyoto University" with a high concentration of weirdos, and after a while, I think there was another one in the past, so I think there is no more than one in 10,000 people in the population ratio.

They X can put boxes in the air.
- We need to ask what exactly "[[ground]]" means.
    - The [[ground]] is just a [[shared belief]] that "it is OK to [[delving into]] this far" held by the majority of people.
- X is not in on this.

Those who have not participated are not that rare.
    - [[philosophers]] and [[mathematicians]] who doubt [[assumption]] and dig around.
    - [[frivolous]] People who say a lot of fluffy things.
    - I recognize this as "someone who tries to put a box in the air and it falls down."
- X is different from both.
    - Can put boxes in the air and still assemble things without falling off

Why is this possible?
- Thinking of this in terms of the gravity and box metaphor seems impossible, so a different model is needed
    - Maybe "net."
        - [[knowledge consistency]]
