UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a dimensionality reduction method developed by Leland McInnes, John Healy, and James Melville. HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a clustering algorithm developed by Ricardo J. G. B. Campello, Davoud Moulavi, and Jörg Sander. B. Campello, Davoud Moulavi, and Jörg Sander. Therefore, their authors are different.

Leland McInnes is best known as the developer of UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection), but is also involved in clustering methods. In particular, he has proposed an improved version of HDBSCAN* (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), the "Accelerated Hierarchical Density Based Clustering" algorithm.
