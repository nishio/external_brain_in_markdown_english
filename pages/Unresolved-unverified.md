        - [[teleport]]
    - How to designate a teleport destination
        - [[Virtual Virtual Reality]] curved laser pointer can warp to any location
            - However, when you make a mistake and fly to a strange place, you have to turn around 180 degrees to get back.
            - I would like to see a [[Look Back Button]], as looking back 180 degrees is often a hassle.
        - [In the Bigscreen Beta, select the teleport destination display and jump.
        - [[balloon jump]] in [[Oculus Rooms]]
        - There is also a [[two-stage teleport]] using a monolith as a fusion of the two.

- I want to tap the Scrapbox API to get Lines, make them into Draggable objects, and place them in the scene.
- I want to save the edited result on Unity on the net and restore it later.

    - How can I display information fixed to a face, such as [[subtitle (movie)]]?
    - see [[CenterEyeAnchor]]

- How do I make Unity-chan walk?
        - [[Playback of animation]]
    - Moving objects from scripts
        - [[Cat Animation]] might be helpful.

- Things follow the user
    - User One Acquisition
    - I want to make sure Unity-chan comes with it.

- I want the menu to appear only when I look at things.
    - How do we draw the menus?

- How to display an outline around a focused object
    - I use it here: [https://developer.oculus.com/blog/distance-grab-sample-now-available-in-oculus-unity-sample-framework/](https://developer.oculus.com/blog/distance-grab-sample-now-available-in-oculus-unity-sample-framework/)
        - [[Contour Highlights]]

    - [[Can a keyboard be connected?]]
    - I found what looks like a solution, but I haven't tested it yet.

    - [[unity-webview]] looks good
        - Web page could be displayed, but it is rendered as is, not in VR.
        - Coping method unknown
    - [[Embedded Browser]] looks good

            - → Failure
