title: "Understanding the system and understanding the user"

from  [[Wellhead 2022-01-19]]
- [[Understanding the System]] and [[Understanding the user]]
    - Understanding what kind of [[pain points]] various users in the world have.
    - Understanding of "how the system is designed."
    - Users may make misguided requests because they don't understand the system, but the creator may also make misguided designs because they don't understand the pain points of all users.
    - So it is important for the creator to observe [the user's honest reaction
        - Ego search as a means to that end.
            - Is it? (conclusion for now anyway)
    - It is also important for the creators themselves to become users.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/yosider/icon' alt='/villagepump/yosider.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/kuuote/icon' alt='/villagepump/kuuote.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
