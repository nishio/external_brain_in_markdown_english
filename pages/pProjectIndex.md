Hub page hub page for personal notes about the project.

Moved to private Kozaneba
- Why Kozaneba:
    - Separate containers for each project will take away what doesn't fit well.
    - Tasks that connect two projects should be easily represented.
- Why undisclosed:
    - Only those projects that clearly fall into the "open to the public" container can be published.
    - The whole hub should be a place where you can write anything, and for that reason, it should be private.

This is what Kozaneba should be about.
- Individual projects could be Scrapbox or Kozaneba.
    - Kozaneba's development is managed by Kozaneba, but everything else is still Scrapbox.
- In other words, there are "containers for each project."
        - [[Container Metaphor]]
- Items that do not fit well in the container are missed.
    - I have to edit the video before my lecture at the 54th Annual Meeting of the Young Scientists in Information Science -> Come to think of it, I was going to upload my lecture at the Musashino Endowed Chair on YouTube, but I neglected to do so.
        - Maybe you should re-shoot Keicho's screener before the lecture and introduce it as "what I've been doing lately" - I'm sure you'll be able to find it.
- This should be private.
    - In other words, only those projects that clearly fall into the "good to publish" category are open to the public.
    - Maybe the whole hub should be private.
        - If only non-public ones are held aside, they will be overlooked, there should be one dashboard.
        - In order to put anything on, it needs to be private, that thing, I can't make it public yet, but when I can make it public, I want to be involved with that project...
