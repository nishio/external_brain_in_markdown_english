- [[Resolution of Perception]]
- Considered examples of excessive abstraction of various realities in [[Mistaken Dichotomy 2]]
    - [[Abstraction Is Not Always Good]] [[Golden Mean]]
- Illustrated the transitions between these interpretations
- 1: State of believing there are only two types of things
    - Believing the world consists only of black and white
- 2: State of realizing intermediate things exist
    - Realizing there is gray in addition to black and white
- 3: State of realizing there are not just several types, but countless types of things
    - Realizing gray is not just one type but a gradient with various shades
- 4: State of realizing that two attributes are not opposing but can change independently
    - What was thought to be black and white is actually independent like red and blue, with purple having both and black having neither
    - [[Axes Are Not Singular]]
- 5: State of realizing values come with dispersion
    - In a state of [[Uncertainty]], values have dispersion
    - A step further is realizing the "distribution is not necessarily normal," where "expected value" and "most probable value" differ

Beyond stage 4 lies the [[Trade-off of Two Attributes]].  
It might be good to include this in a blind spot card.

- > It might be good to include this in a blind spot card.
- After consideration, it felt like this should be divided into multiple cards
- > In the stages of resolution, the lowest resolution state was a dichotomy, but there is also "identification as the same" --- [[What Was Thought to Be One Concept Is Nested Two Concepts]]
- First, there is a point, and there is the realization that "it's not a point but a set with size," which is the basis for [[Moving Backward but Reaching the Same Goal]]
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/63f10705ddda4e251f8e58f180c2f51b/thumb/1000)
    - [[Mistaking It for a Point]]
        - Added on 2023-09-08: "It's not a point but has size" implicitly assumes "having size" = "having boundaries," but there might be [[No Boundaries]]. [[Not a Point but a Probability Distribution]]
    - The reverse mistake is [[Mistaking a Distribution for a Point]]
- There is a realization of changing from considering that set with size as "one thing" to "two different things," which is [[Different Things Belonging to the Same Category]]
- In the current diagram, there are 3 after 2
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/994fad428fbe7af23a9086a983e159d7/thumb/1000)
            - Made it [[In-between]]
    - Skipping that, the realization "I thought they were two different things, but it's a gradient" is [[Mistaken Dichotomy]]
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/10ad9c1f6cfd2701d0af1a5e0c661869/thumb/1000)
            - Made it [[Not Two Different Things but a Gradient]]

- In stage 4, the realization is that it's not a single axis
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/e0e93bd5a1d0bce420aad9d09b0821c4/thumb/1000)
    - [[Mistaken Binary Opposition]]
    - [[Axes Are Not One-Dimensional]]
    - [[Strength and Weakness Axes Are Not Singular]]
    - [[No Order of Magnitude Exists]]
- Regarding stage 5
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/f7c8880465f0982dcad05f629838ded4/thumb/1000)
    - [[Expected Value Is Not the Mode]]
    - [[Deviation from the Mean and Sample Size]]
    - [[Comparison of Means]]
    - [[Significance, Profit and Loss, and Dispersion]]

- [[Is There Size?]]
- [[One or Two?]]
- [[Is the Boundary Clear?]]
- [[Is There a Third?]]
- [[Mistaken Dichotomy]]: The diagram has room for improvement, so it's not included above
- [[Are There Countless?]]
- [[Are There Multiple Axes?]]
    - > The realization that it's not a single axis in stage 4
        - > [[Mistaken Binary Opposition]]
        - > [[Axes Are Not One-Dimensional]]
        - > [[Strength and Weakness Axes Are Not Singular]]
        - > [[No Order of Magnitude Exists]]
        - Also [[Trade-off of Two Attributes]]
- > 5: State of realizing values come with dispersion
    - > In a state of [[Uncertainty]], values have dispersion
    - > A step further is realizing the "distribution is not necessarily normal," where "expected value" and "most probable value" differ
        - > [[Expected Value Is Not the Mode]]
        - > [[Deviation from the Mean and Sample Size]]
        - > [[Comparison of Means]]
        - > [[Significance, Profit and Loss, and Dispersion]]
    - Created [[Is There Dispersion?]]
    - [[Expected Value Is Not the Mode]] is often mentioned, so it might not be a blind spot?
        - It should be included because many people fall into this trap
    - The fact that comparing means is not a total order is surprising [[Efron's Dice]]
    - The remaining two are also somewhat blind spots
    - "Sometimes it's better to have more variability"
        - When it's better to have more variability, averaging the opinions of many can make things worse
        - These two connect from this perspective
    - Fundamentally, it's the influence of a nonlinear threshold function
        - Therefore, [[Stochastic Resonance]] is also connected

2022/11/24  
- Breaking down stage 5 further
    - [[Is There Dispersion?]]
    - [[Is the Dispersion Different?]]
    - [[Is the Distribution Shape Different?]]
        - [[Recognition of Distribution Shape]]
        - [[Pay Attention to Distribution Shape, Not Just the Mean]]
        - [[Point, Dispersion, and Distribution Shape]]
    - These could be separated

Previously titled "Stages of Reality Resolution" (2019-05-06)  
- On 2021-03-28, attempted to link this page and mistakenly called it "Stages of Cognitive Resolution" [[Cognitive Resolution]]
- After considering the variation between [[Resolution of Reality and Cognitive Resolution]], it felt like [[Resolution of Perception]] was a better fit.
- Since "Stages of Resolution of Perception" was too lengthy, it was shortened to "Stages of Resolution"
