It's only in the hands of humans", and I'm turning to AI to make me feel good with [[sense of superiority]] over it. Domination is pleasure.

Ah, I see.　Some people use it to feel superior by making fun of it?
    - I feel like [[self-assurance]] gets shredded when you can't find the [[make light of]] point, though.

How to use AI
    - Create an environment that facilitates [[awareness]] (I mainly use this method?)
    - Receive [affirmation
    - Receive [judgment
- Feel superior by making fun of them.
