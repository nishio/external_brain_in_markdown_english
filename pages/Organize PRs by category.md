title: "Organize PRs by category"
---

I was speaking on 2025-05-20 for the policy team, but I thought I should be open about it because there seems to be some misconceptions in the world about ranking people by the number of likes they have.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1925705743182843986) We have a working code that labels the PRs that come into Team Mirai's policy once an hour and puts them into a Markdown file. If you paste it into ChatGPT, you can chat with AI based on what kind of PRs are coming in that category.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1925338243496919268) I created a system that crawls PRs for Team Mirai's policy every hour and keeps the JSON containing all the data updated with the latest information. By instructing Devin in Japanese, I was able to extract the PRs with specific conditions from all PRs in about 2 minutes.

If you paste it into ChatGPT and write, for example, "a quick summary of what it says", you get results like this

I recommend o3 instead of 4o.
As for the problem of "there are too many things to do and I don't know where to start," I think that consulting with o3 like this will solve the problem.
I'm sorry to inform you, but this method is not available since 200 cases have come in the README.
