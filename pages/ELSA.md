> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1648181108713074688) I let my guard down thinking "I'll never need English speaking skills again in my life" and suddenly I need them by a month from now, so you can never be too careful! [[nishio ]] I guess I should charge for an English conversation school and force myself to spend time speaking only English. I think I was level 6 at Gaba back in the day, wonder how much I'm dropping by not using it...

- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1648184540635222017) I hear a lot of names like ELSA and [[Speak]], but at the end of the day, the problem that needs to be solved the most is that people don't spend time learning unless they are forced to. I think the best way to solve this problem is to assign a human being by paying him or her.

- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1650537075811454977) I thought I wasn't allowed to proceed until I heard an OK-like sound. I had trouble advancing at all.

- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1650539905511198720) role's l is not good at all!
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1650540809136250882) usually no s either
