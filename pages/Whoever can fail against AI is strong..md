- Shogi has become stronger with AI running on a single PC than with professionals.
    - Shogi has entered an era in which professionals learn moves made by AI.
    - A superhuman who hates to lose keeps playing against a tireless AI.
    - The time has come for those who can learn by trial and error against AI to be strong.
- People get angry, scold, and evaluate.
- AI does not get angry, scold, or evaluate.
- The one who can fail against AI is strong.
    - Self-study has its limitations.
        - If you don't learn from your human counterparts, you'll never grow beyond a certain point.
        - When you ask stupid questions of your human counterparts, they get angry, scolded, and evaluated.
            - If you ask too much, people get tired and weary.
    - Most people are afraid of "failing against humans," so they stop learning.
    - No matter how much AI asks, it never gets angry, never scolds, never evaluates, never tires.
    - You can make as many mistakes as you want against AI.
    - The time has come for those who can fail against AI to be strong.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1728052272209317931) Failing against AI is just as strong as writing with guns and making errors when learning to program.

> [nullzwai](https://twitter.com/nullzwai/status/1728077412934496594) "He who can fail is strong" is a golden saying. In today's world where avoiding risk is even considered a risk, you need to be tough enough to not just fall down and get up. Even if you achieve your personal evaluation goals, it is meaningless if the company goes under.

> [cafelatte88](https://twitter.com/cafelatte88/status/1728213100044910725) Contrast that with how businesslike (non-emotional) the person giving/receiving human feedback can interact? I guess.
>  On the other hand, would positive feedback be more effective if it came from a human being? Is this going to be a world of feedback philosophy?

> [teruskywalker](https://twitter.com/teruskywalker/status/1728058787615879646) you are right.
>  Wall-to-Wall with Artificial Intelligence is

>  Artificial Intelligence can

>  On the other hand, in an exercise gym studio program
>  In a tough time
>  It's encouraging to have others around.
