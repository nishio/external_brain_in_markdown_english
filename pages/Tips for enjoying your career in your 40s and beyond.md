> [nori76](https://x.com/nori76/status/1793079394535379407) When I decided to work for the rest of my life, not just 65, I thought it would be nice to "[[consider]] my 40s as the beginning of my career. Because even until the age of 65, I still have more than 20 years to go. On the contrary, I decided to take that as an "opportunity" to try various things from scratch and go independent, and so far I am enjoying it very much.

You can do a lot of new things while working as a salaried worker, and it is much less risky that way. In my opinion, it is more important to focus on the "long term" and to be able to do various things.

> I think that if you put a time horizon of 20 years or so, you can reduce the size of what you do now. If you do that for 10 years, it will be quite a lot of time. What is good about reaching this age is that it is easier to enjoy the "process" of the 10 years, rather than just talking about the results you will get by continuing to do it. I think it's good that what you are doing is interesting in itself.
