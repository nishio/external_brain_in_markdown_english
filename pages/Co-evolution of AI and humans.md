> [kazuhi_s_](https://twitter.com/kazuhi_s_/status/1638430695524831232/photo/1) A report suggesting co-evolution of AI and humans that the quality of Go played by humans is evolving at an accelerated rate since [[AlphaGO]] was released. The quality of human Go has accelerated since the release of [[AlphaGO]], suggesting co-evolution of AI and humans. The quality of the game has rapidly improved since 2016, after having remained flat for the past 60 years. Moreover, the number of new moves created by humans is increasing, rather than AI moves simply being memorized.
