Questions and Comments
How does project success affect the balance between team member motivation and market value?
How can the combination of exploratory nets and the KJ method be applied to problem solving today?
In what situations is "speak from a conclusion" most effective?
How can the similarities between GTD and the KJ method be applied to other productivity methods?
In what situations is the relationship between tacit knowledge and discomfort particularly important?

- Compared to a working division of labor team, there is less of a reason for members to stay involved in a project in an unexplored junior project
- Clear division of roles" is "a risk of not having someone in charge."
- The team leader should be willing to fill it himself if the rest of the team is missing.

- Expedition Net
    - Jiro Kawakita
    - Very useful for solving everyday problems
    - Kawakita's books, "Ideas" and "Explorations in Knowledge."
    - If the quality of the data used as material for the KJ method is poor, the results are irredeemable.

- Lessons from the Ground Self-Defense Force
    - One minute you're dead, the next, who's going to report the conclusion? Next thing you know, you're dead and who's going to report your conclusions!" is a very useful phrase!

On the Language of GTD and KJ Method Analogy
- Relationship between GTD and the KJ method
- GTD is "write down everything you care about."
- Similar to the KJ method "write down what seems relevant to the problem".
- Balance between efficiency and stress-free work

How does discomfort relate to tacit knowledge?

From previous note
Focus on perspectives from AI and other life forms as well as humans
Exploration of diverse perspectives is an important means of broadening horizons, as AI can provide a broader perspective
The idea of profiting from uncertainty is a new approach
Long-term value of a system with a set of limited downside risk and unlimited upside risk
Convert information from a broad perspective into a form that can be processed by humans using the KJ method and other information organization techniques
Collaboration between humans and AI to share tacit knowledge
Cycles that include collaboration, such as the SECI model, are beneficial.
View AI and humans as equals and engaged in the same tasks
A certain level of anxiety tolerance is necessary to improve knowledge productivity, such as from the perspective that "good and slow are better than fast".
Collaboration with AI is a new relationship in which the human is no longer the verbalizer before the AI or the judge of the outcome after the AI.
It's important to "make AI equal to humans," and that's worth it in the long run.
These key points may serve as important guidelines for developing new directions and strategies to improve knowledge productivity. In particular, the exploration of new collaborative relationships between AI and humans could significantly change the shape of future knowledge production.

## Research Notes

### About the project falling into the unexplored Jr.
Compared to a working division of labor team, we feel that in an unexplored junior project, there is less of a reason for members to stay involved in the project. For example, a member may not be able to work on the project during the summer vacation because he/she did not get good grades in the first semester. If there are four members, the risk is four times higher than in a one-person project, and if the division of labor is not clear at that time, there is a possibility that there will be no one in charge of the project.

I fear that "clear division of roles" may not be an appropriate construct. While it is important that "no member's contribution to the project is unclear," the team leader may want to be willing to fill in for himself if the rest of the team members are missing.

Also, regarding ChatGPT's comment, I don't think it is necessarily true that projects with low market value are more likely to fall through. If you can show market demand at the proposal stage, that would be great, but I haven't seen many proposals that do that.

### About the Explore Net (Fireworks) Study Group
We learned about an idea method called "Exploratory Net". I found this method, invented by Jiro Kawakita, to be very useful in solving everyday problems. In addition, reading Mr. Kawakita's books such as "Idea Method" and "Exploratory Studies of Knowledge" helped me understand the concept that if the quality of the data used as material for the KJ method is poor, the results are irredeemable.

### About Speaking in Conclusion
The Ground Self-Defense Force teaches, "Speak first of all about conclusions! Next moment, if you die, who will report your conclusions!" I found these words to be extremely beneficial. Thanks to this teaching, I myself have learned to speak from the conclusion.

### About Dominion 2022-02-22-3
We thought about the strategy of the game Dominion. In particular, we felt that it was important to develop a strategy that takes into account the effects, costs, and victory points of each card.

### About Hatena2009-10-29
After reading Hatena's blog post, I realized the importance of thinking deeply about my condition and symptoms. In particular, I thought it was important to understand exactly what my body changes and symptoms are and what they indicate.

### On verbalizing the analogy between GTD and the KJ method
I've been thinking about the relationship between GTD and the KJ method; GTD doesn't say, "Write down everything you need to do." To be precise, it is "write down everything you care about. I felt this is similar to the KJ method's "write down what seems to be related to the problem.

### About Hatena2009-09-22
Reading Hatena's blog post made me think about my own position and self-perception. In particular, I found the self-perception of "unreliable as a marriage partner but interesting to appreciate" very useful in understanding my own values and position.

### pIntEn on completion of translation up to chapter 6
We have completed the translation of up to chapter 6 of pIntEn. Through this translation work, we were able to improve our English comprehension and translation skills. In addition, I was able to gain new knowledge and perspectives through a deeper understanding of the content of the original text.
