---

An idea about when to ask others for help, made famous by Google Brain's adoption of it. #KnowledgeSharing #OrganizationalTheory

> When you are stuck on something, first try to solve it yourself for 15 minutes. Then, after 15 minutes, ask someone else for help.

> 15 min rule: when stuck, you HAVE to try on your own for 15 min; after 15 min, you HAVE to ask for help.- Brain AMA

- Include the rest of the story: "When you are stuck on something, first try to solve it yourself for 15 minutes. Then, after 15 minutes, ask others for help. Because not doing the former is a waste of other people's time, and not asking for help is a waste of your own."
