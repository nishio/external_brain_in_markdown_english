Words are handles of meaning, and the process of making them is often a metaphor or parable. However, the words function as handles that make it easier to manipulate one's thoughts. It is important to pay attention to bodily sensations, experiences, and discomforts that have not yet been translated into words. Also, if there is a disconnect between the words and the concrete experience, it is necessary to go down to the physical sensations and experiences and reconnect them with the handles.

Training oneself to express one's experiences in words is the first step in connecting words with concrete sensations and experiences. Then, by reviewing and brushing up the tentative verbalization over time, the words can be made more precise and expressive.

The meaning of words is not a point, but a distribution, and it is thought that as people repeatedly take actions for and against the same short sentence and visualize how it compares to other opinions in the world, they will gradually become aligned with the same distribution.

It is difficult to verbalize what we do not understand. It is absurd to try to explain it in neat and tidy words. It is important to first try to write it down, even if it is just a list of fragmentary keywords.

### Considerations and questions

Considering the relevance of the "superficial coined words" fragment, it seems important that the concepts to which the words refer be useful when creating the words. Also, considering the relevance of the "Judging by Actions" fragment, it seems that not only the words but also the actions are important. From these perspectives, what factors should be emphasized when creating the words?

In addition, given the relevance of the "post-LLM worldview" fragment, it would seem that training in expressing one's experiences in words would be important. But how should that training be conducted? And what do we think we can gain through that training?

Finally, considering the relevance of the fragment "It is difficult to verbalize what we don't know," the difficulty and importance of verbalizing what we don't know is emphasized. However, what methods are considered effective in overcoming this difficulty?
