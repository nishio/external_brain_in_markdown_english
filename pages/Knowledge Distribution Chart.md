title: "Knowledge Distribution Chart"
---

A [[schematic]] with [[amount of knowledge]] on the vertical axis and [[field of knowledge]] on the horizontal axis. I often use it because it is very useful.

In order of suitability for first-time readers
    - [[Radar Charts and Knowledge Distribution Charts]]
    - [[Knowledge Exchange Requirements]]
    - [[3 Steps to Knowledge Exchange]]

time series
- I first wrote about it in 2011 [Advent Calendar for Graduate Preparation](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20110309/1299598527)
- I've used it in several lectures.
        - [[Learn from those with little knowledge.]]
- It was pointed out that the meaning of the axis is not specified and clearly stated
- I realize it would be easier to understand if I put the radar chart out first.
