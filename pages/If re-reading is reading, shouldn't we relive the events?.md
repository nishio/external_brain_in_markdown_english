title: "If re-reading is reading, shouldn't we relive the events?"
---

- [[Re-reading is the only creative reading technique.]] Then, isn't creative attending a lecture by reviewing the recording, and creative participating in an event by reliving it?
- None of these are "one and done".
    - If you got a lot at one time, that's what you originally had.
        - Reading a book about something you already know makes it easier to understand, but it doesn't contribute much to learning something new.
    - If you only get a little at a time, you should repeat it.

Different types of events have different levels of difficulty.
- Sitting and listening to a lecture is like reading a book [[one-way communication]].
    - A live webcast archive that can be viewed later can be easily retaken.
    - [[Physical Education]] and the greater the rate of participant interaction, the more difficult it becomes to relive.

The timing of the re-reading does not have to be right now.
- I'd rather have a pause.
        - [[step-by-step procedure]]
- Scrapbox brings up past pages through links when a related topic is mentioned.
    - This seems like a good idea.
    - Because "[[context is connected]]" creates an "incentive to read back.
