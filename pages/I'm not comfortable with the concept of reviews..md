- I'm not comfortable with the concept of [[review]].
- Why do humans need to see the source code?
- Whether or not you read the source code of a library or framework when you use it
    - Read only when you have a purpose, not all the time.
    - If the documentation says, "This function does this," believe it and don't worry about how it is implemented.
        - Read only when the suspicion arises that something might be wrong with the document.
    - The code written by AI is starting to have a similar skin.
        - Only care when they are behaving strangely.
        - And that, too, Next Action is not "human read," but "let a smart AI consider it."
