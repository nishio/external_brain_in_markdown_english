see  [[PDF to Scrapbox]]

This theme was developed into AI after I wrote a rough draft of what I wanted to do, "send PDFs to Gyazo and paste them into Scrapbox," but I felt that it was mainly technical content that would change over time [[obsolescence]] and need to be [[discarded in a modern context]]. I felt that it was a matter of [[creating a new blank page]], not here.

    - [[Output of ideas by scraping instead of writing]] is important.
