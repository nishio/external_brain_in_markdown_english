> [ssimtok](https://twitter.com/ssimtok/status/1781661465780601238) "Pride Vision," which shows if a candidate is in favor of marriage equality by holding an AR camera over an election poster, is now available at TRP's Malifaux booth. The system is scheduled to be put into practical use on April 22 for the supplementary election for Tokyo's 15th district in the House of Representatives (April 28, 2012).

>  ・How do you combine this with issues of thought and belief other than marriage equality? (Why? Only marriage equality?)
>  ・Is this not in violation of the Public Offices Election Law?
>  The question is.


> [HiromitsuTakagi](https://twitter.com/HiromitsuTakagi/status/1782036539801002307) This is a case somewhat in the middle of personal data protection legislation. It is not a matter of obtaining the consent of the data subject, nor is it a matter of acquiring the thoughts and beliefs of the data subject, but a matter of the content of the data and the accuracy of the decisions based on it (although the relevance of the data is probably not an issue, and the data is probably being used). The accuracy of the identification of the data subject could also be an issue.

> [HiromitsuTakagi](https://twitter.com/HiromitsuTakagi/status/1782038952670847318) However, the evaluation of candidates (what kind of principles, etc.) has been freely conducted for a long time, and the same problematic issues were not raised under the Privacy Act. However, this was never considered a problem under the Personal Information Protection Law. This is probably because the purpose of reporting by news organizations was exempted from the full application of the law, and the accuracy and rationale were left to the ethics of the press.

> [HiromitsuTakagi](https://twitter.com/HiromitsuTakagi/status/1782040617289499037) Also, from the viewpoint of freedom of expression, we should be free to evaluate the candidates in any way we like (even if they are on the list). However, this case shows that this will not be the case if a machine is used to judge the candidates. It will depend on how the system will be adopted.

- >  Why not just skip to the candidate's official website or something?
- >  I don't think it is a good idea to have a system that allows the creator of the application to intervene in the evaluation process.
- >  I didn't know this direction existed. That's amazing. I never imagined it.
- >  They don't have to know the candidate to choose.
- >  Convenient. Very dangerous.
