[[reduce input/output friction]].
[[Goal, input, output]].


The main points of the parts and examples of instructions that the AI can perform are as follows
- requirements arrangement
    - Have the document analyzed and summarized
    - Extract assumptions and constraints
- Sorting Tasks
    - Classify AI-oriented tasks and human-oriented tasks
    - Reasons and bottlenecks are also noted.
- data handling design
    - Let AI create design plans for input/output formats
    - Automatic generation of codes for data conversion
- Workflow and system design
    - Generate flow diagrams and API specification templates
    - Draft procedure description document
- Prototype construction and testing
    - Let AI generate code for core functions
    - Test data and report generation scripts are also automated
- Operation and improvement cycle
    - Automatic log analysis and report generation
    - Visualization of error locations and presentation of improvement plans

Based on these considerations, AI can be effectively entrusted with tasks by clearly specifying the tasks it is asked to perform, their purpose, and the necessary inputs and outputs.
