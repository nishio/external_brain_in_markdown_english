### digest
.
The notion that "you can't do intellectual production without a coherent amount of time" is a fallacy, and the problem is that there is a low resolution to intellectual production. There are two types of intellectual production that can and cannot be done in a discrete amount of time.

### Relevance
.
The notebook and the fragment "The Art of Intellectual Production Must Make It On Its Own" share a reflection on the methods of intellectual production. Also, the "Can't you do intellectual production on your phone?" fragment of the notebook embodies the idea of "the type of intellectual production that can be done even in interrupted time" of the notebook.

### deep thinking
Methods of intellectual production vary from person to person, and it is not possible to say that all individuals need a certain amount of time. It is important to find a method of intellectual production that can be used effectively even in the time that is interrupted.
