title: "Organizations are places to combine expertise"
---

from  [[The more advanced knowledge becomes, the more specialized it becomes and the less useful it becomes on its own.]]
>  An organization is a place where [[expertise]] is organically linked and even [[coupled]]. An organization is any place where people [[work together]] toward a goal, such as a company, government agency, or non-profit organization. Thus, a society in which knowledge is central is necessarily a society of organizations. There is de-organization, but not de-organization.

    - [[Gathering is the first step, staying together is progress, working together is success.]]
- > The organization here is not a rigidly closed one. Especially from now on, it will be free to come and go. It will not even be an employment relationship. It will be a variety of connections, including cooperation, collaboration, and partnership.
        - [[An organization that is free to come and go as it pleases]]
