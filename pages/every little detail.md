        - > His motto is "[[stories (esp. war stories) or lectures told by someone near a temple while begging for money]]," from which he found "[[不如省事]] (事过省にならない)."
- The saying that it is better to leave out the little things.
- It is difficult to determine if it is a "small thing."
    - For example, is it a "small thing" to put garbage in a garbage bag?
    - According to Nishio's observation, great teachers take the initiative to clean up trash.
    - This is sort of tautological. By seeing a teacher who takes the initiative to clean up trash despite his or her high position, and by people around him or her feeling good about it, the teacher is clustered as a "great teacher".
    - When a great teacher takes the initiative to throw away trash, people around him or her will think, "We can't let the teacher do that," and will take the initiative to throw away trash. The teacher will not order or teach the students to be conscious of the environment and to improve it, but will let them spontaneously create their own activities. Advanced educational technology.
    - On the other hand, if someone says, "I don't throw trash away because I am a great person in a high position," that is ridiculous; he is not a "great teacher" but a "teacher who pretends to be a great person.
- Goethe: "[[Don't]] let the big things be sacrificed to the little things."
        - [[Seven Habits]] "Prioritize what matters."
    - This one prioritizes important matters.
    - If there is something more important than throwing away trash, that will naturally take precedence.
    - In other words, should we assume that they dumped the trash because they had no other priorities?
