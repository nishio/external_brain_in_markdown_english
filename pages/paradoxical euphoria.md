> I remember thinking about what happiness is for about 80% of my life, so I guess I would rather say my specialty is happiness theory, but I will write some conclusions I got.
>  ・At the time one is thinking about what happiness is, that person is unhappy.
>  ・ Most successful people are (seem to be) unhappy.
>  ・ Happy are those who make their own world. The king of the mountain or the frog in the well. There are many examples of internal power harassment and so on.
>  ・ Successful people are almost always unhappy when they retire.
>  ・ Successful and happy people are semi-retired. The pattern is that they only hold power and leave the line.
>  In the end, successful people are structurally more likely to be unhappy because it is difficult to make equal friends. Especially when they get money and raise their standard of living, the probability of losing the friends they had before increases. (By the way, I didn't have any friends in particular, so I'm going to be extravagant, even if it's just to spite myself.)
>  Moreover, success doesn't increase that much in a competitive game, with or without a sense of superiority, because there are usually more amazingly successful people.
>  Successful people are unhappy when they retire because the people around them don't retire with them and their relationships disappear all together.
>  So, in order to be successful and happy, it is important to get out of the competitive game, while at the same time maintaining a world in which you feel superior.
>  In other words, you mean old people.
>  People who are called "old people" are usually long-lived and healthy, so I think they are happy and stress-free to the point that it really affects their health and longevity.
>  So, let's all not only aim to be successful, but even more so, let's aim to be old people. The real winners in life are old people. It is hard to become one, but it is worth it.


> [gweoipfsd](https://twitter.com/gweoipfsd/status/1757062964384063574) The post about "old people" is an analysis of the structure in which social success and happiness do not necessarily coincide, but when I write something like that, many people read it as me wanting to be an old person. I am annoyed by the fact that many people read my post as "I want to be an old person". This is why liberal arts majors are so annoying. You just long for power, don't you? Don't put us together. There are people who just want to analyze.
