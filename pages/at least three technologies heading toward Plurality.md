>  If I understand correctly, there are at least three technologies heading toward Plurality.
>  X: [[Broad Listening]] (or visualization of opinion distribution among diversity)

>  Some might wonder why not mention of Decentralized Identity? DID is important component of both Broad Listening and Quadratic Funding. I just avoided to draw four-dimensional cube. That is why I used the words "at least three".
>  One more thing. I wrote "Quadratic Funding" but I feel it too specific. I don't know comprehensive term for the mechanisms such as Quadratic Funding, Retroactive Funding and Social Impact Bond.
