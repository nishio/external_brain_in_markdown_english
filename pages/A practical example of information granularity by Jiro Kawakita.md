title: "A practical example of information granularity by Jiro Kawakita"

from  [[Granularity of information]]
How much information will be written on each KJ method fusen, and how granularly will it be chopped?

- Actual examples by [[Jiro Kawakita]] himself ([[Exploratory Studies of Knowledge]] p.123)

- On the right side, there are "[[dot-notes]] and [[self-indulgent pleasures]]" that I wrote down in shorthand during the interview.
- The label on the left is made from a clean copy of it.
- > Each label sheet consists of two rows of small labels (4 cm long), 12 labels in total, affixed to a backing sheet. The individual labels are perforated so that they can be torn off from the backing paper as well. (p.121)
- 4cm is even smaller than my [[38mm x 50mm fusible wrap]]?
    - About 40mm x 15mm [[channel 4 label]].

    - People unfamiliar with the [[KJ method]] may find it "very granular".
    - Especially when you think of the so-called [[information card]] in the expression "writing information on a card and arranging it".
    - I would think that a lot more text would be written.
- On the other hand, many people write in one word when given a limited amount of time to make labels at a workshop, etc.
    - Writing a lot takes time.

The granularity of the nameplate after grouping
    - [[fog of avidity]] and other illustrations made by Jiro Kawakita himself.
- Often hear the comment, "Surprisingly long."
    - If you've categorized your labels, your nameplate tends to be the one word that represents that categorical category.
    - It's not just whether it's one word or not, but also the high percentage of verbs it contains.
        - Related: [[Explain with verbs]].
        - It's hard to explain with verbs if you've classified them.
