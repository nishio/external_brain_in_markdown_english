title: "Equivalent exchange of labor and wages"
---

Someone on a social networking site said "[[exchange of equal value]] of [[labor]] and [[wages]]" and I thought this phrase was interesting.
Whether he intended it or not, since he says "labor and ~" rather than "equivalent exchange of [[working hours]] and wages," he is of course affirming that the "more powerful" will get more for the same hours of work.
