<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>If what one person A can read, another person B cannot, I guess you could say that person B lacks "[[literacy]]" in the [[literacy]] sense of whether or not they can read, what do you think?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Yes, the word "literacy" as used in that context refers to the ability and knowledge to read text and information. If person B cannot read what you can read, then you lack "literacy" in that particular area. However, "literacy" can refer not only to the ability to read and comprehend text, but also, in a broader sense, to knowledge and understanding of a certain field or topic. For example, "digital literacy" often refers to knowledge and skills related to digital technology.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>At this time, B may become angry when it is pointed out to him that he is not literate enough. Why is this?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>There are several possible reasons why some people are offended by the suggestion that they are "not literate enough."
        - Impact on [[self-respect]]: People want to be recognized for their abilities and knowledge. When that ability or knowledge is pointed out as lacking, self-respect is easily damaged.
    - [Received offensively: Depending on the way the point is made and the context, it may be taken as a one-sided criticism or attack.
    - Concern for misconceptions and bias: A suggestion of "lack of literacy" may be taken as an assessment of a person's general knowledge and abilities.
            - [[overgeneralization]] だね<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Cultural and background differences: The concept of "literacy" and perceptions of its importance may differ across cultures and backgrounds. Therefore, what one person considers important may not feel the same way to the other.
- For these reasons, it is important that points about literacy be phrased and timed appropriately, taking into account the feelings and background of the person to whom they are addressed.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>[If [[you want to tell them, you need to be considerate]], you may not need to tell them in the first place.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Certainly, the necessity and timing of communicating should be considered based on the situation, relationship, and purpose. The following considerations may help you decide whether or not you should communicate:
    - Purpose: It is important to be clear about what results or changes you are hoping to achieve by communicating. For example, if you are aiming to help them grow or improve their situation, it may be worth communicating.
        - So you don't have to tell them if you're not "trying to help them grow or improve their situation."<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - [[If you're not trying to improve the situation, there's no need to communicate that you need to give consideration.]]
    - Relationship: The relationship between the teller and receiver should also be considered. If the relationship is close, it may be easier to communicate because there is trust. Conversely, if the relationship is shallow, it may not be appropriate to point this out.
    - Circumstances: Whether the lack of "literacy" in a given situation is temporary or whether it creates a specific problem is also a consideration.
    - Sensitivity: It is important to consider how open the other party is to feedback and pointers, or even if they may be repulsed by past experiences.
- Thus, the decision to communicate depends on many factors and should be considered carefully. It is important to be clear about the intent and consequences of communicating and to respect the other person's position and feelings.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>If B reacts ideally, without being emotional, to the lack of literacy, what is the ideal response?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>While the ideal response may vary from person to person, the following are some responses that are generally considered constructive
    - Calmly accept: First, calm your emotions and reactions, and then calmly accept the other person's opinions and points of view.
    - Ask questions: ask for specific examples and details to clearly understand the specifics, reasons, and background of the pointers.
    - Appreciate: Feedback and pointers can be viewed as an opportunity for growth. Therefore, it is useful to thank the person who provided the information.
    - Communicate your position and reasons: If you have a different idea or background to a point being made, you can help the other person understand by being honest about it.
    - Consider countermeasures and remedial actions: If you feel that the points raised are legitimate, you can consider how to resolve the issue and what actions to take, and see this as an opportunity for growth by doing so.
- Such reactions are useful for maintaining and improving interpersonal relationships and personal growth, and can increase opportunities for understanding and cooperation without emotional involvement.
