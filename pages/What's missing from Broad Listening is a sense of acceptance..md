- I was talking to [[tokoroten]] and was convinced by his assertion that the problem is that certain elements are missing in broad listening.
    - I doubt if it is appropriate to call it [[voice effect]].


Mr. A writes an opinion, the system summarizes it and creates an output.
- I don't see where my written opinion is reflected in this output.
    - [[Opinion traceability has two directions.]]
- It would be nice if, for example, if you put in your post ID or something in some way, it would highlight the relevant points of your broad AI.
