    - I tried [live video game
- Voice and face are shot separately and synthesized later.
- Often previews freeze because of two video sources, painful.
- It might be better to export the video compositing the two videos first and then edit that.

    - I wonder how to solve the problem that when I create a sub-sequence in Premiere Pro and add it to another sequence, the waveform does not show up in the audio channel. Is it a mistake to create a sub-sequence to try to handle multiple videos together?
