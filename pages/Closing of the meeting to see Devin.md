- [[Meeting to see Devin]]

How much did it end up costing?

- After I used up my monthly mininum of 250 ACUs, I added 100 ACUs at a time. 100 ACUs is 200 USD, and 1 USD is a little over 150 JPY (157 JPY as of today), so a little over 30,000 JPY each time, or 270,000 JPY in total.

2.### Devin-related "Go Private & Restructure" task
.
    - T8567: Devin's privatization
    - T8568: Migration of connection to personal Slack
    - T8569: Organize WebUI members
    - * T8570: Make all repositories private.
    - T8571: Creating a closing article
        - These are highly interdependent and collectively need to proceed as a phase of "making Devin specialized for personal use". Considering the timing of publishing the closing article and the backward tasks (T8572, T8573, etc.), it is desirable to start early and complete in phases.

### T8568
: Migration of connection to personal Slack

Let's turn this off.

* ### T8570
: Make all repositories private.
- I don't know how to get this snapshot back to base.
- Simply delete or
- I deleted it, saved the snapshot, and got the onboding screen.

Organize your knowledge

- Uke. Always do it.

Knowledge is a kind of global variable that affects all team members (unless it is Pin to Repository), but many organizations will have people who approve without thinking about the scope of impact.
- It's hard to debug when someone's properly approved knowledge causes them to behave differently and do weird things.

* ### T8570
: Make all repositories private.
- I'm starting to feel this is not appropriate, so I'll close it.
    - I'm cloning the private repo's data in the publis repo, but some people say that it would be better to clone from the public repo in the private repo, or rather pip install it.
