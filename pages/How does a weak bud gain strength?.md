How do [[weak shoots]] gain [[strength]]?

I don't know, but I'll write down some random thoughts.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - [[track record]] I guess not.
- A: There are a few natural "think they are the strongest" types
        - [[I am the strongest]] by [[My Values]]
    - 「 [[The value of my being to myself is higher than anything else I can think of.]] 」
- B: Otherwise, you prove your worth by [social proof
    - I have achieved these results, and many people are happy because of them."
        - I feel like it depends on whether you want "[[many people]]" or "[[authority figures]]" here.
            - 「 [[Pleasing the masses is evil.]] 」
                - Oh no, it's the first half that says this, the one with the strongest "self-worth".
        - What people find [[authority]] in is also up to them.
        - [[Social proof is beneficial for maintaining mental health]]
- A and B are not distinct and separate
    - There's a type of person who believes in his or her own worth and is an A because a parent or teacher gave him or her approval as an authority figure before he or she is aware of it.
    - In other words, the individual also acquired [[confidence (in oneself)]] through B, but then "[[I am worthy]]" becomes [[axiomatized]] and the cognition is twisted to deny B after the fact.
