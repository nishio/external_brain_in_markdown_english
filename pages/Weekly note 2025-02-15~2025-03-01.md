I know it's the weekend in terms of switching weeklies, but I'm participating in [[MITOU2024 Demo Day]] the whole Saturday and Sunday, so I don't feel like I'm taking a break.

2025-02-14 What we haven't been able to do
- local deep research experiments and
- Experiments with broadlistening in Devin and
- Still experimenting with new algorithm [originality filter

TODO
- backlog, last week's story, put what you did or didn't do this week and let o3 think about it
    - What should I make them think about?
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3-mini-high/icon' alt='o3-mini-high.icon' height="19.5"/>It is good to have o3 think in terms of the following
    - Task Prioritization: Organize the backlog and tasks performed and not yet accomplished and identify which are important.
    - Cause Analysis: Identify causes of unaccomplished tasks and problems in the last week and consider areas for improvement.
    - Next Steps: Derive a future action plan and proposed resource allocation and scheduling adjustments
- These axes allow for efficient task management and planning.

I get the impression that o3-mini-high says the right things without thinking it through.

## Task Priorities
.
- 2/25 Lecture
    - Highest priority due to impending dates (see T0057). Preparation, including materials and rehearsals, is needed.

## Cause analysis of unaccomplished tasks
.
- Lack of task concretization
    - Experimental tasks are left vague as to "where to start. Clarifying the setup and scope will make it easier to proceed.
- tightening schedule
    - Time was allocated for events such as lecture preparation and roundtable discussions, and experimental systems were put on the back burner.
- Confusion due to information dispersion
    - Management of multiple channels (see T0113/ T0116) such as Signal, Slack, ChatGPT, etc. is not keeping up.

Work in progress from last week 2/14
Mechanism for experimenting with clustering algorithms in Devin
Prototype of Deep Research system for data not available on the Internet (not yet tested)
Tried Computer-use, looked up how to use it from a script (untested).
I haven't been able to do all of it because of the busyness and preparation for the lecture afterwards.
