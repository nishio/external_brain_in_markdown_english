[[Difference between Scrapbox and Blog]].
- Difference between [[Scrapbox]] and [Blog
    - [[The blog was dismantled and became a social networking site and Scrapbox.]]
        - [[Scrapbox and Blog]]
    - [[Why Scrapbox?]]
    - > Existing blogging systems are weak in their support for discovering relationships between individual entries. As the number of entries grows, the total value increases only in a less than linear fashion.

When article A is written and article B is written one year later
- If you didn't recall A when you were writing B, then A didn't contribute to your intellectual production at B.
    - A→0
- If you remember A when you are writing B, and the combination produces better value
    - A and B each have a value of 1, but A+B=3
    - This leads to nonlinear growth in value output per unit time

concrete example
    - [[Owase 2024-01-23~24]] related story on the road
    - There was also talk of Manazuru.
        - [[Manazuru 2023-05-13]] and connected
