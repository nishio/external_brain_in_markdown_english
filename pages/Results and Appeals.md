title: "Results and Appeals"
---

A comment in reply to someone's private post.

People who do one interesting thing after another do another interesting thing immediately after doing one interesting thing without [[appealing (to)]] the [[results]], so they may be misunderstood as not having done much when compared to "people who have only achieved one thing but have invested the rest of their time in appealing their achievement. I think they would be misled into thinking that I didn't do much.

After reading this again, I was reminded of [[Appealing to results is the responsibility of the person who produced the results]], to the effect that [[Do not set numerical criteria for evaluation of researchers#5a49c7e4aff09e 0000233519]], but the composition is somewhat different since the evaluator in this case is the supervisor.
