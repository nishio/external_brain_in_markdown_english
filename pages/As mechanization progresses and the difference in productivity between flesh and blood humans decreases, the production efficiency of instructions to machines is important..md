title: "As mechanization progresses and the difference in productivity between flesh and blood humans decreases, the production efficiency of instructions to machines is important."
---

- [[In a world where increasing mechanization will eliminate differences in physical productivity by flesh-and-blood humans, the efficiency of the process of producing instructions to machines, as typified by programming, will become an important factor in measuring human productivity.]]

- [In a world where [[mechanization is advancing]] and physical productivity differences between [[a flesh-and-blood person]] will disappear, [[process of producing instructions to the machine]] will become an important factor in measuring human productivity.

- As [[mechanization]] progresses and the difference in productivity of live humans decreases, [[production efficiency of machine instructions]] will become more important.
