### digest
.
We are considering whether to improve the automatic translation system in Scrapbox or switch to a GPT-based one. DeepL-based methods have a glossary function and can be controlled so that specific words have specific translations. On the other hand, GPT-based methods can adjust the translation simply by giving instructions in natural language. Both methods require some hard work.

### Relevance
.
It is related to the fragment "[[pContinuousTranslation2023-06-01]]". This fragment states that they are considering whether to improve Scrapbox's automated translation system or switch to a GPT-based one. This is directly related to the note.

### deep thinking
The choice between improving Scrapbox's automated translation system or switching to a GPT-based one has a significant impact on the quality and efficiency of translation. DeepL-based method improves on the existing system, leveraging its terminology capabilities and controlling how specific words are translated into specific terms. The GPT-based method, on the other hand, is a new and more efficient way to translate a term. GPT-based methods, on the other hand, are a new approach and have the advantage of adjusting the translation simply by giving instructions in natural language. However, both methods require some hard work, and the choice must take into account the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

### summary of thoughts
Improving Scrapbox's automated translation system and switching to a GPT-based system is a choice that will have a significant impact on the quality and efficiency of translations.
