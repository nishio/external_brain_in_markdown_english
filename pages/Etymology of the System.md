title: "Etymology of the System"
---

- > From French système (“system”) or Late Latin systēma (“system; harmony”), from Ancient Greek σύστημα (sústēma, “whole made of several parts or members”), from σύν (sún, “with, together”) + ἵστημι (hístēmi, “to stand”) (Proto-Indo-European *steh₂- (“to stand (up)”)).
    - [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/system](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/system)
- It's so old that it's hard to say "this is where it came from" on the contrary.
