The current [[Keichobot]] is a free trial version of the paid Keichobot Premium.

- With per-user memory
    - Currently, the emphasis is on being able to start using the system immediately without creating an account, etc.
    - Premium first creates an account.
    - Instead, you'll be able to see your past interactions from your account screen.
    - [[motivating system]] and developmentally integrated
    - I've been thinking that the two have a lot in common from the creator's point of view, but it's still true from the user's point of view as well.
            - [[Motivation systems and Keichobot have similarities from the user's perspective.]]
    - The lack of integration in the current Keichobot is around the fact that you want people to remember things like TODO lists, etc.
        - I don't want to have to explain what the task is every time.
    - Interview long-term users of the motivation system to find out when they use the system.
    - Developmentally integrated with [[Kozaneba]] via [Expedition Net
    - There was discussion about "getting lost in depth-first search" and "maybe we need a width-first search."
    - But if you naively do a breadth-first search, it feels like you're ignoring what we've said and asking a different question, depth-first for this care.
    - Instead of simply avoiding depth, we can put an upper limit on the length of isolated branches that do not form a network.
