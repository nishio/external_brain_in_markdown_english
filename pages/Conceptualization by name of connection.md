Conceptualization by name of connection
- The "set of operations" and the "[[set of connections]]"

> [masuda220](https://twitter.com/masuda220/status/1712987952610230360) Abstract and conceptual data models are not the same.
>  The abstract data model abstracts data types into a set of operations.
>  Conceptual data models are conceptualized by the name of the data type and the name of the connection between data types.

> [masuda220](https://twitter.com/masuda220/status/1712982697654751344) In this sense, object-oriented programming is a method of implementing an abstract data model.
>  A different approach from the data model, which models data in terms of relations.
>  The abstract data model and the relational data model overlap in some areas but do not match in many areas.
>  >masuda220: A module is a set of operations.
>  What kind of operations should be collected in a module? How to describe the specifications (name, pre-conditions, post-conditions) of the operations.
>  Data abstraction, which defines (exposes) a data type as a set of operations, is one of the basic methods of module design.
>  Class and method design is a technique of modularization through data abstraction.
