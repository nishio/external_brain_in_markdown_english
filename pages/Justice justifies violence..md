title: "Justice justifies violence."
---

I was looking up the phrase "[[right]] justifies [[violence]]" and was amused to see it paired with "violence [[creates]] justice."
If we naively believe that violence is evil and justice is good, cognitive dissonance occurs when the two are connected.

> The Right to Resist - Constitutional Authority, Beginning Violence and Justice
>  Constitutional power is, simply put, "the power to create power where there is no power" (and thus, as the German word verfassungsgebende Gewalt implies, it is not "power" at all), violence that creates something out of nothing. There is "[[Creating Justice through Violence]]" and "[[Justification of violence by justice]]" at the same time.
