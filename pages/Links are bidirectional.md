title: "Links are bidirectional"
---

- Linking in [[hypertext]]" is one-way, but approaches to make linking two-way (e.g., backlinks in wikis) emerged rather early on.
- It depends on what kind of information you put on the link, but if you put information that "Record A is related to Record B", it is natural to consider it bidirectional.
- Linkage by "common key phrase occurrence" may involve two or more records
    - Unlike directed graphs, which consider edges to be ordered pairs, hypergraphs, which consider them to be sets with more than two elements, match better.
