            - [[Negative feelings accelerate if not completed.]]

I associate it with the following article
- [This is how my entrepreneurship ended - yet life goes on｜Tai_VR game production｜note](https://note.com/taishi_busido90/n/na0df663a4394)
    - > A few months later, I couldn't get anything satisfactory. I felt something was missing. Even so, when we released the beta version, the response was positive, and we even received an offer from a VR hardware company to release a commercial version of the game. Still, I was not confident about releasing a commercial version as it was, so I continued development. The little money I had was steadily disappearing...
    - > In the fall of 2021, my development work came to a halt again. I think there are many reasons, such as lack of confidence in the game design, lack of technology, and so on. But I knew the real reason. I was not confident in my ability to release anything properly in the three years since I started my business. I also had no confidence in the products I was creating. This lack of confidence was holding me back from developing more and more.
