title: "Blog text generation instead of translation"

The hypothesis by [[blu3mo]] that "it is better to let Scrapbox generate blog-like sentences based on bulleted notes instead of letting it translate" was first published on 2023-06-10.

- I want to improve the [/blu3mo-en](https://scrapbox.io/blu3mo-en)middle of the road.
    - I've been looking for a way to get it to translate well while keeping the bulleted structure, but I'm starting to feel like I no longer need to do that.
    - Maybe it would be better to have it generate blog-like sentences based on bulleted notes.
    - Trying different Prompts:...
- GPT3.5？<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - The link above is GPT4 by mistake, I intend to use 3.5 for actual operation!<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/blu3mo/icon' alt='/villagepump/blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I'm inclined to stop translating at DeepL line by line because it's easier to control but harder to develop afterwards.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/blu3mo/icon' alt='blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>I tried a few more things after that and came up with this: `Convert the style of this personal note from bullet points to cohesive easy-to-read structured paragraphs with [keywords] in English.`
