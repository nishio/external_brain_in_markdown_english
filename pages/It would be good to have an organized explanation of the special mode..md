title: "It would be good to have an organized explanation of the special mode."

- [[special mode]]
- [[object-oriented mode]]

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It would be good to have an organized explanation of the special mode.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "specialized mode" is this "specialized mode"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I myself prefer to use Keichobot's general purpose mode, but I have had sessions with a human coach as a Clean Language client to begin with, I have trained on the coach side myself, and I know what's in the system itself, so I'm in a very knowledge-rich situation. It's not always easy for knowledge poor users to do "everything is free". Oh, this is related to the other day's [[Coloring books and free books]] analogy. So, I created a way to start a purpose-specific session that compares the degree of freedom.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "everything is free" is that "everything is free"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>The user must specify what it is used about in the first move, and since there are no other clues, the program proceeds with the session using only that first statement as a clue. It is quite dependent on the user's ability to create a conversational flow that is beneficial to him or her.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "user" is this "user"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>A user uses Keichobot as stationery. It is natural that the quality of the results of using stationery depends on the user's ability. For example, imagine a magnetic drawing tool, there is a stamp in the shape of a circle for users who cannot draw a circle with a pen that can freely draw lines. In order to reduce dependence on the user's ability, the degree of freedom of the user is reduced.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "Keichobot" is this "Keichobot"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>So, Keichobot, which originally had a high degree of freedom, was given a specialized mode with reduced freedom.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Whether this will make it easier for users to take advantage of Keichobot is only a hypothesis, but I hope it will make it easier to use!
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that "Keichobot"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Hmmm, this question is hard to answer. Talking more about the specialized modes, I think that of the three modes, this time especially the KPT mode would be easier to understand the flow

- Is there anything else you can tell us about this "user"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>👎 User
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that "specialized mode"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Yes, first of all, template-based methods in the world are often rewritten in the form of questions, and if you put a template in the form of a question on Keichobot's system, it becomes a "template that listens back".
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "template" is this "template that listens back"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Ordinary templates are one-way, but Keichobot asks questions about what the user has written. The user can answer the question or ignore it and enter the next item.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What do you hope will happen regarding this "Keichobot"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It would be nice if users could get used to using the specialized mode and then be able to use the general-purpose mode.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to "Keichobot" for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>To be precise, "it would be nice if users could use the general-purpose mode," and for that "users need to get used to using it," and the hypothesis is that "the specialized mode could help them do that.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>As for "Keichobot," can it?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I've gone so far as to add a specialized mode, and I haven't been able to observe whether or not users are accustomed to using it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between that "mode" and "specialized mode"?
