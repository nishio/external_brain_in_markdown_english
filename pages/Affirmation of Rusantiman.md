title: "Affirmation of Rusantiman"
---

- Response to Drucker's [The knowledge society is not a society of bosses and subordinates.
- Drucker says X, but my boss says not X. It's inexcusable."
- Cherry-picking from books the evidence that others are not right.
- Since A, who has the power, is not right, I, who does not have the power, am right."
        - [[Affirmation of one's helplessness]]
        - Composition of [ressentiment
- Only using knowledge gained from books to criticize others, not to transform behavior.
- Drucker himself said [Knowledge must be proven by deeds.
- When you are in such a state of twisted lusantiman, no matter how much you read and gather knowledge, you will not use it in a useful way, so it's sterile.
    - Repeat the pattern of "this book says so and so, and it's inexcusable that he doesn't follow it".
    - The more you do that, the more people around you will leave you.
