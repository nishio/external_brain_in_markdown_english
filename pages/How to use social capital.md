title: "How to use social capital"

2018-04-30
I have talked about how [[monetary capital]] goes away when you spend it, [[knowledge capital]] doesn't go away when you spend it, and [[SOC]] requires a knack for using it, but if you use it well, it increases. #Money goes away when you spend it.

- When there is a demand D and a supply S, value is created by an intermediary M who knows both and causes them to combine.
- In the case of commodity trading, M corresponds to the market.
- In that case, the commodity is separated from the producer and distributed independently.
- However, knowledge, especially knowledge in the sense of solution capability rather than information, cannot be distributed separately from people.
- Similarly, for a variety of reasons, demand on the demand side can often not be distributed in isolation from the consumers
- Therefore, there is a type of transaction in the world in which neither a market in which "suppliers display their products and consumers buy them" nor a market in which "consumers post jobs and suppliers apply for them" can be used.
- Just as markets create value by creating [[lubrication]] for commodity transactions, so providing lubrication for that type of transaction is value creation.
- In this case, the intermediary M is the supplier in the form of [[matching]] value provision.

    - If we design the system so that intangible capital is attracted to M in exchange for providing that value, positive feedback will turn around.
    - What are the conditions and how to design them are the current concerns
    - I think it's a requirement that after the D and S transaction occurs, there should be an increase in Happiness for both parties.
        - Because trust in intermediary M will decrease if the transaction does not lead to a positive outcome.
        - Therefore, the act of introducing S to D, to anyone, lowers D's trust.
        - On the other hand, if you introduce a not-so-good D to S, it lowers S's trust in you.
        - So M needs to do its best to [[scrutinize screening]] and [[filter]] out the participants who are not good.
