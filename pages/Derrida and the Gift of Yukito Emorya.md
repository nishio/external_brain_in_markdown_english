The discussions of gift-giving by [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Gyojin Karatani]], while having different philosophical backgrounds and goals, have important intersections.

Derrida's theory of gift:
- Derrida's discussion of gift-giving revolves around the contradiction that gifts are not essentially gratuitous. He argued that pure giving is impossible because the moment a gift is made, it is recognized and an obligation of return or gratitude arises. For Derrida, giving is always an impossible act, and this impossibility shapes the essence of giving.

Yukito Emorya's Theory of Gifts:
- On the other hand, Yukito Karatani analyzes giving through the concept of "modes of exchange. He examines how different modes of exchange, such as gift-giving, exchange, and money, function within a social and economic structure. Emaya points out that while gifts strengthen solidarity within a community and contribute to social stability, they also have the aspect of reproducing power relations because of the obligation to return the gift.
