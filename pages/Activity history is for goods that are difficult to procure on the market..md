title: "Activity history is for goods that are difficult to procure on the market."

Ten years of [[Activity History]] takes ten years to make.
Cannot be created later when demand arises.
- Money cannot be procured from the market.
    - For individuals
    - For the organization, "We are pleased to have Mr. X, who has been active in ~ for many years, join our membership!" can be a game play that says
        - This is [[market procurement]].
        - It has some foil effect, but I think most people think of it as just Mr. X's personal activities.
- So it's a source of [[competitive edge]].
    - [[Goods belonging to individuals]].
    - Whether "the content of the activity can be attributed to an individual" for individual individuals and activities depends on the circumstances.
    - There are situations that can be attributed, but people don't.
    - Some people [[manage information in a messy and scattered way]].

I learned something like that from [[Contemporary Art Business]].
- > Creating an archive Working to historicize art Making history by documenting Making history by documenting Making history by documenting Making history by documenting Making history by documenting history Practicing Historicism Consciously

- [[Difficult-to-procure resources]]
[[Difficult to procure on the market]].
