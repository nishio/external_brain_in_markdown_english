title: "Comfort zone with high consistency"
---

- I'm relieved that the [[integrity]] of what I've thought about is high.
- I feel like I'm being thought of correctly.
    - Create [confidence (in oneself)
- But that may just be a distraction from less consistent information.
    - It may be the mindset of staying in the [[comfort zone]].
