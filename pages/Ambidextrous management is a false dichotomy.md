title: "Ambidextrous management is a false dichotomy"
---

Since "ambidextrous management" is a metaphor for hands, it's easy to imagine "there are two, and two is all."
If the two hands are "leveraging existing markets" and "exploring new markets," then there's at least three arms because the company also needs to "explore knowledge not yet connected to the market. There may be more.

Of course, what I originally wanted to say was "not one", but that would be misinterpreted as "two and all". Then the question becomes, "Which of the two is this department?" which would result in [[choosing the wrong two options]].
