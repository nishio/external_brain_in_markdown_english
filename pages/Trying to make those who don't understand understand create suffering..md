- Thoughts on [[Buddha]] in [Sanyuttha Nikaya 6.1.1

Suppose Mr. A explains something to Mr. B and Mr. B fails to understand it.
- What Mr. A wants Mr. B to understand
    - This is [[greed]].
        - [I want others to behave the way I want them to behave.
    - This greed creates [[suffering]] for Mr. A.
    - So Mr. A should avoid it.

- [[Desire to be understood]]

    - [[Don't ask those in front of you to understand.]]
    - [[I don't care what I can't control.]]
