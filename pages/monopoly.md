- [[Management Games]]. The player rolls the dice in a backgammon-like manner to advance the board, and can buy real estate in the squares where he or she stops, and the person who stops in that square pays a fixed amount of rent. By buying up land of the same color, the rent doubles, and furthermore, by investing in a hotel or other facilities on top of the land, the rent goes up and up and up. A similar concept was later developed in [[Momotaro Dentetsu (Japanese railway system)]].

If you cannot pay the rent, you can borrow money from the bank by first mortgaging the land. If that is no longer possible, sell the property.

Because it is an analog game, unlike Momotaro Dentetsu, it allows for free negotiation. Land exchange is an obvious example, but it is possible to take land in exchange for rent, or to make a contract that exempts you from paying rent.

Games to learn about monopolies [[economies of scale]], capital investment [[reproduction on an enlarged or expanded scale]], liquidity of cash, understanding the needs of the other party and negotiating with them, etc.
