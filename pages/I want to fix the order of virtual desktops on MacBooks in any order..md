I want to fix the order of [[virtual desktop]] on my MacBook freely.

2019/5/30　from  [[Mac Diary 2019]]
- I want to work with the browser, VSCode, and React in this order with a three-finger swipe to move around, but it rearranges itself.

- Automatic reordering of operation space" is turned off.
        - I didn't know it was called [[Operating space]].

    - [[Mission Control]]

2022/11/24 Did this on a new machine.
- It's confusing when the order changes on its own.
