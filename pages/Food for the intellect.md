title: "Food for the intellect"
---

In saving money, it is more efficient to cut major expenses than to cut minor living expenses. But when you get right down to it, does it make sense to cut spending on things that "won't kill you if you don't have them," such as books, in order to live a minimum life without starving? Even if the body is alive, the intellect is as good as dead from starvation. I am troubled by such comments.

No, I'm talking about whether or not to buy a new MacBook.
