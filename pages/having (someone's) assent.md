>  In [[phenomenology]], every act of cognition is a "[[subjective certainty]]" of the living world by the subject. The act of questioning and clarifying the "conditions and structure of the establishment of [[confidence]]" that makes the living world appear to you is called [[phenomenological reduction]].

> The basic idea of phenomenology is to clearly confirm the structure of how our perception of the world is formed. It is not a question of whether a certain perception is correct or not, but rather a question of the structure of our beliefs. By doing so, we can understand why differences emerge among different perceptions, and under what conditions a common understanding can be widely created. This is the basic idea.
