On "people who see value in what others see value in."

- I thought I wrote something about [People who value what others value.

The theme of "people who find value in what others find valuable" (i.e., mentality that leaves value judgments to the "receiver" side and uses others' evaluations as criteria for happiness and decision-making)

- [[Value is determined by the receiver, not the sender.]]
- Knowledge itself has no value. Value is created only when there is someone who seeks it and pays for it.
- The lecture explains the structure of leaving the value of one's output entirely to the "receiver" and the dangers of such a structure. Citing the example of game strategy information, he explains that "it is difficult to generate rewards if the information is buried in areas where others do not perceive value.

- [[The measure of happiness becomes "how you are valued by others.]]
- He warns, "If you don't do what you love, before you know it, the evaluation of others will become the measure of your happiness.
- When we live by the "receiver's standard," we lose our independence because we wait for others to evaluate our entire behavior.
- What you like = The more value you have in your own standards, the freer you are from evaluation dependence.
- This page is really a memo summarizing the risks posed by those who find value in what others find valuable.

Interviews (coverage of how engineers are hired and learn)
- [Principles of technology that engineers should learn with Yasukazu Nishio of "The Technology Behind Coding"｜High-Class Job Hunting and Recruiting Information Site AMBI ([https://en-ambi.com/itcontents/entry/2018/04/24/110000/?utm_)](https://en-ambi.com/itcontents/entry/2018/04/24/110000/?utm_)) source=chatgpt.com]
- Nishio-san for new engineers.
- If you pursue the same field of study because "everyone else is studying it," you will always end up following suit. The knowledge of those who have dug up interesting topics on their own is the only knowledge that has value in exchange.
- He explains that simply riding the "fad" (what others perceive as valuable) will reduce scarcity and ultimately not lead to the creation of value.

Contrastive note: People who value the existence of differences.
- In a related note, "[Innovation cannot be planned, but people who are likely to generate innovation can be nurtured. The article recommends that people should not rush into easy-to-understand evaluation axes, but rather develop a niche. Here, Mr. Nishio organizes the attitude that is opposite to the "recipient standard" dependence and compares the characteristics of the two.

If you want to dig deeper, you can combine multiple words in the Scrapbox search field, such as "others," "evaluation," "happiness," etc., to see a list of surrounding notes (e.g., "[[desire for approval]]," "[[average orientation is the worst environment]]," etc.).
