title: "Nishida Philosophy 3"
---

The main points of Dr. Kitaro Nishida's paper in response to Dr. Tsuda's critique can be summarized as follows.

- Knowledge has various positions and orders, and [[perceiving objective objects]] and [[reflecting on subjective actions]] are not the same. Kant's [[pure synthesis]] was not just [[logical subjectivity]], but [[the unity of perception and thought]].
- [[Willful experience]], like perception, is a direct given, and as we deepen the position of [[subjectivity of perception]], we can see more [[object world]] than [[natural world]]. [[Awareness of will]] is deeper than [[intellectual awareness]], and [[the object world of will]] is constituted by [[cognitive subjectivity]] that is deeper than [[the natural world]].
- True cognitive subjectivity is [[the unity of thought and intuition in the broad sense]], not mere [[formal judgment subjectivity]]. Nishida calls it "[[Location]]" and considers it a [[transcendental predicate surface]] that becomes a predicate and not a subject.
- A place is neither a being nor a nothing, but [[a general person for whom judgmental knowledge is established]]. Behind the concrete general person there must be a further place as [[the reflective general person]]. Finally, beyond conceptual limitation is "[[The Place of Nothingness]]," where one sees oneself.
- Nishida's position is epistemological, not metaphysical. He goes beyond the [[Rikkert]]-style position of judgment subjectivity, starting from the judgment consciousness itself, and tries to clarify the formation of [[subject-object opposition]] and the meaning of [[know]].

This is a detailed explanation of the concept of "place," which forms the basis of Nishida's philosophy, in response to Dr. Tsuda's criticisms. This is a remarkable essay in which Nishida's unique speculations are developed from the standpoint of epistemology, transcending the subject-object conflict and reexamining the deep meaning of knowing.
