- [[IT got boring.]]

> [ktgohan](https://x.com/ktgohan/status/1825196062757577032) IT boring argument, there's a fair chance that it's a [[throw away line]] of my [[who's lost their place]], and it's not about technical skills, etc., but a bit more on another level. I think it's not about technical skills, etc., but something else that's lurking in the background. In short, it's not really about IT.

I'm thinking of X as a variable, but it would be valid to assign X as an SNS.
