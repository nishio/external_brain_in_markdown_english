Over 50 experiments over the past 30 years have consistently shown that nominal brainstorming, which involves no communication at all, generates greater quantity and quality of ideas than verbal [[brainstorming]], but computer-mediated brainstorming is even better than nominal brainstorming when there are a large number of members. Brainstorming is even better than nominal brainstorming when the number of members is large.

This may be due to the fact that each person is given a PC, so there is no blocking of output; the ability to read back logs at any time eliminates the cognitive cost of remembering the flow of existing conversations; and the anonymity of the speaker eliminates the risk of being ridiculed for outlandish opinions.

The results did not differ from the NOMINAL for a team of 6, but exceeded the NOMINAL for a team of 12. Several other experiments have been reported in which the number of participants must be somewhat large to show a difference.
