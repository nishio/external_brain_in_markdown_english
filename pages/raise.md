raise
I was thinking in relation to "[[raising]] the stakes in poker" ([[raise]]) regarding the Omoikane project's recent moves.
- When asked why the raise, the language was better.
- In short, "whether or not it will be adopted" is a future indeterminate fact, and since it is difficult to control it now, the only thing to do is to "[[leave]] luck to the heavens.
- My initial image of this situation was "we'll move in earnest after it's adopted."
- But [/omoikane/ Let's start without waiting for the results](https://scrapbox.io/omoikane/ Let's start without waiting for the results), and I felt that the return if adopted would certainly be greater if we started first.
- On the other hand, this is "raising the poker multiplier" because it is increasing the cost payments
