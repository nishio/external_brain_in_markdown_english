title: "TOTAL REVIEW"
---

- [[A "super" introduction to task management to end "To-Do Hell]]  p.198

- Many people fail to do regular reviews, such as weekly.
- Difficult to conduct regular reviews in the first place
- Reviews are an end, not a means.
- So if the purpose of the review is to successfully turn the daily tasks around, then there's no need for a review.
- There is no need to ritualize the unnecessary, and there is no need to feel guilty about not being able to perform the ritual.
    - Related [[Ritualization of Means]].
- Just do a review when problems arise in your daily routine.
- We call this an abortive review, a metaphor for an abortive medication taken when symptoms arise.
