title: "developmentally oriented organization"
---

- Military-style instruction was [[top down]] with "[[what you will learn]]" and "[[correct]]" and members were expected to learn it

- The idea of "[[Lean Startup]]" and others was that the "right answer" was unknown and the organization had to find it.
    - There is "something to learn" about whether "customers exist," and the organization and its members don't know the outcome.
    - So we have to ask the market and "learn" fast.

- This is [[single-loop]] learning. [[agilis]] argued that single-loop learning alone is not enough.
    - > Single-loop learning is to solve problems according to a framework of ideas and actions that is already in place. Double-loop learning means abandoning the existing framework and incorporating a new framework of ideas and actions. The concept was proposed by American organizational psychologists Chris Argillis and Donald Schoen in 1978 in "Organizational Learning. Organizations have difficulty surviving and adapting to their environment through single-loop learning alone. It must unlearn its own stereotypes of past successes, double-loop learn new knowledge and frameworks from the outside, and then repeat and reinforce them again through single-loop learning. It is said that only organizations that can continue this cycle repeatedly can maintain their competitive advantage.

- The [[Learning Organization]] or [[U-theory]] is how to do this double-loop learning. The first step in double-loop learning is to cross the [[stereotype]] barrier ([[VOJ]], Voice of Justice in U-theory), or in other words, [[self-renovation]].

    - [[developmentally oriented organization]] aims to enable its members to transform themselves

- Cybozu] is a good example of a developmentally oriented organization in Japan" ([[U-theory]], "Why are organizations that can show each other their weaknesses strong?
