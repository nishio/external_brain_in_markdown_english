The author of "Ajin" has left the company, and the artist is now working on the next installment.
> [DividedSelf_94](https://twitter.com/DividedSelf_94/status/1731239909225382330) Subhuman is an unusual manga in that the original author suddenly left the board and the artist had to come up with the entire story from the middle of the manga. The style of the manga changed in the middle of the story, and it became more and more interesting with a Hollywood flavor, which is probably the artist's hobby.

> [DividedSelf_94](https://twitter.com/DividedSelf_94/status/1731239910999507017) It's interesting to see how the artist's brushwork starts to take off along the way.

> [DividedSelf_94](https://twitter.com/DividedSelf_94/status/1731307285421666385) I wouldn't say the main character's personality is 180 degrees, but it's about 120 degrees different from the beginning to the end. I mean, most of the characters clearly change their personalities from the middle of the story.
>  The "accident" makes it a unique and tasty manga. The "accident" gives the manga a unique flavor.

> [DividedSelf_94](https://twitter.com/DividedSelf_94/status/1731308654421491720) The author's "Ajin" is a very disgusting manga in which all the characters, including the main character, are scum, but the artist is the exact opposite. As a result, it is a miraculous work that started out as a very strong manga, but gradually became more and more exciting in a royal road style.

> [DividedSelf_94](https://twitter.com/DividedSelf_94/status/1731309208354935073) I'm not saying it's the author's fault, but it was the foundation of the original work that was censored that made the final part of the film so much fun. So it's all good! I'm just saying that it's all good!

>  I think there are a surprisingly large number of people who are concerned about this.

> [ggggggggggggero](https://twitter.com/ggggggggggero/status/913002629374001153) This probably depends entirely on the piece.
>  In the case of Zainin, the original author was there from episodes 0~5.
>  My role at this stage is almost exclusively drawing.
>  We take the original author's rough name and make it into a complete name, and then draw it.

> [ggggggggggggero](https://twitter.com/ggggggggggero/status/913002816511397888) (The one that looks like it's on the omake page of Bakuman. It's the kind of thing you'd find on the omake page of)
>  I'm just a person who draws pictures, especially unless an editor or an original writer says something like, "What can you do about this?" I'm just a person who draws pictures, especially unless I'm asked something like "What can you do about this?

> [ggggggggggggero](https://twitter.com/ggggggggggero/status/913003269785501696) (So at this point you have never met the original author.
>  We would get a name and just draw it, so it was fine if we didn't meet each other.
>  I actually met him only once, after he got off subhuman, when we ran into each other at a totally unrelated place and greeted each other. ↓ ...

> [ggggggggggggggero](https://twitter.com/ggggggggggero/status/913004012026306560) I often get the impression that we've broken up a fight, but there's no time to fight itself.
>  More to the point, I don't know exactly why Mr. Miura came to the decision to step down.
>  I'm a lax person, so I didn't specifically ask. ↓ ...

> [ggggggggggggero](https://twitter.com/ggggggggggero/status/913004187008434176) Writers are human beings, and I am sure they had unavoidable circumstances at the time.
>  When we met, you said you were sorry it had come to this.
>  He seemed very sincere.)

> [ggggggggggggero](https://twitter.com/ggggggggggero/status/913004371901784065) back to the story
>  So I'm not so sure I'm in touch with the content of episodes 0-5.
>  For example, I made the rules for the IBM to IBM fight.
>  At the stage of Mr. Miura's name, there were no clear rules.
>  IBM's characteristics are what I suggested.

> [ggggggggggggero](https://twitter.com/ggggggggggero/status/913004521256763393) And what about after episode 5?
>  This is really a blank slate.
>  The only thing that was initially decided was that it would start out as an escape type and then become more and more of a battle. ↓↓

> [ggggggggggggero](https://twitter.com/ggggggggggero/status/913004895963193344) I thought Mr. Miura is a good storyteller who "makes various things happen more and more anyway without thinking later". The great thing is that the setting can change during the serialization. That makes for an exciting story. That is the most attractive point of Mr. Miura's storytelling, isn't it?

> [ggggggggggggero](https://twitter.com/ggggggggggero/status/913005186964008961) But this is the way to make it because of Mr. Miura,
>  I don't have that kind of storytelling style. ↓ ...

> [ggggggggggggggggero](https://twitter.com/ggggggggggero/status/913005466774495232) As of episode 6 when I was told I was going down and it was suddenly decided that I would even be in charge of the original story.
>  So we needed to think in broad strokes about everything that was going to happen.
>  So you thought at that time about the answers to the foreshadowing up to that point, what the subhumans and IBM were and other detailed settings, and what kind of people the characters were and what kind of pasts they had. ↓↓.

> [ggggggggggggero](https://twitter.com/ggggggggggero/status/913005898015981568) (That's why Miura's name is not in the book after volume 2.
>  Mr. Miura himself seems to be a man of integrity, saying "I didn't write it, so you don't have to publish it.

> [ggggggggggggero](https://twitter.com/ggggggggggero/status/913006297548709888) This is the kind of distribution between the original author and the person in charge of the drawing in the subjunctive.
>  I think it totally depends on the work.
>  I also don't think this trend of changing the author of Ajin is particularly unusual in the manga industry. ↓ ...

> [ggggggggggggero](https://twitter.com/ggggggggggero/status/913006534149337088) Well, it would be such a long story if I explained in detail the distribution between the original author and the drawing staff.
>  So I think it's in your best interest to enjoy the manga without worrying about who is drawing it or anything.
