> [kmizu](https://twitter.com/kmizu/status/1664424417374638080) I'm starting to see more and more software engineers, including myself, who are around age > 35, saying and doing things that concern "[[am I]] not an old man?".
>  I suppose it will slow down the "[[aging population combined with the elderly]]" to some extent, but I wonder how long it will last.

> [kmizu](https://twitter.com/kmizu/status/1664484075191820289) One answer is to give up and accept that you will eventually become [[problems caused by the elderly (esp. gerontocracy, and elderly people's control over the young)]]. One answer is that we should accept ourselves to become [[problems caused by the elderly (esp. gerontocracy, and elderly people's control over the young)]], and it may not be so hard to see.

> [podhmo](https://twitter.com/podhmo/status/1664428785826144258) [[aging population combined with the elderly]] is caused by the flow that makes responses to questions by referring to [[cache in the brain]]. I have an image that this will be completed when this [[discrepancy between cache and reality]] can no longer be ignored.

If they can afford it, but they don't relearn what they have learned in the past and just refer to vague memories, they are likely to become [[problems caused by the elderly (esp. gerontocracy, and elderly people's control over the young)]]. It would be bad if the examples you mention are only from the past.
- [[Time is a luxury that makes you an old man]].
- [[If you don't relearn, you'll become an old man]].

>
> It would be similar to part of [[anger management]] and would require attempts to avoid [[response by reflection]] and [[automatic thinking]]. By the way, if you do that in all directions, you will lose [[time]] and the bomb will explode.

> [podhmo](https://twitter.com/podhmo/status/1664430907418382336) [[If you lose your hesitation, you may be an old man]] self-knowledge, but if you fix the self-knowledge that [[hesitation]] is always there as a cache and refer to this move If you do this, you are likely to become an old person.
>
>  But is the progression really halted? There is always a concern that it is not good for our mental health and we may not be able to afford it.

    - If you keep repeating the response of "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry" in a consultative way, it's going to be harmful.
- > I wonder if it's that kind of [[immediacy]] that's required in some cases and that's what you're talking about (pro-gamers).
