- I'm using AirPlay to skip the screen, so I'm only getting 1080 horizontal.
- If you buy [this](https://www.apple.com/jp/shop/product/MJ1K2AM/A/usb-c-digital-av-multiport%E3%82%A2%E3%83%80%E3%83%97%E3%82%BF), it looks like you can get it for 3840.
    - However, if you simply put it out at that size, the letters are unreadable.
    - I can pinch out to zoom in, so that could be considered fine.
- Physical stickies can be lined up 13 horizontally and 9 vertically.
