> I think the real problem is [[it is easier to look at the ugly than to imagine the beautiful]]. It seems to me that most of the people who created beautiful things went on to fix what they thought was ugly. Someone looks at something and thinks: "[[I can do it better]]." This is probably the genesis of great work...

>  It is not enough to not tolerate ugliness. In order to get the olfactory sense [[to know where to fix things]], you have to have a good understanding of the field. You have to study it well. But once you become proficient in the field, an inner voice will whisper. "What a hack! There has to be a better way. Don't ignore this voice. Pursue it. A demanding palate and the ability to satisfy it. That's the recipe for great work.
