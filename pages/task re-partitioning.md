title: "task re-partitioning"
---

from [[Hatena2009-11-05]]
There are many books out there on how to manage tasks and so on, but reading them does not make it possible. Just as teaching a child how to ride a spinning wheel will not suddenly make the child learn to ride a spinning wheel, it is necessary to think about how to make the child learn, not how to manage.
I've heard a lot about how people grow as human beings when they have children, but maybe that's because they literally think about how to help them learn a skill they have no prerequisite knowledge of.

> @tokoroten I need a task management software that can [[redistribute]] tasks.　I have TODOs of various granularities in one TODO list, so I can't prioritize them.　 If we can redistribute TODOs and make them primitive, then they can become automatons and the tasks will get done.
- I used to think "I want a task management tool that supports task breakdowns," but I think the essential mistake is that "people who don't have the skills to output the information in bullet points of the appropriate granularity for the management tool" are using "a restrictive editor that only allows bullet points. Now I use a regular text editor.
- Also, having only one task list is a mistake. If you write a list of things that need to be done today, including tasks that do not need to be done today but will be done someday, you will be distracted and unable to concentrate on the task.
- > Ah, there it is.　And the task to be done today is a pain in the ass, and the easy task to be done tomorrow is executed.
- If your ability to control your concentration is weak, when you receive a lot of information, you will become confused because you will not know which one to pay attention to. It is important to reduce the amount of information that enters your eyes.
