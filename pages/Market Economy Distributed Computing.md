p.395  [[radical market]]
>  To understand how [[(the) market (as a concept)]] solves "very large systems of equations," you need to know two key ideas: "[[distributed computing]]" and "[[parallel processing]]. In such systems, complex computations that cannot be performed by a single computer are broken into smaller parts that can be processed in parallel by many computers distributed in geographically distant locations. While it is well known that distributed computing and parallel processing have contributed significantly to the development of "[[cloud computing]]," the largest application area has been overlooked. That area is the [[market economy]] itself.
