title: "Trash collection of information that is not worth the hassle."

> The act of web clipping, in particular, is a great way to feel that you have done something even though you are not processing any information, and what it brings about is [[making a house into a garbage dump]].
> If it takes a little effort to make a page, "[[I don't feel like putting even a little effort into it...]]", you're not making any progress in [[intellectual production]] at all, and in fact It's getting harder and harder to make progress.

- [Efficiently handling tasks would implement a fast fucking application.
- Mechanical web clipping efficiently creates "[[isolated pages]]" that have no useful connection to other pages.
- The value of the knowledge network will diminish as more and more isolated pages are added efficiently.

Isn't it wrong to mechanically create isolated pages, but not to spend time connecting those isolated pages?
- You can clip "I'm curious about something" and it can be connected after the fact.
- It is not always possible to find a good "[[connection]]" from the beginning.
- But [[rereading]] is necessary to "discover the connection after the fact"
    - Is it the same point that "it's pointless to collect information that isn't worth reading again?"
- Even if you haven't found the connection at this point, you may want to take the trouble to add an [[Open Link]] to make it easier to find.

Possibly a chicken and egg
- When a person who has some [[knowledge network]] in his brain passes information through that "net," he "[gets entangled in (a problem)."
    - This is the discovery of "connection
- Discovering connections may be difficult for those with underdeveloped knowledge networks
- What to do in such cases?
    - Once you have gathered enough information to make a list, make sticky notes and move them around while making the list, and move the ones that "seem to be related to this one" closer to the sticky notes.
    - Move it and then ask, "What kind of relationship?" Put the relationship into words by thinking about
        - [[List, move, and verbalize relationships after the fact]]

suggestion
- It's better not to read "quoted and not retweeted retweets" that you don't feel like taking the time to do a single step.
