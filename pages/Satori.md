In English, it's usually translated as "enlightenment" or "awakening."

In [[Zen Buddhism]], a school of [[Mahayana Buddhism]] that developed in Japan, satori describes a profound and [[sudden understanding]], the experience of seeing into one's true nature. This moment of enlightenment is characterized by a clear and intimate realization of the nature of existence, the understanding of the interconnectedness of all things, and the shedding of illusions and misconceptions about the self and the world.

Satori is seen as the ultimate goal of [[Zen]] practice, and it involves a profound shift in perception that transcends ordinary logical reasoning. It's not something that can be achieved through intellectual understanding alone, but through a direct, intuitive insight often achieved after years of [[meditation]] and [[mindfulness]] practices.

It's important to note that while the concept of satori originates from Buddhism, its understanding and interpretation can vary significantly among different Buddhist schools and even among individuals. As such, it is a deeply personal and subjective experience, making it difficult to fully convey in words.
