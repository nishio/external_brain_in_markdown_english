- Talking about [[I want to rebuild Regroup.]], maybe we should create a [[Network of demand requests]] first.

I recently talked about [[Interference Effects of Ideas]] in another case, but in short, if you have a "specific requirement" and from that "an idea of how to solve it" is born as a primary idea, and you wait until it gains stability and comprehensiveness before implementing it, rather than implementing it right away, it may be a good idea. It may be better to wait until stability and comprehensiveness are achieved before implementing it.
