<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The distinction between [[schizo]] (schizoid) and [[parano]] (paranoid) in [[Asada Akira]]'s "[[Fugitive Theory]]" is based on the theories of the French philosophers [[Gilles Deleuze.]] and [[Felix Guattari]]. In particular, it is the background for the concepts developed in their work "[[Anti-Oedipus]]." In their exploration of [[the relationship between society and the individual]], Deleuze and Guattari used the approach of schizoanalysis, contrasting the concepts of [[schizo]] (schizoid) and [[parano]] (paranoid). These are used as metaphors for understanding society and the individual beyond the clinical diagnosis of mental illness.

Schizo (schizoid)
Schizo is characterized by [[fluid]] and [[open identity]], [[non-hierarchical organization]], and an uninterrupted flow of desire. From this perspective, schizo-like beings are not bound by fixed social statuses, roles, or unitary truths and meanings, but rather by diverse possibilities. The schizo approach emphasizes creativity and change, with the power to create new forms of life that transcend constraints and limitations.

Parano (paranoid)
In contrast, paranoids seek [[order]], [[control]], [[consistency]] and often rely on [[exclusive identities]] or [[fixed structures]]. Paranoid entities may view the [[external world]] as hostile or threatening and attempt to defend against or control it. In this perspective, the world is interpreted in [[the dichotomy of friend or foe]] and reality may be distorted through delusions or illusions of persecution.

Application in Akira Asada's "Fugitive Theory"
Akira Asada uses these concepts as a metaphor for the relationship between individuals and power, the possibility of self-realization, and "[[escape]]" from social constraints and norms in contemporary society. In his interpretation, [[schizoic escape]] is understood as an attempt to seek new forms and expressions of life through deviations from the existing order and systems of meaning. In contrast, [[paranoic escapism]] is seen as arising from adherence to existing systems and power structures and an attempt to protect them.

Through this distinction, Asada explores various strategies and attitudes for transcending the social and cultural constraints faced by individuals and the possibilities of freedom and creativity in contemporary society.
