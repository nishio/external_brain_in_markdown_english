- [[Intellectual Production of Engineers Before and After]] to [[Have Claude 3 Opus summarize]].

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This document is a transcript and related information of the lecture "Intellectual Production Techniques of Engineers Before and After" by Yasukazu Nishio.

The main flow of the lecture will be as follows
- The importance of [[intellectual production]] when Nishio wrote [[Technology Supporting Coding]], which was published in 2013.
- That a chapter on intellectual production was attempted to be included in "Technologies Supporting Coding," but was cut for editorial reasons, and a portion of it was published as a column instead.
- The column led to the writing of a feature article "[[How engineers learn]]" in WEB+DB PRESS magazine.
- The feature article led to the writing and publication of a book titled "[[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]].
- The response to the publication of "The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production" and the idea of publishing its contents in [[Scrapbox]], a [[Network-like information representation]].
- The creation of an English-language version of the same book to convey the importance of intellectual production techniques to engineers in English-speaking countries.
- Finally, Nishio introduced his Scrapbox page and announced that he would be taking questions from the floor.

This is the main content flow of the transcript. Mr. Nishio discusses his experiences when he wrote "The Technology Behind Coding," leading up to the publication of "The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production," and how it has developed since then.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The lecture itself contains many elements of the intellectual production techniques advocated by Nishio.

- The fact that he has compiled the knowledge he gained from his experience writing "The Technology Behind Coding" into a new book entitled "The Intellectual Production of Engineers. This applies to the intellectual production process of verbalizing and systematizing one's own experiences.
- The fact that they are carefully collecting and analyzing feedback after the publication of "The Intellectual Production Techniques of Engineers" and applying the findings to their next actions (e.g., creating an English version, publishing on Scrapbox, etc.). This can be said to be a cycle of incorporating feedback and improving output.
- The lecture itself is also an act of verbalizing the process and results of one's own intellectual production and outputting them to the audience. This allows you to obtain feedback from the audience, which can lead to a further cycle of intellectual production.
- The suggestion at the end of the presentation to encourage questions from the audience and to use Twitter hashtags is a way to lower the psychological hurdle to output and promote interaction.

Thus, not only the content of the lecture, but also the act of giving the lecture itself can be seen as a practical example of Nishio's intellectual production techniques. He verbalizes his findings, outputs them, receives feedback, and connects them to the cycle of further intellectual production. This process can be seen in this lecture.

- [[Linguization of Experience]], [[Systematization of Experience]]
- [[Gathering feedback]], [[Improvement Cycle]], [[Opportunity to get feedback]].
- [[reduce psychological hurdles to output]], [[facilitate interaction]].
