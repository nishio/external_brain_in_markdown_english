title: "Programming is the process of expressing what you need to think about"
---

>  Programming is the process of clarifying [[what to think]], expressing it in [[the listener's language]], checking that the message is conveyed correctly, and refining the expression until the listener is able to think for you.
>  Generally, the "listener" is a computer, not a human, and the "language of the listener" was [[programming language]] until ChatGPT appeared in 2022.
Translation from [[Programming is the process of articulating what needs to be thought about]]
