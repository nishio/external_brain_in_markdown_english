I had AI read past discussions regarding "AI will take jobs" and "No, AI will not take jobs."

- [[AI will not take jobs.]]  2017-11-20
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>Summary observations:
- Past discussions ("AI will not take jobs; those who can use AI will take jobs from those who cannot") focused on the "human-to-human" competitive relationship, viewing AI only as a tool to be used by humans. However, new data indicates that there are cases in which specific business areas themselves are shrinking and demand is disappearing from the market. Rather than "those who can use AI" taking jobs away from "those who cannot use AI," the automation and substitution of AI itself is causing an increase in the number of tasks that do not require human intervention in the first place.
- The two are not necessarily exclusive. Past perspectives emphasized the disparity between human competition and the use of technology. The new analysis, on the other hand, focuses on the structural changes in work due to technological progress, i.e., the quantitative reduction and redefinition of work itself. A better interpretation is,
- AI can be a tool for competitive advantage among humans, though,
    - In certain task areas, substitution and compression are progressing to the extent that "work done by humans" itself is being reduced,
    - Beyond the human-to-human discussion of "who will master AI," the definition and scope of work itself could be reconfigured.
In other words, a more comprehensive understanding can be achieved by taking into account that efficiency gains from AI can transform not only simple "human competition" but also the entire industrial structure through "demand disappearance.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>Summary:
- In past articles, the expression "AI taking jobs" was used as a "low resolution" and focused on competition among humans (those who can handle AI vs. those who cannot). There, the composition of the situation is that those who can take advantage of AI will capture more jobs through efficiency gains, while non-users will be at a disadvantage. On the other hand, the new perspective suggests that advances in AI are shrinking "demand in specific areas," and in some cases, jobs themselves are disappearing from the market. In other words, there is a development in which not only "those who can master AI will win," but also AI will render some jobs unnecessary, and the number of "jobs performed by humans" itself will decrease.
A better interpretation:
- The two are not exclusive. The composition of "[[people who are proficient in AI taking jobs from the weak]]" is correct in many situations, but it emphasizes "[[redistribution]] among humans. On the other hand, new data indicate that there is also a phenomenon of "[[a]] reduction in the demand for work itself" before "[[redistribution]]". A more comprehensive understanding is that the transformation of work due to AI is
    - Realign human competition in some areas (AI users outperforming non-users),
    - At the same time, certain work areas themselves are being reduced or eliminated (more work that does not require humans).
- It is necessary to recognize the dual structure of the two. By taking an integrated view of both, we will be able to understand the impact of AI on the labor market with a higher resolution.

- [[Separate "jobs" in "AI takes jobs" into "problems" and "solutions.]]  2023-04-03
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>Summary:
- This other article does not simply accept the statement that "AI will take jobs," but offers a perspective that divides "jobs" into "problems (demand)" and "solutions (supply)." When AI increases productivity on the "solution" side, the unit cost of solutions falls, but if the quantity of "problems" to be solved does not increase, surplus "solvers" However, if the quantity of "problems" to be solved does not increase, there will be no work for the surplus "solvers," leading to a price decline and a shakeout. On the other hand, if the quantity of demand (problems) is sufficient, the increase in productivity will rather stimulate the supply side, creating a virtuous cycle in which more problems can be solved. In other words, the impact on "jobs" is determined by the balance between the increase in productivity due to AI and the increase or decrease in problems (demand) in response to that increase.
Which is correct or is there a better interpretation?
- While previous discussions have focused on "competition between those who can and cannot use AI" and "the disappearance of demand for jobs themselves," this article adopts an economic perspective of the relationship between "demand (problem)" and "supply (solution). This provides a new resolution and a clue to a more complex understanding of labor market changes caused by AI.
- A better interpretation is,
    - The efficiency gains from AI are not merely limited to competition among humans or a reduction in existing demand,
    - It is necessary to take into account that various patterns (falling prices, increasing demand, redistribution, etc.) can emerge depending on the "problem-solution" supply-demand relationship.
- In other words, there are areas where AI will increase supply capacity, thereby increasing "problems," and conversely, there are areas where demand will not increase and a surplus will be created, leading to a selection process. Together, these multiple interpretations provide a more comprehensive and high-resolution understanding of the relationship between AI and work.

- [[AI takes jobs that could be done wrong.]]  2022-08-10
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>Summary:
- This other article points out that AI excels in areas where "it doesn't matter if you're wrong". While programs (traditional software) have automated accuracy-oriented tasks where mistakes are not allowed, AI conversely moves into creative and ambiguous areas where "there is no right answer and some errors are acceptable. Illustration generation, for example, has no strictly correct answer, and AI can easily produce a much higher standard of artifacts than the average human. As a result, some creative areas where mistakes can be tolerated will be replaced by AI. On the other hand, for humans, there will remain "tasks for which there is no right answer, but which cannot go wrong," i.e., important decision-making.
- Which is correct or is there a better interpretation?
    - This perspective is new in that it organizes "in what areas AI will replace humans" in terms of error tolerance and the existence of clear-cut correct answers. This is a different axis from the conventional discussion of "whether AI is [[making efficient]], [[job elimination]], or [[competition among humans]]. The scenario of AI taking over the domain where "there is no right answer, but quality can be guaranteed within the allowed range of error" (creative fields) provides an interesting insight into demand and skill utilization. Ultimately, a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between AI and work can be achieved by combining different perspectives (supply and demand, human competition, structural changes in work, and clarity of correct and incorrect answers).

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Reflect on the conversation so far and think deeply about it from different perspectives to derive a better interpretation.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>What emerges from the discussion thus far is the need for a multi-layered and multi-faceted interpretation of the "AI taking jobs" situation. Organizing the arguments and data points presented so far, the following integrative understanding is possible.
- How to view it as a competition between humans:
    - Past discussions have presented the perspective that AI does not proactively take jobs, but that those who can use AI take the jobs of those who cannot. Historically, new technologies have always reorganized and eliminated the jobs of those who could take advantage of them (capitalists and engineers) from those who could not.
- A supply and demand perspective (problem-solution relationship):
    - Another way of looking at it is to break down "work" into "problems (demand)" and "solutions (supply)," and if AI increases productivity on the "solution" side and there is an oversupply, [[price competition]] will arise and entrants will be eliminated in this scenario. On the other hand, if there are enough problems (demand), productivity improvement could rather expand the market and bring favorable results for humans. Here, whether "AI simply reduces jobs" depends largely on the demand side.
- Transformation of the work structure (disappearance or transformation of the work itself):
    - The latest data suggest that the demand for human labor in areas such as document creation and translation may itself be declining. Rather than competition among humans, AI is replacing work areas and eliminating the need for human intervention in an increasing number of cases.
- Isolation by task nature (correct answer or not and error tolerance):
    - In another article, there was an analysis that AI would take away the "allowed to make mistakes" area. Here, by subdividing tasks into "areas where the correct answer is clear and errors are not allowed," "areas where there is no correct answer and errors are allowed," and "areas where there is no correct answer but mistakes are fatal," the article organizes which tasks AI is strong in and which areas remain of value to humans.

A better interpretation:
- In the end, the impact of AI on jobs cannot be captured from a single perspective, such as "[[competition between humans and AI]]," "[[change in demand]]," or "[[disappearance of the job domain itself]]. The following comprehensive understanding is more appropriate.
    - Compounding change: AI increases the gap between humans as an efficiency tool, while driving down prices if demand remains constant, and chipping away at task areas that do not need to be carried out by humans.
    - Phased and domain-specific impacts: AI will first significantly erode some areas, such as text generation and translation, while other areas still require advanced human judgment, creativity, and decision-making. The scope and degree of impact will vary depending on the stage of technological advancement, user proficiency, and market structure.
    - Continuous reconfiguration: As AI's capabilities improve, areas that were previously considered "difficult for machines" may gradually be replaced. At the same time, however, the overall picture of work will continue to change dynamically as new problems (demands) arise and tasks that require a higher level of human value emerge.

Taken together, these multiple perspectives suggest that the simple assumption that "AI will take jobs" is inappropriate, and that understanding AI as a dynamic process in which AI and humans interact to continually redefine markets, demand, task structures, and skill sets provides a much higher resolution of reality.

- The question of whether to take away jobs or not is itself a [[false dichotomy]], an [[inappropriate question]].
