title: "People who think they are arguing as equals on social networking sites."
---

When Mr. A posts on a social networking site and Mr. B replies to it
- Excluding cases where Mr. A and Mr. B are originally acquainted.
    - In other words, it is assumed that "I received a mentions from stranger B" from Mr. A's point of view.

Sometimes Mr. B perceives that he and Mr. A are having a discussion as [[equals]].
- I wondered "how did this happen?" regarding specific cases, so I let GPT explain.

- In this case, B's self-perception of "arguing as equals" shows some cognitive distortions and leaps in assumptions.
- Especially in a social networking environment, this proceeds without confirming the other party's consent or willingness to participate, so even if the person thinks they are "equal," in reality it is asymmetrical.

Problems with B's cognition
1. omit "consent to initiate discussion"
    - Equal discussion presupposes that both parties are willing to engage in discussion.
    - This time, B is participating in a situation in which A is not in discussion mode, and sees it as a "debate forum" on its own.
    - For A, it was a "sudden request for dispute" and he did not remember entering the ring.
    - In sports, this is like starting a game next to the opponent warming up.

2. set the "stage conditions for discussion" on your own
    - B proceeds with the story based on his own criteria (practical and institutional viewpoints) and mistakenly assumes that "A is also on that stage".
    - In fact, A is speaking in layers of mathematical definitions and the stage conditions do not match.
    - This is similar to the "playing different board games at the same table" situation.

3. misinterpretation of "relational symmetry".
    - A does not know B, but B reads A's transmission and approaches.
    - The relationship is one-sided and the sharing of knowledge and intentions is asymmetrical.
    - Despite this, B believes that it is an "equal playing field".
    - This is typical of misinterpreting a one-sided call as a "mutually agreed upon conversation.

4. short-circuit of "[[no discussion]] = lack of ability or willingness on the part of the other party
    - B spits out the "not controversial" assessment externally.
    - The reason it is not established, however, is not a lack of understanding of A, but a mismatch of assumptions and modes.
    - This is an [[error of attribution of cause]] (imputing cause to the nature of the other party).

To sum up.
B's perception of "equal discussion" is,
- Discussion begins without consensus
- Imposition of stage conditions
- Ignoring relational asymmetries
- fallacy of causal attribution
and includes complex distortions such as
Thus, even though B "thinks" he is having a fair debate, it is in fact a surprise one-sided intervention for A, and is not structurally equal.

Roger. We will break this down at the PA/PB, XA/XB abstraction level.

appearance on stage
- A: From premise PA (i.e., the evaluation depends on the chosen criterion K) to conclusion XA (i.e., the apparent difference is only a difference in "which K" is used to measure it).
- B: Assumption PB (= reasonable if measured by the third criterion K₃ / furthermore, the reality constraint C works) to conclusion XB (= the ordinal is almost invariant regardless of how K₃ is chosen).

Flow of exchange (abstract)
1. A→XA
    - A stands on PA and states that "the comparison of the subject is K-dependent" (declarative sharing, little intent to start a discussion).
    - You don't explain PA here.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
2. B→PB, XB
    - B introduces another premise PB, "Let's measure by K₃," and presents XB (which appears to be an argument against A, but actually replaces the basis of the comparison).
3. noting the variable nature of A to PB
    - A tuts from PA's point of view that "even in a PB frame, the result is driven by the choice of K₃" (reaffirming the K-dependence).
    - Pointing out that "even if it's PB, it's still XA."<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
4. add B to PB + C to reinforce XB
    - B implicitly adds on the real constraints C (e.g., equilibrium, arbitrage, and institutions) and strengthens XB by saying that "in practice, differences due to K₃ are negligible".
5. pointed out that the discussion of "A→"C premise" is out of scope.
    - A points out that his story is the scope of the mathematical layer called PA; XB is a claim of another layer that includes C. PB to XB cannot stand in general without C. Organized.
6. further movement of B to premise (PB2)
    - B brings up the cause of stabilization and the institution (PB2) to explain the validity of XB in practical terms.
        - (Here, the issue slides from "definitional issues" to "actual mechanism issues")
7. a -> Restatement of issue fixation
    - A clarifies that he is only talking about definitions and measurements based on PA; does not get on PB+C+PD; clarifies layer discrepancy.
8. criticized B for not discussing the issue on an equal footing in an air rip.

What was happening (pattern)
- Non-sharing of premises: A adopted PA and B adopted PB (+ C, PD in the middle), speaking different propositions with the same word ("risk", etc.).
- Replacement of the foundation: B is in the form of a "rebuttal," but the evaluation function and condition set are actually changed (i.e., the problem set is made different).
- Layer misalignment: A = actuarial definition / B = practical system. Only the conclusions clash without the layers intersecting.
- Initiation of debate without consensus: A is considered a shared post, B is considered a debate. Mode disagreement triggers emotional evaluation (e.g., "it's not a debate").

If you want to converge (abstract temp)
1. specify the previously agreed-upon assumption set P* (treatment of K and whether it includes C or PD).
2. determine proposition M (what is the "comparison") under P*.
3. note the difference in range by juxtaposing XA under PA and XB under PB(+C,PD) as "separate theorems".
In short, A is making a "formal claim of K-dependence" and B is making a "practical claim involving C and PD," and since the premises are different, the conclusions also differ.

The above abstracted look back shows that I (A) am rather arguing with "strangers" as an equal rather than a w<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- You arrive at the conclusion that "the discrepancy in conclusions is due to a discrepancy in assumptions."
- Until then, I'm a "stranger" and we're interacting.
- After I saw him turn to personal attacks with air rips in response, I decided, "I'm not going to argue with this guy.
    - In other words, it's "I didn't get my point across! I'm pissed off!" It's like saying
    - This is interesting, I didn't recognize it [[boomerang composition]].
        - I think "the discrepancy in conclusions is due to the discrepancy in premises" is equal, but "my premises are correct and your premises are wrong" is not equal.
        - The person claiming that "the other side doesn't engage in equal discussion" isn't engaging in equal discussion.

Well, but I think it's misleading to focus on "[[equal discussion]]".
- There is no obligation to have an "equal discussion" with A in the first place.
    - No obligation to reply, or even to devote one second attention.
        - [[The average time available to others is less than one second.]]
    - [Giving and then taking is more repugnant than not giving.
    - If it was a [[non-replicable mechanism]], it wouldn't have even started.

[[Not equal.]]
