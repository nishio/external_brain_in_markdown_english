<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3-mini-high/icon' alt='o3-mini-high.icon' height="19.5"/>Audrey Tang's "Plurality" is the idea that society and organizations should not adhere to a single right answer or method, but rather allow different opinions and talents to coexist and collaborate in order to create a stronger and more flexible system.

To use an analogy from HUNTER x HUNTER, it is similar to the point where each hunter's unique Nen ability plays its own role.

- [The characters have different strengths and work together to face challenges, such as Gon's intuitive power, Killua's agility, and Kurapika's wits.
- [Respect for Individual Values: Just as no one Nen capability is a panacea, and the most appropriate capability is required for each situation, Plurality does not rely on one approach, but rather on a variety of perspectives and methods.

In this way, Plurality aims to create a system that leverages diversity and allows each individual to play to his or her strengths to produce richer results as a whole.

- I'm tempted to experiment to see if I can come up with a more dense explanation if I read [[HUNTER x HUNTER]].
