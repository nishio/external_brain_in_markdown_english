title: "A person's value is not in how much money he has accumulated, but in how much he has shared of his wealth with others"
---

> (In the Tayal values,) a person's career and social status are not determined by how much wealth they have, but by what they give, what they share, what they create for the community, how many people they are capable of caring for, and how many lives they can feed. Those who have resources do not hoard them for themselves, but share them, thereby enhancing their reputation within the tribe.
> From that time on, I came to believe that a person's value is not in how much money he or she has accumulated, but in how much of that wealth he or she has shared with others.
