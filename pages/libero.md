<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The libero (libero player) is a specialized defensive player in volleyball. The libero has the following characteristics
- Defensive Specialty: The libero plays primarily in the rear guard and specializes in receiving and digging (playing to prevent spikes).
- Offensive restrictions: No offensive actions (e.g. spikes) over the net are allowed.
- Special uniforms: They wear uniforms of a different color than the other players to make them stand out.
- Freedom of substitution: Unlike other players, there is no limit to the number of substitutions, and players are free to come and go as they please on the court.
The libero plays an important role in controlling the flow of the game and improving the team's defense.

- Center of defense: responsible for defending the last line of defense and preventing opponents from attacking.
- Starting point of attack: After winning the ball, the player often starts the attack with an accurate pass.
- Freedom of Movement: Covers a wide area depending on the situation, rather than a fixed position.
- Leadership: leadership is important because you are expected to direct the entire defensive team.
The soccer libero is not so common today, but in the past he was a key player in catenaccio tactics.
