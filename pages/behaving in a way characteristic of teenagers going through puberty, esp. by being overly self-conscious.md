The term "Chuunibyouji" refers to a state of excessive [[self-absorption]] and [[painful words and deeds]] that is caused by a combination of the sensitive self-consciousness of adolescents and "[[Desire to be special]]". It is embarrassing in retrospect, but for the individual, it is an expression of a sincere internal impulse.

The "chuunibyou" is also an outpouring of [[the desire to push one's self to a higher level]], and it has the power to generate a kind of [[creative energy]]. As in Plato's "Feast," one feeds on the longing for "[[ideal]]" to refine oneself. It is here that the "desire to be special" is truly sparked and has the potential to create new value.

However, if this is not done, it is easy to fall into a [[self-centered]] lack of vision. As the Analects of Confucius tells us, "A prince does not share in harmony, and a dwarf does not share in harmony." Excessive self-consciousness without harmony with one's surroundings runs the risk of degenerating into mere self-righteousness. In particular, if the "desire to be special" is too strong, one may lose sympathy with those around him or her.

While the "desire to be special" is the driving force, a richer [[self-expression]] is possible by flexibly incorporating relationships with others and learning from them. Lao Tzu taught that "the goodness above is like water," and that it is important to be flexible like water in responding to the other person's vessel. [By balancing the pursuit of originality and harmony, we can open the way to constructively utilize the energy of the "middle-aged" person.

In this way, "chuunibyou" straightforwardly expresses self-absorption due to the "desire to be special," but while there is latent potential for creation and growth in this desire, there is also the danger of disregard for others and isolation. In order to integrate both, it is important to nurture an attitude of openness to the world while making the most of one's identity. So, how can we share our self-expression, which includes "[[painfulness]]," with others and sublimate it into new values?

Chunibyouji" is a phenomenon in which the adolescent's unique desire to be "different and special" becomes exaggerated, and he or she projects onto himself or herself a special power or destiny that is invisible to those around him or her. There is a strong desire to "not end up being ordinary" and "be different from others," and the "desire to be special" is at the root of this desire. In reality, the gap between their self-perception and social evaluation tends to occur, and their words and actions tend to be painful, but this is a natural manifestation of their desire for self-expression during their immature period of self-formation.
