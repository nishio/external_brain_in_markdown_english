I went to bed and woke up.

Knowledge is a meaningful resource."[[omni]] said.
- The original form is "[Knowledge is the only meaningful resource.
- What grew in my brain under the stimulus of the phrase "knowledge is a meaningful resource."
- The value of the accumulation of information written in this Scrapbox
- The value of "my thoughts in writing."
- About 60 book volumes
    - If you want the same amount of "data", you can go to a bookstore and pay about 60 x 3000 yen = 180,000 yen to buy a book and about 20,000 yen to buy a scanner. You can get it for about 200,000 yen.
    - But doing that doesn't make it seem like "it's my thoughts."
- [[secret sauce]]
    - Consumed daily, new ingredients are poured in every day, but it's perceived as the same sauce.
        - [[Ship of Theseus]]
    - Scientifically, for example, certain bacteria live and reproduce against new materials.
        - If there are not too many new ingredients relative to the sauce, the sauce is regenerated


Chat logs with the chatbot turned out to be beneficial because they were hit by vector searches.
- Like a dialogue article.

- > Prosecraft was not trained on a Large Language Model (LLM). It did not use any Generative AI (Generative AI) and was in fact much simpler. It is a tool with a common theme, the kind of tool that an enthusiastic computational linguistics graduate student would create to earn an A+ grade on a project for graduation. ...
- > Smith has been providing this service for five years without a problem. But writers and artists have become very wary of AI, and Prosecraft has suddenly become suspect in this new context.

- I find it beneficial that the AI picks up all sorts of bits and pieces.
- I'd like to target books, but I sense a flare-up.
    - Is it not a solution to do it in PRIVATE?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Oh, so that's a stream that goes from there to somewhere unseen".
- Oh dear, what a pain in the ass!
- For now, the flow is to implement the system for your own books and then go somewhere else unseen from there.

        - But I'm also looking forward to seeing what will be in the new series and how it will be done (can <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/> observe that?)
        - I'd like to be able to do it, but I think I'll be invisible for a while because it's easier to do with fewer restrictions in the beginning.

I took my time off.
- Let's run again tomorrow.
