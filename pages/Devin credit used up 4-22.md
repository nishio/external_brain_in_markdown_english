Devin credit used up 4/22

Devin use all over the place
- Have them read the issues that are stopping because they can't see the Next Action and create a plan of action.
- If it looks good, proceed with implementation.
- Even if not, "Devin says this, but not because of these problems?" The discussion can evolve into "Why not?

...

I'd like to block off a day when I'm not covered in meetings to work on it.

Move to a place that takes about an hour -> A

Threw more and more issues to Devin, yesterday
- A day goes by and you forget what you threw.
- I don't know the progress status of N "forgotten items".
- I need to write it down on a list and organize it.

The date changed before I finished reviewing the task I threw at Devin yesterday.
- But it was fun, there was no choice not to participate, no choice.
