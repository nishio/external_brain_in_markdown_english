> Incidentally, if I were asked to choose one more book, I would choose "The Voice of Heaven" by Lem, a [[thought-provoking science fiction]] book from the far north.
> Do you really think you can communicate with an intelligence with a different logical system?　A masterpiece that demands thorough contemplation from the reader.
