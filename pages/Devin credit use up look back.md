Devin credit use up look back
- We just barely succeeded in using up all of Devin's tokens before they expired.
    - I feel like it was a good experience.
    - I still can't verbalize what was so good about it.
- Less suffering.
    - 11 parallel to proceed, it wasn't as deadly as before.
    - Stop "tabbed work-in-progress tasks
        - This is a bad habit and should definitely be stopped.
        - You have to open tabs to see what's inside and there's no list.
        - Sometimes browser crashes or memory release stirs things up.
    - Devin's WebUI listings are getting better, too.
        - PR'd, merged, etc. are now shown as icons, so it is much easier to grasp the situation.
        - In addition, I've decided to properly maintain the titles and put a ✅ at the top of the list for those deemed finished by humans.
    - But don't rely on a single ready-made WebUI.
        - The "why are you doing it, how did you think about it, what did you ask for?" is on the human side, so the WebUI can't tell you.
        - I've been confused because I've been switching tabs and such without verbalizing it.
        - Contextual information should be verbalized.
            - For example, it's better to manage it with free descriptions in Cosense's bulleted list.
