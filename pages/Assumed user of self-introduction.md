title: "Assumed user of self-introduction"

> [songmu](https://twitter.com/songmu/status/1658506529132417025) I've been having trouble with [[self-introduction]] lately, so I say "I'm Songmu, a software engineer," but when I'm having a conversation with multiple people I think there is an [[information gap]] between people who know me and people who don't, and people who don't have information feel a [[lack of context]] and feel [[uncomfortable]].

> [songmu](https://twitter.com/songmu/status/1658506754546872320) I don't want to introduce myself too pompously, and I don't want them to feel defensive, so I introduce myself moderately, but it's difficult to find the appropriate level of [[self- disclosure]] level is difficult.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1658624882362703873) This "people who already know me are not [[assumed users]] of self-introductions" and "it's practically impossible to tell everything about myself in a limited amount of time, so I don't have to aim for it in the first place" kind of feeling.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1658626687108804608) If you give your first move "I'm a researcher at a software company" and get back "What kind of research do you do?", you can say "It's hard to explain in a few words." If you preface with "I'm a researcher at a software company," and then talk about the difficulties, most "I think [[etiquette]] is to pose an interest in the other person" types will choose "I don't know" and you will get 1 bit of information.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1658627747214938112) I want to identify early on whether you are "[[someone who pretends to be interested when you are not]]" or "[[someone who is really interested]]". Because spending time explaining something to the former will not make either of us happy.
