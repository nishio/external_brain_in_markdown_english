title: 'Easy" is not the same as "short."'
---

- The words "[[easy]]" and "[[short]]" are not the same.
- Easy" and "[[perfection]]" are not the same thing.

- Context of whether the abbreviated form (e.g. gem i) or the non-abbreviated form (e.g. gem install) should be taught first
- > [hyuki](https://twitter.com/hyuki/status/1017954091912138752)I was wondering if you meant that "easy" is not the same as "short". If "easy" means "easy to understand" and "short" means "short to write," then the best order would be to teach them to understand the full spelling easily and to write it short.

- > igaiga555 Why is this? Because I can't take it?
- > hyuki I think it's because "writing perfectly" is not always "easy to understand".
- > takahasim install is the key to remember when you forget the i, but not for X, I guess.
