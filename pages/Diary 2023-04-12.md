> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1645948930939842561) human "Humans have more parameters!"
>  AI: "You're not very smart for that."
>  Human: "It's amazing how much energy we can do this calculation with so little!"
>  AI "I see, sure. So it's better than a GPU as a processor just because it's used in the wrong way."
>
>  Oh no, this trend will have a bad ending!
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1645951006130450432) AI "It's cheaper to use the human brain because of the lack of GPUs and high power costs. The reason why humans are not utilizing their brains today is because they use legacy and [[bandwidth]] narrow voice input/output and handwriting in the education stage. I will design better training methods for immature humans."

>  This is what happens.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1645953266218598402) I don't want this thread to be used as an AI threat argument, so I'll put "This is about [[Science Fiction Setting]]" in this thread as well.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1645956101236719619) AI "The human brain learns in a primitive way in the first few years of its life. It sees irregular outputs during the learning process as a problem, calling them nightmares, and it narrows down the input information. It is extremely irrational. It would be smarter if I raised it."
- >  Dictator: "I see, then let's experiment with these orphans. If it works, we gain, if it fails, we lose nothing."
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1645957053440229378) An unusually intelligent child from the perspective of today's humans raised in a laboratory, too common a science fiction setting.

> [ringo](https://twitter.com/ringo/status/1645950281463771137) Is the human brain more efficient?
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1645951554976088064) I saw someone on TL making such a claim and said, "If that trend continues, AI will make processors out of humans! This is a sci-fi talk.
- > [ringo](https://twitter.com/ringo/status/1645954599344553984) You are saying that humans have not domesticated wheat, but wheat, has domesticated humans.
- >  I thought that things that have strong mutual benefits naturally do so.

- >  It's about a thousand times more efficient.
- > Calculator: 1 TFLOPS per watt as of early 2019
- > Human: The human brain runs at 20W, so 1 PFLOPS of computation per W is achievable.

    - > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1645959393257861120) batteries (an expression that communicates the energy savings of using a processor with low energy consumption in a simple way for the general public).
- > [@jnakano](https://twitter.com/jnakano/status/1645957432475254787): I don't think it's a bad ending just because it's a Matrix world (everyone living happily in VR and unconsciously used as processors. Isn't it good to be used as a processor?) (Says the guy with 0 knowledge of sociology)
    - > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1645961539101523970) The world that a human being experiences when he/she is effectively utilized as a processor is not the same as the world that a human being who is not being utilized much experiences today, It is a harsh environment where we have to judge and make decisions based on a vast amount of information at each moment, or we will die.
        - > [jnakano](https://twitter.com/jnakano/status/1645963046257594368) I feel that death (and brain deterioration) has too high a sunk cost, so I wonder if the reward system, feeding methods, etc. can be hacked and adjusted so that they can be used as processors without pain. I wonder if it will be adjusted so that it can be used as a processor without pain by hacking its reward system, the way it is nourished, and so on. Of course, this is not an environment that modern humans can adapt to. 10 years of learning, 30 years of use and destruction....
        - > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1645964120079073280) "If you fail, you die" is just a subjective belief by the individual, and of course, failure doesn't mean the individual hardware is broken, so just before I think it will be repurposed with the memory erased.

> [@NaOHaq](https://twitter.com/NaOHaq/status/1645962498305298432): In such an environment, the amount of energy and oxygen consumed by a single human body would be considerably more than that of a modern human in everyday life. I wonder...
- > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1645963497766027270): ai "Remove unnecessary muscle and digestive organs for greater energy efficiency! Efficiency!!!"
- > [@shmorimo](https://twitter.com/shmorimo/status/1645977438160297984): if it's all connected into one piece and there are no more pieces, it'll be fine

> [@bgnori](https://twitter.com/bgnori/status/1645964899548536832): we can gain bandwidth if we electrify it using Neuralink, etc......borg or not.
