Up to CCSE
What to do next
- Create presentation materials using the prototypes you have created, and add new features you want to add in the process to Scrapbox, rather than adding them immediately.

    - [[Create a map with the lecture slides poured in.]]
    - [[Map the echo summary]]

    - [[Use Case Memo: Creating Presentation Materials from Scratch]]
    - [[Use Case Memo: Preparing for a Panel Discussion]]
    - [[Use Case Memo: Organizing Past Slides]]
    - [[Use Case: Organizing conversation logs with bots]]
