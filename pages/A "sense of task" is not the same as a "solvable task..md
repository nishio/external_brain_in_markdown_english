title: 'A "sense of task" is not the same as a "solvable task.'

from  [[Manazuru 2023-05-13]]
There is a difference between "[[sense of the issues]]" and "[[problem that can be solved]]".

However, often the "problem" is not a "solvable problem" but only a vague "sense of the problem," and the sense of the problem cannot be solved by others as it is.
    - Let's do [[needs-seeing matching]]! but this is the reason why most of them don't work!
- Those on the technology side tend to lose enthusiasm for the task of converting a sense of challenge into a challenge to be accomplished, saying, "It's not something we do, is it?
    - Converting it into a problem that can be solved, and if we're not suited to solve it with our own technology, then the time taken out of the project is lost.
    - In many cases, they don't want to do it even if they could get consulting fees up front.
            - Not something you can buy with [[commodity called cash]].

In order to transform a "sense of problem" into a "solvable problem," it is necessary to [[verbalizing]] it to the point where it becomes an "enthusiasm" for solving it.

But there is a hurdle of "saying something with a certain degree of [[confidence (in oneself)]]". Only people with a certain amount of [[self-assurance]] are able to say a lot of miscellaneous ideas, and most people are not. That's why I mentioned the possibility of using [[anonymous seed comments]] on [[Polis]].

I was writing from a different angle before.
