Summary: The
- While it is easy to quickly return results to society based on market needs and user demands, social implementation-first research tends to neglect basic and long-term perspectives, which can impair the originality and depth of the research.

Commentary:.
- Benefits
    - Quickly responds to [[social needs]], [[practical application]], and [[diffusion]].
    - External feedback enables early modification of research direction
    - Easier to obtain [[funding]] and [[social support]] by demonstrating practicality
- Disadvantages: -Disadvantages: -Disadvantages: -Disadvantages: -Disadvantages
    - [Basic research and long term perspectives have been put on the back burner, leading to a decline in creativity.
    - [Emphasis on short-term results inhibits in-depth verification and theoretical accumulation.
    - [Initial implementation, implementation costs, and market competition may constrain research activities.
