title: "Radar Charts and Knowledge Distribution Charts"
---

    - [[Knowledge distribution maps and radar charts are almost identical in what they represent]]

    - Maybe people are more familiar with radar charts.

    - The picture I drew in [[Specialists and generalists]] is similar to the mapping between a radar chart and a knowledge distribution map

- Radar chart has discrete regions of definition, but the knowledge distribution map is continuous
    - I believe the "knowledge domain" is not discrete, but continuous.
    - The knowledge domain that many people imagine may be discretized
    - Even in my descriptions of various things, I often discuss them in a discretized definitional domain of about one or two points.
        - Like, "I know engineering and I know business administration."
        - In this case, it MUST not be a continuous knowledge distribution map

- The radar chart is limited to a finite definitional area.
    - This is unacceptable to me.
    - It creates the misconception that "everything is in plain sight."
    - It's important not to overlook the fact that "new territory is being created."
        - Related: [[Strategy Canvas]].
        - New fields of knowledge are being created all the time.
    - The knowledge distribution map has no edges and is infinite.
    - But then I thought about it, and I never really explained it properly.
            - [[Increase in knowledge areas]]
    - For simplicity, I have used one dimension, but of course it is multidimensional.
