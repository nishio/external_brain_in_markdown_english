title: "Diseases to be classified hierarchically"

- In the [[liquidation]] of physical objects, [[level]] classifications are likely to occur.
    - Because there is [[implication]] in the space, as in "what you put in the second drawer of the sleeve desk" is "what you put in the sleeve desk."
    - By the constraint of having a single "[[Location]]" because the physical object cannot be easily duplicated.
- There is no constraint with [[Single location]] because the information can be easily replicated
- Nevertheless, they try to use the metaphor of physical organization to create a hierarchical classification
- Maybe it's because they haven't had the opportunity to learn non-hierarchical organization.
- Isn't the only time you learned to organize in the first place, like a toolbox in kindergarten or putting things away in a school bag?
- What are some examples of non-hierarchical organization?
    - Sort by last access date
