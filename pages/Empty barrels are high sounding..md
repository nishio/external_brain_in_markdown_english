title: "Empty barrels are high sounding."
---

A barrel full of contents does not make much sound when tapped, but an empty barrel makes a high pitched sound when tapped.

Japanese proverb #Parable

- The more insubstantial a person is, the more he claims to make himself look great.
    - [[The less confident you are, the more you speak ill of others.]]

a wise man keeps some of his talents in reserve

- [[Empty barrels resonate well.]]
