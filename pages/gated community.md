> A gated community is a residential area with a gate (gate) and a wall around the perimeter to restrict access to the property by non-residents, thereby preventing through traffic and improving security.
[Gated community - Wikipedia [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%86%E3%83%83%E3%83%89%E3%82%B3%E3%83%9F%E3%83%A5%E3%83](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%86%E3%83%83%E3%83%89%E3%82%B3%E3%83%9F%E3%83%A5%E3%83) %8B%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3]

Figuratively, "limited participation [[in the Community]]"

When the language was first created, it was physical, but today it is easy to create it by setting up some kind of gate to the online community
- [[token gate]] by [[NFT]], etc.
