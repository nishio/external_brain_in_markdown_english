- At birth, we may interpret others as Pattern 1: "Others are a collective entity."
    - We believe that what we tell person A is also communicated to person B.
    - We even think that our thoughts are conveyed without words.
- Through development, we observe "not communicated" instances and shift to Pattern 2: "Others are individuals."
    - However, this interpretation can be excessive.
        - There is a possibility that A and B exchange information beyond our sight.
- For example, a man X makes a move on a woman A in a group of women.
    - A responds with a +10 out of ±100, thinking "not bad, but we've just met."
    - If X thinks "the more attempts, the better" and approaches B as well,
    - If A and B share this information, both might rate X at -100, and this information could spread to other women connected to A and B, leading to everyone rating X at -100.
    - X, unaware of this principle, is overly fixated on the "others are individuals" interpretation.
- For instance, a con artist X presents a tempting offer to A.
    - A avoids being deceived because they heard about B almost being scammed.
- What does this mean?
    - Individuals who understand the defensive advantage of being a collective actively exchange information to form a virtual collective.
    - Predators find it more efficient to attack individuals isolated from the group.
