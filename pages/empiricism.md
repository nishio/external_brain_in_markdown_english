title: "empiricism"
---

- Empiricism is the [[philosophical]] position that all human [[knowledge]] comes from [[experience]].
    - [[John Locke]]'s "[[tabula rasa]]" ("Man is a blank slate at birth") is well known.

Nishio's Position
- Organisms have "favorable characteristics" for [[innate]] by [[mutation]] and [natural selection
    - So "tabula rasa" is a [[science]] fallacy.
- On the other hand, it is not [[useful]] to think about one's personal future [[decision-making]], which has already been born, because innate characteristics are unchangeable.
- It is important to acquire knowledge from experience → [[way of learning]].
