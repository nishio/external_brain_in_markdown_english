title: "Changing Values"
---

- [From the Well-being Index
- [[values]] changes depending on [life event
    - But the person himself is hard to notice because the scale of value itself is changing.
    - The birth of a child is a big change.
        - Because there are so many people who change, "those who don't change" are sometimes regarded as anomalies.
        - Someone who said "stupid people have no reason to exist" when he was a student may now say "we need a system that allows even stupid people to live happily".
        - It depends on whether it's a girl or a boy.
            - Especially when male parents have girls, they begin to think of themselves as "protecting vulnerable women from harmful men".
            - For men, women's sexual victimization is not their own business.
                - The threat of being falsely accused of molestation is more likely to harm you.
                - When I look at social networking sites, I see people who only see one of these positions, and they have sterile fistfights with each other.
    - Experiencing how good people in society unknowingly discriminate and treat you unfavorably by living abroad yourself.
    - Basically, you're saying that values change as we "experience" things, and that life events often involve new experiences.
