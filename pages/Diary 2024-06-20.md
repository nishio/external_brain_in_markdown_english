Not only AI Yasuno and AI Yuriko, but also AI Ishimaru! Japan's first "election in which all major candidates will be equipped with AI" is steadily approaching! The era of digital democracy has arrived, a historical turning point~~!


Woke up from sleep, added
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1803556412783804813) In future elections, voters will be able to call up a candidate AI at any time to ask questions, debate, and listen to multiple AIs discuss topics of interest to them This will be possible. We're not there yet in this election, but we've certainly made great strides toward making that a reality.　#DigitalDemocracy


Consider verbalizing your stance.
- I believe that digital democracy is the direction of better social development.
- Technological advances have changed the way people communicate.
- The social structure needs to change accordingly.
- The person most likely to change for the better is Yasuno.

I went to see my first live show.

Received the poster.

Bought lunch, going home.

- The rest of us thought it would be cooler after dark.

[*** Manifest (detailed version)
> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1803666653739421882) Today, we are releasing the manifesto (detailed version) of Takahiro Anno, who ran for the Tokyo gubernatorial election as an independent individual, to over 100 people. I have been thinking about the future of Tokyo while interviewing more than 100 people. It is 93 pages long, but please take a look! #TOKYOAI

> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1803667416553251221) I also do not consider the above manifesto I presented to be 100 points or perfect. I believe there are various parts that are lacking. That is why I will continue to update the manifesto as I listen to your feedback. I would very much appreciate your candid feedback.
> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1803667791511494737) For a long time, I have had my doubts about manifestos without specifics that are announced at elections. That is why we do not want to be political, but concrete policies. Furthermore, we want to create a vision for the future beyond that!





> [Snapshot_0001](https://x.com/Snapshot_0001/status/1803738771101499871) While I am impressed by the interesting and informative pledges, I feel that there is still more that can be done by the metropolitan government in terms of welfare policy, at the risk of sounding like an amateur. I am impressed by the interesting and informative pledges. Of course, municipalities are the best at providing individualized services, but I think that TMG can handle some of the things that the national government can't handle.
> [Snapshot_0001](https://x.com/Snapshot_0001/status/1803745595271823595) Since the users of welfare policy are sort of the opposite of Mr. Anno, it is necessary to find out their needs on a zero-based basis, and this is difficult to collect digitally. I think it is difficult to collect I believe that offline dialogue with 100 homeless people, in addition to the knowledge of 100 experts, will bring this commitment to the highest level of both economy and welfare. #TOKYOAI
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1803770194533515456) The tool used in this project, "Talk to the City", has in the past used AI to transcribe and input conversations with 12 people released from prison. I think that analyzing and understanding the conversations with 100 homeless people as you mentioned (#broad listening) is exactly what this tool is good at.

What do you think about names and icons being displayed when YouTube comments are read?
    - [It's strange that only the recipient is invisible.
- Yes, I'm sure some people would like to hear it anonymously.
- [[Anonymous Broad Listening Channel]] is required

[[Perspective API]] applied for.
- Must be tied to GCP Project
    - I've changed it to komorebi-kagami.


- [[Metaphor of warriors]]

Anonymous channel, I have a Google Form as a simpler solution in case my Polis doesn't make it in time.
Would the same method solve the bottleneck of exchanging poster information? I was thinking about it, and Mr. A quickly solved it with LINE Webhook.
