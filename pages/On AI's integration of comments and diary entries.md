On AI's integration of comments and diary entries
- I feel it would be beneficial to let people comment on the diary.
- On the other hand, I find it beneficial to have a "blank page" when I wake up in the morning, where I can write down what I thought about while I was sleeping
    - Before the world drowns it out with unnecessary stimuli.
    - This writing may not be limited to text, but can also be expressed in pictures.
- If so, is it better to comment on the previous day's diary while you are sleeping or
- Now, I have a light [[Spaced Repetition]] with links to diaries from a year ago and 100 days ago, but I can't say it's being utilized much.
    - I don't find the link useful because I know it's "linked just because it's 100 days old."
    - Picked up by AI vector search without resorting to such methods.
- In addition to yesterday's diary, you could also randomly pick up one diary that hasn't yet had an AI comment on it.
- Useful not only diaries but also nodes of thought
    - Rather, the nodal point of thought is certainly the thought
    - The diary [[also records]] the events of daily life.
    - It would be possible to filter it since the AI is able to determine that it's an everyday event.

### digest
.
Comments on the diary by the AI can be useful, and it is important to write down what you think about while you sleep. In addition to diaries, nodes of thought are also useful. Currently, we have links to diaries of one year and 100 days ago, but their utilization is low; we can think of a way to pick them up by AI vector search, or randomly pick up diaries without AI comments.

### Relevance
.
The "intelligent collaboration between AI and humans" is related to the idea of AI commenting on diaries, where AI and humans collaborate on a diary and each can advance their thinking to gain deeper understanding and insight.

### deep thinking
Collaboration between AI and humans has the potential to contribute to the creation of new knowledge and the deepening of thinking. However, for this to happen, it is important that AI and humans collaborate on an equal footing. In addition, the information that AI can obtain from reading diaries may differ from that obtained by humans. This comes from the fact that AI has a different perspective and understanding than humans.

### summary of thoughts
Collaboration between AI and humans contributes to the creation of new knowledge, but it requires an equal relationship.

### Title
.
AI-Human Collaboration: The Path to New Knowledge Creation.
