title: "Should we write adoption criteria?"
---


Cons
- People will try to optimize the adoption criteria as written.
- Trying to write to the adoption criteria hinders writing about intrinsic motivation
- In the first place, I myself have not yet acquired a firm belief about what kind of adoption criteria I should take.
Pros
- Know what to look for in advice from the adults around you.
- Can affect 1~2 orders of magnitude more people than adoption, and is beneficial in moving the world in a better direction.
- Writing may bring clarity to my thinking.
