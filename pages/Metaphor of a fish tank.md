- > They are used to keep "captured" fish "alive" and "swimming". Of course, it is also important to be able to recapture the fish immediately (without the hassle of fishing) if needed.
- > "Active" is more valuable when the total number is limited (my way of saying, closed and moving). The number of information that can be placed under the realm of human cognition is limited, so it is better not to make everything "active".
- > Fish flitting about: Simply put, there is a subterranean lake that serves as a metaphor for the unconscious, and the idea of fish floating in it.

- > If the information can only be read by you at the time you store it, then it is captured in your framework at that point in time. This is not "autonomous". It cannot swim.
- > In other words, when an idea is first captured in the conscious mind and then stored in a state that allows the idea to be autonomous, even in a different consciousness, when it is brought out of consciousness, the information is "swimmable".
- > Therefore, it is a "written explanation", i.e. [[(late Edo-period) culture of debauchery]].
