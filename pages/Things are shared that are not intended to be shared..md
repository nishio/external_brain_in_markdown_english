Only the first Tweet that became "just a share" was retweeted and propagated.
The link I wanted to share was eventually shared, but no one saw it because it didn't expand...

Expands and displays on Facebook

However, this actually hides the part I wanted to share in the "More" section, whereas only the fishing title of the original article and an image of no particular significance are displayed in large size.

This "specifically -" part was interesting, but did not come across at all.

On PC, "Include original post" must be checked

I don't know how they do it with the phone app.
