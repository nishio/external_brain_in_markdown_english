title: "Art in the Age of Reproduction Technology"
---

- [[duplication]] in the age of technology [[the arts]].
- Review written by cultural critic [[Walter Benjamin]] in [1936.
- > Mechanical reproduction has freed works of art from their parasitic dependence on [[ritual]].
        - [[religion]] and [[political authority]] were the driving forces behind the creation of the artwork.
- > Instead of being based on ritual, [[art]] is beginning to be based on another practice - [[politics]]." For Benjamin, [[politicization of art]] had to be the goal of [[communism]], as opposed to [[fascism]], which is [[Beautifying Politics]] for [[Social Control]].
