<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> [[aging population combined with the diminishing number of children]] increases [[automation pressure]], while [[automation]] makes employment insecure, and when [[employment is insecure]] people become [anxiety and hatred increases toward a generation that is receiving [[pension]] without working with money taken from their own paychecks.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The declining birthrate and aging population [[are]] creating a labor shortage, and automation in many industries is driven by [[economic necessity]]. As automation progresses, routine and low-skilled jobs are particularly affected, and employment may become unstable. Job instability can increase [[economic insecurity]] among [[the working generation]], which in turn can increase [[social tensions]].

On the other hand, when employment becomes unstable, some may develop feelings of [[unfairness]] and hatred, especially from the viewpoint of [[the younger generation]], that the taxes and [[social security contributions]] they pay are used to fund the pensions of the elderly. Such [[social division]] may accentuate [[economic disparity]] and [[a sense of intergenerational inequality]], which may have a negative impact on [[social sustainability]].

For society as a whole, it is important how to balance technological progress with [[intergenerational fairness]]. Policies and systems must be put in place to link increased productivity through automation to improved welfare for society as a whole, and to support unstable employment situations. Also, deepening [[dialogue and understanding]] between the elderly and the young can be one way to ease [[intergenerational tensions]].
