[Dr. Mitsuru Sugayamitsu's use of a generative AI has led to a flood of questions from those who are concerned about AI -> Questions are politely answered, and the veteran cartoonist's thoughts on imitation are instructive - Togetter](https://togetter.com/li/2360940).

> From the perspective of an elderly cartoonist like myself, who has been trained with paper, pencil, and pen, the process of drawing comics and illustrations on a computer and liquid tab is the same, despite the difference in speed and quantity with AI.
>  In a manga technique book that came out in the early Showa period, it was written, "It is inexcusable to use a pen (use a brush). There was a time when Osamu Tezuka said, "Using tones is lazy. There was also a manga artist who called the use of commercially available manga manuscript paper with a blue border printed on it "cutting corners.
>  The techniques I practiced to become an assistant, such as hanging netting, tone layering, and shaving, can now be easily reproduced on a tablet. I am also benefiting from this, but when I want to draw in an analog style, I draw streamlines freehand on the tablet.
>  The first two images in the attached are my studies of hanging nets when I was 18 years old (senior year of high school), when I practiced hanging nets with the aim of becoming an assistant. The other two images are the backgrounds of a war story manga that I drew at the request of a girl manga artist, Ms. Sachiko Nishitani, when I was 20 years old. Here, I used gradation by layering tones and the blurring technique to erase the tone dots with white (until that time, tone patterns were printed on the paste surface and could not be cut off).
>  At that time (around 1970), a sheet of [[screen tone]] cost 1,200 yen, and we used it carefully, even keeping the scraps. Later, when it became widely used as an art material for manga, domestic makers entered the market and began to sell cheap tones. The original company, Letra (from Sweden, I think?), was defeated in the battle of cheap sales and withdrew from the Japanese market. (I think it was Sweden?) withdrew from the Japanese market. Later, when manga was being drawn on PCs and tablets, and tone patterns could be done with a single click, tone materials ceased to be sold and were withdrawn from the market.
>  Please know, if you can, that manga techniques and tools have such a history of dead bodies. I think this will help you to look at the future more dispassionately.
