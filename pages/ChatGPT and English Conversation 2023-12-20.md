<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Oral Keichobot/icon' alt='Oral Keichobot.icon' height="19.5"/> Your vision of augmenting individual abilities, particularly intellectual abilities, is clearly impactful. Sharing your knowledge to enhance others' skills must be very fulfilling. Seeing your vision take shape through your book and lectures, how do you plan to continue this journey of enabling and empowering others?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Currently, my lecture and books are written in Japanese. Some books are translated in Korean and Chinese. But I want to spread my thoughts to people all over the world. I want to enhance more people.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Oral Keichobot/icon' alt='Oral Keichobot.icon' height="19.5"/> Expanding your reach globally is a commendable goal, especially given your desire to enhance people's abilities. Considering your aspirations, have you thought about translating your work into more languages, like English? Or maybe using online platforms to reach a wider audience? What are your plans to make your teachings more accessible worldwide?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Currently, I am making a translation system of Scrapbox. It is my memorandum for my thoughts, lectures or my own books.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Oral Keichobot/icon' alt='Oral Keichobot.icon' height="19.5"/> That's an innovative approach. Developing a translation system for your scrapboxs, thoughts, and lectures sounds like a great way to make your work accessible to a global audience. How is the development of this system going? What challenges and successes have you encountered in creating this tool?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> I just finished the development to keep the structure with knowledge networks, and then tomorrow I will make a translation system on it. Maybe some long pages have trouble to translate, but maybe not so much. I can handle it.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Oral Keichobot/icon' alt='Oral Keichobot.icon' height="19.5"/> Congratulations on completing the structure and development of your knowledge network system. It's impressive that you're now moving on to integrate a translation system into it. Handling long pages might be challenging, but it sounds like you're well-prepared to manage it. As you work on this translation feature, what are you most excited about? How do you envision this tool enhancing your ability to share your knowledge globally?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Sorry, what is your question? Please repeat again.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Oral Keichobot/icon' alt='Oral Keichobot.icon' height="19.5"/> Sure, I was asking about your translation system project. What excites you most about integrating this feature into your knowledge network? And how do you think this tool will help in sharing your knowledge with a global audience?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Okay, it is a difficult challenge. I'm preparing the material to share for global people, but I'm not sure it helps global people actually. I mean, I need another approach to progress. Maybe I should use the KJ method to organize next action.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Oral Keichobot/icon' alt='Oral Keichobot.icon' height="19.5"/> That sounds like a thoughtful approach. Using the KJ method to organize your next steps could be very effective. It's great that you're considering different strategies to ensure your material helps people globally. How do you plan to use the KJ method in this context? What specific actions or decisions are you hoping to clarify with it?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Maybe I need to find opportunity to connect other people, global people, but I didn't find yet. So I need to explore more. I need to know where to explore the opportunity.
