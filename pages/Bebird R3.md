Even I hesitate to post pictures.
What, my ear canals are too dirty?
How can there be this much hair?
I haven't cleaned it in a while because my ear buds went missing, so I have something like "a surface of earwax that peeled away from my ears and dried into a flimsy sheet"!
I mean, if you were in the middle of all this, you'd have shoved it in the back of your ear without looking.

So if you've never looked inside your ears, you should give it a try.
