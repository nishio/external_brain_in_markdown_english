title: "Why Scrapbox?"
---

from [[what is "Scrapbox by Yasukazu Nishio"? #59082328aff09e0000d1ccbc]]
- Q: Why am I so excited about [[Scrapbox]] but not about the various services I've migrated to from [[Hatena Diary]]?
- A: Consider the functions that blogs used to have as "flow" and "stock".
    - The role of the flow part, i.e., the immediate distribution of information, in which updates are notified via RSS, etc., and people who have read the latest posts send trackbacks and discussions become lively..., has been eclipsed by the prosperity of Twitter and Facebook.
    - With respect to the remaining stock portion, existing blogging systems are weak in their support for discovering relationships between individual entries. Even as the stockpile of entries grows, the total value increases only in a less than linear fashion.
    - Scrapbox seems to be the most serious within the scope of our observation in the direction of how to transform stocked information into [[structured information]].
(2017-04-09  [[The blog was dismantled and became a social networking site and Scrapbox.]] )
