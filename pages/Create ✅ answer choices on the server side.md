title: "Create ✅ answer choices on the server side"
---

I want to be able to create choice answers on the server side.

- If you don't standardize the display and input of buttons, you have to send each of them from the server, which is a hassle.
        - [[Common display and input of ✅ buttons]]
- status quo
    - Receive response from server in JSON
    - If data.text is not empty, set lastKeywords, otherKeywords to setGlobal
    - Update buttons with useGlobal
- Let's give it to them in BUTTONS!
- Looks like it's working well.
- Move ✅ first
