[[Poker]] [[Analogy]]

The question of 'how much to bet to win' is absurd.
- Before 'how much to bet,' there's 'what kind of hand you have.'
- It's not good to bet a lot with a bad hand.
    - However, there is a chance the opponent may [[fold]].
- It's also not good to bet too little with a good hand.
    - How much loss is still acceptable?

What seems obvious in the context of poker can become unclear in different situations.
