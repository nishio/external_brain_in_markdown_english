AI Agents and Agile Scrum

When a single engineer manages multiple AI agents as a "team," the Agile Scrum approach is helpful.

- [[Clarify roles]]: Define the tasks and areas of expertise for each AI agent, and indicate the specifications and goals by the engineers themselves as "[[product owners]]".
- [[short sprints]] and reviews: Periodically check progress and, if necessary, revise specifications or correct study data. For example, assign tasks in "one-day sprints" and check the results.
- [[retrospective]] ([looking back): After the work is completed, reflect on whether there were any problems with coordination among AI agents, how to improve the accuracy of instructions, etc., and reflect on the next cycle.
- Lighten the ceremonies of the scrum: as the equivalent of "[[daily standup]]", briefly check the status of each agent first thing in the morning. Quickly identify any obstacles, need for additional resources, etc., and get back on track.

When these are turned around in a small cycle, a single engineer can efficiently manage multiple AIs. By frequently rotating the sprint planning and look-back cycles, task assignment and refinement of the learning model can be done in an agile manner to increase the overall output.
