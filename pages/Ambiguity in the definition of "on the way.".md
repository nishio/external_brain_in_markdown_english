Definition of #complete


> How do you integrate the "limit the number of tasks you are working on", "only do one at a time", "don't start something new, finish what you are working on first", "don't start at the deadline, do 30 minutes right now", "[mixed-think-life philosophy The "mixed-think-life philosophy" and the "let's finish what we're working on first" guidelines seem contradictory on the surface, but how can they be integrated?

> When I talked to my wife about it, she pointed out that there is ambiguity in the definition of "on the way." If you interpret "filing a document" as a large, fluffy task, then "I've finished writing the whole thing anyway, but haven't reviewed it yet" is in the middle of the process. If I interpret it as the four tasks of "write the document, review it, put it in the envelope, and mail it," then the first task is just completed.

> They are the same state as physical phenomena, but they look different depending on the interpretation on the human side. The interpretation that is complete is less stressful, so the interpretation side needs to be changed.

> "Let's make it more efficient by sticking together the task of posting papers and going to the dentist since they are both outgoing tasks" is an implicit assumption that the tasks are finely sliced and diced, so to speak, and a middle boss to fight after holding a hagane no tsurugi (a sword of steel). Those who have a fluffy big perception of tasks are hinokibo and should hit [[slime]] first.

> Minimize the granularity of tasks & make it easier to finish tasks by defining done. For example, "Let's do it now for 30 minutes" is consistent with the idea of dividing tasks into 30-minute units and finishing them one at a time. I wonder...
