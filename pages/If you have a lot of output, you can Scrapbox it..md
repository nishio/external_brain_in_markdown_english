- Stop using [The Legacy Protocol of Conversation
    - [[Even if you explain it carefully, they don't understand.]]
    - Because careful explanation increases the size of the information, which is more likely to overflow from [[working memory]].
    - There are many ways to expand working memory, such as [[reading notebook]] and [[Kozaneba]].
    - The receiver [[Not fast enough to understand.]] So the receiver can only [read slowly

Everyone understands at a different rate.
- It's not a good idea to strangle the speed of output just because the listener happens to be slow in understanding.
- If the output is replicable content, it can be enjoyed by people other than those who were in front of it at the time of the output
- Some of those people have a much faster rate of understanding.

    - You can't plant all the seedlings in a small field.
    - [[Trying to make those who don't understand understand create suffering.]]
