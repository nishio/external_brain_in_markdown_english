title: "Safety and Production Efficiency"

> [azulblue](https://x.com/azulblue/status/1837361201053065513) Mr. Son,
>  "When you try to increase [[safety]], [[production efficiency]] suffers."
>  We arrive at the truth without laboring a single millimeter.
>
>  What I've been doing is like a factory manager who builds factories with a minecraft mod and makes tracks while digging in the open air, but it seems that often my friends fall into holes and die.
>
>  I heard over lunch that if you design the equipment so that it does not fall off, the equipment will become larger and the production per area will fall off.
>  It was like, what real factory are we talking about?

> [diodio213](https://x.com/diodio213/status/1837468219676021239) I recited it every morning and believed it! Is this a lie ！！！！?

> [azulblue](https://x.com/azulblue/status/1837502874991169969) It's true.
>  No one can check the contents of a factory with production machines packed tightly into a 10m square, can they?
>  If you build that kind of structure my son is working on, the machine will break down unless a human checks it, and if you make a gap for a human to enter, you reduce the number of machines.
> The idea is that there is a physical contradiction between how many things can be made in a certain area and the safety of human collaboration.
> Given the time lost in repair and investigation after an accident, it is more efficient to point and confirm safety while people are working together.
> That's for sure.

> [tetra1945](https://x.com/tetra1945/status/1837676459663806971) The reality is that skilled workers don't respawn endlessly.

> [azulblue](https://x.com/azulblue/status/1837677754399244515) It seems that what my son is aiming for is a factory without a single human being.
>  That is why it is said, "If you leave it to machines alone, there is a limit to efficiency. If it is left to machines alone, there is a limit to efficiency. But if we pursue human safety (by using human corridors and safety fences), space efficiency will decrease.
>  And that seems to be the case.

> [mikeke0505](https://x.com/mikeke0505/status/1837452981345964459) Why in the world would you leave something that looks so inefficient alone?
>  There are a lot of things that look like that.
>  Actually, "because that way you don't die."

> [zuf3337](https://x.com/zuf3337/status/1837459461302374908) *In the real world, you can't respawn even if you die, so you have to investigate the cause, prevent a recurrence, shut down operations in the meantime, compensate the bereaved families, and get a huge bashing from the public to get the necessary number of workers. The company is short of workers, and even if it tries to hire more workers, it cannot because of the bad publicity, so it becomes "safety first, quality second, and production third".

> [NobushiQ7](https://x.com/NobushiQ7/status/1837451027966316831) Cramming them in tight can also make for a terrible work environment.
>  There's also the law, so we're actually applying a pretty high safety factor.

> [DoubutuRyu36172](https://x.com/DoubutuRyu36172/status/1837455363035275556) whatever the game is.
>  We can learn from taking things seriously and having fun.

> [emon11451400](https://x.com/emon11451400/status/1837473955533521300) It's the same with information security. The more robust it is, the less convenient it is.
