The concept of "rule of law" has its origins in ancient times, but it was not established in the modern sense until the Middle Ages.
- Ancient Origins
    - In ancient Greece and Rome, there was the idea that the law had a role in limiting power.
- Medieval conversion.
    - The [[Magna Carta]] of 1215 was an important step toward curbing the monarch's arbitrary exercise of power and calling for rule under law.
- Enlightenment Era Development.
    - Enlightenment thinkers] of the 17th and 18th centuries (e.g., [[John Locke]], [[Montesquieu]]) further systematized the concept of the "rule of law" in the modern state.

Thus, the rule of law, while rooted in ancient legal systems, took on modern connotations after the Middle Ages.
