title: "Self-perception of not making a choice"

- [[How do you know what your life choices are?]]
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1391679068651724803): It's odd that people who appear to be making "choices" from the outside can have a self-perception of "not making choices," which from the outside appears to be a cognitive distortion. I think that [[cognitive distortion]] is what prevents many people from being aware of their choices.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1391680015935311874): It is obvious that the choices themselves and the amount of them vary from person to person. For example, if you are born physically weak, your options to become an athlete are much thinner. Parents' economic status and ideology also strongly influence a child's choices, and the case of the rural school teacher who has his student delete his social networking account shows how much opportunity is lost by taking away that choice...
- > [ukkaripon](https://twitter.com/ukkaripon/status/1391681903808290820): When I give lectures to children, I often talk about how the degree of effort required to make a choice or achieve an outcome depends on the previous choice I often tell them that the degree of effort required to make a choice or to achieve a result depends on the choices they made before and on the environment around them. So it was not too much [[the obvious choice]] that you don't have to work hard if you don't think you have a choice.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1391759679693344769): In terms of "natural choice", most people who think they are not making a choice are making a choice to attend school if they are in Japan. They may not be aware of the choice not to attend, but they are in a position to make a choice. There are many children in the world who really don't have a choice to attend school. unicef.or.jp/about_unicef/a...
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1391759836149207045): the thought of taking something for granted makes choices invisible.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1391760387838672901): Some of the reported cases included "changed universities from graduate school, changed departments". This means that implicitly, there is a widespread false assumption that it is normal to go to the same school in the same department, and this assumption prevents people from being aware of their options.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1391763476058497027): There are cases where a child chooses to "take his/her life" because of bullying without being able to see "the choice to attend school" or "the choice not to attend school", I feel very sorry for them, and I think it is the responsibility of adults to make them aware of the "choice not to attend school" and the "choice to escape from unpleasant situations", so that they can choose to do so.
