The goal is to catch the ball in one of the cup-shaped areas or to spike it onto the pointed end. It's not just a child's game; people of all ages enjoy it.

Kendama tests your hand-eye coordination, balance, and concentration. It has also gained international popularity and is now played by enthusiasts worldwide.

Miyama Hiroshi, a Japanese Enka singer, has a special connection with kendama. During the 68th NHK Kohaku Uta Gassen (2017), a famous Japanese music show, Miyama and others attempted to set a kendama Guinness World Record while he sang, but they were unsuccessful. In 2018, at the 69th NHK Kohaku Uta Gassen, Miyama and a group succeeded in their kendama challenge, setting a Guinness World Record. In the following years, during the NHK Kohaku Uta Gassen shows, there were more attempts at kendama challenges. Some were successful, setting new records, while others were not.

In 2023, VERNON, a member of the 13-member group SEVENTEEN, participated in a performance with MIYAMA Hiroshi.
