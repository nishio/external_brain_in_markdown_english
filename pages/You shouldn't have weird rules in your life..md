title: "You shouldn't have weird rules in your life."

> [shu_yamaguchi](https://x.com/shu_yamaguchi/status/1918425980923986226) You shouldn't set strange rules for your life. You should not set strange rules in your life, such as "I don't work with people who are slow to reply to my e-mails" or "I don't associate with people who drink beer before me". This is a kind of [[curse]].
- Life's [[option value]].

> [fladdict](https://x.com/fladdict/status/1918471049303474212) Agreed. The so-called "[[hand advantage]]" ([[advantage in number of cards in hand]]).
>  The only time to reduce hands is when you have "too many cards in your hand and decision-making is congested"; otherwise, more hands are better. Otherwise, it is better to have more hands.

> [fladdict](https://x.com/fladdict/status/1918472729201918463) Basically, since the strongest winning pattern for trekkers is "[[hand card destruction]]", the exact opposite is true: hand card restrictions are a strong handicap.
