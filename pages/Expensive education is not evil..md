title: "Expensive education is not evil."

Expensive educational methods are not evil in themselves.
The existence of expensive learning methods is not negated by the fact that "another method can be used to learn at a lower cost."
It is not "everyone should study on their own, so cram schools, tutors, and universities are evil."
It cannot be said that "English conversation schools are evil because listening to NHK Radio English is free."
It doesn't follow that "buying a paid technical book is bad because there are free web articles."

One person X might decide, "I'll study on the less expensive side, I don't need the more expensive side," but [[No one is equal to the market.]].
If another person Y chooses the expensive method after learning of the inexpensive method, that is Y's freedom, not the decision of an unrelated third party X.
If Y does not know the inexpensive way and chooses the expensive way, and you think it is not good, you can teach Y the inexpensive way.
It is a common phenomenon that sellers of expensive methods do not tell buyers about less expensive methods, and it is futile to say [[inexcusable]] to that.
