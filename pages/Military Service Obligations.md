    - [[Germany]] - suspended conscription in 2011 and is now a volunteer force.
    - [[America]] United States - Since 1973, the draft has been suspended and replaced by a volunteer military system.
- [[Canada]] - Conscription ended after World War II and is now a volunteer military system.

The status of military service varies from country to country, including Japan, and depends largely on the country's [[security guarantee (e.g. military security, network security, etc.)]] policy and historical background. The availability of military service is one of the policies that vary greatly from country to country.
