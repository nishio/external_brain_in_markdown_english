title: "Homo sapiens inevitability decline"
---

- I was looking at [[S-shape development of technology]] and digging into the keyword [[sic transit gloria mundi]], and I thought that the reason why I don't feel that [[Homo sapiens]] remains [[core existence]] when I think of [[progress of civilization]] is [[world view]] of [[Homo sapiens inevitability decline]]. I cannot feel that [[Homo sapiens inevitability decline]] is [[world view]] when I think of [[progress of civilization]].



- [[Homo sapiens]] / [[must decline]]
- The feeling that [[Homo sapiens]] will continue to be [the lord of creation
    - [[The spirit of all things is the cat.]]
