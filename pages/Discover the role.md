If you haven't been able to discover your [[role]].
- The type of person who gets anxious.
    - Why are you worried?
        - Feel that fulfilling your role and being appreciated by those around you is a good reason for you to be there
            - [[desire for affinity]]
- People who start stating their own theories in a chat channel.
    - Why?
        - If you don't play any role, no one will pay attention to you.
        - Especially in online venues, those who just exist and don't speak up are nothing.
        - That's where they try to gain attention.
        - [[Authority Desire]].
    - People with high [[desire to achieve]] start working on their own.
    - In some cases, however, the goals that the individual wants to achieve are not in line with the goals of the organization.
