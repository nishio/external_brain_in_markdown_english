title: "Worldcoin and Curve"

- A few days after writing the first part of [[AI's Impact on Labor Market May Not Be Mitigated by UBI in Japan]], I realized
- Might not be right.

I wasn't sure what "[[Worldcoin is a governance token]]" meant, but it may be the same as "[CRV tokens become a vote in distribution decisions.

I felt the need to be able to understand [[Curve War]].

> At launch, the maximum circulating supply of WLD is 143 million, 43 million of which will be allocated to users verified during pre-launch and 100 million will be given in loans that will expire in three months to non-U.S. market makers, the firm said.
>  75% of the tokens have been earmarked for the community, 13.5% to investors of Tools for Humanity, 9.8% to the initial development team and 1.7% in reserve. The allocation to insiders has increased to 25% from 20% stated earlier because the process of developing and launching the network was more "complex and costly" that initially thought, as well as the challenging market environment. Investor and team tokens will be locked up at launch and slowly released after the first year and for the next two years.
