title: "Derailed class + one-way class = flipped class"
---

- [[derailment]] is "[[unexpected]] development of a topic," and when the purpose is to develop a topic, it is the same phenomenon as 1 of the 7 opportunities for innovation, "[[Unexpected Success]]". On the other hand, in the evaluation of the [[subtraction method]], where there is a schedule and "it is negative if it cannot be done as planned," unexpected development is suppressed because it appears to be a negative thing that takes resources away from what was planned.

For a fixed "[[lecture]]" with no unexpected developments, take a video and play it.
- Rather, there is an approach where students come to take a class after watching a video, which is what is called "reverse teaching.
- > In this type of class, students prepare for new learning content by watching video lessons, usually at home, and there is no lecture in the classroom; on the contrary, the teacher provides individualized instruction and students work with other students on assignments that would traditionally be considered homework.
