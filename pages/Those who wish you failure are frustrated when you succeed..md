Those who wish you failure will be frustrated when you succeed. So ignore them and continue your efforts toward success. The most clever way to punish them is in the form of "your success".

- My own plain version of what [[Baltasar Gracián.]] said.
- > [The most ingenious punishment is to make your success a poison for your opponent. [The most ingenious punishment is to make your success a poison for your opponent.
