title: "Changes in the way we learn"
---

Compared to a hundred years ago, there has been a huge change in [[Worth learning about]] versus [[Learn how]].
For example, on [[Learn Programming]], it is not appropriate for 50 students in one class to learn by transcribing what the teacher writes on the blackboard in their notebooks.

This change is due to the new and increased number of "things worth learning.
- The appropriate [[way of learning]] depends on the [[subject of study]], and since there is a new subject, a new way of learning is needed.
For those who do not see this "new increase", there appears to be no change.
