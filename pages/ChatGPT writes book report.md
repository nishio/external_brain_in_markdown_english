> A fifth-grade girl wrote a book report on her own study, and she was too good for it,
>  "Did your mother help you by any chance?" I asked him, "No, no. No, no. This was written by ChatGPT. I think the essay contest may be full of AI from this year.

>  Since the topic came up in the classroom, I taught the following lesson
>
>  ①Write an essay
>  ② Correction with ChatGPT
>  ③ Read and compare
>  4) Ask AI to tell you why the changes were made.
>  ⑤ Keep a notebook of what you have learned
>  ⑥Discuss the taste that AI cannot produce
>  ⑦ Add usable parts and modify
>
>  I want to work with children to learn how and where to use AI
