title: "Maybe not enough input."
---

> [rootport](https://twitter.com/rootport/status/1714496675543453869) I've been seeing a lot on TL the past few days, "A million people have come up with the same idea. Out of them, 10,000 people think of moving their hands, 1,000 people actually move their hands, 10 people complete it, and only 1 person can write it in an interesting way. I completely agree with this, but I feel that it is difficult for the general public who are not involved in creative activities to understand.

> [rootport](https://twitter.com/rootport/status/1714497471949529470) For example, a person who always watches one movie a month can be called a "movie buff" in the eyes of the public. But that is only 12 films per year. On the other hand, people who are engaged in creative activities can easily watch more than 100 movies a year. The amount of input is extraordinary, and they frequently experience "I've seen a similar scene before. I've seen a similar scene before.

> [rootport](https://twitter.com/rootport/status/1714498730131681742) Anyone who watches 100 movies a year will find [[James W. Young]]'s assertion that "ideas are nothing more than new combinations of existing elements" s assertion that "ideas are nothing more than new combinations of existing elements" will feel right. With the exception of "The Tempest," all of Shakespeare's works were adaptations of existing stories or historical facts. Even that "The Tempest" was inspired by a real-life maritime disaster.
- [[Ideas are new combinations of existing ones]].

Even One Piece, which seems to be all original, is made in such a way.

I think too many people are unaware of the cost of the time it takes from thinking, "Oh, I found something relevant," to retrieving it, as well as the lack of input.
- Since the time when there was no computerized search, people have been trying to retrieve information efficiently in the form of [[information cards]] and so on.
- [[Information design is "the art and knowledge of preparing information in such a way that people can use it efficiently and effectively."]]
