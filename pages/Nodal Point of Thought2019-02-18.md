    - [[Header Table of Contents is a tree]]
    - [[Relational connections between fragments]]
    - [[Link from Scrapbox text]]

- The KJ method focuses on [[seem relevant]], not [be similar
- Scrapbox does not tag [[stock associations]].
- → [[Associations, not analogies]]

- Consider that the KJ method is done by a machine, not a human: [[The machine does the KJ method.]].
    - [[Device for generating associations]] Suppose R is given
    - It is a device that takes one fragment as input and returns another fragment
    - There are already various ways to realize this: [[Relational connections between fragments]].
- However, the KJ method finds "[[Things that might be relevant]]" from the 100 written down and places them nearby.
- I naively thought this "[[seem relevant]]" was [[similarity]], but that is incorrect.
    - In fact, when I teach the KJ method, I repeatedly say, "It's not about collecting similarities.
    - Examples: [[Conflict is a close relationship]] [[What is a relationship?]]
    - Just as Scrapbox, the [[stock of associations]], encourages new [[associative connections]] via 2-hop links, so does this [[search]].
- From the given 100, we search by association, and the first pair that merges is the "likely related pair".
        - [[Confluence of associations]]
    - I thought of [[associative device]] as having fragments as input and fragments as output
    - But in the KJ method, "something that might be related" doesn't have to be verbalized at the right time to lay out "why it's related."
    - Posteriori connected: [[Relationships where topics are connected...]].
    - Isn't it too restrictive for an associative device to output fragments?
    - Couldn't it be a vector instead of a language?
        - I thought that, when you look at it as a vector, if you reduce the flow of "language -> vector -> vector -> language", it is "language -> language" after all, and there is only an implementation pattern of an associative device that "involves a vector in the associative process".

- Annotation to assign a 2D vector to a set of short sentences = [[KJ method]].
