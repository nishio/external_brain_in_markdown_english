title: "Determine who to persuade"
---

Persuasion is costly. Therefore, if it is not done after identifying the target to be persuaded, it will be a waste of cost.

It is not appropriate behavior to say, "I'm persuaded because I've been rebutted," or "I'm familiar with you, so I'll persuade you."

- A slight concretization of [Don't persuade people you don't need to persuade.
