Support for multi-line import
    - Import support when copying and pasting from Facebook, Slack, etc.
    - line unit
        - line-by-line filter
            - Swipe to OK/NG
            - I'd like to see it learn on the browser.
                - Well, let's start with something simpler.
            - We can start with the rule base.
→ This should be done on a separate screen.
- On a larger screen, separate from the map and such.
- It would be nice if we could export a short list of sentences.
- It would be nice to be able to put it on Scrapbox.
