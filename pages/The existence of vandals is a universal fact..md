title: "The existence of vandals is a universal fact."

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1962219198547103874) When they see someone creating something new, some people feel inferior and destroy what is created because they don't want to admit it. Destruction is not good, and it is sad that it was destroyed, but the existence of destroyers is a universal fact, so if you don't want your work to be destroyed, you have to put it out of the reach of the destroyers.

I felt the sadness of having my works destroyed many times when I was in elementary school, and after passing the junior high school entrance exam, I entered a world without such vandalism, so I came to feel that a [[permissionless]] society is essentially [[open to vandals]], [[Destruction is less expensive than creation]], [[The difficulty of getting in accumulates value inside. creation]], [The difficulty of getting in accumulates value inside. (I didn't acquire the vocabulary to express this until I studied organizational theory at MOT.)

relevance
    - [[wplace vandalism incident]]
    - [[How to deal with other people's words]]
    - [[Permissionless is not ideal alone.]]

- [[destruction]]
[[Inferiority to those who make it.]]
