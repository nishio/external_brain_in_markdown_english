> [ama_ch](https://twitter.com/ama_ch/status/1774207325525753869) "One learns by experience" is the Greek phrase "ta patemata, mathemata (what is suffered is learned (what is suffered is learned)," which suggests the image of "[[deed, suffering, recognition]]". By "deed," one suffers "[[suffering]]. What learning by experience implies is nothing other than reaching a higher level of [[recognition]] through [[suffering]] by [[action]]. "2)
