> The first stage of making small groups is at most a few sheets. And when they are small, there are usually a number of sheets that are not connected to other pieces of paper and remain as a single sheet. Such a single sheet is called a "detached monkey" or "[[loner]]" for convenience. This loner has a good reason for being alone and should never be forced into any one group, ignoring his/her arguments. It is better to think of them as [[one piece is one group]].
- [[Continuing Ideas]]  p.62
I sometimes verbally called them [[stray monkeys (any monkey of the family Lepismidae)]].
