Preconceived ideas are generally accepted ideas and values, formed by social experiences and customs. Stereotypes, on the other hand, are firmly held beliefs about certain things, often based on personal experience and prejudice. Both can hinder flexibility of thought, and recognizing and breaking through these can be important for gaining new perspectives.

Preconceptions and stereotypes are closely related. Preconceptions are social and cultural frameworks and common sense shared by many people. When these preconceptions become deeply rooted in an individual, they become fixed ideas, creating rigid thoughts and attitudes toward certain situations and things.

In other words, when preconceived notions are widely shared among people and are unconsciously accepted by individuals, they tend to appear as stereotypes and exclude different views and new ideas. Thus, there is a relationship between preconceived notions influencing stereotypes, and when stereotypes are reinforced, it becomes more difficult to think flexibly and respond to change.

Considering this discussion in the English language space, "preconceived notions" and "conventional wisdom" refer to common ideas and beliefs that are widely accepted throughout society. When these permeate people and become deeply embedded in their individual thinking, they appear as "stereotypes" or "fixed ideas. These fixed ideas make it difficult to accept new information and different perspectives.

In English discussions, the concepts of "[[fixed mindset]]" and "[[growth mindset]]" are often used, with the perspective that being stuck in a fixed mindset hinders personal growth and flexible thinking. The point here is a chain of "preconceived notions" imposed by society that can easily turn into "fixed ideas" at the individual level.

To put this back into Japanese, preconceived notions are widely shared social frameworks that, when deeply rooted in an individual, appear as fixed ideas. In English discussions, these stereotypes are identified as obstacles to growth and change, and the importance of a growth mindset is emphasized. For this reason, understanding how preconceived notions affect personal stereotypes is important for fostering flexible thinking.

Considering these concepts in the Chinese language space, "既成观念" or "传统观念" refer to widely accepted social and cultural ideas. When these preconceived notions influence individuals, they can be expressed as "固有观念" or "刻板印象". In particular, it is emphasized that "刻板印象" refers to fixed prejudices and stereotypes that hinder the acceptance of new information and different views.

In Chinese discussions, the terms "思维定式" and "思维局限" are often used, and these refer to fixed thought patterns or limits to thinking. This is seen as an impediment to flexible thinking as well as fixed ideas (刻板印象).

To explain this Chinese idea in Japanese, a preconceived idea (既成观念) is a fixed value or framework of thought that is widely recognized in society. When these become fixed within an individual, they appear as inherent ideas (固有观念) or stereotypes (刻板印象) and cause a narrowing of the range of thought. In Chinese, these are described as "思维定式" or "思维局限," and are understood to be factors that make it difficult to accept new perspectives and information.
