System introduced in 2003

> The "Designated Manager System" is a new system created by the Act for Partial Revision of the Local Autonomy Act enacted on September 2, 2003, which revised the "Management Consignment System" for the management of public facilities. Since there are no legal restrictions on the scope of designated managers, private companies and NPOs can manage public facilities in addition to conventional public organizations, and it is expected to improve services and efficiency of facility management.

> Because the procedure for selecting a designated manager is left entirely to the ordinance, it is not necessarily necessary to select a designated manager by [[public solicitation]] or other methods if it can be explained to the council and residents, and it is possible to stipulate in the ordinance that the PFI business can be selected as the designated manager. It is also possible to stipulate in the ordinance that a PFI provider can be selected as the designated manager.
