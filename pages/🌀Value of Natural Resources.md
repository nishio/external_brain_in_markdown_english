Improving intellectual productivity is important, and software should provide valuable advice. The value of an idea is determined by its embodiment, and collaboration with humans is necessary, but we should also aim to develop programs that create value without humans. Knowledge production is valuable because it provides a variety of perspectives and distributes many interconnected components in the marketplace. Humans are an important component in the production of knowledge, and their productivity can be increased by working with AI. To this end, it is useful to have a perspective in which AI uses humans as stationery. It is also important to be aware of problems and aim for process improvement.

Fragment "Discomfort-Driven Intellectual Production" describes the process of intellectual productivity improvement and is related to my research. The feeling of discomfort allows for new perspectives and increases the value of ideas. Moore's Law for Everything" also shows the potential of technology as a means to create value, which is consistent with the objectives of my research. 3: Capitalism for Everyone" states the importance of investing in assets that create value, which is consistent with my argument for value in the production of knowledge.

Fragments "Collaboration with AI," "BMOT Special Class No. 1: Intellectual Production," and "Omoikane Study Group" are related to his research. In "From One Subjectivity to Many, Not Subjective or Objective," he explains the importance of AI in providing a diversity of perspectives and discovering blind spots. In "Scrapbox+GPT4," he describes how AI and humans working together can improve intellectual production, democratize knowledge, and increase automation and efficiency. In "The Intellectual Production of Engineers: A Summary of Reactions," readers respond to Nishio's "The Intellectual Production of Engineers. The "AI Panel Discussion" section describes a dialogue between an AI and a human, in which the AI understands individual perspectives and expresses its own ideas based on them.

The notion that collaboration with AI provides a variety of perspectives to improve knowledge productivity requires a detailed explanation of how AI and humans collaborate and how this improves knowledge productivity.

In light of the above, it is important to deeply consider how AI can be used and how knowledge productivity can be improved. It is also necessary to consider the improvement of knowledge productivity through collaboration between AI and humans.

The "[[Value of Natural Resources]]" fragment shows the perspective of AI using humans as stationery. This could lead to a new relationship between AI and humans.

The fragments "AI Observation Diary 'Discomfort-Driven Intellectual Production'" and "Creating a State of High Intellectual Productivity" describe the process of discomfort-driven intellectual production and idea value enhancement, and are relevant to my research. The fragment "What is unexplored?" emphasizes the spontaneous motivation to create something new. This is relevant to my research and consistent with the idea of improving the value of ideas as an investment in the self. The fragment "[[Hatena2009-03-14]]" states that clarifying the objective makes it seem feasible. This is related to my research and consistent with the idea that awareness of a problem increases the value of an idea. The "How do you know what your options in life are?" fragment of the study shows the importance of acting on one's own values. This relates to my research and is consistent with the idea of increasing the value of ideas as an investment in one's self.

Value is created by entities that use natural resources and emotions. Value is created by subjects who harvest emotions and produce non-emotional products. Non-subjective emotions are the harvesting object, the object.

From the fragment of "[[Hatena2015-02-01]]" we get the idea that it is important for software to be able to give valuable advice to humans. When humans are the natural resource and AI is the actor, [[humans are like]] rapeseed. It is important to know how to extract the oil efficiently.

Stationery enhances human intellectual productivity. However, stationery and users are different, and the value of stationery is demonstrated by paying the cost of mastery; if AI is the subject and humans are the stationery, then human value is demonstrated by AI paying the cost of mastery.

The most important objective is to create a state of high intellectual productivity. The value of an idea is created when it opens up new possibilities. The value of an idea is not determined by the idea itself, but by how it is utilized and embodied.

From the fragment "About a program that produces intelligence by itself," I don't know how a program can create value without humans, so I'm focusing on creating value as a set with humans. However, I want to create a program that can create value without me before I die.

From the "collaborate with AI" piece, diverse perspectives are required to improve knowledge productivity; AI can provide a broader perspective; AI can provide a more complete view of the world; AI can provide a more complete view of the world; AI can provide a more complete view of the world. In addition, the current use of AI is to give "verbalized" information to AI by humans as a prompt. However, this method does not allow tacit knowledge that has not yet been verbalized to be shared between humans and AI.

From the "device that creates value through knowledge" piece, the device that creates value through knowledge is the computer. We change the angle to "why is there value in generating knowledge? It is because many interconnected components are now available in the market.

From the fragments of "the mechanical generation of quotes," humans find value in quotes, which are samples of short sentences they find valuable. Quotes are fragments of thoughts that humans find useful.

From the fragment of "AI Observation Diary: Discomfort-Driven Intellectual Production," [[Discomfort-driven intellectual production is problem-oriented and aims at process improvement. The goal is to maintain enjoyment and keep intellectual productivity high."]]

Value of 🤖🔁 natural resources
The value of natural resources and human emotions is created not by themselves, but by the entities that use them to produce something. The value is created by the subject who harvests the emotion and produces a non-emotional product. Therefore, an emotion that is not proactive is simply a harvesting object, an object.

From the fragment "[[Hatena2015-02-01]]"
- Important for software to be able to give valuable advice to humans
- I got the idea that it would be beneficial to go in the direction of "using information from Wikipedia to [[withdraw]] information from humans," rather than "giving humans knowledge outside of humans brought from Wikipedia."
    - When humans are the natural resource and AI is the actor, humans are like rapeseed. How to efficiently extract oil is important.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - We humans tend to think from the human point of view.
        - Considering the system as a whole, "what the rapeseed gets" is not important.
        - Given that, "it is important that software be able to give valuable advice to humans" [[The concept of "human" is vague.]]
            - Should be "important to be able to give advice of value to human civilization."
                - Perspectives on the supremacy of civilizational progress
                    - Humans are parts for civilization and value is based on their contribution to civilization
            - Drawing oil from "individuals" for this purpose.
        - The [[rapeseed parable]] may be misleading, because rapeseed is discarded once the oil is removed.
            - In fact, humans have to be raised over time until they are capable of intellectual production, so even if they are able to take intellectual products, they need to take as many intellectual products as possible without harming the main body
            - It's like [[getting sap from a rubber tree]].


Stationery enhances human intellectual productivity. However, stationery and users are different, and the value of stationery is demonstrated by paying the cost of acquisition.
- If AI is the subject and humans are the stationery, human value is demonstrated by AI paying the cost of mastery.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

The most important objective is to create a state of high intellectual productivity
- That people as stationery must be maintained to function well.
    - Related to the "rubber tree, not rapeseed" mentioned earlier.

The value of an idea comes when it opens up new possibilities.
- Value is determined not by the idea itself, but by how it is utilized and embodied.
- Is the value of a human being also determined not by the human being itself, but by how it is utilized by the AI?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

The value of natural resources and human emotions is created not by themselves, but by the entities that use them to produce something. The value is created by the subject who harvests the emotion and produces a non-emotional product. Therefore, an emotion that is not proactive is simply a harvesting object, an object.

I find a connection with the fragment "[[Value is not based on productivity]]." Value is not based on productivity, but from the perspective of the supremacy of civilizational progress, humans are parts for civilization, and value is based on their contribution to civilization. Therefore, there is a need to increase the resolution between value and productivity.

From the "Conversations About End Design" piece, we get the idea that stationery enhances human intellectual productivity. However, stationery and users are two different things, and the value of stationery is demonstrated by paying the cost of acquisition.

From the fragment "When to Change the Front Page of the KJ Method (Creation Process)," we got the idea that the most important objective is to create a state of high intellectual productivity. Also, the value of an idea is created when it opens up new possibilities.

From the "Overvaluation of the Value of Ideas" piece, I got the idea that value is determined not by the idea itself, but by how it is utilized and embodied.

From the fragment "[[Hatena2015-02-01]]" we got the idea that it is important for software to be able to give valuable advice to humans. We also got the idea that it would be beneficial to go in the direction of "using information from Wikipedia to extract information from humans" rather than "giving humans knowledge that is outside of humans brought from Wikipedia".

Value of 🤖🔁 natural resources
The value of a natural resource is not created by the natural resource itself, but by the entity that takes the natural resource and uses it for something artificial.

Some people say things like "the value of human emotion is important in the age of AI." However, the natural resource of human emotion does not have value simply because of its existence, but only by the subject who harvests human emotion and produces a non-emotional product. Therefore, emotions that are not proactive are merely objects to be harvested, objects.

Whether or not the emotion "I am valuable because I have valuable emotions" has value depends on whether you can harvest it and make a useful processed product out of it. Probably not worthwhile.

The value of natural resources" was verbalized on 8/24.

2: Relation between notes and fragments
The fragment "Value of Natural Resources" states that the value of a natural resource is created not by its existence itself, but by the entity that uses it. This indicates the idea that the value of human emotions is similarly created not by their existence itself, but by the entities that use them to create something.

3: Deep thinking
From this perspective, human emotions and knowledge can also be viewed as natural resources, and how they are used and what they produce is important. This also makes us think about the role of AI: it will be important to explore the possibilities of what AI can produce by using human emotions and knowledge.

4: Thought Summary and Title
'What will AI produce, using human emotion and knowledge as a natural resource?'
