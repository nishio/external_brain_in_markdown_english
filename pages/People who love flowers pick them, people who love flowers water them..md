Buddha's excellent answer to this question, 'If you say you love flowers, you would just pick them. But if you love flowers, you will take care of them every day and water them every day. If you pick the flowers, they will wither. Don't forget that [[love]] is not something to [[possess]], but to ″[[gratitude]].

> Bernard Shaw said, ”I love flowers, that’s why. I love children too, but I would not like anybody to cut off their heads and arrange those heads on my table.”
>  Bernard Shaw says: "Because I love flowers. I also love children. But no one would want to cut off its head and put it on their table."
