title: "simple contact effect"

> The mere exposure effect is an effect in which repeated contact (even under a threshold) increases liking and impressions of a person. Zajonc (1968).
[Simple contact effect - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8D%98%E7%B4%94%E6%8E%A5%E8%A7%A6%E5%8A%B9%E6%9E%9C)

> "Misattribution of perceptual [[fluency]]" theory
> "Continued contact with a stimulus increases affinity for the stimulus by increasing processing efficiency at the perceptual information-processing level for the stimulus. This increase in [[affinity]] is falsely attributed to a liking for the stimulus itself.
