I will discuss [[marginal return]] in the context of this essay.
Amodei places particular emphasis on the concept of "marginal returns on intelligence. This refers to "how much additional outcome can be obtained from an increase in intelligence.

To illustrate with a specific example:
- Examples of common marginal returns in economics:
    - When adding fertilizer to farmland
    - The first unit has a big effect.
    - The additional effects gradually become smaller and smaller.
    - At some point, the additional benefits almost disappear.
- For marginal returns on AI intelligence:
    - Simply increasing intelligence does not lead to unlimited results.
    - Other limiting factors exist:
        - Speed limits in the physical world (e.g., time required for an experiment)
        - Data needs
        - Intrinsic complexity
        - Human constraints (e.g., laws and regulations)
        - Constraints by the laws of physics

Key Points:
- If progress in a field is "high marginal returns on intelligence," it means that significant progress can be expected as smarter beings (AI) are introduced
- Example: biological discoveries could be greatly accelerated with smarter researchers
- On the other hand, in fields that require physical experimentation, time constraints are inevitable, no matter how high the intelligence

This framework is considered a key concept in understanding how fast AI can make progress in any given field.
