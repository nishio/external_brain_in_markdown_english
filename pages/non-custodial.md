- Non-custodial" is a term often used in the context of financial services and blockchain technology to refer to users retaining full control of their assets (usually cryptocurrency).
- Specifically, in a non-custodial wallet or service, the user retains his or her private key (a digital code that controls access to the assets). In contrast, in custodial services, the service provider retains the user's private key and takes control of the assets.
- The main advantage of non-custodial services is that users retain complete control over their assets. This means that the user's assets are not at direct risk in the event of hacking or fraud by the service provider. On the other hand, however, users are responsible for their own security and must take extra care in managing their private keys and security measures.
