One of the characteristics of Japanese-style organizations is that they do not work without "[[understanding]]" from the field, even if they are instructed by the top. Then, when I asked GPT-4 to organize how to create that "[[understanding]]" from a psychological perspective, he came up with something that nodded to my experience as well. They are really good at organizing these concepts.

When we tried to roll out the new sales territory model to frontline salespeople, there was a strong emotional backlash. I believe that in order to "persuade" them, we need them to be "[[convinced]]." Please identify 5-10 elements that are necessary for people to be "convinced" of something, using a checklist based on a psychological model.

Using these elements to explain and interact with the implementation of the new sales territory model will help to promote better understanding and conviction.
- 1: [[Provide Reasons]]: When people accept something, it is important to understand the reasoning or rationale behind it.
    - Explain why the new model is necessary and how it will contribute to sales results.
- 2: [[Ensure Self-Involvement]]: People respond more positively to things in which they are personally involved. Provide opportunities for sales members to be part of the implementation process of a new model.
- 3: [[Trust and Respect]]: When people feel trusted and respected, they are more likely to accept information and change.
    - It is a good idea to respect the opinions of the field, explain accordingly, and share the reasons for the change.
- 4: [[Tangible Benefits]]: Specifying tangible benefits can motivate people to embrace the new changes. Showing the benefits and successes of the new model is a good way to do this.
- 5: [[communication]] : Change often brings anxiety. Regular communication and transparent sharing of information can help alleviate this anxiety.
- 6: [[Provide time]]: Convincing requires time to digest and adapt to new information. It is important to provide the right amount of time, rather than forcing speed.
- 7: [[Adaptation Support]]: Provides resources (training, guidelines, mentorship, etc.) to assist in adapting to the new model.
- 8: [[feedback]] : Make adjustments as appropriate based on actual application and response. This will create an environment in which employees can take ownership.
All of these elements are important to promote a sense of conviction and are based on psychological understanding. On the other hand, it is important to adaptively apply these elements to individual situations.
