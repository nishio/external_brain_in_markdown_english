title: "Strengths of weak ties"
---

> In 1970, Dr. Granovetter surveyed 282 white-collar men living in a suburb of Boston, U.S., to determine the [[sources of information]] that helped them find jobs. He found that 16% of those surveyed got their jobs through information from people they met frequently, i.e., people with strong [[social ties]], while the remaining 84% got their jobs through information from people they met infrequently, i.e., people with weak social ties. It was also found that the [[(degree of) satisfaction]] was greater for those who obtained their jobs through information from such "[[weak ties]]".
