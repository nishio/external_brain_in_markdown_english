title: "Make an impact that makes everyone want to do it."

- > Technology without economic rationality is not so (incremental), so innovation is needed. How to [[Make an impact that makes everyone want to do it.]] is the most important issue for innovation.

from  [[Ideas without implementation are no longer needed.]]

If you bite off "make an impact that makes everyone want to do it..."
- A: Create a minimum prototype that can be demonstrated
- B: Demonstrate it to get attention (=make sure lots of people see it)
- C: Out of the many people who see it, a few who want to do it appear.
- D: When that person does A~B, the engine of extended reproduction begins to turn.

> A: Create a minimum prototype that can be demonstrated
- [[Minimum Viable Product]]
- The concept of Viable is ambiguous, giving rise to the term [[Eariest Testable Product]].
- There is still ambiguity on "what to test" here.
    - The original context was venture startups, so it was "who would want to pay for it?" ([[customer existence hypothesis]])
    - From what's being said here, it looks like we're examining "whether this process will begin to expand and reproduce."
B: Demonstrate it to get attention (=make sure lots of people see it)
C: A few people who want to do it emerge from the many people who have seen it.
D: When that person does A~B, the engine of extended reproduction begins to turn.

- The [[Digital Democracy 2030]] movement seems to fit quite well as a concrete example.
