title: "The division of roles is also unclear."
---

When I talk to AIs, they often say things like, "[[Role assignments are]] unclear," but I think the assumption that roles can be clearly assigned is not appropriate and can even be counterproductive, especially in small teams.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>While role assignment may be effective in large organizations, it can be rather unnatural and constraining in small teams. In a small environment, each person can cover multiple areas in a flexible manner, cooperating and complementing each other as the situation requires, allowing for a more organic progression. The ideal of "role assignment" should be reconsidered, especially for small teams, as strict role assignment can inhibit small turnover, learning, and emergent ideas, and hinder the productivity and growth of the team as a whole.
