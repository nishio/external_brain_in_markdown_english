title: '"Putting it all together" and "getting it together."'
---

Jiro Kawakita sometimes describes "[[summarize]]" and "[[be collected]]" as different things.
- It's not that humans [[I'll try my best to summarize.]], it's that [Data is compiled on its own.
- When people who have experienced "[[come to one's own]]" hear this, they say, "Oh, that.
- If you have no experience, you may be thinking, "It comes together on its own? How is that possible?" p.53
- It is similar to explaining a bicycle in words to someone who has never ridden it [[Parable of the Bicycle]], but they don't get it.

In Ideas, p. 53, he writes
- > While I was obsessed with the vague, big-broth term, "compiling materials," my research materials were "[[inconsistent]]," which is a very ironic result.
- The rest of the section is abstract and difficult to communicate.
    - > It "comes together" only when both methods of summary analysis and integration are exercised in their entirety in a relevant manner.
- He uses the strong phrase "ambiguous and big talk."
    - In short, I'm pointing out that everyone thinks they know what "putting it all together" means, and that I think I can do it, but I'm not sure what exactly "putting it all together" means.
- [[let the chaos speak for itself]], p. 331, counterposes the KJ method with "[[Normal summary thoughts]]."

- p.332〜334:
    - Mosaic World
    - An ecological world of seamless meaning
- This is an interesting story, but I'll explain it another time.
- roughly speaking
        - [[summary thought]] is beneficial because it reduces decision time, but we tend to use it even in situations where it is not available
    - Then the "well-organized parts" become a pieced together "[[Mosaic World]]".
    - Explore Net is "[[seamless]]" to connect the pieces together.
