title: "The first person to move is the one who moves alone."
---

When a group of humans changes from being stationary to being in motion, one person is the first to move, except when some external stimulus causes them to move all at once. For this to happen, this person must be someone who does not care that "those around him are not moving.

In an organization of three or more people, those who take "not moving" as the "will of the majority" cannot move because "other than myself" is the majority.

The reason why I believe in "Originality first before co-creation" is because "Act without regard for others..." is a useful characteristic for creating something new.
