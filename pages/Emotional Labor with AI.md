- What can be done immediately with generative AI, specific examples of use
    - Bullet points" into "natural sentences" and vice versa
    - Text-based "[[emotional labor]]" that falls under
        - Polite thanks to business partners, etc.
    - Halcination occurs when an AI tries to compensate for something that is not included in the input sentence according to "common sense," and thus gives an answer based on a false premise.
    - Tasks that only change the format of the input are difficult to halucinate.
        - Bullet points, summaries, translations, careful writing, etc.
    - Texting jobs that don't require information to be included should be left to AI.
    - Tasks for LLMs, since "emotional labor" does not increase the amount of information

I've learned that I can call such things "emotional labor".

I often do a lot of emotional labor, such as "Make the bullet points into sentences that the person who reads them will see them in a positive light and take action on them.

In other words, there are two kinds of people depending on how they communicate, and in fact, even if they think they are speaking the same language, they are not communicating, which is why there is value in having an LLM in between to "interpret" for them.
