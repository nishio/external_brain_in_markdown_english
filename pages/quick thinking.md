title: "quick thinking"
---

It appears to me that the quick thinking that can be trained by training is the training of the neural nets in the brain by putting in sufficient input and output, and then using those neural nets as [[oracles]] to reduce the processing cost in the layers of symbolic manipulation.

If so, isn't this a skill that just isn't done yet, but will be eradicated in the future by "neural nets that have more [[case knowledge]] than humans can experience"?

I don't know which comes first, being replaced by the system or being lost by [[adding to one's years]].
