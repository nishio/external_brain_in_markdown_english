title: "People who want to wear avatars and communicate."

There are people who want to communicate wearing avatars, [[who want to communicate as themselves]], [who want to create space

> [hiroko_TB](https://twitter.com/hiroko_TB/status/1727234930646893026) because normal people don't want to wear avatars and communicate and stuff.
>  >MutsuPachi_Ch: People often say the reason VR is not popular is because it's expensive.
>  Some people are asking for 20,000.
>  Yes, Quest3 may be expensive.
>  But you can buy a Quest2 or PICO4 for 40,000 yen, and a PS5 for 40,000 or 50,000 yen.
>  Why do you want such low prices only for VR? It's not smartphone VR.

I don't do VRChat. | Ashiyama Hiroko's site and blog](https://www.hirokotb.com/2021/11/vrchatvrchat.html)
    - [[VRChat is a reincarnation of another world]]

> [sifue](https://twitter.com/sifue/status/1727333177633767772) Agreed. It's partly because they don't want to wear an avatar, and [[for most people, having a second identity is often a mental stress]] I feel that it's rare for people to be able to establish both a primary identity and a VRC identity in a VRC or something. It's usually a high mental load to use [[multiple identities]].
- > [sifue](https://twitter.com/sifue/status/1727506983757176849) By the way, this feeling is based on more than 3 years of my own activities promoting VR to more than 20,000 people every year. I also assume that the second identity we are talking about here is not to the extent of differences in behavior from one community to another, but to the extent that name, gender, personality, appearance, and age are also different from the first original identity.

> [yuiseki_](https://twitter.com/yuiseki_/status/1727469567285571875) Heh. I wonder if people like [[their appearance]] so much, or if their dislike of being something they are not is stronger than their dislike of being something they are not. I hate what I look like, and I hate even being human, so I decided to stop, and I ended up on earth...

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1727570877653582159) I don't hate my figure, but I don't like it either, and I don't have a figure I want to be, but rather [[I feel uncomfortable with the physical localization of the body]]. I feel uncomfortable with the physical localization of the body], so if I were asked what I want to be, I would say [[I want to be a space]].
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1727571468006101336) In VRChat, I am definitely the latter if I have to choose between those who create their own avatars and those who create their own worlds. As for my own personal avatar, I can use an appropriate preset, and if I am asked to create one because it is difficult to identify the individual, I would create a body with an appropriate geometric shape.
