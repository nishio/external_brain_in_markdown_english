>  Programming is the process of articulating what needs to be thought about, expressing it in the language of the listener, checking if the message is conveyed correctly, and then refining the expression until the listener can think on your behalf.
>  Typically, 'the listener' is not a human but a computer, and until the advent of ChatGPT in 2022, 'the listener's language' was a programming language.
