title: "(0.0) What is intellitech?"
---

[[intellitech]] = [[intelligence]] + [[technology]]

It is [[知的生産術]] in Japanese. By literal translation, [[知的]] is [[intellectual]], [[生産]] is production or creation, [[術]] is [[art]] or [[technique]].

I use the word for technology to boost your creativity.
