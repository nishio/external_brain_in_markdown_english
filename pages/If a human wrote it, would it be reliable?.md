title: "If a human wrote it, would it be reliable?"
---

The assertion that "[[a]]ny writing by an AI is unreliable."
If a human wrote it, would it be reliable?

Subdivide "human."

Some people make an effort to be credible and others do not.


What increases reliability?
- [[foundation]] or [[knowledge consistency]], right?
