- The trick is to put the number at the beginning of the radio button choices.
    - Aggregate by number of records and sort in ascending or descending order rather than by "aggregate value".
    - Then the 6 o'clock position on the pie chart would be the median.

At this point, I'm thinking, "When I put them in ascending order, the 6's are in front of them? Why is that?" There was a
That's what the ambiguity of "ascending or descending order" is all about.

    - (I thought it was, but it wasn't.)
    - Aggregate by number of records and sort in ascending or descending order rather than by "aggregate value".
        - The sorting at this time is by order of the choices, so 6 comes first in ascending order.
    - Then the 6 o'clock position on the pie chart would be the median.

    - (I thought it was, but it wasn't.)
    - Aggregate by number of records and sort in ascending or descending order rather than by "aggregate value".
        - The sorting at this time is in the order of the choices, so 6 comes first in ascending order (it doesn't matter that I put the number at the beginning).
    - Then the 6 o'clock position on the pie chart would be the median.
