The idea that [[the ability to collect taxes]] is [[the source of a currency's value]].
- "Fiat money has exchange value because it has sovereign power to [[tax]] economic activity paid for with the currency it issues."

[[Chartalism]] [Chartalism - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartalism)
> In macroeconomics, chartalism is a heterodox theory of money that argues that money originated historically with states' attempts to direct economic activity rather than as a spontaneous solution to the problems with barter or as a means with which to tokenize debt, and that fiat currency has value in exchange because of sovereign power to levy taxes on economic activity payable in the currency they issue.
