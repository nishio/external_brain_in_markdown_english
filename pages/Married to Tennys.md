Saw a [Tweet](https://x.com/ix5ois8nhoenwqa/status/1932412130420236747?s=46&t=gkSZtjGEtUZPO0JCzBxCBw) that said "I've had a couple of people who got [[married]] when I taught [Tennys, I was curious what that meant.
I read AI's commentary and thought, well, that's what I thought, so I'm reprinting it.

Why "teaching" tennies (Gemeinschaft/Gesellschaft) leads to marriage
- [Matching Apps: A Mass Comparison
    - [[Gesellschaft]] = market and transactional relationships
    - Fosters endless search for "maybe there is a better partner" and does not deepen the relationship
- Lack of shared intimate experiences
    - [[Gemeinschaft]] = affective and communal relations
    - The act of "spending time together," even at a cost, is the switch from a "transactional relationship" to a "community relationship.
    - [Conflict of [[self-realization]] vs.
    - Be aware of the binomial axis
    - "Am I comparing myself to my partner in the marketplace?" "Are we creating a "co-presence" together?" You can check yourself.
- Increased isolation
    - Society as a whole becomes Gesellschaft
    - Having a small Gemeinschaft, even a small one, evokes a sense of security and a long-term orientation.

Why "just teaching" works.
- Frames change behavior.
    - When informed of the "market-based evaluation -> communal collaboration" axis, unconscious selection criteria change.
    - Converted from "dating = comparing specs of the other person" to "we both [[nurture the place]] together.
- Rapid consensus building through language
    - The cost of matching values is drastically reduced because couples can talk about "this is an investment that will fatten up the Gemeinschaft".
- Visualization of "next steps
    - Since dating → engagement can be explained as a formalization of Gesellschaft → Gemeinschaft, it is easier for both parties to understand the "necessity of getting married.

Why the compatibility with modernity "stings like crazy".
- Advanced marketization x SNS fatigue
    - Every relationship becomes scoreable and comparable, and people are constantly imagining "better options".
    - Tennys sees this exhaustion as a structural problem and prescribes the creation of small communities.
    - [[remote work]] dilutes [[geographical]] and [[professional]] ties.
    - [The weakening of the physical community demands a theory that consciously designs "us.
- [[Self-branding culture]].
    - In contrast to the trend to commodify self and others, Gemeinschaft-like affection, which "[[treats]] each other as ends rather than means," has become scarce.
