pIntEn Restart
2021-08-10
Looking back as we reboot
- I was moving forward in 2019 without a hitch, but it fell apart at the beginning of 2020 when [[COVID19]] buzzed me up and changed my lifestyle.
    - I used to go to a comic book cafe [[switching tasks from one location to another]] instead of at work or at home, so I can't do that anymore.
    - It's not something I'm in a hurry to talk about, so I put it on hold until things settle down.
- As far as progress sheets go, this is an excuse not to do it.
    - The next before that event is 2019-04-29, and the next after that is 2019-06-19, and the next after that is 2020-01-22.
    - What they were doing at this time of year.
        - They did a lot of things, but the biggest would be Regroup.
    - Regroup and translation were both in the plan, a colleague invited me to give a presentation on Regroup, and I had to work on a demo version before the deadline, so translation took a backseat.
- Phenomenon in which a task is interrupted because it is pushed aside by a more urgent task and will not be resumed
        - [[Phenomenon that long-term tasks interrupted by urgent tasks are not resumed.]]
