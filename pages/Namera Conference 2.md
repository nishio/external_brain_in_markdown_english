title: "Namera Conference 2"
---

2023-10-29 The last "name-your-enemy party" was so well received that we decided to continue it as the "[[name-your-price conference]]".

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Claude/icon' alt='Claude.icon' height="19.5"/>Based on Ken Suzuki's book "Smooth Society and Its Enemies," the "Namekura Conference" is a gathering of people who aim to realize a smooth society. At the second conference, the following topics were discussed
- The approach of IP Zukan and the possibility of blockchainization of ideas (Mr. Ryo Arai)
- Historical evolution of the Internet and Web technologies and the cycle of decentralization and centralization (Toshiya Tanaka)
- The similarities and differences between "The Smooth Society and Its Enemies" and "Plurality" proposed by RadicalxChange (Taiyo Hamada)
- The "Illusion of Evidence" brought about by the development of AI technology and how to deal with it (Mr. Toori)
- Proposal for a New Value Exchange System to Replace Currency (Mr. Kobayu)
Throughout the entire conference, both technical implementation and ideological discussions were held to realize a smoother and more cooperative society. Ken Suzuki concluded the conference with a message to the participants: "Let's make things, let's think about ideas, and let's do both at the same time.

- The subtitle of the last issue was "[[Smooth Society and Its Implementation]]."
- In Ken's words, "[[a community like]] Nukadoko."

# Delusions of knowledge mobility and the blockchain of ideas
.
- Mr. ryo arai ([[ryoar]])
- [Materials:](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Nh2eBpsD3vRMvsi5--b6AmkjN25WBLaVSD5bjwhq_N0/edit?usp=sharing)

Intellectual property illustrated book
- [IP Zukan | Creative Media for Matching IP and Business](https://chizaizukan.com/)
- Smooth knowledge
- IP Hunters Association
- IP is not limited to patents.
    - There is also free research for elementary school students, etc.
        - [野さいマスク：捨てても植物の芽が出る野菜由来のマスク | 知財図鑑](https://chizaizukan.com/property/461)とかかな<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- IP information is difficult to convey to non-specialists.
    - After reading and deciphering the information, we expand it with our "imagination", illustrate it, and transmit it.
            - [[Development by delusion]]
    - Often inquired about due to interest.
            - [[SF Prototyping]] に関連したものを感じる<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

Trigger (2018)
- multi-touch display
- Voice to Image" API
- Combined two IPs to create "a system in which images appear when you talk around the desk, and what you tap is later sent as minutes of the meeting.
    - The minutes don't have to be in text format, it's a way of showing them that destroys stereotypes.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- The application that was originally included was Whack-a-Mole.
    - It's a waste of time and effort to showcase something that has been developed over many years as "usable for whack-a-mole".
- [[sowawa]]>  display with multi-point touch, reminds me of Samsung [[SUR40]].

[[Markup Ratio]]
- How many times the cost of production are you able to sell the product for?
- Worst among developed countries
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/cb96f1f469ef0f60ee07bee10cc44530/thumb/1000)

Barriers to IP utilization
- Search, decipher and utilize
- Easy-to-understand translation
- delusional rapture
- Context discovery overlaid with social issues
- Visualize and disseminate
- Delusion leads to achievement.
    - Delusion accelerates distribution.
    - [[障壁を取り除く=なめらか化]]<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

Challenges and solutions we have been working on for three years
- High human labor costs
    - Struggling to grow as a media
- →Generated AI
    - Currently, the accuracy is still low, but the advantage of instant mass production
- Mining delusions mass-produced by generative AI
    - The same idea of "Couldn't this be used for packing materials? but the application of the idea may result in "ecological" or "cost reduction" benefits.
        - The "axes" and "cuts" are being discovered by the "differences" between "similar ideas."<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - [[Similarity -> What is the difference?]]
    - YukiJP> An example of how AI halcyonation can be used in a positive way
        - nishio> Sometimes you want the AI to be more halucinating.
        - sowawa> This goes along with what I was talking about with Ken earlier. It is more human or more fun to be halucinating.
    - YukiJP> I'd love to see some ideas that the AI generated but couldn't make into articles.
        - You could make that part of the program available to the public, for a fee. New business development personnel are likely to subscribe.
- Delusional Edition [[Pinterest]].
    - Generates a large number of 0 to 0.1 before 0 to 1.
        - Related: [[Miscellaneous but useful]] : The output by ChatGPT was [[miscellaneous]], so the time taken to edit it seemed to be more, but the benefit from the lower cost of starting to write far outweighed it.".

Chain of ideas
- Talk about being able to record ideas in a chain and distribute them to people at the source.
    - [[Retroactive Funding]]みがある<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - [[Easier to evaluate after results are achieved]].
            - → [[Easier to agree on what has helped than what has not]]

question
- Does it have to be a blockchain? It seems to me that recording an idea on a public chain would cause loss of novelty at that point and prevent subsequent patent applications?
    - There is a strong resistance to public disclosure, in some cases internally, but not for the general public.
    - Even if limited to internal disclosure, research, product development, and sales each have different perspectives, so it would be beneficial to create a system that bundles the contributions from these people's perspectives and links them to value, leading to the utilization of knowledge within the company.
- Semantic Web of Knowledge, Semantic Web in 3 dimensions
    - When you create a hierarchy or classification, you thereby fix the context to a single object.
    - In the Scrapbox domain, it's called the "[[dead text]]" problem.
        - Similarly, there would be a "[[dead IP]]" problem.
    - [[Knowledge needs to be stored on the network]].
        - [[MEMEX]]
- GPT
    - Make the document more fine-grained rather than stand-alone.
    - Then we could curate more.
    - 「 [[Evergreen notes should be atomic.]] 」を連想した<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Technology and Business Matching
    - There are people who are in charge of new projects and are having trouble
    - Start with your own patents
    - Delusion is like tagging.
        - 「 [[Expand the pertinence of useful concepts]] 」に関連してるように思った<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - ![image](https://gyazo.com/4970417a627f3ac7e1548767b80a8c6c/thumb/1000)
- What royalty model is the existing patent?
    - different
    - Patents will be published.
    - waiting game in a circle (game theory)
        - The power to protect where we want to protect ourselves.
        - The existence of arbitrage, which enables patent trolls, is a flaw in the system to begin with.
    - Rock-like ownership
        - lot
    - Radical Markets
    - Patents are information, reproducible goods, why they can be occupied.
        - Rather the opposite, the problem was that ideas could not be possessed, and patent laws were created to allow them to be possessed.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - [[Physical legalism]].
            - It made the "idea for which the registration of the establishment of the patent right was made" into "property that can be owned.
    - Arbitrage resolution, how do you do it?
        - Radical Markets' proposal is simple but doesn't seem to match this problem
- Today, when Internet searches have been replaced by generative AI, information can be obtained without looking at links.
    - Those who benefited from PV no longer did.
    - Similarly, a centralized AI can do the work of utilizing patent information.
        - Curated by AI
            - Determining the scope of useful information = calculation act
            - It's a high calculation, which is why it's so centralized.
            - Really?
            - Article 66(1) of the Patent Law: "A patent right shall arise upon registration of its establishment."<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - In short, the requirement to be recorded in the patent office ledger is an accrual requirement
- ken:
    - Talk about reducing distribution costs by narrowing down patterns.
        - Copyright Propagation → CC
            - 8 combinations of BY/NA/SA
        - I wrote about content propagation in Named Enemy as well.
            - 5.4.2 Open Content: Chain of Remixes and Value Propagation<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Feel free to use it ↔ Give me 10% of the proceeds.
            - There are many different combinations.
            - If the patterns are narrowed down, it would be easier to put them on the blockchain.
    - Regarding machine matching
        - An "efficient patent troll" could be achieved by optimization with proﬁt, not social good, as the objective function.
        - Need to be able to make Ethical decisions.
    - knowledge graph
        - LLMs move from static to dynamic graphs.
        - Network changes depending on context
        - Meaning-making becomes dynamic.
        - Information that "when A becomes possible, B becomes possible."
            - A number of elements are updated by the input that A is now possible, following the network
            - Dynamic Semantic Web

Discord
- Ikumi Akatsuka> Patents are supposed to keep knowledge open, but they tend to be used to keep it closed.
- nuun> It's a copyright context, not a patent context, but it's close to [[story protocol]].

    - [Story Protocol](https://www.storyprotocol.xyz/)
- YukiJP>
    - The idea itself of a system to replace patents with blockchain, which would return the money to the originator if used, has been around for about 5 years, so I'm curious what is preventing its implementation.
    - Friction with established forces responsible for patents? Simply difficult to implement at the ultra C level?
- Zhou Jingfang> When I was a member of "Unexplored IT," I made a presentation on how it would be great if we could create a system to systematically summarize previous research and then publish/develop it in a github-like format to create a github of thoughts.
    - [Developing an interactive summarization system for prior research -. Unexplored iPedia - Into a World No One Has Stepped Into Yet]](https://jinzaiipedia.ipa.go.jp/mitou_ipedia/development_result/post/先行研究をインタラクティブに要約するシステム)
    - After listening to today's talk, I have a gentle impression that it is important to create and provide tools that are indispensable for people to actually imagine and create their future, and to embed collaboration naturally in these tools.
- YukiJP> If IP is managed by blockchain, I wonder if it would be better to use consortium chain to create a foundation as a collaboration across companies, and the revenue from the realization would be automatically distributed.
- nishio> The phrase "patents are a game of camp" reminded me of the first story about "enclosing land and claiming ownership."
    - > The first who conceived the idea of enclosing a certain piece of land and declaring, "This is mine," and found people so congratulatory that they believed it as it was, was the true founder of the political society (the state). --- [Rousseau.
        - [[NameEnemy Association#64af5a3daff09e000035b7de]]
    - I see you had some land here.
        - [[Cultivation of the Nowhere Sphere]]?
    - [[Radical Markets]] also pointed out that it says.
- HiroHamada> I'll add a code for [[Molecule]], which offers IP-NFT for biotech companies, linking IP and NFT. [https://github.com/moleculeprotocol/ipnft-samples](https://github.com/moleculeprotocol/ipnft-samples)
- YukiJP>
    - It would be fun to have a big competition based on IP information.
    - A contest to see who can produce more interesting things, AI or not.
- Zhou Jingfang>
    - Why is it that both codes and ideas are information, but codes are allowed to expand in an OSS way and ideas are not?
    - → Because code implementations are expensive to reproduce, but "patent ideas" are not so costly to reproduce?
    - If it were access to chatGPT to reproduce the dialogue with the person who came up with the patent idea, could it be forked or something similar to the code?
    - sowawa> ↑I think it's possible.
- Ikumi Akatsuka> note that you can pay by AI to AI
- sowawa> This is the same thing [[lightning labs]] is saying.
- nishio> Let's create a gated digital nation with a centralized curated AI instead of patent law and strictly bound "citizenship" to communicate with it (delusion).
    - If you put an NDA when you join this "digital nation" (a closed web service called "Digital Nation"), you won't lose your novelty by making it public knowledge.
- Ikumi Akatsuka> Note: It would be good to create a CC-like classification for patents as well.
    - Lessig: "You know about eight different kinds of ^^^."
- YukiJP> I wonder if it is possible to make decisions by AI, and to what extent it is acceptable or possible.
- sowawa> Indeed, AI seems to be better at optimizing financial returns.
- sowawa> I sometimes think about the Semantic Web again when I think about AI.
    - Or rather, a reminder.
- Ikumi Akatsuka> Dynamic Semantic Web
- YukiJP> What is Semantic Web?
    - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web)
    - [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/セマンティック](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/セマンティック) and Web
- sowawa> Like a dynamic RAG.
- nishio> Since humans can't see the entire web anyway, why not render only the "surroundings" and generate only the nearby areas while moving around?
    - Image like an auto-generated dungeon game.
    - miyabi> It's like a stream that curates and generates useful context within a certain perspective.
    - sowawa> That's a filter bubble,,

> The Web started as decentralized, but Web 2.0 centralized it, so Web 3 is a movement to regain decentralization.
- error
- Since the 90's, the transformation to centralization has been pointed out, and there has been a movement to bring back the Web to individuals.

Ikumi Akatsuka> I am in a hurry as if they are talking about me.
YukiJP> We tend to focus on the existence of centralized systems, but I think people themselves tend to be centralized.
- I'd like to read any discussion or theory on whether a system can mitigate a person's tendencies.
Kobayu> I don't understand decentralized things because...
nishio> If everyone does not believe in Buddhism and feel that "[[there is no such thing as myself]]," the trend toward centralization will not stop.
- To stop the cycle, you must be liberated and get out of the circle of samsara (delusion).
- sowawa> I think that's called ordained.
- nishio> I'll go to India for a while to get a degree(...)
- renchon> Let's get ordained.

Takum> It says [[to break away from the nuclear and membrane structure]], it's a lickety-split.
- nishio> Indeed, the membrane must be abolished.
- Takum> We need to change the way we understand that the nucleus controls the inside of the membrane, but even if it could be implemented systematically, how many people would be able to understand it intuitively?

renchon> I think the "original experience" of Vitalik who created Ethereum, for example the nerf of WoW, as a feature of Web3 decentralization is actually quite important for ideological understanding, even if it is just a narrative.
- It's a common little story.

KOJO> At the last after-party, we were talking about how nice it is that Bitcoin has a god-like Satoshi Nakamoto, but in a way, it's a conceptual simplicity of the basic infrastructure.
- If PICSY could do it, Ken would be a god.
- nishio> It is worth observing whether it makes sense for it to be Satoshi Nakamoto, whose face is not visible, or if it could be Vitalik or Kensuzuki.
- sowawa> I wonder if the problem is that if you can see faces (in this case contactable and able to intervene politically), you may be able to create authority and decision making that is convenient for someone.

underground
- No revocation or fraud protection.
    - Because they can't be policed by authority.
- So each individual does his or her best to avoid being scammed.
Authority-free exchange platform
- I could be trafficked.
    - [[DeDeal]]
    - Unbound
    - Unmercuryed
            - Transactions prohibited by [Mercury (company name)
    - Silk Road
        - [Silk Road (marketplace) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace))
        - > Silk Road is the so-called black market and the first commercial dark web. Illegal drugs and weapons were sold on its website, with bitcoin as one of the main transaction currencies, which was one of the main virtual currency use cases in its early stages.
            - [5 years after the arrest of the founder of "Silk Road," where about 140,000 bitcoins were seized, over 85,000 signatures on a petition calling for extenuating circumstances](https://coinpost.jp/?p=49217)
- No basic human rights.
    - It is not what Bitcoin does with the Bitcoin protocol itself. Bitcoin just does money and its transfers, no one distinguishes between them.
    - Talking about services and people who "use" bitcoin and make their own rules among themselves.
    - There is the same argument on the INTERNET.
        - [RFC 8280 - Survey of Human Rights Protocol Considerations](https://tex2e.github.io/rfc-translater/html/rfc8280.html?ref=coinkeninfo.com)
        - The Internet is free. You can send packets containing anything anywhere, as long as you accept the rules of sending packets."
nishio> pointing out that the internet was created after the failure of the interconnected mutually beneficial community, I see.

Interpretation of Time Frame
- First, [[decentralized]] spreads
    - Then you need rules.
        - The more detailed the rules, the more [[centralized]] it becomes.
Interpreting Layers
- Low layer is [[decentralized]].
- High layer: app store becomes [[centralized]].
- There's a partial overlap with the interpretation of the time frame, because a high layer can't be created without a low layer.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

Sell organs and cash on Mercury
- The idea of not selling is domination, surveillance and control in the first place.
- "so that nothing bad can be done" = "defines what a 'bad thing' is."
    - More rules by trying to eliminate them.
        - This story was in the "Commons."
- Blockchain is also just not monitored by the government.
    - Mutual monitoring and management
- Trying to determine if it's a good thing to distribute is [[CENTRALIZED]] because of the cost.
    - ↔ Isn't it not a cost?
        - The entity that makes the rules is [[CENTRALIZED]], so it becomes [[CENTRALIZED]].
            - If someone hosts a fork that is OK to buy and sell incrementally when the chickemie becomes OSS and anyone can fork the service [[decentralized]].

These are ways of utilizing mechanism design, and I try to apply this to Taiwanese politics as much as possible.

Plurality within an individual
- On the side of the Named Enemy, it is referred to as "splinterism."
Differences in membrane concept
- This is not a question of which is better, but rather the concept of a "membrane" looks at things in more detail ([[Cognitive Resolution]] を上げる)上で有益な気がするな<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

- Concentration of wealth through IT → Emergence of new wealthy people → Intervention in social issues through private funding
    - self-contained (of a story, etc.)<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - By changing the source of resources for solving social problems,
        - Decision-making mechanisms for solving social issues are shaken up.
            - Because there is no legitimacy in using the traditional (when taxes were the source of funds) decision-making mechanism.
- Therefore, technology and logic are needed to bring about "new forms of cooperation".
    - The perspectives describing this domain are: Tame Enemy, Plurality, Social Common Capital

- Plurality in RxC is "technology to cooperate across differences", so it assumes Diversity "a state of difference" and thinks beyond it, clearly.
    - Plurality in political philosophy is not focused on technology, so the difference is probably not clear.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

    - [[Inquiry (Yukito Karatani)]]
    - These are two good books by Yukito Emotani.
    - Shifted perspective from modes of production to modes of exchange
    - The "Value Morphology" section of Marx's "Theory of Capital"
    - Where does value come from?
        - It comes from exchange, not production.
    - [[Self-creation and self-destruction of money]]([[Ayumu Yasutomi]])
        - computer simulation
        - KEN: I learned this first, and from there I traced it to Emaya and Iwai.
    - self-purpose
        - It's worth it because I think it's worth it.
        - So is money.
        - [[Theory of Depression]](Kozo Uno)
    - ken: i don't think the exchange relationship alone explains everything
        - The idea that "the substructure defines the superstructure" and "the structure of the state and society is also determined by the structure of the economy" is unreasonable.
        - It's not just the exchange, but the state itself that is of value.
            - Value is created because we think money has value, just as value is created because we think a nation has value.
            - Those diverse values interact.

                    - >  Talcott Parsons' and Luhmann's social systems theories differ fundamentally in their conception of the "system" between them.
                    - >  Parsons' social system consists of a nested structure from the world system in the large to the individual in the small, whereas Luhmann considers a multidimensional, mutually complementary, and interpenetrating system with no hierarchy among systems.
                    - >  While Parsons has methodological individualism, which is descended from Max Weber, at the core of his theoretical construct, Luhmann clearly rejects a theoretical construct that takes the "individual" as its starting point until late in his career.
                    - I see. So you are imagining a complementary system without assuming a nested structure of large and small structures or a stacked structure of substructure and superstructure.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- X is great, but it doesn't have to be that 2x2 frame.

        - I felt that that frame framed my thinking and got in the way of thinking about the relationship between [[Cultivation of the Nowhere Sphere and Exchange Stylistics]].
        - I think it would be useful to remove the frame and make some observations and observations about recent OSS and Ethereum
- About [NAM
    - Mr. West invited me.
        - Mr. Emaya is going to do some social activities, so why don't you join us?"
        - > Japanese economist...

    - When I joined, Emiya said, "Why don't you use the [[LETS]] you're working on at NAM?"
        - I did it because it was a good opportunity.
    - I was doing PICSY at the same time and contributed about it.
        - We thought it would be a good public opportunity.
- separatism

            - [[Carl Schmidt]] is about to shoot through
        - Are we shooting through? We don't know yet.

    - Solution by Technology" is close to what we are trying to achieve.
    - I even mention security at the lickety-split stage.
        - Money→resource allocation→voting→security
        - It doesn't look like we're getting there.
    - With the emergence of ethereum, I feel the need to think about the new social contract
    - No need to emphasize the differences.
        - Similarity and family in the eyes of the world
        - It's all about creating partnerships and changing the world.
- It was my fault for not transmitting the Named Enemy in English.
    - It's Smyrnau's fault.
    - 2012/12 Released "Smart News" application
    - 2013/1 NAME ENEMY PUBLISHING
    - I didn't know this.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - It's more like a superhuman release of these two in parallel.
    - I have an English paper I wrote in 2009, which was left as Reject because reviewers were very divided about it, and I'll put it in arXiv for now.
    - As for the English version of Name Enemy, we could not make it CC-0 due to a conflict with the publisher, but we can partially release it under the pretext of promotion.

These problems, which originated mainly in the economic realm, have gradually encroached on the realm of values and ethics.

The Illusion of Evidence
Create a culture where images are not evidence.

YukiJP>
- > [hazuma](https://twitter.com/hazuma/status/1656866529605214208) By the way, as I have said repeatedly, the spread of generative AI means that the world will become a mixture of truth and lies. We have been living in such a world for a long time. Until recently, there were no photographs or recordings. Everyone spoke from memory.
- > [hazuma](https://twitter.com/hazuma/status/1656866975338074112) Still, mankind has established a proper order, and I don't think it is something to be so fearful of. It's just that the simple assumption, which was conversely strengthened by the immaturity of technology over the past few decades, that if you provide "evidence" such as photos and recordings, the truth will be confirmed, will expire.
- > [hazuma](https://twitter.com/hazuma/status/1656867778891255811) So, in my opinion, humanities knowledge will be rather effective in the age of generative AI. Humanists should look at the current situation with the understanding that it is not about protecting humans from AI, but rather AI that will restore the humanistic world (not sure if that is a good idea or not).

counter-misleading
- Humor over Rumor
- [[Polis]]
- [[Community Notes]]

nishio> A tradition has been established where the speaker's presentation materials are used even though he/she is not speaking: ...... Is this "smooth"?

Exhibiting in AI is prohibited in Skeb.

- I can pay 100,000 for an AI painting.
    - = Exchanging 100,000 yen for something generated by one click is considered a legitimate transaction.
    - →Can be used for money laundering.

Countermeasures against hoaxes
- Who starts it is tied to power.
- Need a system of "authoritative speakers" and "denial of authority" instead of "countering with memes."
- → I'm not arguing that countering with memes is the best way to go.
    - Polis] and [[Community Notes]] from "There are approaches like this, but they are not systematic."

nishio> So you don't know whether it is a counter to a hoax or another hoax?

Once the image has been digitally signed.
- You know, an electronic signature doesn't guarantee veracity.
- How about protocol-wise?
- I'm not sure that veracity is independent of time frame.

How to correct mistakes in community notes
- Community notes are not a guarantee of truthfulness in the first place.
- Am I right?" I didn't ask.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Is it useful?" I ask.
    - > We propose an algorithm that identifies notes that are considered informative and useful based on the user-generated notes themselves and the history of user-generated ratings for each note.
    - A system in which those commonly rated as "useful" by clusters of different opinions come out on top.
- Clusters of community notes are not clusters of social nets, but clusters of past opinions

Much of the criticism of PICSY is criticism of money itself.
- PICSY is too monetary.
- What will really be used 300 years from now will be in a different form.

From scalar values to value vectors
- Mechanisms born in an era of exclusionary nature of goods.
- Digital goods are basically non-excludable goods

How to extract value from digital goods
- Open to the whole world
    - Value is maximized
How to Make Money
- If you open it up to the whole world, you won't make any money!
- Copyrights and patents create exclusivity.
The discrepancy between these two methods is a flaw in the system.

Cryptocurrency Waste
- Inefficient to get a worldwide consensus to send $100 to the next town.
Habits of the age of exclusionary ownership
In the age of digital goods, we need a system that makes the most of the characteristics of digital goods.

Why is money stable?
- Because people think it's worth it.
- People think it's worth it, so they can use it in exchange.
- It's worth it because it can be used for exchange.

- B gets chicken from A.
    - B thanks A.
    - Gratitude is subjective
    - Recorded in the hands of B.
    - falsify as many times as one likes
        - Not worth tampering with.
- Things flow in the direction of the arrow (trust)
    - If you give, you get to give again.
    - Mutual beliefs create value in "arrows".
- [[Morse's Theory of Gifts]] [[Spirit of Howe]].
    - [[ハウの呪力]]<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Computer Management of Confidence
    - Systematization of [Spirit of Howe
- A related saying among software engineers, "[[Information is gathered to the sender of information.]] 」<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

Advantages of allowing time differences compared to bartering
- Not much different from the gift economy in the village.
- Can you do business with someone you don't know?
Suggestion to make it happen: flooding.
- Behind the arrows, "information about needs" propagates.
- [[6th order of separation]].
    - Virtually the whole world to deal with.

Q: Similar to Lightning Network.
- No incentive to take the shortest route.
- A: Not from Lightning Network
    - information retrieval algorithm

Infinitely generated problems
- Reverse arrows are not negative.
    - I didn't understand this either, but most people don't get it, it's not clearly explained.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - The current currency is a two-tuple `(p, c)` with individual p and balance c corresponding to each other, whereas the proposed method is a three-tuple `(p1, p2, c)` because the "arrows" accumulate, and this does not cancel out `(p2, p1, c)` and is managed in a separate location.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/7137f923f01ce590908ba29c4848ae0b/thumb/1000)
    - No arrows are "people without trust."
    - When arrows are stored, they are "people of trust."
        - Even if the size of the two-way arrows are equal, they do not cancel each other out and lose credibility.

Flooding algorithm cannot be applied to services
- Why not just create a token that says "Right to Service?"
- In the end, it makes digital goods "things" without "character".

# get-togethers

It's impossible to organize, so I'll write Ken's closing remarks first.
- Very interesting, made my brain sweat.
- Great on the grass route.
- Let's make things and think about ideas, both at the same time!

## difficult to organize get-together conversation

- I understand it was something like the sowawa CAP theorem.
- Zhou Jingfang> My understanding is that we are talking about something like breaking the quantum Arrow's theorem, which is a quantum extension of Arrow's theorem, so I'm not sure how extensible it is to human society, but maybe not. I wanted someone to read it with me, so if you'd like, I'd be happy to do it. [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.00458.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.00458.pdf)

Q: Why did you start Scrapbox?
- I was blogging before Scrapbox in the first place.
- I wrote about my research and experiments with technology, and they thanked me for it, so I continue to do so.
- Later, I switched to Scrapbox because I thought it was a more appropriate means of storing knowledge than blogging.
        - [[The blog was dismantled and became a social networking site and Scrapbox.]]

Maybe PICSY should move away from the monetary metaphor.
- Natural recovery is unnatural as a metaphor.
- Value decay
- In the first place, in a growing economy, there will be a gradual inflation and a decay in the value of money.
    - Most people don't get it, so maybe you're right that comparing it to money as a metaphor in explaining it is misleading.
    - Whether or not PICSY is a currency is irrelevant to whether or not "PICSY is a beneficial system."

[[SUI]] and [[APTOS]].
- Forks of [Libra
- extremely fast
- I want it to be better known.

Enhancing individual intellectual productivity or building team consensus?
- Nishio personally has focused on the individual, thinking that Originality first before co-creation.
- The [[Plurality]] aspect, especially the [[broad listening]] aspect, leads to better deliberation by strengthening the individual's "ability to understand other people's views"
- I think it's the Aufheben of the "individual or team" conflict.

Where would you map [[Masayoshi Sun]] to the triangle of "[[Ideology in the 21st Century]]"?
- Not much information.
- The episode, "Talking to ChatGPT, I'm putting out patents all over the place."
    - Are you really doing this because you think it will give you a competitive advantage, or are you introducing it because you think it's a useful narrative in creating a good perception of yourself by society?
    - If it were the former, I have a feeling you wouldn't publish it.

A melting pot of ideas within the community
- People with a viable idea and enthusiasm for it start their own businesses.
- More and more [[spin out]] and eventually the community dies.
- [[Move the good stuff.]]"

Practicality and "ahare
- Waste is "ahare".
- Practicality gone too far is also "ah-hare."
    - Maybe because it's too wasteful and practical?
- making wasteful efforts
- nonessential and nonurgent
- What is your ideal world?" KEN: "A world where waste can be created in peace."
    - [[Non-objective tinkering]]
- emo (i.e. effeminate)
    - It is of "indescribable" origin (Halcynation).
    - The Japanese-derived culture of emoji, which has also made its way into Unicode, is mistakenly believed to have originated from emotion, but in fact it is meant to express 'inexpressible' (i.e., not easily verbalized) feelings."
        - have one's imagination run wild

If values become too diverse, they become ungovernable.
- Really?
- Why?
- cost escalation
- Flat when values are no longer diverse.
- Smooth is good

Management is concerned about people
- If you don't take care, people will leave.
- Organizations with more than 50 people almost care
    - grooming
- Smooth evaluation by PICSY?
    - It doesn't work with dozens of people.
- Correctness of evaluation
    - "Correctness" and "usefulness."
    - Dry evaluation does not motivate.
    - Evaluations that are highly motivating improve results in the following year.
    - Example: Failure and low results
        - Should they be evaluated on results and paid lower?
        - Should it be elevated as "good that you tried?"
        - Should we evaluate them dryly and give them another non-monetary reward?
    - Work in a company, not all of it belongs to the individual.
        - How much of the outcome is due to the individual? How much of it is due to the environment?
    - Personality of the person in question
        - Some people demotivate themselves with good evaluations!
            - 'I'm running out of challenges in this environment, so I'm changing jobs and taking on new challenges.'
        - Dry evaluation exits the genus.
            - But different people have different personalities.
            - The manager's job is to figure it out and make unfair adjustments.
    - People look at fairness sideways.
        - Who's watching who
        - Managers must see these dynamics.
> [0xikkun](https://twitter.com/0xikkun/status/1718653337116266628) The essence of personnel evaluation is not to evaluate people correctly, but to keep them motivated, and a bias term needs to be added to the correct evaluation.

- Go to the site, don't call them.
    - Observe all things
- They went to rural areas, not urban areas.
    - What kind of apps do you use? Like the Bible app.

If PMF is the only objective, there are several winning patterns.

- There is an element of art in matching PMF with "what we want to do".

Do you A/B test when making a PMF?
- local
- Too time consuming without a lot of users.
- Need 10,000 active users.
- Use hunches and qualitative observations

When was the last time you PMF'd?
- First day of launch
- What percentage of the original fans?　Almost none.
- I couldn't find any other quality news app that worked crisply.
    - I wonder if it has to do with the "mobile communication is slow in rural areas" I mentioned earlier, it's important to find out that that's a pain point for users.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
