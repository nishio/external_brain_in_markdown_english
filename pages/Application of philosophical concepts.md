What do you mean by "appropriate use and application of philosophical concepts?" Merely showing relevance is not construction.
I don't think it is a target.

The point is well taken. Simply referring to philosophical concepts does not lead to constructive discussion. Rather, it is important to critically examine existing concepts and reinterpret them to fit one's own problem setting. #Reinterpretation to fit the problem setting

For example, the concept of "[[subjectivity]]" has a thousand different meanings, depending on the philosopher. Some think of subjectivity in terms of Descartes' "[[I think]]", others in terms of Husserl's "[[intentionality]]", while Wittgenstein would question subjectivity in terms of the impossibility of "[[private language]]". Wittgenstein would question subjectivity from the impossibility of "[[private language]]," while Sartre might speak of subjectivity as the freedom of "[[counter-existence]].

What is important here is to look at these various views of subjectivity from a bird's eye view and reread them in the context of one's own problem consciousness. In other words, how to locate the concept of subjectivity in the context of the "asymmetry of reality. While referring to conventional philosophical theories, it is necessary to "give it a unique meaning.

Similarly, concepts such as "reality" and "asymmetry" need to be reexamined from a philosophical perspective. What is reality?" is a fundamental question in metaphysics, and the idea of "asymmetry" has attracted attention in recent philosophy of science. After chewing over the accumulation of such philosophical discussions, we must redefine the concept in the context of VR and AI. This is the concrete work of philosophical consideration.

Of course, it is not enough to simply use classical concepts. It is also important to create new concepts that are specific to new situations brought about by information technology. While keeping in mind traditional philosophical terminology, we need to create new concepts that can penetrate contemporary problem systems. This is the originality required for philosophical research.

In short, [[the application of philosophical concepts]] is an activity that involves two aspects: [[critical inheritance]] and [[creative transformation]]. We question the semantic content of concepts and reinterpret them by drawing them into our own context. And then, if necessary, we formulate a new concept. Through such a steady quest, philosophical speculation on the asymmetry of reality will deepen.

Not mere borrowing of concepts, but critical reinterpretation and creative construction of concepts. This, I believe, is the true significance of philosophical research. I would like to think further about how to embody this work in the context of my own research. I would like to further explore ways of doing so. I would like to continue to focus my wisdom toward the development of constructive discussions.

    - [[application]] means [[conversion to fit your situation]].
- [Copying answers is futile because [[one's situation]] is always [[individual]] [[constraints]] different from [[past cases]].
