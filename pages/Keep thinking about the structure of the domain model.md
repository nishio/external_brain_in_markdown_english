title: "Keep thinking about the structure of the domain model"

However, I think it is a very useful practice to keep thinking about the structure of the domain model in order to create a more problem-solving system.

We have been discussing about the structure of the domain model every day. By domain model here, I don't mean the code, but the model of the business system.

I've been talking endlessly about how this structure would probably have this kind of impact when linked with the user interface.

> [naoya_ito](https://twitter.com/naoya_ito/status/1659408360515735554) My sense is that rather than creating domain models to solve problems, we use domain models to gain a deeper understanding of our business. As with anything, if you come to a better understanding, a better solution to the problem will naturally come to mind

>  In the meantime, I'll put this one up too. Just because I said what I said in the first sentence doesn't mean I think DDD isn't important to talk about implementation. Rather, I'm saying that it's not a good idea to do so, trivialize the way we talk about implementation, and things like that.
>  >naoya_ito: I'm seeing more and more comments about DDD that trivialize the implementation because [[ubiquitous languages]] and such are important. They are talking about defining an aggregate and storing it in a repository to keep the system consistent, or using domain services or CQRS for things that don't fit in the aggregate.


> [naoya_ito](https://twitter.com/naoya_ito/status/1659448131686391809) When we talk about the structure of the domain model away from the implementation, we are doing so with a rough idea of what the implementation will look like in the future in mind. I do this while keeping in mind what the implementation will be like, so I have a certain amount of directionality, and it goes both ways.

>  Good thread. I'll leave it hanging.
>  >uharaqo_jp: Evans wrote a methodology for domain experts and developers to collaborate, and he showed its practicality with implementation examples. Both design and implementation are of course important. But that implementation was just one example, and I think the value of [[tactical patterns]] has diminished a lot in 20 years.
