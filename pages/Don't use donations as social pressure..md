I have seen some people say on social networking sites that "everyone has been helped by OSS, so we should donate to OSS, and we should show on social networking sites that we have donated", but I think this is a problematic statement.

First of all, the availability of [[financial resources]] varies depending on the family's situation. The approach of trying to increase [[donation]] with [[peer pressure]] by creating an atmosphere of donation and openness creates a [[cruel]] environment for those who are not in a position to do so

And while it should of course be up to the individual donor to choose which donation recipient he or she chooses, I personally think that the decision to "donate to the OSS that has been so good to us" is not a reasonable one. It would be distributing to something that is already well-known, rather than to something newly created.

There are certainly multiple problems with this opinion. First, since donations are limited to those who can afford it, it is unfair to require this behavior from everyone. Since family financial situations and individual responsibilities (e.g., providing for a family, paying school fees, etc.) vary widely, a culture that encourages uniform donations may unintentionally put [[pressure]] on those who are in [[financially difficult]] situations.

In addition, the peer pressure created by promoting donations on social networking sites can be a [[detrimental social pressure]] for people. The value of doing good individually [[spontaneously]] and in secret can be undermined, and donations can be misinterpreted as something "for [[showing off]]. This can lead in a different direction from the essential meaning of donation.

When it comes to choosing a donation recipient, the decision should be left to the individual, but the idea of "donating to the OSS that has helped us" is not always the best approach. This approach may lead to prioritizing funding for [[already successful projects]], and support for new innovations or projects that are not yet recognized may be put on the back burner. As a result, new ideas and projects may not get the support they need while existing successful projects receive additional support.

Donations should be made based on personal values, financial resources, and above all, the goals one wishes to achieve through the donation. The process should be left to the freedom and discretion of the individual, including whether or not to make the act of donation public. And society as a whole needs to strike a careful balance between encouraging a culture of giving but not allowing it to become a negative social pressure.
