GPT
- Title: Introspective Thoughts on Translation Quality and Speed
- This text appears to be a record of self-dialogue and thought process. It contains thoughts on the trade-offs between quality and speed of translation, on the use of translated content, and on ways to improve translation. In particular, it contains thoughts on the effective use of automated translation and various approaches to the post-translation improvement process.
- It also discusses the importance of optimizing the overall translation process and balancing quality and speed. The text offers an in-depth look at translation and language processing and should be of interest to anyone interested in the evolution of translation technology and how it can be used.

- Two voices are clashing within me.
    - A: English translation, don't think about quality or anything, just translate everything.
        - Decision-making about "which to do first" is futile.
        - It's important to have a form that you can throw together quickly when you want to tell someone in an English-speaking country.
    - B: You're automatically translating everything on DeepL every day, and it's not being utilized!
        - By doing it all, you're giving yourself extra to think about.
        - We should start small and improve.
    - A: No, no, no, I'm talking about starting small, but you've already gotten to the point where you throw in a URL and it translates one page, right? We're talking about the next step.
- I would consult with GPT4 or...
- I thought, "It's [[false dichotomy]]," as GPT said, "Let's figure out whether quality or speed is a priority.
    - How am I wrong?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/yosider/icon' alt='/villagepump/yosider.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Hmmm,[[Trade-off between two attributes]] とか<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - It's not a good gesture to get into this kind of dichotomous composition early on that prevents us from understanding things properly.

        - Not being utilized, and why is that?
            - That's because "when you want to tell someone in an English-speaking country" never occurred in the first place.
        - Claims to be able to "translate one page if you throw a URL at it."
            - Does it satisfy the "keep it in a form that can be thrown together quickly"?
            - I didn't. It's just being output locally to the console.
            - To be fulfilled, it needs to penetrate through to "if you throw a URL" "it will be translated and published."
        - Does "keep" really matter?

        - Next Action is to make it all the way through to the public.
    - This is the kind of sane "thinking" that prevents us from understanding things properly, and doing the "let's figure out whether quality or speed is a priority" thing.
