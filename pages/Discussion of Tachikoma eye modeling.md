- At first I didn't realize the top half was through and thought there were three 30 degree slopes.
    - I didn't know how to fix it, so I wrote on Twitter and they told me.

                - [[Tile Clip - T Pipe - Side Stud]]
    - The structure of the part that is visible on the outside seems to be correct; it may take some trial and error to determine where to grow the T-shape from.

    - In fact, it is possible that the three eyeballs are connected to each other and not to the others, and that they are stopped by pressing down from above...
    - Hmmm, narrow...

    - I don't have enough material to try it, but this would just barely fit in a 2×3 gap.

- > I had only bought two sets last year, so I had to do some trial and error with what parts I could find. It's more severe than I thought. ......

- I see, as for the sides, you combine a 1×1 panel that goes through with a block that has a concave center of studs so that the pipe can go all the way in.
        - [[Recessed studs - Open studs - T-pipe]]
- Is this the black bar growing sideways from the center bar? I don't have one and will buy one.

- > I'm not sure if I'm getting the right response because I feel like I've twisted it up quite a bit. ......
- >  That's what the black bars are for. I haven't tried it because I don't have it on hand, but I have a feeling you could do something similar with two arm-shaped clip bars!

            - [[Side Stud - Double Clip Bar]]
- Hmmm, I might not be able to reach it as it is.

- I added another one and it connected at least once...

- > Sorry!
- >  I know it sounds like I'm in the wrong place, but I just bought a few more sets today and I've been playing around with them, and I think I've got a good set up, so I'll share it with you!
- >  I personally want to make it right because it's not a weirdly elaborate assembly and it's reasonably strong lol.
