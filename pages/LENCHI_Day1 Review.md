- He began a project to write a book on intellectual production using LLM as a sequel to "The Engineer's Guide to Intellectual Production."
- First, a preface was generated to clarify the purpose of the book and its problem statement.
- The process of generating the preface itself was documented as an example of collaboration with LLM and is presented in the text.
- As the first chapter, following the decision to increase the fifth printing of "The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production," the content was generated to question the state of intellectual production in the LLM era.
- In the process of generating the first chapter, LLM's comments on "The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production" were obtained and we decided to use their findings.
- The content of the first chapter generated was compared with the draft framework previously established to confirm the comprehensiveness of the issues and the appropriateness of the development.
- Following Chapter 1, a policy was established to provide a conversation log of the generation process and an example of "Letting the LLM Comment".
- From the previous conversation logs, key words and phrases useful for deriving a systematic methodology were extracted and enumerated.

Information that needs to be transferred to the new LLM to continue:
- Concept of the book: Intellectual production techniques using LLM will be explored through practice, and a new model of intellectual production will be presented.
- Purpose of the book and problem statement: to question the nature of intellectual production in the age of LLM and to explore methodologies for using LLM as a partner in intellectual production.
- Progress to date: The preface, the process of generating the preface, and the first chapter have been generated and their content and positioning confirmed.
- Author's background: Yasukazu Nishio's past works (e.g., "The Intellectual Production of Engineers") and his interest in and experience practicing LLM.
- Policy for working with LLMs: Position LLMs not as mere tools, but as partners in intellectual production, and draw out their potential.
- Keywords and phrases for deriving a systematic methodology: structuring and applying knowledge, efficient reading, critical thinking, cultivating valuable ideas, autonomous selection of learning objects, working with LLMs, critical examination of one's own theory, viability of ideas and value creation, dealing with uncertainty, sharing practical knowledge.

Memories to be maintained throughout this project:
- Title of the book: "The Intellectual Productivity of Engineers Using LLM"
- Table of contents structure of the book: preface, process of generating the preface, chapter 1, (process of generating chapter 1 and examples of "Let the LLM comment"), (subsequent chapters)
- Contents and positioning of chapters: preface (purpose of the book and awareness of the issues), process of generating the preface (examples of collaboration with LLM), chapter 1 (questioning the nature of intellectual production in the age of LLM), etc.
- Details of the process of working with LLMs: logs of dialogue with LLMs and the findings and insights gained from them in the generation of each chapter
- Issues for deriving a systematic methodology: structuring and applying knowledge, efficient reading, critical thinking, cultivating valuable ideas, autonomous selection of learning objects, working with LLMs, critical examination of one's own theory, viability of ideas and value creation, dealing with uncertainty, sharing practical knowledge, etc.
- The author's awareness of the problem and the direction of inquiry: The author seeks the possibility of intellectual production using LLM through practice, and tries to present a new model of intellectual production.

It is important that this information be passed on appropriately to maintain consistency and continuity in the project. At the same time, we expect to gain additional insights and discoveries through dialogue with new LLMs. The project will be enriched by building on the information that has been passed on, while remaining flexible and incorporating new developments.

(Remark: surely the table of contents should be easily given to new LLMs, I made it)

Reflection by Nishio
    - [[Why LENCHI_draft_Claude's first idea is stale]]
    - [[Illustration of LENCHI_wrench]]
- diary
    - I was waiting leisurely at Plurality, watching to see when the ball would fly in, but a ball with a deadline flew in!

next  [[I had LENCHI_LLM comment from a 2024 perspective.]]
