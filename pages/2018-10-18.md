- I want to convert my corpus to JSON.
- I'm currently extracting text from a PDF of a book and creating a text file with one line per page.
- I'd like to attach some more meta information.
- What page of the book is this sentence on, what is the section heading, and so on?

If we collect them in JSON format, we can add something without hesitation when we want to add something.
{text: "...", type: "twitter", url: "...", ...}
