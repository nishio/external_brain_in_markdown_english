I felt that I never explained why I included in the denominator the days that I am not working here.

He said, "I calculate the rate of progress using only the days worked as the denominator."
- The day you don't do it will never have happened.
- When you don't have much time and can only do a little, doing a little lowers the average amount of progress.
- When I think, "A high average amount of progress is desirable," I think, "Let's not just do a little bit today, let's do it all at once over the weekend."
- This, of course, is a factor that slows down overall progress
- Do not set KPIs that would cause problems by raising them.

If you use the denominator for the days you are not working on the project.
- If you don't do anything today, progress is 0. If you do a little, it's a plus.
- Since it has nothing to do with the actual number of days of operation, it is possible to estimate "at this pace, what month and day it will end".
