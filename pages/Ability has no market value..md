title: "Ability has no market value."
---

I saw a discussion in a certain place, and although it's not really the main topic, I was curious [[type error]].

- [[Ability]] itself does not have [[market value]].
- [[goods]] created by the ability
- The promise to produce what is specified by the ability ([[contracting]])
- A promise to exercise the ability for a specified purpose ([[quasi-delegation]])
The market value is only for such things as
Because capabilities are not marketable.

- [[non-transferable resource]]
