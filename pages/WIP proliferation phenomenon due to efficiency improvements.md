> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1639496875912105985) I've been feeling like I was dying lately, and I could verbalize why.

>  Until now: come up with [[idea]] -> [[Initiation Cost]] is high -> most of them disappear without being started
>  Lately: come up with an idea -> throw it into [[ChatGPT]] -> partially done -> feel [[sacrilegious]] to throw it away -> lots of [tasks in progress

> [rashita2](https://twitter.com/rashita2/status/1639497262584963073) I know exactly what you mean. Let's call it "the phenomenon of [[WIP]] proliferation by [[making efficient]]".
> [rashita2](https://twitter.com/rashita2/status/1639497537366421504) often happens when I manage to [[efficient]] "ideas" in manuscript writing/book writing.

>  The dynamics used to be that it was hard to get started, and when you got started, you got back on track, but now that the initial operation is easier, the concurrent lines are going to come in droves....

>  I can imagine a trend where [[multitasking]] skills come in handy here, but it's not within the scope of human perception, is it?
