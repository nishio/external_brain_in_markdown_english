> [@takiuchi](https://twitter.com/takiuchi/status/1654830339972550657?s=20): a repetitive structure where the victim is doing the same thing as the perpetrator in this third-order world, and it's likely to happen elsewhere too.

- The LGBT community represents only a subset of the 100 different sexual orientations and gender identities that are known to exist. Therefore, the voices of those who do not belong to the LGBT community but have other sexual orientations or gender identities may not be adequately heard.
- While LGBT is a relatively common group in overall sexual orientation, it is only about 20-30% of the total. Therefore, people of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities can be misunderstood and unintelligible by the LGBT movement.
- While the LGBT movement is important to many people, we need to show understanding and inclusion for people of other sexual orientations and gender identities. By doing so, we can incorporate even more diverse voices and build a better society.
