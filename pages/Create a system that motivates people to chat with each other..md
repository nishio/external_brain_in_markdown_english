title: "Create a system that motivates people to chat with each other."
---

- [[Proposal support mode for making]] to consult a motivational system.
- I call it the "make proposal support mode," but it can also be used as a "make clarification mode" when you're not in a situation where you have to make a proposal to someone in particular.
- The conversation clarified the target audience, etc.
    - 'People who are unmotivated' --> 'People who are unmotivated due to a lack of task organization.'
- summary
    - People who are unmotivated
    - I want to spend my time in a positive way by motivating myself.
    - Due to lack of task organization.
    - So, add a specialized mode to this chat system to dig into the task.
    - The next action for this is to create a draft question in a messy way and use it as a trial.
        - The more we use it, the more we come up with ideas for improvement.
    - By asking questions:.
        - Dig deeper into the task
        - Clarify what you get out of the task
        - Subdivide to the point where the goal is visible.
        - I know what to do now.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>This mode is to support proposals to make. What are you thinking of making?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Create a system that motivates people to chat with each other.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Who is it for?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>People who are unmotivated
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen to that person?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Hope that motivates you.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What do you need in order for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Good luck digging into and understanding the cause of "unmotivated."
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of things would help you do that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>There should be a mode to ask motivation-specific questions in this listening chat system.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What made you think that way?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>For a long time, we have been operating a system that motivates users with choice-type answers, but since it only accepts choices, it does not allow us to dig deeper into the user's task. We often observed cases where users were not motivated due to not understanding the task properly, so we wanted to improve the system.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "motivation" is that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Positive Time Spending
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  I've been operating a motivational system for a long time with multiple-choice answers, but it only accepts choices, so I can't dig deeper into the user's task. We have often observed cases of lack of motivation due to lack of proper understanding of the task, so we wanted to improve the system.
- Is there anything else you can tell us about this "motivation"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Motivation should not be supreme. Often the task is not appropriate.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is that "motivation"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>one's mind
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  Do not make motivation your supreme priority. Often the task is not appropriate.
- How do you know you are "motivated" to do this?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I'll know when it comes up.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  Do not make motivation your supreme priority. Often the task is not appropriate.
- Where does this "motivation" come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>For example, what you might get as a result of performing a task is very fascinating, or what you might want to know about it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "task" is this "task"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>This needs to be chewed up more. The case of someone saying something like, "I feel like I should study English, but I don't feel motivated to do it," is not the right definition of the task. It is unclear what would be good about doing the task.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What does that "motivation" seem to be?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Gasoline. Without it, the car will not move forward.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  This needs to be chewed over more. The case where you say something like, "I feel like I should study English, but I'm not motivated to do it," is not the right definition of the task. It is unclear what would be good about doing the task.
- Is there anything else about this "task"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Basically, the task needs to be subdivided into smaller tasks and reachable goals
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is this "task" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's in the user's brain or in the user's preferred task management tool.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is this "task" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>How to read the tasks in a task management tool is a difficult question.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>How do you know what the "task" is?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>There's no way for the system to know without some form of input.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  How to read tasks in a task management tool is a difficult question.
- Where do these "tasks" come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>There are those that spring from the user's inner self and those that are imposed on the user by others.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  How to read tasks in a task management tool is a difficult question.
- What would you like to see happen with respect to this "task"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It is easy to think that it is a matter of doing, but that is a false KPI, and the gain per unit of time should be maximized, not the amount of work done.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to the "task" for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It would be nice if you could verbalize what you would get out of doing that task.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Can you do that with regard to "tasks"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I don't know if we should have a system to ask those questions.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  It would be nice if it could be verbalized what is gained by doing that task.
- What does this "task" look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's like taking one step forward. To do too many steps without knowing the direction you want to go or the place you want to reach is like running around without knowing where you are going.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  This needs to be chewed over more. The case where you say something like, "I feel like I should study English, but I'm not motivated to do it," is not the right definition of the task. It is unclear what would be good about doing the task.
- What do you hope will happen regarding this "motivation"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>When you get motivated, you go fast, like riding a bike instead of walking. So, if you motivate yourself for a task that is not appropriate, you will just get lost on the bike. I guess I need to clarify my destination setting.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to "motivation" for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It is good to be motivated for appropriate tasks. Conversely, we should not be motivated for inappropriate tasks.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>As for "motivation," can you do it?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>You need to have a system that separates the appropriate and inappropriate tasks by question and then motivates the appropriate tasks.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between its "motivation" and its "tasks"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>When you're motivated, tasks get digested, and when you have the right tasks in front of you, you're motivated.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is that "motivation" the same as "task"? Is it different?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>No, sir.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  When you are motivated, tasks get digested, and when you have the right tasks in front of you, you are motivated.
- What happens to your "motivation" during this "task"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>A good cycle goes around: you get motivated to do a task, you get rewarded for doing it, and you get even more motivated to do it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to the "task" when its "motivated"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>once more
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>This mode is to support proposals to make. What are you thinking of making?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>A system that asks in-depth questions about the task, clarifies what can be gained from the task, and then subdivides it to the point where the goal is visible to motivate the user.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Who is it for?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>People who are unmotivated due to lack of task organization.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen to that person?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Hopefully the cluttered task list is organized, you know what to do now, you're motivated to do it and do it, and the gain is maximized.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It would be nice if this chat system could have a specialized mode for organizing tasks.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>How can I make it so?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It would be nice if we could verbalize what questions to ask for that specialization mode.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What made you think that way?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I've created three specialized modes, but the first step is to create questions. The first question proposal should be messy because as you make it and try it out, you will come up with more and more ideas for improvement.

- What is the connection between this "task" and "motivation"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>You could have a system and convert the task into motivation.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between its "system" and its "tasks"?
