title: "True motive"
---

An episode in which I gave advice on the motive for applying for a job and it improved dramatically.
- [This Sunday, I'm going to buy a white T at UNIQLO and cry｜Aya Shimada (Aya Shimada) |note](https://note.com/cchan1110/n/nfe51e6e81c25)

- [[reason for (one's) application (esp. to a company)]]
- before
    - > We wanted to make UNIQLO clothes, which are simple and easy to match, known and worn by many people.
- after
    - > We want to help people who want to change themselves "find their first piece of clothing.
- The former "motive" immediately begs the question, "Is this a real motive?" I suspect that it is.
- I then delved into the "triggers" and pointed out, "That's what you want to do," to which he replied, "This is what you want to do?" Is it really okay to write something like this?" I think.
    - In other words, there's an implicit assumption that this is the way to make an aspiration, and it's wrong.
