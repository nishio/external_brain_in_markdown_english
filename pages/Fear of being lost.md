title: "Fear of being lost"
---

- [[Why publish your personal project?]]
- I realized I had a strong fear of losing them.
    - This page was written in Scrapbox with voice input to write down what I was thinking while I was suffering from eyestrain and headache so bad that I put a warmer on my eyes to deprive me of vision, and I suddenly realized, "Why am I writing in Scrapbox all this way?" and then I realized
    - So this page itself is the first edition with voice input

If you don't record your thoughts, they'll just keep disappearing.
- Fear of losing something of value makes us record our thoughts.
- Why publish your thoughts?
    - For if it is not made public, it is lost with death

- [Humans are fragile parts that only operate for a mere 100 years or so.
- Information not output from the part during normal operation will disappear.
- Personal memory is just a cache for faster access, it disappears when the power is turned off.
- The same feeling of pressing Ctrl+S on the blistering feeling that if you write a long sentence without saving it to a file, it might disappear and make your thoughts public.
