Weekly note 2024-08-10~

Week in Review
- The overstuffed and collapsed weekly journal system has yet to be restored.
- I was working on a review of the Plurality book that should be a top priority.
    - I've advanced 200 pages in a week and will finish next week.

2024-08-29
I realized I should switch up my weekly journal.
- I noticed that the link from the diary to the past diary had the past diary doing the switching.

Two and a half weeks.
- Plurality Book Translation Review
- [[Polis2024-08-20]]
- [[Facing the Ocean 2024 Yokohama]]
- [[Cybozu Lab Youth Summer Camp 2024]]
- [[Unexplored Junior 2024 Interim Training Camp]]
- [[p2024-08-26]]
- [[Unexplored Junior AWS Tour]]

another way of looking at it
    - I read [[mystical rationalism]] in [[Diary 2024-08-26]] and have been digging [[dragon tree (Dracaena draco)]] from there
        - [[Semiotic Elucidation of the Emptiness View]]
        - [[From Wittgenstein to Ryuju]]
