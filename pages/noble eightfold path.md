> The Eightfold Path (Hashōdō, 巴: ariya-aṭṭhaṅgika-magga, Sanskrit: ārya-aṣṭṭāṅgika-mārga) is the eight practical virtues for attaining Nirvana in Buddhism: [[right view]], [[ contemplation]], [[correct word]], [[correct meditative activity (in Jodo, saying the name of Amitabha)]], [[right livelihood]], [[diligent application]], [[ true faith (in rebirth in the promised land)]], [[right concentration]]... The Eight Noble Truths are said to have been preached by the Buddha in his first sermon ([[first full revolution of the year]]). It is the [[truth of the way to the cessation of suffering]] in [[The Four Noble Truths (of Buddhism)]], and is considered to be the specifics of the [[middle way]] preached by the Buddha.
