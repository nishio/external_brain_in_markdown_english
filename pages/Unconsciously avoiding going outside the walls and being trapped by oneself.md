Unconsciously avoiding going outside the walls and being trapped by oneself

[[same suffering over and over again, labyrinthine until you realize it's happening again]]
    - [[Edges are expensive to move.]]
        - [[tiresome]]
- If you're unconsciously avoiding it, you're [[inside the walls]] all the time.

    - Labyrinth all the way until you realize
    - There is no unexplored land inside the [[walls]] that has been trodden down.
    - I've looked everywhere and can't find it.

- [[The appropriate way to cut out the need is determined after the need is identified.]]
- [[clusters split by pulling]].
    - [[untied]]
        - [[A large blurry mass is pulled into line and disintegrates.]]

This is also [[Barbell Strategy]].
- Low risk low return inside the wall and high risk high return outside the wall barbell
- High returns out there means more than just finding a good one-shot.
- When [[other settlements]] are found and [[new trade routes]] are developed, great value is created from [[trade]] there.
