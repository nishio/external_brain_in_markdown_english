[In "Reflections on the French Revolution," [[Edmund Burke]] pointed out the danger that radical [[reform]] would destroy the "[[legitimacy]]" underpinned by [[tradition]] and [[custom]] and disrupt [[social order]]. He was very concerned about the loss of authority and violent disruption that would result from a radical overturning of existing institutions and values.

Technology-enabled direct democracy in 2025 may also shake the "legitimacy" supported by existing representative democracy. For example, as technology makes the will of the people instantly visible, the value of deliberation by representatives may diminish and [[popular]] and [[short-circuited]] decision-making may increase. Also, traditional authority and [[expertise]] may be downplayed, creating a simplistic "majority = justice" orthodoxy.

In light of Burke's warning, technology-driven democratization also needs to be carefully phased in to avoid hasty and radical reforms.
