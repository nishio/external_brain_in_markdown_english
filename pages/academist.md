> [rmaruy](https://x.com/rmaruy/status/1814139361719636152) Over the past week, the resolution of the aims and points of the "decentralized institute" that Mr. Shibafuji is envisioning has improved dramatically. I don't know if it will really work, but I am sure that ALIGN is aiming in the same direction. I don't know if it will really work, but I think it is the right direction.

On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of Academist Kurafan, we were pleased to have a walloping regarding the presentation of the company's vision. With tomorrow's FtC as a wolf's smoke, I believe that the next challenge will begin. I would like to go along for the ride.
