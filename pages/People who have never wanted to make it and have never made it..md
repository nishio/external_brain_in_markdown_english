There are people who say "[[I want to make it.]]" but don't act on it.
It is not that they "want to create" but that they just yearn to be "[[Creator]]".
There is nothing "made" because we don't really want to "make" anything.

Example
- People who want to be game creators but have never made a game and only play.
- People who want to be cartoonists but have never drawn cartoons.

- [After 8 years of university teaching, you start to distinguish between wannabes and manufacturing enthusiasts -> "Wow, you came to university to do 00, so why haven't you done it before?" (Next week) "Oh, why couldn't you do it this week?" ｜Yoichi Ochiai｜note](https://note.com/ochyai/n/n781fb2209af4) #wannabee [[distinction between "wannabee" and "manufacturing enthusiast"]].
    - > People who have never made a product they wanted to make or never researched a product they wanted to research are [[longing]] for "[[evaluation of results]] and [[self-realization]]," not interested in or fond of the experimental results, the implementation itself, or the process of making the product. They are not interested in or fond of the experimental results, the implementation itself, or the process.
        - [[Why haven't you started?]]
    - [[I just want to be "the one who makes new things."]]

It is very difficult to detect [[adoption]] of [[unexplored junior]] in many cases. One of the most important factors that can make a difference is "If you want to do that kikaku, you already have some [[progress]] regardless of the [[unexplored junior]] application, right? is a big factor.

    - > I want to get to the goal, but I don't feel like breaking it down into NEXT ACTION.
    - I want to get to the finish line = [[I just adore the results.]].
    - Not interested in breaking it down into next action = [[Not interested in the implementation process.]].

from [[mitoujr-mentoring-tips]]
- [[I want to make it.]] and have never made it.
- [[People who want to do it but haven't.]]
[[who wants to be the one who made it]]
