title: "People trade what they don't value for what they do value."
---

People exchange something A that they do not value for something B that they do value.
- There are people in the world with opposite values.
- Most business transactions are with people with opposite values.
    - You can buy a Coke for $1.50 because Coke is not worth $1.50 to the manufacturer.
    - A stock transaction takes place because someone thinks "stock is better than this cash" and another person thinks "cash is better than this stock".
        - When both sides are looking at short-term price movements, they disagree on "going up" or "going down," so a deal is made.
        - People who don't understand this part of the equation make the mistake of thinking that stocks can be sold at any time.
        - When the crash starts, most people think that the market is crashing and that they don't want to buy or sell until it calms down, so they can't sell.

In some cases, the opposite values prevent a transaction from taking place.

I'm not sure if it's true or not, but I'm not sure if it's true.

If you declare that you will put it off for your own reasons and start putting all kinds of conditions on it, there is no way any man will take you up on it.
> [mt_yamamoto_](https://twitter.com/mt_yamamoto_/status/1673163880049303552) Women always want to say that highly educated women are shunned by men (due to their complexes), but it is only because the process of committing to education is at the price of youth, which is a very important factor for men. It doesn't make any difference if an 18 year old girl has a graduate degree by mistake.
