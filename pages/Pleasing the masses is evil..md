title: "Pleasing the masses is evil."
---

'Can't please everyone with your deeds and works? Then please a few. Pleasing the masses is evil."

- Nishio's translation of a fragment of a poem by [[Syrah]] quoted at the top of [[Nuda Veritas.]] (The Naked Truth) in [[Klimt (German film festival)]].

Meaning that instead of trying to please the vague "masses," we should try to please a few more specific people.

Translation Considerations
- Kannst du nicht allen gefallen durch deine Tat und dein Kunstwerk, mach es wenigen recht; vielen gefallen ist schlimm.
    - Tat appears to be That in the picture.
        - Not that it's an error, but the old spelling of Tat is That, first orthography in 1902.
    - Tat means "deed" and Kunstwerk means "work of art.
    - durch deine Tat, "by your actions."
    - Kannst du nicht ~ , which means Can you not
    - allen for all, wenigen for few, vielen for many.
    - Mach es! ― Do it!
        - mach = second-person singular imperative of machen
        - So, "You should ~."
    - recht is right, Mach es wenigen recht, meaning "do right for the few".
        - I'm not too sure about the syntax interpretation here.
        - It's a conjugated form of wenig, meaning "FEW," but it can be in the dative, genitive, or dative case.
        - recht can be an adjective or an adverb.
            - I think you need ist to use it as an adjective.
    - schlimm is "bad."
    - I'm not sure of the nuance of the word "gefallen" in "vielen gefallen ist schlimm", which is the same word as in the first half, and I'm not sure which translation to use for "please", "satisfy", "appeal", etc., but I think these three verses are a composition of the same verb applied to three subjects, "all, few, many". I think the composition is that the same verb is applied to "all, a few, and many.
- I'm not familiar with German grammar and syntax, so I'd appreciate it if you could point out any errors.

- > Consider how difficult it is to make everyone happy with what you do or what you express. Let some people be happy. Remember that it is wrong to make any man happy.

Thoughts on translation
- I want to translate it into modern language.
- The distinction between "all," "a little," and "a lot" should be clear.
    - Reference translation 1 is "many," "few," and "many."
    - Reference translation 2 is "all," "how many," and "how many."
    - Neither one feels right.

- Reference 1 describes it as a passage in "[[be overjoyed]]", but I can't find anything like it in "[[be overjoyed]]".

    - I think you may be confusing the lyrics of Symphony No. 9, which is also the subject of Klimt's [[Beethoven Frieze]], with the lyrics "[[be overjoyed]]".

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The translation itself is generally accurate, but the following points could be improved to make the translation more natural and contextual.
- Choice of translations such as "Tat" or "Kunstwerk":.
    - It is appropriate to translate "Tat" as "deed" and "Kunstwerk" as "work of art. However, since the word "deed" has a rather rigid impression in Japanese, it could be softened a bit to "action" or "activity.
- About "Mach es wenigen recht":.
    - The nuance of this phrase is "satisfy the few." Rather than "do right by the few," it is more natural to say, "try to please the few."
- Translation of "vielen gefallen ist schlimm":.
    - The phrase "vielen gefallen" is better translated as "to be liked by many. The translation "to please" is also suitable, but here "to be liked by many is evil" is more appropriate.
- Overall expressive brevity:.
    - Since the original text has a somewhat literal translation style, it is recommended that the translation be smoothed out a bit.
    - Improved translation: "If you cannot please everyone with your actions and works, then please a few. To please the masses is evil."

This translation is in context and in a form that more naturally conveys the intent of the original text.
