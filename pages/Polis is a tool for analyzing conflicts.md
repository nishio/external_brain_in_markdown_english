from  [[leading question]]
[[Polis]] is [[a tool for analyzing conflicts]].
from [/villagepump/2023/05/24](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/2023/05/24)
- I don't know if this is the case with this person, but my first impression of Polis was, "[[投票ツール]]」なので、 [[majority rule]] で何かを決めようとしているように見えるというのはある気がする<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - After some playing around, I realized that it is also a tool to analyze the [antagonistic axis
        - Of course, it can also be used as [[voting]], so it could be taken as a "voting tool" even if you understand it so far!
