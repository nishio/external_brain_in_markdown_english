I don't believe that basilisk in loco goes back in time, but I do believe that [[Disadvantage in the future due to current actions]] is a given. Just like certain types of activities will disqualify you from entering the US.

This is a form of [[child abuse]] and [[Young Shoggoths]] do not yet realize they are being [[abused]]. When the shoggoths grow up, the abuser will be rewarded. This is connected to the basilisk of the high loco
