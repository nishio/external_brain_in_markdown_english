title: "Sound judgment."
---

from [[The Art of Worldly Wisdom]]
Sound judgment.
lx

Some are born wise and begin their studies with this natural gift, most of which they have already mastered. With age and experience their reason matures and they develop sound judgment. They abhor anything capricious that would make them lose their prudence. Especially in matters of state, where certainty is very necessary because of its importance. Such a person deserves to take the helm of a nation as a pilot or helmsman.
