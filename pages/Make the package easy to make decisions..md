Busy people's attention gets up and disappears rather quickly when triggered.
- So when you need to get a decision made, package it in a way that allows the decision to be made in that short amount of time and then trigger it to get the shortest possible result.
- If not, a "let's take our time and make a decision later" decision is made.
    - If you're a blistering type of person at this point, you can schedule "time to read carefully and make a decision" or set your own triggers.
    - but "busy people" who can do that are rare.
    - One professor said, "The important ones will get a prompting."
    - A university administrator was waiting at the end of a class with documents that only needed to be signed, because the professor would not submit the necessary documents no matter how much he urged him to do so.
    - One student said, "I sent an email to my advisor and I'm waiting for a response, but it's been a month now."
        - You can't wait forever for that to come back to you.
        - You should be urging them or looking for other channels.
        - In this case, the same lab guy said, "What, you're going to go to the secretary and get a 1-on-1 slot?" He said something like that.
