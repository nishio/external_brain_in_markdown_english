    - I don't get the sense that because one person is writing information and others are not, that it's not equal or that it's not an exchange... No, I get it, but I think you just expect too much tangible results from the people around you.
    - Maybe if you stop sulking like that and stop outputting, you will realize that if you stop explaining things to others, you will lose your resolution, you will start writing for your own understanding, and eventually your readers will be you a year later (when you have forgotten the details of your decision making), and other people's reactions will become irrelevant. The reactions of others will no longer matter.

    - I've been feeling a bit mopey and haven't been able to articulate it well yet, but maybe this angle will help: the ROM is the strongest only on the axis of evaluation within a closed, small community, and in the long run, the personal enhancement through writing will outweigh it.
    - I guess there are those who see the purpose of writing as a means of accelerating one's growth and those who see it as a means of gaining recognition from others. Of course, I'm talking about the former.
