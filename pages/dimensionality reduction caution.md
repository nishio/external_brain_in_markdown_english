title: "dimensionality reduction caution"
---

It was titled "[[Memory and Abstraction]]" from 2018-10-22 to 2019-11-10, but I renamed it because I cannot recall this title when referring to it from various places, so I decided it was not an appropriate name. Note dimensional reduction as we are talking about putting [[dimensional reduction]] in [[attention mechanism]].  #memory #abstraction

    - Multiply both query and key by the same [[Dropout]] when drawing from [[memory]] in [[attention mechanism]].
- This is effectively equivalent to doing a [[dimensional reduction]] of the two and then comparing them.
    - [Dimension reduction and comparison" as explained in [Similarity of concepts is not distance.
    - [Recall from [[memory]] with abstraction rather than simple similarity of query and key.
- In other words, this is the equivalent of [[analogy]] or [[suggestion]].
