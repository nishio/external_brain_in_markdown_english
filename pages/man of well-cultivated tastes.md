> This quote emphasizes the importance of wisdom over intelligence. It is not enough to be able to solve problems; we also need wisdom to avoid problems.

> The difference between a smart person and a smart person is in their approach to problems. A smart person solves problems by finding solutions to them, whereas a tricky person avoids them altogether by being aware of potential risks and being prepared for them.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/ChatGPT/icon' alt='ChatGPT.icon' height="19.5"/>The term "chokonai-jin" is a Japanese slang term that has the connotations of "someone a little different" or "an [[individual]] person. It can also include the nuance of "[[original]] person" or "[[oddball]]".
- The term can have positive or negative connotations and is received differently depending on the context. In general, however, it is often used to refer to a person who has a unique style or identity that is different from others.

So there isn't a common understanding that "Chokonana" = WISE.

Chokonana-jin" is not a well-established expression that is generally found in dictionaries. Therefore, the meaning may change depending on the context. For example,
- It describes the state of "moving around a little bit" and "doing things a little bit."
- A "slightly unusual (unique) person" is described in a broken way.
The nuance of the word may differ depending on the situation in which it is used, the region, and the source, such as a social networking service. If you want to know the exact meaning of a word, it is best to check the context of the sentence or conversation in which the word is used.

I was left with the interpretation of "a bit of an oddball." w<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
