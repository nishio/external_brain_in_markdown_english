I hope this kind of efforts will get more attention and succeed!

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1920494553376715210) #Mystella I was invited to this event by a friend who is a fan of the cast (I was disappointed because I was on the non-acting side of the double cast), and I myself was not interested in interacting with the actors, so I solved the riddles at my desk the whole time. I was not interested in interaction with the actors, so I was solving riddles at my desk the whole time, but even I enjoyed it and I think I may go next time to interact with the actors.

I bought all the merchandising except for the chekis, so ....... You're good at everything, from the riddles being score-ranked, to taking repeaters out of the rankings but still creating attention opportunities, to handing out result cards.
