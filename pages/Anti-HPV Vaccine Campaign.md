Anti-HPV Vaccine Campaign
> [@Tanuk_Ichi](https://twitter.com/Tanuk_Ichi/status/1691004846634303488): 2020 Osaka University paper
> As a result of Japan's anti-HPV vaccine campaign, an estimated 17,000 extra Japanese women born in 2000-2003 will develop cervical cancer and 4,000 extra women will die who did not have to die.
> Yet, almost no Japanese media outlet has taken this announcement seriously...

- > [@Tanuk_Ichi](https://twitter.com/Tanuk_Ichi/status/1689867476484706305): as I tweeted before, as of last year, HPV vaccine for men is routine in 46 countries and territories worldwide
- > All high-income countries, except Japan, also vaccinate boys against HPV
- > Because boys are not vaccinated in Japan, Japanese males are at high risk for HPV infection...


> [@fusakui_politik](https://twitter.com/fusakui_politik/status/1691037628576018432): In a special exhibition on the human body and medicine at the Wellcome Collection in London, there was an exhibition on what happened in Japan over the HPV vaccine HPV vaccine in Japan.
> The media reports and the government's response have caused a gradual shift in the decisions of those who feel insecure to the "red line" in the figure, and the vaccination rate has gone from 70% to 1%. How did this really happen?

> [@PKAnzug](https://twitter.com/PKAnzug/status/1691383931168550912): It's a very good exhibit, so I've translated it into Japanese. The original exhibit is huge and the letters are relatively small, so please enlarge it.
