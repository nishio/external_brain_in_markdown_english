### Summary and commentary (concise version)
.

This paper focuses on "working memory" and discusses the brain mechanisms that support human higher cognition and the planning and execution of actions. Key points are summarized below.

1.### Working Memory Concepts
.
    - Unlike "memory," which retains past experiences, it is responsible for the temporary retention and processing of information needed to plan and execute future actions and cognitions.
        - The capacity is estimated to be about 3 to 4 items, and if old information is not deleted or updated using caution, it will soon overflow.
            - [[erasing working memory]].

2.### Difference from short-term memory
.
    - While short-term memory focuses on "passive retention of information," working memory is an active function that "retains and simultaneously processes and manipulates" information.
        - Attention control (executive system) is a major key, and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the brain plays an important role.

3.### Working memory model (Baddeley)
.
    - It consists of a phonological loop (linguistic information), a visuospatial sketchpad (visual and spatial information), an episodic buffer (integrative retention), and a central execution system to control them.
        - The key is the function of attention allocation and control by the central execution system.

4.### Measurement method: RST/LST
.
    - RST (Reading Span Test) and LST (Listening Span Test) are dual tasks that involve "understanding (processing) sentences" and "memorizing (retaining) words" simultaneously.
        - Estimate an individual's working memory capacity based on how well it can both process and retain.

5.### Brain activity and individual differences
.
    - fMRI studies have shown that the coordination between the prefrontal cortex (especially the dorsolateral PFC) and the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC) is closely related to the performance (capacity) of working memory.
        - People with high capacity (HSS) have strong connectivity in these areas and are able to allocate attention efficiently. In people with low capacity (LSS), this connectivity is weak.

6.### Working memory in the elderly
.
    - Capacity tends to decline with age, but there are significant individual differences.
        - While coordination between ACC and PFC is necessary for attentional control, there are cases in which other regions, such as the superior parietal lobule (SPL), may additionally assist in the elderly.
    - It is suggested that a certain level of improvement can be achieved by devising strategies and training.

In general, working memory, also called ### "[[brain notepad]]"
, is a dynamic system for simultaneously processing information while keeping it temporary. In view of capacity constraints, individual differences, and changes due to aging, it has become clear that the brain network centered on the prefrontal cortex supports this mechanism.
