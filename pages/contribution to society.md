[[If you give the axis of happiness to an outside party, it is unstable]]. Rather, happiness is infectious if the social group repudiates it."

If you ask them to analyze themselves, they will either say that they want to extend the research they are currently doing or that they want to be of help to others. The more serious they are, the more likely they are to do so.

If you give [[the axis of happiness]] to an external party, it will be unstable.
