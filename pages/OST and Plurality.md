I was going to write it, but I forgot all about it 2025-02-15

[[Open Space Technology]] and [[Plurality]]
    - We discussed how to create [[A Society of Teamwork]].
- The word "society" is too vague.
    - More detail.
    - It would be nice if many teams of about 10 people full of teamwork were created.
    - Do "pro-vaccine" and "anti-vaccine" groups need to understand each other?
        - Vaccine talk is off-topic for "road-building groups"

- Everyone can decide on a theme.
        - [[Open up agenda-setting authority to people]]
- Each individual decides for himself where to participate.
        - [[Subjectivism doesn't force anyone to move.]]
        - > If you have an unpopular... preference, you will end up in a fork where there are few others to interact with you.

- Small groups are created.
    - It doesn't have to be continuous, it can be switched four times.


[[Plurality-like]], right?
