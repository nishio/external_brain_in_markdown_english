title: "Let's just leave it open for now."

from  [[Diary 2023-04-30]]
- [[for now]] [[open]] Let it go.

I was thinking about Japol's Scrapbox.
- I tend to take the "let's just open it up for now" option, and people around me stop me.
    - To those around you, "being open" is seen as excessive risk-taking.
- Why [risk-taking
- Because, after all, if it doesn't work, [[leave it alone]] and do something else.
        - [[irresponsibility]] is strong or [[lack of interest in maintenance and development]].
        - [[Anything that no longer functions must be destroyed.]]
    - [[We should not devote attention to something that is not beneficial.]]
            - [[Attention mobile voting]]
