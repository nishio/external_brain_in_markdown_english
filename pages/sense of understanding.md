title: "sense of understanding"

from [/inteltank/training-creation-toramaki by Sawachin](https://scrapbox.io/inteltank/training-creation-toramaki by Sawachin).
- In [[training content]], it is better to use "number of questions asked" as a KPI rather than "satisfaction at the end of the training".
        - [[(degree of) satisfaction]] does not correlate with training outcomes
        - Even if participants are satisfied... it doesn't mean that they are "growing in skills" or "knowledge".
        - Instead, by using satisfaction as a KPI, only a [[sense of understanding]] is generated, and people who "can't do it at all when they actually try it" are created.
            - [People perceive uncomplicated things as easy to understand, so "[[easy-to-understand content]]" often omits many "necessary but difficult-to-understand elements" to create an easy-to-understand story.
                - Too much is left out, and the result is only a sense of understanding.
                - Contents similar to "/nishio/ [[understanding]]" and others are described from various angles.

[[number of questions]].
- [[Incorrect KPI setting]]
