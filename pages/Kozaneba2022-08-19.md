Keichobot's question-answer keyword pairs are connected by edges, "What is A?" "B", "What is B?" C" type of bad conversation, we can detect them and give advice on how to make them better.

The idea must have come from this: "I've been thinking about this for a long time, and I've been thinking about it a lot.
    - [[The "Interesting" Exploration Net]]
- So the first step is to "create a single dense net."

The KJ method led to the function of the "line" that was attached to Kozaneba through the exploratory net
Connect to Keichobot through the same exploratory net
I think I may have found a clue to [[the fusion of Keichobot and Kozaneba]], which has been an issue for a long time.
