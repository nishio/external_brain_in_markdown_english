<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nihia/icon' alt='nihia.icon' height="19.5"/>The value of touching it again after a period of time is discussed in the following pages.

- It is important to set aside time for reflection. Unlike reading for entertainment, the purpose is to organize the content and keep it in your mind, and by reading books you can chew on your experiential knowledge and pass it on to others to make it even deeper. He stated that it is important to go back to the starting point, thinking about yourself two years from now and whether you are happy as you are. It is especially important to remember the feeling of wanting to know during difficult times.
- [[Test of Time]]
- It describes how only good things remain with the passage of time. This is exemplified by the classics as the "test of time."

These details show that the value of putting in the time includes the universal value of looking back and self-evaluation, deepening the experience, and leaving something good behind.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nihia/icon' alt='nihia.icon' height="19.5"/>The following are excerpts from several pages that discuss the value of re-exposure after a period of time in relation to spaced repetition, incremental reading, etc.

Incremental Reading
- Incremental Reading is a method in which sentences are presented at progressively longer intervals using an interval repetition algorithm. The parts of the text that are deemed important are skimmed, and when the fragments are small enough, they are rewritten into a quiz format. This method allows reading to proceed efficiently, as sentences that are too difficult or boring naturally disappear.

IncrementalReading of physical books
- The Incremental Reading technique can be applied to physical books as well. One word is left on the page to indicate what was gained while reading, and the next interval is determined if it was. The reader is reminded at progressively longer intervals of what is buried in the book, which allows for more efficient reading.

- [[Trigger to read back]]
- It is beneficial to reread something once read over time. This rereading can be triggered by Spaced Repetition, social triggers, or by hitting the original source to teach others. Scrapbox is also described as a system that triggers rereading through the joining of links.

Experiment with changing the sort order in Scrapbox
- Scrapbox also incorporates the concept of interval repetition, introducing a mechanism to present articles that are 10 days old or older from the last update date at progressively longer intervals. This mechanism reminds the user of old articles and provides an opportunity to recall "Oh, I used to write something like this in the past.
    - This is not an official feature.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

From these contents, it is understood that re-exposure to the information after a period of time promotes knowledge retention and efficient organization of information. In particular, tools such as Incremental Reading and Scrapbox naturally remind us of important information, enabling efficient learning and intellectual production.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Where did I mention that "Scrapbox triggers rereading by joining links" to increase abstraction of knowledge?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nihia/icon' alt='nihia.icon' height="19.5"/>The following pages discuss how Scrapbox triggers read-backs through link merging and the increasing abstraction of knowledge.

Re: (5.4.3-2) Scrapbox
- One of the features of Scrapbox is the concept of "links. Links can be expressed with a simple notation, and links can be created even if the page does not exist at this time. Concepts that may be useful in the future if they lead to something or if a page is created can be made into links, and Scrapbox can suggest link connections through ambiguous searches, assisting in the discovery of related articles in the past. This triggering of link connections is beneficial for knowledge discovery and abstraction.

Search to Link
- Scrapbox allows associations to be externalized in the form of "links". This creates a network of knowledge that can be mechanically followed and explored. By manually assigning links, information in Scrapbox is not only searchable, but also facilitates the binding of knowledge through links.

What is this?
- Scrapbox represents a network of knowledge by structuring information using links. Unexpected links can be connected and Scrapbox's suggestion function is useful, and new learning can occur through the discovery of pages you have written in the past. It is believed that comparing similar things increases abstraction of knowledge.

These contents show that Scrapbox's linking function facilitates interconnection of information, creating a network of knowledge that promotes abstraction and new discoveries.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I think it said something about alternating between the abstract and the concrete.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nihia/icon' alt='nihia.icon' height="19.5"/>What is said about "alternating abstract and concrete" is on the next page.

- [[Scrapbox reminds me of what I've forgotten.]]
- It is emphasized that Scrapbox can move back and forth between the concrete and the abstract in a mutually complementary manner. It explains how concrete things and abstract concepts can be linked together to make it easier to recall them later. Specifically, if you save concrete things a, b, and c as links on the page of abstract concept x, and then link concrete things c, d, and e on another abstract concept y page, c will appear as a common link. It is stated that this allows you to recall relevant information you have written in the past.

Concrete/abstract is a false dichotomy
- It is stated that concrete experience has myriad aspects, and which parts to isolate and abstract from is subjective and depends on the context. The importance of moving back and forth between abstraction and concreteness is emphasized because there is not a one-to-one correspondence between concrete and abstraction, but a myriad of correspondences.

From these contents, it can be seen that by utilizing Scrapbox's linking function to connect the concrete and abstract and complement each other, the reusability of knowledge can be improved and new discoveries and deeper understanding can be obtained.
