- Introduction:.
    - Electronic voting systems are increasingly being adopted.
    - Requires security equal to or greater than traditional paper ballots
- Electronic Voting System Requirements:.
    - Availability, eligibility, integrity, anonymity, fairness, no receipt, accuracy, robustness, universal verifiability, voter verifiability, force resistance, etc.
- Attack vectors:.
    - Infected voter machines, active network attacks, network correlation attacks, vote manipulation by authorities, double and unauthorized voting, coercion, etc.
- Electronic Voting Scheme:.
    - Use of cryptographic primitives such as group signatures, encryption shuffling, quasi-homomorphic ciphers, and coerced evidence
- Actual electronic voting system:.
    - DC Digital Vote-by-Mail Service, Civitas, Helios, systems based on discrete logarithm problems, etc.
- Unresolved issues:.
    - Coercion resistance, secure platform issues, ease of use and understanding, threat and security analysis, distributed systems, easy distribution of credentials
- Conclusion:.
    - Much research still needs to be done on remote electronic voting
    - Not suitable for use in important large elections
    - In a low coercion environment like student elections, this could be an option.

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current status, challenges, and future research directions for remote electronic voting.
