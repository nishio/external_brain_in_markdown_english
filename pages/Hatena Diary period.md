When I was using Hatena Diary as a blog
- Due to the malfunction of the blog I was writing with MovableType in 2007-10, I started to use it in earnest because it was too much of a hassle to maintain the blog myself. #MovableType period
- I started using Scrapbox around 2017-04 and officially announced the end of my Hatena Diary usage on 2018-03-07. #Scrapbox period
- > It has been almost a year since my last post "I've been using Scrapbox lately. Since then, this page has not been updated at all, while articles have been posted to Scrapbox one after another, exceeding 1,000 articles.
