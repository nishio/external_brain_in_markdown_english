title: "The merits and demerits of the visual alphabet"
---

When I read [Draw on the right side of your brain](http://amzn.to/2sIYWal), I thought that the habit of relying on [[visual alphabet]], which I learned in my childhood, affected my poor [[rough sketch]] skills, and to escape from this habit, I learned to copy upside down, concentrate on one outline at a time, and focus on the ground space. In order to escape from this habit, lessons are being given on how to turn the sketch upside down, concentrate on one outline at a time, and pay attention to the space of the ground.

But when I think about it, I don't want to draw "good pictures," I just want to illustrate what I have in my brain, so if anything, I should practice the visual alphabet properly.

Wife: "You don't need to practice the visual alphabet. Anyone can do it, even write a stick figure."
I said, "I can write [[stick figure]] and say it's a person, but it's hard to describe the movement.
Wife: "That's not a visual alphabet, that's another skill."
