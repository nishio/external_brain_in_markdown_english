title: "James's Pluralistic Cosmology"
---

[[James]]'s [[multiverse cosmology]].
> In the great turning point at the beginning of the 20th century, this is the trail of an exceptional spirit that explored the "day and night" of the human mind in search of another cosmic consciousness and a different religious consciousness. From the study of anomalous psychological phenomena such as multiple personalities and mediumship, he delved into the world of religious experience, listening to the new meaning and secret music that reason, driven to the brink of stranding, attempts to weave. From science to religion, the experience of leaping over the enormous gap between the two eventually culminates in the revolutionary worldview of the philosophy of "pure experience" and the cosmology of the multiverse. A mandala-like multiverse, full of color, music, and spirituality, encompassing pure experience as the root of life and existence. Intersecting with Kitaro Nishida, D.T. Suzuki, Fechner, Kenji Miyazawa, and others, this book depicts the adventure of a thought that has passed between rationality and irrationality, and has moved toward a lively vision.

> This book clarifies the path from empiricism to metaphysics and the whole picture of pluralistic cosmology.
> The multiverse is the most reasonable hypothesis that can be rationally thought about if we are thoroughly attuned to the experience of consciousness. This book unravels James's convoluted cosmology and clarifies its pragmatist basis and range.
