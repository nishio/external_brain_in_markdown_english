title: "The gods of fortune treat those who leave coldly"

from [[The Art of Worldly Wisdom]]
Make sure the finishing touches are tight.
RIX

- In the house of [[fortune]], if you enter through the gates of joy, you must exit through the gates of sorrow, and vice versa. Therefore, you should consider the finishing touches and emphasize a graceful exit over applause upon entry. Fortunate beginnings and tragic endings are common for the unfortunate. What is important is not the vulgar applause at the entrance, which comes to almost everyone, but the general sentiment at the exit. Few people in life feel they deserve an encore [[Lady Luck]], who warmly welcomes those who visit but only coldly dismisses those who part.
