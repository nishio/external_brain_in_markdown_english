> The countries with the highest scores, or "freedom of the net," were [[Iceland]] (95 points), [[Estonia]] (93 points), [[Costa Rica]] (88 points), and [[Canada]] (87 points). This is followed by [[Taiwan]] and Canada (79 points), [[United Kingdom]] (78 points), [[Georgia]] (77 points), [[Germany]] and [[Japan]] (76 points), [[Australia]], [[France]], and [[United States of America]] (75 points), leaving Japan in 8th place in the world.
