title: "Ranking Study"
---

- Binary classification to guess True or False
- If you are using a probabilistic model such as logistic regression, you will get a real value of "Probability of True".
    - Image of precipitation probability
- So we can sort by its real value.
- When you want to improve this sorted "order" to a "better order", it is a "ranking study"!
- Binary sorting is actually equivalent to one of the three major "pointwise methods" in the context of ranking learning
