<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nihia/icon' alt='nihia.icon' height="19.5"/>The benefits of "drawing lines" as an extension of the KJ method are discussed in the following pages:

- [[Kozaneba:Proofreading:Line drawing function]]
- The author has practiced the KJ method on paper for 10 years and feels that the "draw the line function" is not essential. However, he states that "drawing lines" is a useful option in addition to "putting them close together" as a method for expressing relationships. However, he states that for those who are not familiar with these methods, the additional options can be troubling.

- [[Line Drawing Function]]
- The "draw a line" feature is useful for expressing relationships between distant objects. It is especially useful for clearly indicating relationships. This feature makes it easier to visually understand the relationship between information.

- [[Organize in reverse chronological order]]
- In the first half of the KJ method, relationships were expressed by "putting them close together," but drawing lines has the advantage of clarifying relationships. In particular, it is stated that there is a phase of moving information again after the clarification of relationships has taken place, and that repeating this process will help to organize the information.

These contents emphasize the advantage of drawing lines as they make it easier to visually clarify the relationship between distant information.

- Practicing the KJ method on paper I felt that the "line-drawing function" was not essential [in doing the KJ method (2022-03-08)
- But in the pursuit of better intellectual production techniques, I think it would be better to have a "line-drawing function" (2024-06-02).
- Expressing the association through proximity alone creates a psychological hurdle because moving it causes destruction.
