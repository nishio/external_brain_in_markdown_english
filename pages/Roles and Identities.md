Roles and identity are two different concepts, but they are closely related. Roles refer to expected behaviors and roles in a given social situation or context. For example, there are specific roles such as "leader" at work, "parent" at home, or "supporter" in friendships.

Identity, on the other hand, is more personal and relates to self-perception and a sense of who one is. It includes personal values, beliefs, experiences, and self-image. Identity may be formed in part through roles, but not exclusively.

The role of "someone who knows X" implies that the person has a socially expected behavior or role in a particular knowledge or skill. This can be part of a person's identity, but it does not define their entire identity. For example, a person may be considered "someone who knows X" at work, but there are many other aspects of that person's identity, such as family roles, hobbies, beliefs, etc.

Roles are often given from the outside and are based on social expectations and norms. Identity, however, is formed from within and is deeply rooted in an individual's sense of self. For this reason, even if people have the same role, how they interpret and incorporate it into their identity will vary from person to person.
