I'm sure that people of my generation over 50 years old know that history of the net (the decentralized dream was crushed and only platformers became profitable), and yet now they are saying [[Web3]] Wow! I feel that it's similar to the ease with which the "Zenkyoto Generation" supported the "SEALDs".

I'm a little out of the loop around the whole thing, but I made a note of the discussion about Web3 because I got a sense that it was going to be a useful piece after a while, connected to other things.
