This will make it clear how to move. If not, you will continue to be at the mercy of fluffy generalizations and possibly incorrect majority opinions.

I feel that Japan is a country of abundant peace, where people can believe that they can get what they want if they pay for it. In reality, what's happening now is "you can't get what you pay for because you're out of resources.

If left to the market, the price will rise to the point where "those who want to start" and "those who want to stop because it's too expensive" reach an equilibrium. If the market is left to its own devices, the price will rise to the point where the "people who want to start" and the "people who want to stop because it's too expensive" reach an equilibrium.

This is the reality.

If there is some kind of technical limitation, money may not be enough in the short term. In the meantime, I can say that money can solve the problem if we hit the API.
