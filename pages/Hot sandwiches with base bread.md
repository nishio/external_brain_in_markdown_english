- I used it because I don't like plain base bread so much and it tends to be too much.
- Maybe it's the thickness of the bread portion or the nature of the bread, but the pastrami is still cold.
- Forgot to sprinkle pepper
- Crispy surface.
- The cheese inside isn't too melted.
- The cheese on the outside part was melted.
- Difficult to transfer heat?
    - Is the moisture content of the bread so low that it is less effective steamed by steam?
        - If this is the cause, adding more vegetables, for example, might improve
- I'll try again, but for a longer time.

- Well, I tried to increase the heating time a little bit, but the surface burns before the heat is transferred to the inside.
- You were right to add pepper.
- Is there still not enough moisture on the surface?

- I increased the water content by sandwiching lettuce.
- Surface is not burnt.
- Melted cheese sizzling on the griddle.

    - Only the cheese on the outside is melted.
    - Pastrami is cold, too.
    - That's because you're adding cold vegetables, is that right?
- Also hard to eat.

- I see, there is a way to heat the ingredients first.

    - Whoa, that's good.

    - Beef just got hotter.
        - Firmly peppered
    - As for the veggies... if I were to include them, it wouldn't be lettuce...

Rich in Base Bread
- Cook bacon first.

- Bread is only warmed, 30 seconds.
- After all, base bread tends to burn easily, so I guess I'll have to cook it over low heat for a longer period of time, or cook the filling first.
