> >>> What is concept engineering?
> Engineering the design of concepts. A related field is conceptual engineering.

What would you like to see happen by linking >>>> concepts to engineer?
>  By engineering concepts, it is possible to "feel meta" and communicate with people in different fields. It also has the potential to create a variety of expressions by combining simple atoms.

> >>> If you can make others "feel meta," why are you able to communicate with people from different fields?
> Shared metacognition makes it easier to communicate with people in different domains because they understand how they perceive and have a common framework. In addition, because metacognition is highly abstract and versatile, it can be applied in different domains.
