> [orbs_jp](https://twitter.com/orbs_jp/status/1712295571787231333) Due to the popularity of [[Worldcoin]] in Japan, the Worldcoin team will be visiting Japan again! We will have a Worldcoin meetup on Monday, October 16!
>  This time we will have two sessions, one for those who have [[Orb]] certification and one for those who have not.
>  ↓ Those who have already authenticated Orb (some of them)

- I won the lottery!

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1713843061367947708) I'm heading to [[Singularity Tokyo]] in Shibuya to attend the Worldcoin meetup~!

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1713872746793631844) successfully finished. I'm going to clean up my notes later because the Q&A got really exciting.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1713876149754012099) The [[entity asset]] (oolong tea) was benefited by the system that only one drink is served per person authenticated by WorldID, Basic income drink!
>  I forgot to take a picture of the first substantive asset I received, which was a memorable one, well, it looked like just oolong tea.

talk show
- The development of AI exposes humanity to three challenges
    - The first is economic.
        - Many jobs will be lost with the rise of AI.
        - After In the age of AI, AI creates more wealth and less demand for labor.
        - However, during this transitional period, social instability will occur as some organizations gain the wealth created by AI and many people lose their jobs and become poor.
        - So we need a mechanism such as [[Universal Basic Income]] ([[UBI]]) to distribute the wealth created by AI.
    - The second is democratization of AI governance.
        - How AI should be managed
        - The entire human race is in danger if it does not have governance of AI
    - The third is [[Proof of Personhood]].
        - With the development of AI, [[CAPTCHA]], etc., which rely on human cognitive functions, will no longer function.
        - A [[Proof of Humanity]] in a different way is needed.
        - Iris recognition in [[Orb]] is one of them.
- All three are connected.
    - If we can have a third [[Proof of Humanity]], we can have a fair distribution of wealth, we can have voting.
    - If we can create a unique Real People network, we can solve those problems.
- Worldcoin is a foundation and is governed by members who join the network.
    - World Coin Token is the ownership of network
        - Same as Corporation
- Worldapp is one of the first, but the authentication API will be released and used for [[Proof of Humanity]].
- The beta testing phase is already over and we are in the expansion phase.
    - Right now we have about 2 million people, but we want to cover the whole world.

question
- Do you have a plan to create a social networking site?
    - Rather than having SNS-like functions in Worldapp itself, the direction is to provide authentication APIs so that SNS using human identity authentication by World ID can be developed outside Worldapp.
    - It doesn't quite make sense that you're talking about creating a human "network" but not a social network.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I think it's a MUST requirement to create a [[SybilRank]] type thing and make Trust Seeds of those who scan with Orb.
        - World ID only has a social graph of who trusts who as a human being, and the profile and communication part like Facebook is left to a third party, then make sense.

- As the number of third-party apps grows, won't it become easier to tie them to individuals?
    - Provide [[disposable ID]] to third parties
    - Designed to be issued on a per-application basis so that cross-application ties are not possible.
    - I see<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - > The World ID essentially generates a disposable user ID every time you’re going to use it with an application

- Were there countries with more or less reactions? What were the reasons?
    - Japan Korea Singapore Hong Kong
        - High Asian response
        - We didn't have it in that area during the beta phase, so we didn't expect such a response.
        - Curiosity about new technology
        - Less allergic reaction to Web3
        - Focusing on Asia as one of the company's top priorities.
    - There were no DISAPPOINTED areas.
        - One of the most difficult areas was South America.
        - The response was so much greater than expected that the infrastructure could not be built in time, and it was difficult to communicate with the local media.
        - I think the project itself is being received positively.

- What does Worldcoin Token do? I don't know what to use it for now, I'm hoarding it.
    - the most important role is governance
        - [[Worldcoin is a governance token]].
    - Tokens are exchangeable and thus create exchange value
    - Some stores in Africa and South America accept it as currency.


- What do you think about Japan?
    - I'm thinking Japan is an early adopter.
        - I don't know if that's true. w<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - There may be a lot of early adopters who love technology, but I think there are a lot of older people who are technophobic and have lost the ability to adapt to new things. w

- What is the retention level of Worldapp?
    - Retention is high, I've tried many apps, but this is by far the highest.
    - Grant's button allows you to see the retention.
        - I tried.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

            - 2.36 million registered users, 520,000 Claimed users, about 22%.
            - I'm not sure if this is a lot or a little.
                - I think retention usually means "do you want to keep paying" or "do you want to keep playing the game", but in the case of this app, it's "do you want to receive tokens", so I don't think the comparison is very meaningful!

- I heard about World ID being sold on the dark market in China, has it been hacked?
    - There are three levels of certification, but right now only the base level is offered.
        - One of the first is the current layer, hash value-based authentication of iris information in a smartphone app.
        - The second is authentication to determine identity by selfie in addition to dating information.
        - The third is a full scan by Orb
    - What is being sold is not hacked, but resold by people who have obtained a regular ID, and can be transferred because it does not currently authenticate the face, but cannot be used for future services that require level 2.
    - Those who sold it can never acquire it again.
        - So the seller bet on the position that World ID will never be more valuable than it is now.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - You can't reacquire it if you think that bet was a mistake.
                - The only way to do that is to identify the person who bought it and buy it back, but that's practically impossible.
            - No, wait? Isn't there a way to revoke the older one in the duplicate determination part, which is technically implemented to prevent one person from having two IDs?
                - If this one is realized, it will not be worth buying because "even if you buy it, the seller will make a new ID that you can't use if they make a new one".
                - This one seems to make more sense.

- Will it be possible to create apps in the future that use Worldcoin's authentication features?
    - It's beta, but it's already available as an authentication API.
    - Payments can be made.

- If Worldcoin tokens could be used as AI usage fees for OpenAI, it would support the monetary value of the tokens, do you have such a plan?
    - The idea of using OpenAI for subscriptions is interesting.
    - It is a use case, but the main purpose of the current situation is a governance token, so there is not much emphasis on supporting the value of the token as money
    - It was a little different from my intention to translate "support" as "stable," but I didn't go too deep because "we don't put much emphasis on its value as money at this time."<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - As long as there is a need for OpenAI's AI usage, the usage fee will function as a [[tax collection]], and the value of the currency will come from being able to use it to pay taxes ([[tokenism]]).
        - If you want to distribute the value created by AI as UBI without relying on existing state power, you can pay AI usage fees in your own currency: [[UBI to avoid monopolizing access to AI]].
            - In this case, the value of the currency is auctioned off, and the company that can utilize AI the most ultimately wins the right to use AI.
        - Well, but this "proprietary currency" doesn't have to be Worldcoin, so I can see why it wouldn't be tightly coupled at this point. And we can issue OpenAICoin when we need it, which would still accomplish our goal.

- Do you intend to establish a Japanese branch?
    - To begin with, Worldcoin is a foundation as an organizational structure.
    - [[Tools of Humanity]] is a company
        - Plans to step out of line at some stage.
    - Expanding the ecosystem
        - Its methods are not limited to employment as an employee.

- How do you increase users or create some killer app?
    - What to do about use cases with 3 million users today is not an important issue.
    - When 50 million, 100 million people sign up, there will be use cases that have never existed before.
    - Portugal, Chile, Argentina
        - 1% of the population is signed in
        - Penetrating these areas is important.
    - The SDK is public, so interested parties are using use cases.
    - Maybe UBI alone is currently enough to increase the number of new users, so the development of features for existing users is not a priority.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Logistics to penetrate South America is the top priority.

- What avenues can be considered for UBI purposes, Worldcoin in its current state is too cheap.
    - Worldcoin is not UBI
        - It is a project to create an infrastructure, and its ownership is Worldcoin
        - What we're aiming for is network ownership and something like a ticket, so it's no surprise that Worldcoin's current value doesn't make it a UBI.
    - We need to have a way to distribute them in the future when a foundation arises that wants to UBI.
        - So on top of that, we're using the infrastructure that makes UBI possible.
        - I think they don't want this to be considered a definite fact at this point, so they don't want to state it clearly, but I'm sure it's "in the future when OpenAI does UBI".<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
