title: "The meaning of shining words"
---

[[Dictionary Meaning]] of [[shining word]] is often at odds with its meaning in [author's context
- That's the superior [[metaphorical creation]].
- But when the word is alone, the context is lost and the [[dictionary meaning]] becomes dominant.

Situations like reading a book and highlighting a favorite phrase
- How well does it land in the author's context?
- I think it's more useful to have something that's connected to the context than to simply pick something with a superficial meaning.
    - is the value of connecting with the context, so the reaction of "people who don't know the context" when it is distributed in isolation would be better for the superficial
            - [[Pleasing the masses is evil.]]

- [[Books are already a product of abstraction]], so taking them out of context [[Taking the top of the pyramid is not what I expected...]]" happens.
