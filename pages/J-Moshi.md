>  Based on @kyutai_labs' Moshi, it "speaks" and "listens" at the same time like a human.
>  This is the first model available in Japanese.
>  Model size is 7B and lightweight, please try it!

If we run this on a local machine, we might be able to organize tasks by voice without relying on [[Advanced Voice]].
- I'm not sure when this happened, but Advanced Voice now disconnects after about 5 minutes if I leave it on silent, so I can no longer leave it on when I'm working on my computer and use my voice to control it when I think of something.

- > J-Moshi is in the prototype stage, and its responses may be unnatural. In addition, since most of J-Moshi's training data is chat dialogues, it cannot generate responses according to the user's instructions.
    - Uh, I wonder how much this will affect them.
