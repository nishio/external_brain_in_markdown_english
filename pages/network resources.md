Things that [[increase in value as more people recognize them]], like NFT, npm modules, Art, Music, etc. Surely this is a better way to say Art is public goods." [[Information wants to be free]]" and if there is a notion of possession about the meme, the price goes up.

If you have a brand (and recognition), more people will want to possess it, and you can raise the price per unit. By doing this in the information space, the transfer of value is facilitated. Sure, people's ASSUMPTION could change if they could have digital data that stays the same on each platform.

- Goods whose value increases with [[attention]] have a positive [[network effect]] because [[being connected to]] improves the chance of [[attention inflow]].
