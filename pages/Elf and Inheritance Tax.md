- [[elf]] and [[inheritance tax]]
> [@fladdict](https://twitter.com/fladdict/status/1567599536293695489): I wonder if the "High Elf super financial state" story has already been published in the otherworldly reincarnation system. The High Elves can manage their assets with no inheritance tax and infinite compound interest in a single generation. ...... Over time, all capital will be concentrated in the Elves' hands. Far more frightening than a bad cheat skill. A world where [[capitalists]] and [[moneylenders]] and [[bankers]] are all monopolized by the Elves.

The cycle is that children of fallen families who can't pay property tax come out of the forest and buy a forest when they save enough money. Sometimes they get burned.

It occurs to me that [[(juridical) person]] will never die, but will continue to exist, and eventually all of its assets will belong to the corporation.
