Body is ticking.
- The level of pain in my right knee even though I only travel in Tokyo.
- Subjective symptoms after conference include left calf
- But what I haven't noticed is that my muscles on the front of my thighs are stiff.
- And fundamentally, the iliopsoas muscle is stiff.
    - They said it was like a bar of iron.
- It's a little better now that it's loosened up and I'm finally aware of the stiffness.

Let's take a long bath.
