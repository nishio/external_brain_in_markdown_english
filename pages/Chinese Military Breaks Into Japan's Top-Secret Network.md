Chinese Military Breaks Into Japan's Top-Secret Network
> [Kazuto_Takeuchi](https://twitter.com/Kazuto_Takeuchi/status/1688739808330575872) WP article on the US informing Japan that China had infiltrated the Japanese Defense Ministry's network. The article was published in WP and has become a topic of discussion.
>  The article is a summary in Japanese, but the original article also gives a more detailed history, suggesting that the Japanese government was behind the curve in its counter-information efforts.1//

    - (DeePL) Chinese military hackers had penetrated Japan's most sensitive computer networks, the National Security Agency (NSA) revealed in the fall of 2020.

In the fall of 2020, the second Abe Cabinet had just transitioned to the Kan Cabinet, and the Minister of Defense was Nobuo Kishi, a member of the House of Representatives. The transition was made to the Kishida Cabinet in October of the same year.2/

>  However, such U.S. activities have been known for some time. Even if they are a trusted friend, the reality of the international community is that their trust is "verified" through other channels.4/

> [Kazuto_Takeuchi](https://twitter.com/Kazuto_Takeuchi/status/1688739813556715520) As exposed by the Snowden affair in 2013, the NSA, the US intelligence agency, divides its allies into the Five Eyes ( The NSA, the U.S. intelligence agency, divides its allies into the Five Eyes (the United States, Canada, Britain, Australia, New Zealand) and others.

It is easy to understand and highly recommended. It provides detailed information on intelligence activities after World War II, especially SIGINT, and also on interception activities based in Japan.

This situation could repeat itself in the modern era and needs to be seriously addressed. It is important to allocate resources to the protection of information and to have a mechanism to screen people to see if they are capable of handling secrets.
