- Communication Tools] for close [[notice]] requires literacy on the part of the notice generator.
- [Parents' meeting collapses due to chit-chat on line, causing a wave of screams of real trouble!](https://sirabee.com/2018/07/14/20161708355/)
    - Someone is chatting on line for communication.
        - The person's claim
            - Communication among parents is important.
            - What's wrong with parents talking nicely to each other?
            - It's not a good idea to turn off notifications when it's a network of contacts.
        - Unaware that they are destroying the "notify me of contact" function of the contact group
    - Separate groups for networking and chatting were created.
    - However, the chit-chat resumed in the contact group because "the number of people participating in the chit-chat has decreased".
        - The lack of awareness to come back to it once it's explicitly detached as a nuisance.
        - The fact that fewer people are participating in the chit-chat is evidence that fewer people find value in the chit-chat.
        - I don't get a lot of attention for what I say, but I want to be noticed.
        - So you get a free ride to a group that others are creating for contact.
        - Because the contact is important information and everyone is paying attention to it.
        - Generating a non-contact notification in the contact group destroys the function of communicating the contact.
            - Selfish acts based on [person who craves the limelight
- technical answer
    - Twitter has adopted the "[[Mute function]]".
        - Ability to prevent certain people's posts from appearing on the timeline.
            - Without [[Unfollow]] or [[block (lump of something)]], the other party will not know that [[mute]] has been done.
    - Since the problem is with the individual sender, the choice is to stop displaying that individual's postings.
