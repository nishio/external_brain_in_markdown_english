title: "Balance between life after birth and life before birth"

>  [[Dai Tamesue]]
>  I realize that this is a sensitive discussion, but I think that continuing a country can be paraphrased as "continuing to balance life after birth with life before birth. Roughly speaking, I think that medical care is in charge of life just before and after birth, and the social framework and politics are in charge of life before birth.
>  Medical advances protect and extend life after birth. Medical care enhances the well-being of people after they are born. However, to put it another way, if people are not born, there is no life to protect. How to protect life before birth, in other words, how to create a society, system, and environment conducive to the birth of a child, is a very complex and cross-cutting issue, despite the fact that there are ministries and agencies in charge. Above all, the greatest weakness of pre-born life is that it cannot be expressed in the form of a vote.
> If the system of [[democracy]] allows people after they are born to pursue their own life's gain (leaving out emotions such as being happy to have a child), then no one will think twice about the lives that will be born. To take it to the extreme, if the generation now living can prosper, distribute, and gradually decline, that is the end of the matter.
>  Some people say that people want to have children as long as they are happy, which may be partially true, but from a larger perspective, developed countries are all experiencing a declining birthrate. This is very troubling, but on a macro level, the more affluent people become, the lower the fertility rate will be, which means that people do not necessarily want to have children just because they are happy.
>  For a nation with a democratic system to continue, someone must represent life before it is born, which means that individuals are required to vote on a timeline beyond their own lives. But this is a very difficult problem. This is because a portion of the gains of life after birth would be allocated to the future.
>  What will happen in a [[low birthrate and longevity society]]? The world is watching Japan for learning. Can human beings really go beyond their own personal gain, beyond the time frame of their own lives, and pass their own gain to the future, imagining not only the person in front of them now, but also the life before birth? It seems to be one social experiment.
>  I hope that posterity will say that this generation had imagination and lived for the benefit of the next generation beyond their own gain.

You're saying that there's a bias in having [[democracy]] with [[one vote per person]] for living people that disregards distribution for future people yet to be born.

    - > Without the market, we wouldn't be able to do business. But if you look around you, you won't find any business owners who are taking care of their children. And that's as it should be. In this country, people who have sacrificed childcare in politics and the economy have risen through the ranks to become leaders of society. I was fortunate enough to experience childcare in this way. That is why I realized that a businessman must first take care of his child before talking about business.
