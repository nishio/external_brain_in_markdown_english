> Culture and growth are a set of things.

>  No culture is formed because they are roughly divided into career, general, technical, and research positions and shoved into the same bucket in a messy manner.

I think there are a lot of people who associate hierarchy with organizational hierarchy. This is referring to a structure whereby "Common Value Criteria" are created and maintained over time by "B and C" "[[lengthening]]" and imitating "A" who is ahead of them, right?
