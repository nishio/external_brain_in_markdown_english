# Private developers have the most advantage
.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The development of AI is having a tremendous impact on the software industry as a whole. In particular, [[enterprises]], [[smaller companies]], and [[individual developers]] all benefit, with individual developers being the most advantaged in terms of decision-making costs.

### Advantages of large companies
.
Large companies manage large numbers of projects and complex systems, and AI programming assistance can greatly improve the efficiency of these projects; AI tools provide automatic code generation, bug fixing suggestions, and testing automation, reducing development time and costs. In addition, enhanced quality control through AI improves product reliability and customer satisfaction, strengthening your competitive advantage.

### SME benefits
.
Small and medium-sized companies can also improve development efficiency and reduce costs by implementing AI tools. Limited resources can be used more efficiently to deliver high-quality products at lower costs. In addition, with AI's assistance, they can get to market faster and seize growth opportunities more quickly. For SMEs, AI can be a powerful tool to have the same technological capabilities as larger companies.

### Advantages for individual developers
.
For individual developers, the introduction of AI offers tremendous advantages: AI tools streamline the process of coding, debugging, and testing, allowing individuals to develop high-quality services in a short amount of time. AI tools can also provide support across a wide range of technical areas to achieve multi-functionality, enabling low-cost development. In addition, feedback from AI promotes continuous learning and growth.

### Advantages in terms of decision costs
.
One of the biggest benefits of the development of AI is the reduction of [[decision-making costs]]. In large and small companies, decision-making requires coordination and consensus building, which is a time-consuming and costly process. Individual developers, on the other hand, make decisions on their own and can respond quickly and flexibly. Since internal communication is unnecessary and all information is completed within oneself, introduction of AI tools and adoption of new technologies can be done smoothly.

### Summary
.
The development of AI offers tremendous benefits to all in the software industry: large companies, small and medium enterprises, and individual developers. In particular, individual developers are in the best position in terms of decision-making costs. Individuals have a significant advantage in terms of faster decision-making, simplified communication, greater flexibility, and optimized resources, and with the help of AI, they can significantly improve their competitiveness. Thus, the development of AI is key to facilitating the evolution of the entire software industry and opening up new possibilities.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Do [[empowered individual]] developers threaten the market share of software development companies? Or become complementary goods? Or become independent and open untapped markets?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The impact of AI-empowered individual developers on software development companies can be considered from three perspectives

### 1. threaten the market share of software development companies?
As individual developers are able to rapidly develop high-quality software using AI tools, they will have the ability to compete with software development companies in certain market segments. In particular, they could threaten a company's market share in the following ways

- Addressing niche markets: Individual developers can quickly provide software specific to a particular need, potentially taking share of niche markets.
- Cost advantage: Individuals can develop products at a lower cost than companies, which can give them an advantage in price competition.

### 2. Is it [interpolated goods
?
Software provided by individual developers could contribute to the market in a way that complements existing corporate products. The following situations could be envisioned

- Plug-ins and extensions: Individual developers developing plug-ins and extensions for the corporate platform serve to enrich the ecosystem and increase the value of the corporate product.
- Customized Solutions: Individual developers can extend the use of corporate products by providing customized solutions tailored to specific customer needs.

### 3. Exploit untapped markets
.
The flexibility of individual developers to adopt new technologies and ideas has the potential to open up untapped markets that established companies may not have their eyes on. The following points are important

- Rapid realization of innovative ideas: Individual developers can quickly prototype new ideas and bring them to the real market. This allows them to deliver software that meets new market needs.
- Addressing edge cases: Individual developers can open up new markets by providing solutions to edge cases or specific needs that large companies cannot cover.

### Conclusion
.
Individual developers empowered by AI can be a threat to the market share of software development companies, but in many cases they are expected to play a complementary role and strengthen the ecosystem of companies. It is also highly likely that individual developers will contribute to the growth of the software industry as a whole by opening up new markets. This will lead to greater technological innovation and market diversification as individuals and companies coexist.
