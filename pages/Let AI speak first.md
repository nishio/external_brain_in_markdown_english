- When you are trying to talk about the relationship between A and B, but B is not yet solidified, or the distance between concepts is long and the cost of verbalization is high, first throw A, which is already verbalized, to the AI and let it speak, visualize the surrounding information network, and then use it to say B that you want to say.
    - [[connection of distant object]].

concrete example
    - [[During the continuation of the precise change production]]
    - Trying to connect "surefire performance" with "life," first checking to see if you understand the concept of "surefire performance."
    - [[constraint theory]] → [Theory of constraints that regards humans as devices
    - The first thing on my brain was "human TOC."
    - First, I asked how well AI understood TOC (Theory of Constraints).
    - And after confirming that my interpretation of "[[aiming for 100% uptime is harmful]]" was correct, I connected it with "That can be projected onto humans, right?"
    - [[Understanding the complex world as it is complex]]
    - Before I say my point, I first tell the AI that I'm thinking about "~" and let it expand.
        - The criticisms I wanted to make in response to the statement, "It is important to be willing to find overall patterns and linkages," were succinctly stated.
        - When I write "B criticizing A," if I write A first, I have to do both the viewpoints of A and B. This is a high cognitive cost, so it is better to let AI do A when criticizing what is generally considered to be true.
    - In this conversation, we're [[Summons abstract concepts]] and [[spread a net]].
        - Here's another example: [[Summons abstract concepts]].
            - I let him explain the new metaphor of combining "abstract concepts" with "invocation."
            - And then, to omit the context of "interacting with AI", [["concept "summoned" by AI"]] is modified to [["concept "summoned" by AI"]].
    - [[Silver Democracy and Affirmative Action]]
    - AI substituted youth for minorities in the term historically discriminated against minorities and socially disadvantaged groups used to describe [" affirmative action
    - This, I know I gave you two keywords out of the blue, but you could have just let me explain each of the two and then pointed out that they're related.
    - I thought there would be a little more backlash, but they simply said as legitimate an argument as any other minority" and the discussion was over.
