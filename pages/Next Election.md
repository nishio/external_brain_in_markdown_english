Next Election
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1949263619889549537) When I saw your post "What if we lose the next election?", I thought that we may not be on the same page regarding what "the next election" refers to. The "next election" in which we may lose the seats we gained through proportional representation in this Upper House election is six years from now. No matter what happens in the lower house election or the upper house election three years from now, the seats won this time will not be lost.
- Moreover, there is also [[proportional representation election carried forward]], so it is OK if Mr. Anno resigns.
    - >  The candidate who is ranked next to the lowest-ranked candidate on the party list for a proportional district may be placed as the runner-up. When a vacancy occurs due to the death or resignation of the elected candidate, the runner-up is carried forward and elected. ...In proportional districts, this may be done until the end of the term of office of the member elected in that election.
        - [carried forward election - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B9%B0%E3%82%8A%E4%B8%8A%E3%81%92%E5%BD%93%E9%81%B8)

In other words, the decision to grant the seats to the people will be judged as good or bad six years from now by the "counting of the votes, an expression of the will of the people".

But open source is not a money maker and engineers have lives, so they could not do it full time. The will of the people is to budget for this to be able to hire 10 people full time for 6 years.
