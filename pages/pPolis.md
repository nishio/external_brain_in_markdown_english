> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1647675305350537217) Also, and this is something I've been thinking about for a while and finally verbalized, there is the issue of "ambiguity in the meaning of words". In this case, the meaning of "affirmation" is clearly shaky.
>  So, until now, I wondered if the discrepancy between the meanings of the words would make it impossible to reach a consensus. (continued)
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1647675805588422661) However, what I think now is that the meaning of a word is not a point but a distribution, and that as people repeatedly take actions for and against the same short sentence and visualize how it compares to other opinions in the world, they will gradually come to align with the same distribution. I think that the distribution of words is not a point but a distribution, and that as we repeatedly visualize how our actions for and against the same short sentences compare with the world's opinions, they will gradually become aligned to the same distribution.

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1647706983146090497): one more verbalization: making Polis' seed question is in itself a very good thought exercise. You can look at other people's opinions and adopt them, even if you disagree with them, because "you can always vote against them later".
>  The criterion for adoption is whether it is easy to pitch in favor or against. From that perspective, many people are making low-density arguments with a series of meaningless words. In order to make it as short as possible, we cut out unnecessary words.
>  The attributes of the speaker are also cut off. A statement like "this claim is unacceptable because the speaker is ~~" is a double claim.

> [teramotodaiki](https://twitter.com/teramotodaiki/status/1647799451967438848) pol.is, I think different people are impressed by different things, but I think this kind of tool can be used for running a company. I thought it was a good tool for running a company.
>  "Let's discuss and decide with all employees!" I think 20 people is a realistic limit for what pol.is can do, but pol.is is likely to scale to 100 or 1000 people, or even more orders of magnitude!
- > [teramotodaiki](https://twitter.com/teramotodaiki/status/1647799913793851393) I would rather have all employees participate in pol.is from the beginning to get a sense of "what everyone thinks" than to be told afterwards that "I disagreed with that decision. I'd rather have all employees participate in pol.is from the beginning to get a sense of "how everyone thinks" and to build consensus as much as possible "before" making a decision.
- >  Management is happy to know how to step up to the plate and increase everyone's [[buy-in]].
- > [teramotodaiki](https://twitter.com/teramotodaiki/status/1647803171522363392) On the other hand, social usage, i.e., "social networking is not good because of the echo chamber, so pol.is is better" is a bit skeptical. I'm a bit skeptical about that.
- >  I think visualization is too interesting and too compelling, and I think in some cases it's too much trouble if the divide is visualized. I mean, just the graphs keep getting buzzed and shared.
- > [teramotodaiki](https://twitter.com/teramotodaiki/status/1647803544437927937) However, this is because I have given up on Twitter from the beginning, thinking that there is no way to have a discussion on Twitter, and I only watch people discussing on Twitter from a distance. I have only been watching people discussing on Twitter from a distance, so I think there is a huge difference in our awareness of the issues to begin with.
- > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1647816845322510336?s=20): @teramotodaiki I put this opinion in [https://t.co/NIdrYcvxOJ](https://t.co/NIdrYcvxOJ)
- > [@teramotodaiki](https://twitter.com/teramotodaiki/status/1647846085350821888?s=20): @nishio Ah I see, this is the way to get involved. Good or bad, you said that everything that offers a new perspective should be made into an "opinion".
- > (I wrote "I have a feeling" as a Twitter gesture, which made it difficult to express either agreement or disagreement ðŸ˜‚I'll write it myself next time.)

- [[Problem with two Polis clusters]]

> [@lempiji](https://twitter.com/lempiji/status/1647984192905691136): I have a practical idea that Pol.is might be useful in some cases for problem-solving craftsmen, but it would be quite difficult to determine some kind of guidelines for correct and safe use. I'm thinking Pol.is might be useful for problem solvers in some cases. If it's for public use, I'd do a limited release of about three steps before organizing questions and submitting them, but I'm conflicted about using it in a more messy way.

- [[Problem of too many Polis questions]]

> [@yuiseki_](https://twitter.com/yuiseki_/status/1647958731076820995?s=20): [https://t.co/nwvkCLinwQ](https://t.co/nwvkCLinwQ) I'm trying to use it vaguely halfway for fun, but it's a useful poll to help with decision making. I'm sure it's nice to have others add to the matter.

- [[Polis: same-sex marriage]]
> Many questions are ambiguous and should not be associated
- For questions that "you thought" were ambiguous, just press "I don't know".
    - If you all feel the same way, just go into "Uncertainty".
- How about "should not be associated with."
    - There will be "inconvenient to be associated" for certain people in certain positions.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1648198561941835776) I received the comment that "there are many questions that should not be associated" What are "questions that should not be associated"? There are "questions that are inconvenient for people in a certain position to be associated with". But it is not harmful to the whole because it expects "others to judge conveniently for themselves by not noticing the association".
    - > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1648200432161013760) For example, if I posted the opinion "Mushroom village is supreme" in a discussion of same-sex marriage, the ratio of approval or disapproval in any opinion group would not change, so it would sink without appearing in the "opinions that characterize the group. The opinion sinks without appearing in the "opinions that characterize the group" section. There is no need for the question contributor to determine whether it is relevant or not.
    - > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1648200997792256000) Opinion contributors should not be able to post for free because participants would pay the cost of one vote. if I want to pitch my opinion to 80 people, I should first 80 votes and save up the credits and then pay for it?
    - >  But this way, if we get 30 voters for 20 opinions, no one will be able to post an opinion.
    - > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1648220031602524160?s=20): ah, ok, you can submit an opinion submission requesting M(>N) credits when you have N credits, but the voting act will allow M-N I just can't make another submission until I finish paying off my debt of


- > [@ft28](https://twitter.com/ft28/status/1648240758900801536?s=20): @nishio Many of them were like "same-sex marriage should be allowed because mushroom village is supreme" Can you say it's relevant? I hope the administrators are doing their best, but I'm disappointed.
    - > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1648373496073031680): @ft28 What exactly are you referring to when you say "many people felt that same-sex marriage should be allowed because kikonosato is supreme"?
    - > Here is the list [https://t.co/9ehLplsaUy](https://t.co/9ehLplsaUy)


> [ft28](https://twitter.com/ft28/status/1648195444357599232) felt that the discussion of same-sex marriage and its legalization should be separated.
>  Other adoption and use of surrogate mothers need not be associated with same-sex marriage.
>  In general, the questions themselves have many meaningless and irrelevant associations and are not meaningfully distributed.
>  Discussion should focus on improving the status of de facto marriage and the burden on beneficiaries
>  The current system, which rewards family registers and genealogical survival, is not bad.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1648229749884620800) I think we should each vote on this as an opinion!

- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1649368611440693252) I can see that there is a cutoff that 80-90% of people agree with, even though there are two opinion groups.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1649371371150143488) This Polis, this time, was split down the middle on this issue.

Intention of this experiment
- Stated purpose: "The purpose of this discussion is to find the best way to create a work environment that is conducive to both employees who are raising children and those who are not."
- I think it's inevitable that the final composition of the two groups will be confrontational, so I'll go ahead and say "Even if you have opposing groups, you can still lead to an opinion that 80-90% of the people agree with".
- I'm not making seed opinions this time.

- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1649628774277988352) Summary of major opinions: Important to provide flexible work arrangements for employees raising children and create a comfortable work environment Decrease turnover rate and improve corporate image. Promoting asynchronous communication is also important Directors of employees raising children are not crazy.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1649628988304941056) Group A
- >  - Giving special treatment only to employees raising children creates dissatisfaction among other employees
- >  - Infant care employees and infant care employees should be treated separately.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1649629654578520064) Group B: Salary reductions increase the burden on employees raising children. Support is a corporate social responsibility. Work adjustment by companies is a problem, teams consisting of employees who are raising children would be beneficial. Consider individual measures such as maternity leave, morning/afternoon leave, shorter hours away from work, shorter working hours, etc.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1649630304674680832) Group C: Employees in child care have the same responsibilities and the pay reduction is unfair. Some board members are also in child care. Denies salary reduction and distribution to support personnel. Infants and toddlers should not be differentiated, and should not be separated by infant age.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1649631323940847616) Group A: Other employees are not happy with special treatment. Separate treatment for infants and toddlers. Employees with childcare do not have the same responsibilities and pay reduction is fair. Work adjustment is not a company issue. 5 years of parental leave + 50% salary is not realistic.


> [hal_sk](https://twitter.com/hal_sk/status/1644260321597722626/photo/1) The results of the Pol.is poll, organized by Audrey Tan to explore the impact of generative AI on democracy, are in. 347 opinions were submitted, and 224 people voted a combined 10,220 votes (45.65 per person!). The voting trends show that there were 165 groups of people who voted. Based on the trend of the votes, 165 groups were classified.

- > [hal_sk](https://twitter.com/hal_sk/status/1644260815816790016) The groups are further divided into Group A and Group B, and you can see the ratio of agree/disagree for each group. For example, you can see opinions that were mostly in favor from all groups, opinions that were divided into two groups, opinions that were mostly "don't know/pass", and so on.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1649855767510646784) It is not "165 groups were classified" but "165 out of 224 were classified into the groups described below".
- >  Then, what about those who were not classified, either because they responded too little and there was not enough data, or they were too similar to existing responses (e.g., if they responded randomly, there is a high probability of this).



Polis: same-sex marriage
- We need a new framework that encompasses the family as a social partner and community, not just the old marriage. 78%%
- Sexual minorities are "few," so even if same-sex marriage were legalized, it would not have a big-picture impact on fertility 77%.
- Marriage as social proof and marriage as a tax and social security system have separate layers of issues to be considered respectively. 74%%
