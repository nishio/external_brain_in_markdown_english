- [[space to stretch]] of [[track record]].
- 1:
    - If there are two, the point in between is less uncertain.
    - [[extension]] will also be a little lower.
- 2:
    - Three to put up a face.
    - If you draw an extension line in two dimensions, it becomes the entire space and cannot be drawn, but this is a two-dimensional plane in a three-dimensional or larger space.
    - Four of them make a triangular pyramid.
    - In general, N achievements create a space of N-1 dimensional "blends of what we have done in the past" and "extensions"
- 3:
    - Actually, not a point [[blurred circle]].
    - You can change the extension depending on which point you describe it as.
    - The expression "blurry circle" implicitly implies two dimensions, but in reality it is distributed in infinite dimensions
    - People are not aware of many dimensions.
    - By actively using this swing in the direction of the extra dimension, the coverage can be extended to "dimensions not covered by past performance" while taking the form of a "low-risk challenge as an extension of the past".
