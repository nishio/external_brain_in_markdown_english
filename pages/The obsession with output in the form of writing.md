title: "The obsession with output in the form of writing"
---

- The author shows the Scrapbox page to others only after the author has determined that the page has "reached a level of perfection" that can be shown to others.
    - [[Observation Bias]] makes you think that everything is such a page.
- I feel like that sentence of perfection will be written from the very beginning.
- That's not possible.
- Example
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/683f439cdf299e9170c6e81f69fba29c/thumb/1000)
    - When it was first written, it was only the first three lines.
    - After that, I thought, "It's hard for people who have no experience in Go to understand what I'm talking about," so commentary was added
