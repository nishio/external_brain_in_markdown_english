- > Dawn ([[Technology Triggers]], Technology Trigger) - The first phase of the hype cycle begins with "technology triggers" or breakthroughs (breakthroughs). New product announcements and other events generate media coverage and interest.
- > Apex of Excessive Expectations ([[Apex of Excessive Expectations]], Peak of Inflated Expectations) - In the next phase, public attention becomes greater, often resulting in undue excitement and unrealistic expectations. Sometimes success stories emerge, but many end in failure.
- > Hollow of Disillusionment (Trough of Disillusionment) - Technology rapidly loses interest and enters the "Hollow of Disillusionment" when it fails to live up to excessive expectations. The media stops covering the topic and the technology.
- > Recovery Phase ([[Slope of Enlightenment]], Slope of Enlightenment) - While the technology is no longer covered in the media, some businesses continue to climb the "slope of enlightenment" and come to understand its benefits and how to apply it.
- > Stabilization Period ([[Productivity plateau]], Plateau of Productivity) - When a technology gains widespread publicity and acceptance, it reaches a "plateau of productivity. The technology gradually stabilizes and evolves to the second and third generations. The final elevation of the plateau varies, depending on whether the technology is broadly applicable or only [[niche]] markets.
