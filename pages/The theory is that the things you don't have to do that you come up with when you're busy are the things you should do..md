title: "The theory is that the things you don't have to do that you come up with when you're busy are the things you should do."

- [[busy]] Sometimes I think of [[Things you don't have to do]].
> I think it's not a paradox or Murphy's Law or anything, but simply because we don't have much time and our resolution about time has increased, and our brains are activated to take a serious look at time = life. I think it is because our brains are activated to face time = life seriously.
>  So, it is a good idea to implement interesting ideas that come to you when you are fucking busy, in parallel with when you are fucking busy. Even if you are doing something important and urgent, interrupt them.
>  And as that happens, my priority ranking becomes inflated, and I have no choice but to cut out things that I used to consider important. In other words, your values and comfort zone change.
