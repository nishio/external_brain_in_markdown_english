title: "People who cannot tolerate the good fortune of others."
---

- It seems that one game had a bug that gave out a lot of good items only to a few people.
- I hear people who didn't get to keep their [[fortune]] are furious about it.
- My wife wondered why it happens so much when there's no loss.
- It's the [[just world hypothesis]].
- There are many people in the world who believe that "the world is [[fairness]].
- Such people believe that good people are rewarded and bad people are punished.
- Therefore, if I am not rewarded, it is as if I am being told that I am evil, which is unacceptable.
