> [@yo_ehara](https://twitter.com/yo_ehara/status/1137632108329914368?s=20): in my case, I never quite understood the idea that creating rivals is a good influence, after all. All I can think is that if you have rivals, it's easier to survive if you run in a direction where there are no rivals.


> [1T0T](https://twitter.com/1T0T/status/1137646049089077249) From my experience, there are people who are motivated by success stories such as being accepted to a high status conference, and people who are the complete opposite, who "wouldn't do it if the goal was to win". I have the impression that there are both. If you are in a position to teach, I think you should assume that there are both.

> [1T0T](https://twitter.com/1T0T/status/1137892600734609408) My point is also expressed in the clear metaphor of "gymnastics" and "culture" in this thread. I think it is important to respect the existence of both.
>  >drinami: "Ummm...you are a typical athletic researcher, as self-reported..." is my honest impression.
>  Because it's a goal or a dream, and all they talk about is getting to the top or the number of papers, and I wonder if the point is the PDCA cycle for producing papers... > RT
- > [yo_ehara](https://twitter.com/yo_ehara/status/1137646697872482304) Oh wow! Thank you very much. After all, that area is divided by personality, not by which is more rational...
- > [1T0T](https://twitter.com/1T0T/status/1137648088078725122) I think. I'm more of the not-motivated type myself...

> [drinami](https://twitter.com/drinami/status/1137889760591007744) "Ummm...you are a typical athletic researcher as self-reported..." is my honest impression.
>  Because it's a goal or a dream, and all they talk about is getting to the top or the number of papers, and I wonder if the point is the PDCA cycle for producing papers...
- > [drinami](https://twitter.com/drinami/status/1137889906590593025) I wonder what they hope to achieve when they "win" a position as a PI, for example, if not become a superstar or a top researcher in their field. I am concerned about what one hopes to achieve when one "wins" a position, say, a PI, if not a superstar or a top researcher.
- > [drinami](https://twitter.com/drinami/status/1137890042049835013) In the document, they are lumped together as the genius type, but I think there are a large group of "cultural association researchers" who are driven by internal motivation, not by external results, but by questions they sincerely want to clarify or problems they want to solve. I think that "cultural association researchers" who are driven by internal motivation, not by external results, are not a handful of geniuses, but a large group in the research industry.
- > [drinami](https://twitter.com/drinami/status/1137890148257943552) The author is polite and honest and says that we can coexist with each other, and this material is easy to understand and very helpful for me in teaching athletic-type students. The author is polite and sincere and says that we can coexist with each other.
- > [drinami](https://twitter.com/drinami/status/1137890149080059904) However, when this kind of discourse goes away from the author's intention and is linked to so-called "numerical achievement" and "selection and concentration," it can be seen in the same way as ranking sites, where the diversity of research cultures is undermined. I would like to say that I have a different view.
- > [drinami](https://twitter.com/drinami/status/1137901524166643713) I know this is a regular post, but I'll put this up

- > [drinami](https://twitter.com/drinami/status/1137902111335673863) Even within the scope of your observation, there are some areas where athletes do better, so maybe that's one way to choose a field!
