title: "Swipe to adjust distance"

# want to do

I made it.
    - [[Draw near and read.]]
- The amount of movement was not taken because it was picked up by the swipe Up/Down decision.
- The swipe is uncomfortable to operate as it pops closer with the completed frame.

-----
- In slow swiping, the amount of change depends on the amount of swiping
- Much larger change for quick swipes
- For things that have changed
    - Do not approach within a certain distance (equivalent to maximum display within visual field)
    - Round only when the distance after the move crosses a multiple of the initial value from smaller to larger.

with this
- Fast front swipe for maximum display
- Fast back swipe to initial distance
indicates uncertainty or second hand nature of what precedes it
