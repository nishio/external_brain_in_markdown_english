## "Even 100-150 people can have a deep dialogue" - a detailed discussion of Tan's remarks
.

1.### exact positioning of the utterance
.
At the beginning of the 12-minute mark during the session, Mr. Tan
>  "With the right facilitator, *hundreds-strong conversations* (roughly 100-150 people) can work well."
I have made it clear that this is not the case. The *conversation* here refers to "simultaneous two-way deliberation," and is prefaced by the fact that it is not a mere questionnaire or question-and-answer session.

2.### Work experience cited as basis
.

- vTaiwan/Join process.
    - In the 2015 vTaiwan, which discussed Uber legislation, he described how, after collecting thousands of opinions in Polis, about 140 people spent half a day discussing and compiling a consensus draft via Zoom + minutes sharing.
- Fuehrer's Office "Youth Council".
    - The nearly 200 randomly selected young people were divided into 10 tables, with one professional facilitator assigned to each table. Again, the facilitator explained that the key to "digging deep" with 100 people at the same time was to divide the tables and share the results with the entire group sequentially.
- * Internal workshop of the Ministry of Digital Taiwan.
    - He presented a practical example of using Dotstorming + real-time transcription + timebox in combination with Dotstorming + real-time transcription + timebox to keep discussions focused when 120 staff members conduct "case reviews" on a weekly basis.

3.### Rationale for the headcount limit (oral commentary by Mr. Tan)
.
- [[Cognitive Load and "Dialogue Network Density"]]
    - Around 150 is "the limit at which each person can spontaneously follow who said what. This is consistent with the *Dunbar number* (around 150) in psychology, he notes.
- Moderator placement costs.
    - He summarized that when the number of participants exceeds 150, the ratio of "facilitator: participants = 1:12 to 1:15" will no longer be sufficient and a coordinator layer (meta-facilitator) will become necessary, thus shifting the focus from "depth" to "representativeness.
- Online Simultaneous Interpretation Available.
    - The number of participants is limited to 100 if simultaneous interpretation is used. He also pointed out specific operational hurdles: "If there are more than 150 people and they are multilingual, the delay in switching interpreters will take the heat out of the discussion.

4.### Positioning with Academic Evidence
.

- Mr. Tan himself stated, "This is a 'rule of thumb' based on the Taiwanese government's experiment and my practical knowledge, not a rigorous empirical study.
- However, the Harvard Kennedy School and others have conducted case studies on vTaiwan, and there are several case studies that show that "mini-publics" of 100 people are effective in forming policy consensus.

5.### Conclusion (Mr. Tan's stance)
.

- * Yes - Conditional "deep dialogue is possible".

- Conditions = (1) small table divisions of around 10 people, (2) immediate feedback tools, (3) skilled facilitators, (4) visualization of the discussion.
- [[Limitations]] - If the number of members exceeds 150, "breadth" will be prioritized over "depth" unless a combination of "representative system, lottery, and AI aggregation" is used.

### In short
.
- 100-150 people = "the maximum number of people who can participate fully while maintaining deliberation."
- Beyond that, we will enter the "stratification" phase using AI and random sampling.
--Tan's empirical view is that the
