After walking so hard and so empty, a clear road map will float in your heart.
Beyond the limit is infinity, a legend that repeats itself, let's go beyond, let's paint it over, let's change it.
Do your best for your sake anytime
There's no need for regrets about the future, a new path will be created ahead of you, and only you can see it.
To admit defeat gracefully in order to win tomorrow, let's be cool, but not cool.
You can have your way in everything
