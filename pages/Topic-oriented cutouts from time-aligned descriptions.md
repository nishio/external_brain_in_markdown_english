## Digest 1
A cutout from a time-based description to a topic-oriented one is made.

## Digest 2
.
From the fragments of the "Experience Process and the Creation of Meaning" Study Group 2 and "Kozaneba: Neri Neri," it is clear that the conflict between time-based and topic-oriented is being emphasized. In particular, there is a shared view that organization by topic should be promoted as well as discussions that are stored and retrieved by time axis. In addition, in the "Nodes of Thought 2023-08-10-2" fragment, the ideal is to be able to move freely back and forth between temporal and contextual schemes. These linkages suggest that the balance between temporal and topic-oriented schemes and their application is important.

## deep thinking
The balance between time-based and topic-oriented is an important issue in organizing and interpreting information. While organizing information along a time axis is good for reliving the flow of information, it may require breaking down the structure of the time series to create a new topic-oriented structure when exploring a particular topic or thematics. Topic-oriented organization, on the other hand, allows information to be organized around a specific theme or context. Finding the right balance between these facilitates efficient organization and understanding of information.

## summary of thoughts
The balance between time-based and topic-oriented facilitates efficient organization and understanding of information.

### "Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning" Study Session 2
　　　　I thought about why I did it and found that I chose one of several schemes.
　　　One community on Scrapbox describes this as [/villagepump/time-oriented] v.s. [/villagepump/context-oriented]or[/sta/topic-oriented
　　　　There is an opposition between the "felt meaning" pointed to by the symbol "theme, context, topic" and the "felt meaning" pointed to by the symbol "time frame."
　　　Perhaps the ideal groupware should not only allow discussions to be stored and searched over time, but also facilitate organization by topic
　　　　Scrapbox "can do both" by making every page editable by anyone
　　　　　Add to that the author's philosophy that it should not be "[a] warehouse of dead texts" and that simply storing chat logs is using them as a warehouse of dead texts, and it only encourages organization by topic among those who share that philosophy.
　　　　　It's not a constraint as a system, so I'm sure in many cases if you introduce it into a random organization, it would become a minute book repository.
　　Q: Mailing lists can also be viewed in time or in a tree.
　　 A: But it's hard to use a topic that was spoken about in another tree


### Kozaneba:Neri Neri
[* human speech and writing]
	Human speech and writing are believed to unfold in a one-dimensional time series. This linear structure fragments information and may require breaking the structure when exploring specific topics or thematics.

[* Topic and time series].
	The conflict between topic-oriented and time-series, or time-oriented, is highlighted. It is suggested that the structure of time series may have to be destroyed in order to create a new topic-oriented structure. This may pose a challenge in organizing and interpreting information.

[* Spaced Repetition]
	This concept is related to learning and refers to a method of repeatedly reviewing information at regular intervals. This time-based approach is said to have "gradual value". Perhaps it helps to connect information that is scattered over time and deepens understanding.

[* associative search].
	The expression "2,000 dimensions" could refer to a high-dimensional search and analysis to relate information in multiple dimensions. A multidimensional analysis would help to capture a richer view of the structure and relevance of information.

[* Kozaneba]
	Following the preceding discussion, the properties of Kozaneba are mentioned again, emphasizing the organization of information in a two-dimensional space and the representation of associations by drawing lines. And this approach is said to reduce the "pain of destruction.


### node of thought 2023-08-10-2

Q: Is it ideal to be able to move freely between temporal and contextual schemes?
　A: I think it would be ideal for me to be able to come and go.
　When I'm organizing, I want to organize on the topic axis, but when I don't understand a fragment by itself, I want to shuffle around and see the time line where it came from, and then I see, and then I want to go back to the topic axis and organize again.
　I have been thinking that it would be nice if Kozaneba had such a function, but now "position" is a two-dimensional vector, which is just a higher dimensional vector mapped to two dimensions, with a time axis behind it. But that's ok.

Q: Essentially what we need is a dependency of information, and I think temporal relationships are a substitute for that
　A: When expressed as a sentence, dependencies naturally tend to be in close proximity in a sentence
　So when you read it, you need to read it once you have preserved the information about the time frame, and then afterwards you need to read it and wonder what the structure would have been like in the author's mind.

 [KJ Method Study Session Reflection Study Session] 
[nishio.icon]I didn't realize how important it was to "draw the line" when I created Kozaneba.


### Organize in reverse chronological order
Organize in reverse chronological order
For example, in a dialogue between two people, as the dialogue progresses, things that have not been verbalized are verbalized, knowledge on both sides increases, and new insights are gained, so the later the richer the description of the world should be!

Chat logs and minutes in chronological order are good for reliving the passage of time in the process.
But it's not about "[Bring the important stuff first.
　Bringing important things first is a useful guideline for organizing information for re-reading
　People usually read from top to bottom, so if you put the important stuff at the top, you can adjust the time it takes to read according to demand, such as "I want to know roughly the important parts" or "I want to know every detail.
　　In other words, "[Just read as far as you want and stop.

What would happen, for example, if [Kozaneba] were to place them in reverse chronological order, starting with the newest statement?

impressions
　Kozaneba sorted out some of the words that were not mine, which were split into multiple posts.
　I didn't see a strong advantage to organizing in reverse order to the time line.
　　What I thought was "important" after organizing on Kozaneba does not match the "last post" before organizing.
　　　As I was sorting through it, I kept coming up with new insights.


### Gradual iterations of a story are difficult to split up.
Slowly devolving stories are hard to divide.
When ideas develop on a time scale, they get lost in a one-dimensional output.
If you try to connect the end and the tip of a story after you've written it, they're too far apart to connect.
The lack of connection reveals "not one topic".
But each line is so densely interconnected that you can't even separate them.

I think it would be better to add the addition below.

In explaining the advantages of [Extending the Red Link with AI] to people who are not familiar with Scrapbox, I thought it would be necessary to explain [red link] in the first place, so I had AI generate it, and it seemed like a good idea.
　I tried [convergent move] as well, but it's not good.

　In the first place, since this usage is no longer [Recurrent Notes] or anything else, should we separate the script and the prompt?

### Rapid App Development and Unknown Expressions in the AI Era
　 Moving from a time-based structure to a topic-based structure.
　 Similar to Scrapbox bullet points with comments in the form of bullets.
　 　Branches grow like plants, then they are cut out.
　  [Harvesting Architecture] 

 [Harvesting the Framework] 
　>First, one app is created, then another app is created based on the same code base, and after repeating this several times, the framework becomes stable and the code base can be separated.
　The current activity is about "[intellectual production in the age of AI]," building an app, building another app, and repeating the process at high speed.
　By doing this, we are "extending the branch".
　It is harvested from it after the fact.

Instead of kneading [academic gossip] for zero customers, create something that meets the actual demand of a small group of users and repeat the creation and improvement process at high speed

Scrapbox's compatibility with intellectual production is due to its natural support for [multi-head thinking].
