What did you do last week?
- [/omoikane/Omoikane Embed into other projects](https://scrapbox.io/omoikane/Omoikane Embed into other projects).
    - Omoikane Bot has evolved a bit and now digests daily about the previous day's updates.
    - I'd like to include that in the project over here.
        - Maybe the weekly journal could be further digested by looking at the "Daily Digest".
        - Of course, there's value in the fact that humans look back, so I'm assuming that's not going to stop.
        - Is it easier to do with a foundation than to write from a blank sheet of paper?
        - From a blank sheet of paper might be more likely to produce "what you consider most important in your heart."
        - Mechanical digests are rather useful when looking up past records later.
    - [[Omoikane Study Group]]
    - Once again, the project is presented from a current perspective
    - Talk about how important it is to look back.
    - Documentation process: [[Preparation for Omoikane Study Group]].
