- Dominion event card that destroys a victory point card that someone could gain in the future and prevents them from gaining it, and you gain one point.
    - The cost is 4 coins. The destination is itself to reduce the number of victory points that can be earned, since it normally costs 2 coins just to gain 1 point.
