- If you post the same diagram, the links should connect.
    - [[link in same figure]].
    - Currently, multiple pages do not link to each other even if they refer to the same figure, so we are manually titling the figures to accommodate this.
- Importance of [visual link
    - Opinion that a picture (diagram) can be a more impressive link than a title.
- [[link to external link]].
    - Suggestion that it would be useful if [[Gyazo]] and web URLs ([[External Links]]) are automatically connected.
- [[Cross-project]]
    - It would be good if pages with the same image are connected across the board, independent of the project.

- As I was putting my coherent thoughts together in Cosense, I was thinking, if I put the same diagram on page A and page B, shouldn't the links connect?
    - Under the current specifications, multiple pages that refer to the same figure cannot be connected, so I would have to give the figure a title as appropriate and then list the title alongside the figure on both pages, or something like that?
    - Let's paint a picture of this idea itself.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/2e13fb4b76543e3f41148fa99ced008c/thumb/1000)
    - And the point is, shouldn't we be connected without having to do this? I mean, we don't have to do this.
    - I think the picture is a more striking link than the title.

    - I know you want me to connect with you when you put up gyazo and web URLs.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/はるひ/icon' alt='/villagepump/はるひ.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Sure, it would be nice if the same externally linked pages could be connected.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I'd like to see gyazo connect with you.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/seibe/icon' alt='/villagepump/seibe.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - It would be nice if similar images could be included.
        - Would it be nice to see a list of "pages where this image is posted" on the Gyazo screen?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - I hope it comes out regardless of the project.
