> [HiroTHamadaJP](https://twitter.com/HiroTHamadaJP/status/1661036254186844160) The current state of academia in Japan has to go back to the Basic Act on Science and Technology of 1995, but twitter The discussion on twitter doesn't reach this far.

> [HiroTHamadaJP](https://twitter.com/HiroTHamadaJP/status/1661038336524558338) The following is based on Koji Omi's books, "[[Theory of the Nation as a Nation of Science and Technology]] - Commentary on the Basic Law of Science and Technology" (Yomiuri Shimbun, 1996) and "[[Science and Technology Creation Nation]]" (Fujitsu Books, 1997). Theory of the Nation as a Nation of Science and Technology" (Yomiuri Shimbun, 1996) and "[[Science and Technology Creative Nation]]" (Fujitsu Books, 1997).

> [HiroTHamadaJP](https://twitter.com/HiroTHamadaJP/status/1661038337866727424) Looking back on the current state of Japanese science and technology, Omi clearly states that "basic research is stagnant. He breaks down the causes into several elements.
>  1. low research funding per researcher
>  2. small share of government burden
>  3. few researchers, research assistants and skilled workers

> [HiroTHamadaJP](https://twitter.com/HiroTHamadaJP/status/1661038339208921088) Others include.
>  1. fostering basic research
>  2. Balanced promotion of diverse R&D and promotion of R&D in key areas
>  3. consideration for universities, etc.
>  4. drastic expansion of investment amount
>
>  Each one of them seems to be a valid point, but why didn't these "wonderful words" come true? But why didn't these "nice words" come to fruition?

>  Next, they are trying to bring in a [[free-competitive]] society to foster the basic research mentioned above.
>
>  For example, there is a section on "[[making]] the fixed status system competitive and resilient" (p. 72, Theory of Science and Technology Nation).

> [HiroTHamadaJP](https://twitter.com/HiroTHamadaJP/status/1661038594298089472) "The principle of competition needs to work in a way that young, capable researchers are selected and research funds are focused on those with high potential for achievement. The principle of competition in the form of focused research funding on researchers with high potential for achievement needs to work." (p. 72, "Science and Technology Nation Theory")

- [[Job mobility for researchers]].
        - [[job mobility]]

> At that time, the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization ([[NEDO]]) and other organizations had a system in which NEDO and contract researchers shared 50% of the remuneration from patents and other research results, and this should be released. The New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization ([[NEDO]]), etc., at that time had a system in which NEDO and contract researchers shared 50% each of the compensation from research results such as patents, and this system should be released.

> [HiroTHamadaJP](https://twitter.com/HiroTHamadaJP/status/1661038651428700160) In fact, the [[Japanese version of Bayh-Dole]] system (from the Bayh-Dole Act, which describes the structure of US patents, etc.) began in 1999. In fact, the [[Japanese version of Bayh-Dole]] system (from the Bayh-Dole Act, which describes the structure of U.S. patents, etc.) began in 1999. This meant that the contractor, including the contracted researcher, could hold 100% of the patent.

> [HiroTHamadaJP](https://twitter.com/HiroTHamadaJP/status/1661038966181892096) It also describes how the number of research supporters had been decreasing rapidly since that time. The number of research supporters, rather than research workers, decreased as a result of the wave of reductions in the number of state employees. This required the researchers themselves to do a large amount of administrative work. However, we have not heard of any improvement in this regard at present.

>
>  Big projects are those that solve energy problems, create marine and space projects, and solve national policy issues through national initiatives.

> [HiroTHamadaJP](https://twitter.com/HiroTHamadaJP/status/1661038969528942598) In the Big Project, research facilities and equipment are developed by utilizing a long development period and large development budget, The design of the project is considered such that a research support system is established.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1661048413977477120) Good summary. The "Unexplored Software Creation Project" was started in 2000 by utilizing this [[Japanese version of Bayh-Dole]] system. It has continued for 23 years while changing its form little by little.
>  HiroTHamadaJP: In fact, the Japanese version of the Bayh-Dole system (from the Bayh-Dole Act, which describes the US patent and other systems) began in 1999. This meant that contractors, including contract researchers, could retain 100% of their patents].
