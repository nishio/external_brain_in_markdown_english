title: "Their place"

- Adding [[custom pictogram]] to the chat tool is the process of introducing "their favorite toy" and making it "their playground"
- Tools that can't do that don't give you a "[[Their place]]" feeling.
- If we don't feel like it's our place, we don't feel like visiting or maintaining it from time to time.
    - I think [[metaverse]] and others will go out of business if users can't easily [[customize]] them, because they don't feel like it's their place.

- [[Place Customization]]
- [[sense of ownership]]
- [[I can change the world.]]
