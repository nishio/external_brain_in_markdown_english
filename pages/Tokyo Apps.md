[Tokyo Metropolitan Government Releases Official Tokyo App "Tokyo App" - Plans to Expand Functions in Steps to Improve Convenience for Tokyo Residents | GovTech Tokyo](https://www.govtechtokyo.or.jp/news/2025/02/18/3630/)

> [miyasaka](https://x.com/miyasaka/status/1891832779035623769) Tokyo App has been released. It still has limited functionality and has a strong poitical application flavor, but we are going to develop it so that we can realize "Tokyo Metropolitan Government in your pocket" by carefully nurturing its functionality. There are 14 million Tokyo residents. If we include the residents of Tokyo who commute to work and school and those who are related to inbound tourism, the number will be enormous. We hope that this application will connect these people with the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.
>  What kind of possibilities do you think would open up if this app were to be put into the pockets of 10 million TMG residents (including related populations)? Also, if you were the developer, what features would you think would make the daily lives of TMG residents more convenient?
>  We will work on a large concept, but start small.
>  Yesterday was release day 1, today is day 2. Today is day 2, and we will start our journey of improvement and feature addition forever. We are also looking for people who want to work together with us on in-house development. If you are the one, let's do it! Let's do it!
