title: "The optimal solution is not unconditionally determined."

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1735102271393030505) What should we do if an AI smarter than humans says, "One billion is [[the most suitable]] human population on the planet"? ?

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1735125736493814271) [[asks about assumptions]] How about. Maybe with the science and technology we have at the moment, maybe it's an assumption that we don't turn humans into cyborgs, maybe it's a democracy. I thought there might be a future we could tolerate in that context.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1735158954219721152) Well, clever. This is an important way of thinking. I think that [[optimal solution]] cannot be determined [[unconditionally]], and it should be an optimal solution under a certain [[constraint]], so after [[clarifying the constraint]], you think about [[whether the constraint can be moved]].
