title: "Communities that are allowed to go through"
---

On 2023-12-19, I had a conversation with <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Tomoya Tachikawa/icon' alt='Tomoya Tachikawa.icon' height="19.5"/>, and [[side of well]] was involved, so I put it on

from [/villagepump/community allowed to go through](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/community allowed to go through).
- I was going to write the chat log in my Scrapbox, but I decided to put it in the well because it is also relevant to the well!<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Context that Mr. Tachikawa was president of the university alumni community for several years.

- [[Is the community itself more interesting if it is more unitary?]]
- [[A community that doesn't care if you go through with it.]]
- [[There is a maintenance cost of "being understandable to all members" in a community that is not allowed to go through]]
- [[A case of saying "I see" while thinking I don't understand what you mean.]]
