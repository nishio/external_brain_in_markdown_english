The concepts of "subjective" and "objective" in English, Japanese, and Chinese, as well as the historical background in each language area will be explained.

# Japanese
- [subjective
Subjective" in Japanese refers to a state in which personal feelings and thoughts are reflected. It implies a strong influence of personal viewpoints and interpretations, and is used when an individual's inner self comes to the fore rather than objective facts. In Japanese linguistic culture, the culture of "wa" (harmony) has long been rooted, and the emphasis has been on the group and harmony rather than on the individual. In expression, however, there is a strong respect for individual feelings and views, and subjective expressions often have value.

- [[objective]] (objective)
On the other hand, "objective" refers to a state of affairs based solely on facts, excluding personal feelings and opinions. In Japan, objectivity has historically been emphasized in academia and science. Positivism and objective analysis tend to be emphasized, and culturally, there is an emphasis on facts and logic. However, in interpersonal and social contexts, subjective interpretations such as "reading the air" can play an important role.

# English

[[Subjective]]
The English word "subjective" refers to a point of view that reflects an individual's opinions, feelings, and interpretations. Since the Age of Enlightenment, Western philosophy has tended to emphasize individual reason and subjectivity, and this concept is reflected in language. Subjectivity has been especially valuable in the fields of art and literature, where it has been seen as a means of expressing individual uniqueness and creativity.

[[Objective]]
By "objective," we mean an objective point of view, free of subjectivity and based on facts and evidence. Since the scientific revolution, objectivity has become especially important in the West, with an emphasis on objective methodology and the pursuit of evidence-based knowledge. This pursuit of objectivity has become a fundamental principle in many fields, including science, law, and journalism.

# Chinese

[[The main view : 主观]] (zhǔguān)
The Chinese word "主观" refers to the state of being influenced by one's personal feelings and opinions. In Chinese philosophy, there are diverse schools of thought, including Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism, each of which stresses the importance of the inner life of man and individual perception. In modern China in particular, the gradual emphasis on individual rights and freedoms has expanded the space for the expression of subjectivity.

客观" refers to a state of affairs based on universal facts and truths, devoid of personal subjectivity. Chinese culture has long emphasized pragmatism and realism, and objective analysis and methods are emphasized in science, technology, and economic development. Under socialist ideals, however, objective evaluation for the benefit of the group and the achievement of the goals of society as a whole is of particular importance.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The terms "subjective" (shukan teki) and "objective" (kyakkatteki) in Japanese indicate the difference between perceptions and ideas that arise from the inner life of an individual or are based on external facts. To understand these terms, let's first delve into the concepts of "shu (主)," "kyaku (客)," "shuukaku (主客)," "kan (観)" and "teki (的)".

Lord
The "subject" is generally synonymous with "[[core]]" and refers to the bearer of actions and thoughts, the entity perceived as "[[myself]]" or "[[I]]. From a subjective perspective, the feeling and thinking of this "core" is central.

guest
The term "object" stands for "[[object]]," and refers to an object to the subject, i.e., an external object or other person. From an objective point of view, the nature and condition of the "object" is considered important, and the subject's personal feelings and prejudices are eliminated.

main guest
The term "subject-object" refers to the relationship between subject and object, and the elucidation of this relationship is often an important topic in philosophy. The discussion of subjectivity and objectivity is deeply concerned with how we understand and treat this "subject-object" relationship.

- [[view]] (in Japanese)
The term "view" means to see, to observe, or to have a particular point of view or perspective. The terms "subjective" and "objective" distinguish whether this "view" is from the subject's own internal perspective or from an external perspective based on the object.

[Target
The suffix "target" is used to create adjectives and abstract nouns to indicate that something has certain characteristics or belongs to a certain category. Subjective" and "objective" indicate characteristics based on the subject's inner life and characteristics based on the nature or facts of the object, respectively.

Subjective
In the subjective approach, personal feelings, opinions, and experiences are central. This means seeing things from "my point of view," and the emphasis is on the individual's inner world.

Objective
An objective approach, on the other hand, eliminates personal feelings and biases and evaluates things based on outside facts and data. This implies an "outside perspective" and focuses on the pursuit of universal or sharable truths.

Thus, "subjective" and "objective" provide the basic framework for how we perceive, understand, and relate to the world. Understanding the balance between the two and using them appropriately is critical in communication, research, and daily life.
