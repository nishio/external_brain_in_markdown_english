- It's called a [[romance game]], but you're a queen candidate competing against rivals to raise a star [[Management Games]].
    - In addition, [[Resources]] for star growth are obtained from nine men called "patron saints" w
        - Well, maybe it's a love game because [[the amount of production]] changes depending on the degree of liking. w
- >  The setting is a flying city in the sky. The setting is a city in the sky where two opposite girls are studying hard to become the Queen of the Heavenly Realm. To do so, the cooperation of nine patron saints will be indispensable. The main character, Angelique Limoges, who has been selected as a candidate for queen, competes with her rival Rosalia for the position of the next queen. The original goal of the game is to train the continent and pass the queen's examinations, but the player can also pursue romance in the process. If the romance is completed to the final stage, the game ends with a love ending, and the queen's position is relinquished.

> Keiko Erikawa], who founded Koei with Yoichi Erikawa, noticed that the game's customers were all men, and from around 1983, they began to develop a concept for a game for women. In order to incorporate a woman's perspective, they began training female developers. Since there were few female programmers at the time, they started by hiring women with humanities backgrounds to work on scenarios, and it took 10 years to establish Ruby Party, which became their development team.
