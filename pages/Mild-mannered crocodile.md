title: "Mild-mannered crocodile"
---

There are mild-mannered crocodiles that don't mind having their hands bitten off, and there are [[ferocious]] crocodiles that are willing to kill you if you enter their territory.
The type of crocodile that has to spend regular [[dense]] time in the dry season, etc. is [[gentle]], and this difference in character is inborn.

In an environment where they can secure their territory, if there is a mix of ferocious and mild-mannered ones, the mild-mannered ones will be weeded out and the ferocious ones will remain.
However, when they are crowded together by environmental factors, it is likely that if one side is mild-mannered and does not mind being harmed, the total damage is smaller and they are better adapted as a group than if the two violent ones fight each other and hurt each other.

It is interesting to replace crocodiles with humans.
