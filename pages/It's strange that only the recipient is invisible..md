title: "It's strange that only the recipient is invisible."

Posting online is akin to distributing pamphlets rather than holding a public protest. It is difficult for those viewing the postings to know who and how many other people are consuming the same information, nor can their opinions be measured. While a post may influence their beliefs, it is difficult to create a common belief of a particular group of peers. The ability to spread posts and emphasize attention may help someone, but tracking the recipients of the message will be much coarser than what is possible in a physical public forum.

    - In activities that take place in a physical setting, participants are visible to each other and their interactions contribute to community building and relationship building. Online, however, the recipients of information (receivers) are invisible to each other, making it difficult to form a sense of community and common beliefs. This asymmetry can be a limitation of online communication and social movements, and how to overcome it is a challenge for contemporary communication strategies.
