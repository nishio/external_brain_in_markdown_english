What is the Double Empathy Problem?
The concept refers to "mutual" comprehension difficulties that occur between individuals on the [[autistic spectrum]] ([[ASD]]) and non-ASD individuals.
The ASD side is not "flawed," but rather, it is seen as a misreading of the other's intentions and feelings by both parties due to misalignment of different experiences, norms, and communication styles (as proposed by Damian Milton, 2012).

main point
- Bidirectional: Misunderstandings are not a one-sided problem. It is easy for both sides to misunderstand the assumptions and context of the other.
- Context-dependent: Interpretation habits that are optimized for "neurotypicals similar to oneself" with whom one normally interacts are less likely to apply to others who are different.
- Structural factors: When places and rules are designed according to the social majority (non-ASD) standard, only the ASD side tends to be asked to be considered = fixed misunderstanding.

typical example
- Inclusion and implicit cues (eye contact, sarcasm) in chit-chat are operated under the majority assumption → ASD side has difficulty in taking in the meaning. On the other hand, frank and specific expressions on the ASD side are misunderstood as "[[blunt]]" by the non-ASD side.
- Email: ASD's brief and direct writing of requirements is received as "Are you angry?" and the ASD side feels the vague euphemism is unintended.

Points that are often misunderstood
- ×x "ASD is not empathetic."
→ Just different methods; ASDs are more empathetic to details and concrete experiences and often understand more deeply with explicit information and time than with implicit reading.
- ×x "The ASD side can be fixed by training."
→ Need to design the place and learn both sides (bi-directional adaptation).

Solution Tips (Practical)
- Explicit: Verbalize objectives, agreements, and next actions. Do not rely on tacit "airs and graces.
- Meta-conversation: Discussing the "rules" of communication itself (e.g., reply speed, format, meaning of pictograms, etc.).
- Media design: minutes, bullet points, summary columns, and term definitions. Text assistance for synchronous conversations.
- Co-reading/co-experiencing: Examine the same material (text, case study) together slowly and match the correspondence between feelings and words.
- Diversification of evaluations: Avoid evaluation of "social skills" based on a single indicator such as eye contact or chatting skills, and include evaluation of achievements and considerate behavior.
In a nutshell:
The other party and I are 'different operating systems. If we can share the same protocol (rules) without assuming that we can understand each other without an interpreter, misunderstandings will decrease.
