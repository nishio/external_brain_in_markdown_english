The default setting is Truncate, which hides overflowing characters and makes the font size large.

If you set the Text Scale to about 0.05, it will look much closer to what you expect.

It would be better to use Overflow instead of the default Wrap, Truncate so that it is easier to understand the behavior in case of failure when the user is unfamiliar with the system.
