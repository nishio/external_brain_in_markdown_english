title: "Why did the pension slide but not the basic deduction?"

> [UJfh8rgz3F46952](https://x.com/UJfh8rgz3F46952/status/1851742085361340919) They say that 7.5 trillion yen of tax revenue will be lost by raising the basic deduction, but no, prices are changing, but the deduction is not being switched and 7.5 trillion yen of extra tax revenue is being taken. I think it means that they have been collecting extra 7.5 trillion yen so far without switching deductions even though prices have been changing.

> [Eureka_2GG](https://x.com/Eureka_2GG/status/1851875243130044473) because the people who saw it as a problem were (comparatively) not [[voting]]!
