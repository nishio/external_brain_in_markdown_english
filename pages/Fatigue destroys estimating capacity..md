At this time, other cognitive abilities are declining as well as estimating ability
Seemingly "work in progress".
- Quality is going down and quantity is going up.

I went to bed early and woke up even earlier...

I thought I was tired already, but I've been working five hours earlier than usual, so it's already the equivalent of 6:00 p.m. That's right.
It's been quiet, so I've made progress and am now on page 227, which is a fast pace.

I had a feeling that I was almost there, that if I worked hard, I could finish today, but I calmly estimated that I had four days to do it.
