I was taking Saturday off for the possibility of being tired from [[Social Hack Day #70]], but I'm glad I took the day off because I was tired from [[pBT]] on Sunday!

I used to be very [[deadline-driven]], but it's been a long time since I've done it, and the [[stress]] from the minute-by-minute deadlines has become a big factor.
    - [[(powers of) concentration]] no longer hold?
- Metaphor for [short distance running
- The amount of adrenaline and excitement caused by stress and cortisol? Something due to the production of? relationship between the two?

- > The reason why the short-distance running metaphor fits so well is that it is designed to run through the race with "instantaneous [[adrenaline]]. However, if we do not create a system that allows the [[autonomic nervous system]] to "slow down" immediately after cutting the finish tape, [[cortisol]] tails off and "[[burnout]]" is likely to linger.
- >  It is a natural change to feel that you are not as resistant to sprinting as you used to be, so you can make the deadline driven technique "usable" again by being conscious of "keeping the peak low and the recovery generous".
- be of use as a reference
    - It's harder to push for peak performance when you're on deadline.
    - It will take longer to recover from damage after deadline driven
    - This is the same composition as an "all-nighter" or an "advance on an energy drink.


deadline-driven
It's useful to have a decision run that says there are a lot of areas I want to discuss, but I don't have time to discuss them, so I'm going to cut them off.
- If we had a "deliberative forum" with no deadlines and asked, "How can we make X better?" then the list of "good ideas I have" would just keep on adding and adding and adding, and the list would just keep on growing and growing and growing and growing and growing and growing and growing and growing and growing and growing and growing and growing and growing and growing and growing.
- AI's drafts were being scraped by humans, but the same is true for a group of humans.
        - [[Human Work: AI Ruthlessly Throws Away What It Writes]]
    - When a group of humans deliberate without constraint, they get more and more bloated.
        - Context grows longer.
        - AI sums it up as "ruthlessly discarding human writing."

- [[Deadline driven/meeting driven]]
- I didn't realize the value of ChatGPT's "[[Complete History]]" when it was introduced, but combined with o3, this is what I'm getting. The input is just the first part, but I'm talking about it based on my use of Scrapbox and the fact that I mentioned in a previous chat that deadline-driven was getting hard.
        - [[ChatGPT remembers all past conversations]]
        - [[Only those who have accumulated enough can experience it.]]

- Organize tabs that have been opened too many times
- Switching Weekly Journal
- Identification of tasks that have not been taken up

[[Devin credit used up 4/21]].

- [[Too much focus on not letting go of advantageous positions and lost opportunities]]

- [[The more concentrated, the stronger.]]

The same tab open in multiple places should be closed all together.

I'm opening this page for notes first.
- While cleaning up the tabs, if I find a tab that needs AI processing, I query it and move it over here.

- [[Mobile Safari tab organization]]

o3 competent.
- It's pronounced "old man competent, huh?" in my brain.

I'm tired and covered in snacks.

I'm taking it easy after dinner.


Still to make week5 into a website.
Organize private repo
