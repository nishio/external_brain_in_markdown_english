I was taking Saturday off for the possibility of being tired from [[Social Hack Day #70]], but I'm glad I took the day off because I was tired from [[pBT]] on Sunday!

I used to be very [[deadline-driven]], but it's been a long time since I've done it, and the [[stress]] from the minute-by-minute deadlines has become a big factor.
    - [[(powers of) concentration]] no longer hold?
- Metaphor for [short distance running
- The amount of adrenaline and excitement caused by stress and cortisol? Something due to the production of? relationship between the two?

- > The reason why the short-distance running metaphor fits so well is that it is designed to run through the race with "instantaneous [[adrenaline]]. However, if we do not create a system that allows the [[autonomic nervous system]] to "slow down" immediately after cutting the finish tape, [[cortisol]] tails off and "[[burnout]]" is likely to linger.
- >  It is a natural change to feel that you are not as resistant to sprinting as you used to be, so you can make the deadline driven technique "usable" again by being conscious of "keeping the peak low and the recovery generous".
- be of use as a reference
    - It's harder to push for peak performance when you're on deadline.
    - It will take longer to recover from damage after deadline driven
    - This is the same composition as an "all-nighter" or an "advance on an energy drink.


deadline-driven
It's useful to have a decision run that says there are a lot of areas I want to discuss, but I don't have time to discuss them, so I'm going to cut them off.
- If we had a "deliberative forum" with no deadlines and asked, "How can we make X better?" then the list of "good ideas I have" would just keep on adding and adding and adding, and the list would just keep on growing and growing and growing and growing and growing and growing and growing and growing and growing and growing and growing and growing and growing and growing and growing.
- AI's drafts were being scraped by humans, but the same is true for a group of humans.
        - [[Human Work: AI Ruthlessly Throws Away What It Writes]]
    - When a group of humans deliberate without constraint, they get more and more bloated.
        - Context grows longer.
        - AI sums it up as "ruthlessly discarding human writing."

- [[Deadline driven/meeting driven]]
- I didn't realize the value of ChatGPT's "[[Complete History]]" when it was introduced, but combined with o3, this is what I'm getting. The input is just the first part, but I'm talking about it based on my use of Scrapbox and the fact that I mentioned in a previous chat that deadline-driven was getting hard.
        - [[ChatGPT remembers all past conversations]]
        - [[Only those who have accumulated enough can experience it.]]

- Organize tabs that have been opened too many times
- Switching Weekly Journal
- Identification of tasks that have not been taken up

    - OOPS, I have a lot of non-development work days, and I have a lot of extra Ws.
    - This is the last rush as we are switching to pay-as-you-go.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/84fd5c23792cbdda6cc9486789be8092/thumb/1000)
    - I switched so I wouldn't forget.

Too much focus on not letting go of advantageous positions and lost opportunities
We need to be careful not to get into this composition.
Because the "advantage" of an existing "advantageous position" changes when circumstances change significantly.
Overweighting in thoughts of "not letting go" and losing the opportunity to gain something greater

I wonder if the synonym for [[long-winded thoughtful post]] would be [[stabs people in the back]].
The more concentrated, the stronger.
- Natural and Enriched Uranium
Compression.
- If it crosses a certain line, it explodes.
    - [[atomic bomb metaphor]].
- [[Explosion is an exponential development.]]
    - Hourly coefficients exceed 1
    - There is no leap in coefficients.
        - Smooth rise but rapid development occurs after 1
        - If the coefficient exceeds 1 but the value is 0, it will not develop.
            - Once the trigger is thrown, it begins to develop.
            - [[supercooled water metaphor]].

- I almost wrote about this in [[Introductions and Poker Roles]], but I thought it was a little different.
- Cramming all the information you gather makes you weak.
    - They will say, "You did your best to do your research - that's great - you're not very selective at all."
    - [[narrow down]]
        - [[Conceptual ability is the ability to limit problems]]

The same tab open in multiple places should be closed all together.

I'm opening this page for notes first.
- While cleaning up the tabs, if I find a tab that needs AI processing, I query it and move it over here.

- [[Mobile Safari tab organization]]

o3 competent.
- It's pronounced "old man competent, huh?" in my brain.

I'm tired and covered in snacks.

I'm taking it easy after dinner.


Still to make week5 into a website.
Organize private repo
