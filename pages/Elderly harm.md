It is a word formed by combining the two characters for "old age" ([[老]]) and "harm" or "damage" ([[害]]).

In Japan, "老害" is used to refer to problems caused by the elderly, especially when they are perceived as being out of touch with current realities or societal norms, holding back progress, or causing inconvenience to others due to stubbornly clinging to outdated ideas or ways of doing things.

For example, in a business context, "老害" could be used to describe a senior executive who refuses to adopt new technologies or insists on using outdated business practices, thereby hindering the company's progress or innovation.

It's important to note that this term can be seen as disrespectful and is a somewhat controversial term due to its negative depiction of the elderly. It is certainly not a term that is universally accepted in Japan, but it does reflect some of the [[societal tensions]] that can arise in a rapidly [[aging society]] like Japan.
