title: "Inconvenience of Notability"
---

[[inconvenience]] in [[Notability]].
    - [[I want to go back and forth between multiple pages quickly.]]
    - [[I want to point to.]]
- Every time I move a task after exporting it, I need to select the lasso.
    - I want it to easily become [[one lump]] once selected.
- Cannot recall relevant pages from the past
- I would like to have an after-the-fact index of some of the things I've written, or just look back at the muscle training logs in one place, etc.
    - Caused by a lack of means of pointing to what has been written
    - With Scrapbox, you could just write ` [muscle training]`.
