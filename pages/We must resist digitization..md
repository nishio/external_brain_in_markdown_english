from  [[Toward Relative Art & Technology]]
We must resist digitization.
4. philosophical background
(1) Technical criticism of [Heidegger
Heidegger warned that modern technology causes "[[a]] forgetfulness of existence.
He pointed out that when technology overemphasizes the perspective of the world as "[[an]] available resource," humans lose the ability to deeply engage with the world.
(2) [[Rudolf Steiner's]] person-centered philosophy
Steiner's emphasis on human spirituality and the senses overlaps with his warning against the danger of digital technology depriving people of their senses and intuition.
(3) [[Yuk Hui]]'s "Recursivity of Technology"
Yuk Hui points out that digital technology has the power to reconfigure human existence and society, and calls for a rethinking of how it is used.
