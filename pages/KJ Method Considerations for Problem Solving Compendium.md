title: "KJ Method Considerations for Problem Solving Compendium"
---

- On the [[nicely]] done sensation in [[grouping]] of the [KJ method
>  [[pleasure reaction]] in [[synectics]] (→ "[[Compendium of Ideas]]", p. 247)
>  [[felt sense]] in [[focusing]] (→ "The Big Book of Ideas", p. 27), given that the reason is to choose something that feels right even if you don't immediately know why.
- [[Problem Solving Compendium]]  P.165

I also wrote about felt sense in [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]], p. 204 [[(6.2.5.3) Thinking At the Edge: Where the words are not yet spoken]].
    - In [[Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning]], they call it [[Felt Meaning]].

>  The Area type of [[NMDA]] (→ "Compendium of Ideas", p. 253) recommends that we dare to link the most distant things together. This is supported, albeit indirectly, by an experiment that shows that concept binding can only be emergent if it combines things that are not similar to each other.

I wrote about the NM method in [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]], p.160 [[(5.2.5.2) The NM method focuses on the opposing relationship]].
    - You are right about paying attention to [[confrontation]].
- I disagree with the idea that "conflict" is a "distant thing," and I added that in [There is more than one conflict.

The experiment is Wisniewski 1991, but I couldn't find it in Google Scholar.
I wonder if this is the same person.
