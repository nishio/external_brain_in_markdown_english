The phrase "by deeds one is a Brahmin" illustrates the Buddhist teaching that a person's worth is determined by deeds, not birth. This idea is also found in Jainism, where the Buddha, Mahavira, and others taught similar teachings. However, this teaching is not unique to Buddhism, but was a concept shared by many religious movements of the time.

For reference, we recommend that you look up Buddhist sutras such as the Dhammapada and the Sthanipata. These texts elaborate on Buddhist teachings such as values based on deeds and opposition to the caste system. In particular, the Vasetta Sutta in the Suttanipata speaks of the Buddha's teaching that one should be valued by deeds, not birth.

In the Vasetta Sutta, Buddha speaks to Vasetta in the form of a teaching that one is a Brahmin not by birth, but by deed. This section emphasizes the idea that the purity and morality of deeds is what makes one a true Brahmin. This teaching is a challenge to the caste system and reflects the ethical and spiritual values of Buddhism. The actual sutras are best referenced directly through resources and databases that contain Buddhist scriptures.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The words "[Brahman (priest of Hinduism, member of the highest caste)" and "[[Brahman]]" are different renderings of the same word, both derived from the Sanskrit word "[[brahmana]]. The word refers to the highest rank in the Hindu caste system, which is the role of priests and scholars. Brahmins are privileged to have knowledge of the Vedas and to perform religious rituals, and the spiritual and intellectual aspects are emphasized. For this reason, the term "Brahman" is often also used to refer to one of spiritual purity and high moral character.
