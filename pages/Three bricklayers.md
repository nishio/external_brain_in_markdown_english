title: "Three bricklayers"
---

- [[Aesop]]
[[Traveler]] talks to 3 bricklayers
- 1st person
    - Brick by brick.
    - It's hard to work all day laying bricks.
    - It's not fair that some people live more comfortably.
- Second person.
    - Bricks are piled up to form a wall.
    - I support my family with this job.
    - Thank God I have a job.
- Three.
    - We're building a cathedral that will go down in history.
    - Would be a great job!

One feels [[enrichment]] when one has a sense of connection with [[The Big One.]] (In the case of this story, the historic cathedral).

variation
- In some cases, the second person says, "I'm going to be the best bricklayer in the world."
