[Great things cannot be planned - Japanese commentary on "The Illusion of Goals" | WIRED.jp](https://wired.jp/article/why-greatness-cannot-be-planned-book/)
    - [[Ken Suzuki]] / [[Mizuki Oka]]


from[/villagepump/the illusion of goals](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/the illusion of goals).
Having read only the commentary, not the book, I thought, "Of course!"<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Smart people [[overfit]] when given [[measurable goals]].
        - [[No numerical criteria should be used to evaluate researchers.]]
    - I think ↑ is talking about "setting a goal will only achieve that goal", but this book seems a bit different because it is talking about how setting a goal will not achieve the goal<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/blu3mo/icon' alt='/villagepump/blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - If there are experimental results or other reports in this book, I'd like to read them before making a decision, but "setting goals does not achieve goals" seems to me to be the product of an inappropriate abstraction when I look at this statement alone.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Set a low enough goal and you will almost always achieve it, set a high enough goal and you will almost always fail to achieve it
        - So it doesn't make sense to discuss it by discarding the range of appropriate goal setting.
            - It does, and the book says so.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/blu3mo/icon' alt='/villagepump/blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - I bought the book anyway.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - It's no surprise that just setting high goals is not achieving them.
        - Once a KPI (= evaluation axis) is set, you are motivated to maximize that axis
            - If it is unclear which width is appropriate on this axis, the width to the OK line becomes smaller and smaller [[moral hazard]].
            - Off-axis directional search is suppressed
- So you have to evaluate with [[great things are great]], not quantitatively.
    - In Japan, they've been doing it for 25 years under the name Unexplored.
        - The fact that the method does not scale is the more essential problem, and a way to solve it must be created.
- continue reading
- My frequent use of [[trade-offs between use and exploration]] came up.
- Late in the day, we started talking about artificial life and AI research.
- A story about exploring with [[the evaluation axis of novelty]].
        - [[Can you spot innovative talent in advance?]]
            - The story is that anyone who uses [[novelty (patentability)]] as an evaluation function is a no-no.
        - [[differentiation for differentiation's sake]] and start making crap with no essential difference.
                - [[The Trap of Differentiation]]
- [[OMNI-EPIC]]
    - This is turning out to be an interesting story.
    - Interestingness" is described not by linguistic rules, but as a [[mass of]] weights, which are then explored accordingly.
            - [[Polanyi's tacit knowledge]] feel.
    - [[Japanese culture]].
    - [[unexplored]] w
- I'd heard tidbits about the Kyoto institute, but I didn't know it was going to be like this.
- [[Plurality]] came up.
Interesting.
- For me, most of the components were things I already had, so there was nothing new at that layer, but it was interesting at the meta-level to see how they could be connected. Useful as [Nodes of Thought
