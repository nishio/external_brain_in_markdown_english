[[Tech Transfer]] is important.
    - [[social implementation]] is often deployed by the private sector
    - Deployed by [[private-sector business]], not academia
- If I tell someone in Industry, "I wrote three papers," they don't see the value in it.
    - How to implement an Algorithm written by a Ph.
        - Internal R&D support needed

Trade off
- Benefit to society

India has [[soft power]], soft influence by exporting to African countries.
- [Soft power - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power)
    - > In politics (and particularly in international politics), soft power is the ability to co-opt rather than coerce (in contrast with hard power). It involves shaping the preferences of others through appeal and attraction. Soft power is non-coercive, using culture, political values, and foreign policies to enact change. In 2012, Joseph Nye of Harvard University explained that with soft power, "the best propaganda is not propaganda", further explaining that during the Information Age, "credibility is the scarcest resource".

Creating Wealth in Emerging Countries
- Created by making digital IDs free and making payments low cost and very accessible


All government Approach ⇔ Private Tech Approach
→DPI Approach
Same as 4 quadrant in [[Acemoglu]].
- The Narrow Corridor.
Government running everything is cumbersome, too heavy, bureaucratic
Like the Internet, a middle way where the government provides funding and standards.
First the government funds and creates standards
- Government funding such as ARPA
Somewhere in the transition period of 3 or 4 years, transfer to the private sector and let them build the operations and other services.

It appears to be the type of long-term investment that, if made, is expected to produce long-term value, but that the initial activities are not profitable and therefore not the first step to be taken if left to the private sector.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- I am concerned about the decision making process.
- How did you justify the investment?


Japan has an excellent digital ID system and payment system
- Why doesn't Japan sell this system to Asian countries?
- The value of a common standard payment system
- This is not a story confined to Japan.
- Asian countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, etc.) are growth markets
    - Japan is investing in Malaysia's semiconductor industry.
    - Similarly, why not sell my number system to Malaysia?

new AI economy rides on the data economy
- The new AI economy is built on a data economy.
- You need digitization (DX) as a prerequisite, and you can sell digitization mechanisms to countries that don't have it.


South Australia Data Exchange
South Australia
Aboriginal blood
- Aboriginal blood sample collection from the 1950s?
- 40 million blood samples from South Australian citizens and Aboriginal people?
Why pharmaceutical companies are interested: different DNA structure from European descent
Health Data Exchange
- Cross-country data exchange
A consortium of government, pharmaceutical companies, and MIT's Big Data Living Lab?
- Takeda, GSK, Pfizer?
Confidential calculations using SGX
7 years from start of study to FDA submission
- Mismatch between the drug development process, which takes nine years, and short-term payments

Big Data Living Lab
- MIT Living Lab [http://livinglab.mit.edu/](http://livinglab.mit.edu/) ?
- Sponsored by private companies
- No government funding, because it's political.

You can't use [[child labor]].
- The Xinjiang case was forced labor, not child labor, but, well, that's not relevant to the purpose.
Gap Clothing in the US
- Buy the highest score.
- [[traceability]]
When there's a platform, it makes [[those who don't put information out there]] look bad.
Microsoft
- More than 40 Chinese smelters in nickel and lithium mines in Indonesia

Gartner Curve
    - [[hype curve]]
AI Agent
[[Disinformation]]
Keely Earnhardt?
Two years of Twitter data
There is coordinated activity by about 80 bots.
Russians used to post on social media.
China's [[PLA]] ([[People's Liberation Army]], [[Chinese People's Liberation Army]]) also uses this system.
In other words, Russia and China were collaborating on a net work.
Her paper won the best paper award at a top-tier disinformation conference -> I'll look it up later.

How can AI help develop new services and new revenues?
Many companies question
=Transformational use cases that will bring in revenue in 2-3 years
The core of the problem is quality data.

Companies have internal data, but little
GPU high cost
I think a very efficient AI training strategy will emerge that does not require a GPU.
This is Capex.
- How to get ROI
How it help me to make new revenue

Isn't it [[private sector pressure]] if the government does Payment in IndiaStack? Can the government do it?
In India, it was necessary, 68% did not have a bank account.
OpenID Connect

Banks, poverty and financial instability in India, sustainability in the EU, governments need a brocade to wave their flags
What is the brocade for DPI in the US?
Americans don't believe in country.
- SSN ([[Social Security Number]]) is important.
Private sector creates Confidential Computing Platform
If what you get out of it is worth it, the private sector will pay for it.
The bottom layer of IndiaStack is digital ID
The second is UPI settlement.
Working on the third data.
For US, Japan, need API for remote computation of data
- IDs and settlements are stable.

one possible combination
- the citizen keeps control of the data
- remote computation using confidential computing infrastructure is paid for by the private sector
Transportation
- I want to see the travel route.
- Suica is logging transfers and purchases.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

- I'd like to do more experiments by selecting subjects according to detailed characteristics rather than "people".

[[My number card]]
eKYC
Digital identity only, no money
- Facebook doesn't make money on ID either, it makes money on Ad.
Japan is bringing many foreign workers, Filipino foreign health workers to work in Japan
- They need Digital Identity.
- Need a way to send money back to their home countries.
Japan to Philippines = US to Mexico
- Remittances from the U.S. to Mexico are $500-600 billion/year
Western Union has high remittance fees

Cross border
Legal Framework
- Sharing insight, not data
[[Tech-savvy lawyer]] needed

    - It has nothing to do with traditional legal agreements.
- On the other hand, maybe we need a Law-savvy Engineer too.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - [[Doyu Noboru]] like

MasterCard

What the Philippines Lacks is Engineering Expertise
IndiaStack
Aadhaar is a government built
- Financial assistance to software developers
- IDs don't pay.
- 1.2 billion people
UPI is built by Bank
- Government mandated.
- Indian government did not want banks to run ID system Aadhaar
- Banks deal with money, not identity or personal data. The government has made that clear.
Data is done by private sector, like Health.
- India's lack of portable data is a problem.
- No medical records, bring paper
    - Japan is still doing things like the Medication Record Book...<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I hope it will be linked to my number card so that I can easily pass it on.

Data is people own
Not insurance companies or hospitals.
Belongs to citizens and requires consent for access
The key is "[[consent management]]."

Japan already has ID and Payment.
The question is whether it can be exported to other countries.

Can the Data portion be financial data?
India is still poor
- There are 300 million middle class people who have credit cards, more than the population of Japan.
UPI currently has no benefits, Bank is forced to gov.
Increasing value as society grows.
Children of village women become college students and work in Bangalore and New Delhi
- Bank accout required and become a customer.

If you look up UPI on Google, there's a PDF of the API specs.

- Because it is a SOCIAL GOOD

[[WeChat]] is [[Social Network + Payment]].
- [[LINE Pay]]はそれに近かった<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - [[PayPay]] has gone mainstream...
    - I've heard that there have been cases of people lying about PayPay being the only way to collect money at a drinking party, which is one of the opportunities to spread the word, as an incentive not to give away the means of communication, but I wonder what's really going on.
    - If this is correct, then the combination of Social Network and Payment has had the effect of decreasing the value of Payment.

economic growth

Spec for DSN
Spec for OSS
Means for Gov to facilitate

50% Gov, 50% Citizen or not.
So are JR tickets.
Passengers bought tickets, even on national railways.

[[CBDC over Social Media]]
India Stack doesn't do it?
- High risk / low priority in India
- There are more pressing issues such as Worker health

White paper promote idea to gov
