There are two ways to approach layered knowledge, as shown in the image below:
![image](https://gyazo.com/c5b69e079c5a0eb9dfa25f203e1a13a8/thumb/1000)

[[Layered Knowledge]]
- [[Knowledge Pyramid]]
- The relationship between [[starting from the basics]] and [[digging deeper as needed]] ([[learning what is necessary]])

[[Layers]]
- [[Concepts that are vertically long and horizontally wide]]
- [[Shallow knowledge associations]]
- [[Shallow knowledge]] [[Superficial understanding]]

Please let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.

[[Layered knowledge]]
[[Pyramid of knowledge]]
The relationship between "starting from scratch" and "delving deeper as needed" (learning the necessary parts)

[[Layers]]
[[Longitudinal concepts and wide-ranging concepts]]
[[Association with shallow knowledge]]
[[Shallow knowledge]] [[Shallow understanding]]
