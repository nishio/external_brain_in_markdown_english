> [takahiroanno](https://twitter.com/takahiroanno/status/1645426627780947969) I went to an LLM meetup at a place in Tokyo and it was great. It was a highbrow meetup where all participants were required to bring a demo related to LLM, but about 50 people showed up. It was a highbrow meetup where all participants had to bring a demo related to LLM, but there were about 50 people there, and it was just distilled down to a lot of [[LLM Unemployed]]. It felt like the beginning of an era to me.

Seriously, the beginning of a startup is no different from being unemployed, so if you're going to be unemployed anyway, it's better to start a company. It's a good idea to start a company if you're going to be unemployed. Once you start a company, you can get by, and even if you don't, you were unemployed to begin with. LOL!
