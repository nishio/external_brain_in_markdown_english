Because [[institutions]] are created by people, there is always a [[design intent]].
- Same as program
- A system in which design intent is not verbalized is the same as source code without documentation.
    - You can see how it works by looking at the code, but the information about why it was done that way is lost.
    - For example, if the information of "it doesn't have to be this value in particular, but I decided on this value anyway" is lost, it becomes a value that cannot be changed.
            - [[policy constraint]]

[[Design Decision]]
- [[intention]]
