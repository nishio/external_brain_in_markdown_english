title: "Finding sides by abstracting one from the other."

from  [[A case study of a new combination with the assistance of AI]]
- Finding [[sides]] by [[abstraction]] of one side

- New aspects ([[Aspects of Experience]]) have been discovered at the 1.5 stage, but they are small
- So the desire to enlarge to the appropriate size occurs, and thereby perceive a wider range of [[felt sense]] as a single lump
    - Felt sense is [[innumerable]], so it has no clear boundary originally
    - Where human perception as a lump is changing.
- A more abstract symbol is chosen as a symbol that refers to that broad range
    - (This is not drawn in the diagram.)
Note: If you were going to use A for aspect, it would have been easier to explain if the symbols were X and Y.
