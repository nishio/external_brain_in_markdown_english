Introduction 1
- Three principles
- p.257
    - 1: All technology is a combination of elements
    - 2: The element itself is technology
    - 3: Technology exploits phenomena for some purpose.

Questioning three principles
- 1: All technology is a combination of elements
- 2: The element itself is technology
- Doesn't this definition imply that technology is an endless series of layers?
- →Consideration 1: "What's going on at the ends?"

![image](https://gyazo.com/c32f9564787ccd17561925cf3e8e67d3/thumb/1000)
Questioning three principles
- 3: Technology exploits phenomena for some purpose.
- For example, what is the "position by zero"?
    - Not technology?
- →Introduction 2 "Mechanisms of Technology Creation"

![image](https://gyazo.com/6277fe97d6d7dcedb7c1571f37fda3b8/thumb/1000)
Introduction 2
- Mechanisms by which technology is created. p.258
- Combination of needs and seeds (effects that satisfy needs)
- Confronting Limitations / Creating New Problems
- This creates a new need = [[niche]].
    - niche: (English) niche (French) nisch (German) nisch: hollow → [[hamanas]], [[hyperthermophilic fungus]].
- Needs are drawn from human desires rather than technology itself

![image](https://gyazo.com/e9039e38b4966f511cda9960cf41648d/thumb/1000)
Role of the Economy
- Inform your needs
- Test for commercial availability
- →Commercially available" means "profitable, with people willing to pay for it," i.e., "satisfying human needs at low cost."

![image](https://gyazo.com/d4028a33cd10453ab5d2dfaadae74499/thumb/1000)
Economy is also technology
- There are "arrangements" for business, means of production, institutions, organization, etc.
- This creates an opportunity for the next generation to "make an arrangement"
- Author: "So it's the same structure as technology!"
- Nishio: "Are you ignoring "3: Technology is using the phenomenon for some purpose?
- → Consider the "Arrangement" 10

![image](https://gyazo.com/a2ac98697c9f9372de843b6fbe518e70/thumb/1000)
Arrangement (1/3)
- Creating "[[agreement]]" creates value.
- Example: Barter (fish and wild vegetables)
    - The value of an object is subjective and can be increased by exchange
    - →Value can be created even if nothing is produced.
- e.g.: the right to obtain (→[[currency]])
    - Exchange rotting fish (with zero future value) for "[[the right to acquire things]]".
    - →Value was created in exchange for inanimate objects.
    - [[Arrangements create value.]]

![image](https://gyazo.com/e3b64bd85e5ca6ef871c73355f956923/thumb/1000)
Arrangement (2/3)
- Example: [[alphabet]].
    - By agreeing on symbols to represent words, information can now be conveyed without being in the same place at the same time.
    - → [[Value from Standardization]]
        - Clay tablet and cuneiform
- e.g.:[[0-based system]] ⇔ Roman/Kanji numerals
    - Computing with ranks using 0 is easy = value of human cognitive cost saved ([[thought economy]])
    - ↑upThis value can be obtained by using it alone.
    - Standardization after the fact as good arrangements are disseminated

![image](https://gyazo.com/b4cf0861dc7f65e4d211f8728b664ec3/thumb/1000)
Arrangement (3/3)
- Arrangements" that do not take advantage of natural phenomena can also create value and meet human needs
- If the economy is technology, then all arrangements of this kind are technology.
- It does not have to be an arrangement with another person. Even one person can save that person cognitive costs.
- Isn't this the driving force behind the creation of new concepts? ([[concept = arrangement]])

![image](https://gyazo.com/109e14edb190142a5aba0465aaf947c2/thumb/1000)
Introduction 3
    - [[Technology becomes a living organism.]]
    - p.260

- Technology becomes more complex and [[top down]] design more difficult
- Inability to design rules in advance, especially when the environment changes quickly
- So make it so that it can be changed to interactive (interactive).
- What does "design for adaptability to changing environments" mean? →Example 14

![image](https://gyazo.com/239f15775db0d9352cbdd8f2f74db449/thumb/1000)
Adaptation to changing environment
- Designed to change [[interactive]] as the environment changes
- Example: [[centrifugal regulator]] [regulator - Wikipedia](http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/調速機)

![image](https://gyazo.com/074489aad39ecaf9a8af832d0a8399c2/thumb/1000)
Adaptation to changing environment
- Example: Smartphone
    - Users can add applications according to their own needs, rather than designing and preparing the functions they want in advance.
    - From the smartphone perspective, "a mechanism that adapts after the fact to environments (user needs) that are difficult to know about in advance."

![image](https://gyazo.com/27a62c69f70dae3acb625c927d85493e/thumb/1000)
Adaptation to changing environment
- Example: Behavioral information collection + software updates
    - Excel, etc. We do not know in advance what kind of operations users will perform or where they will stumble. Therefore, we collect information on user operations. Based on this information, we make improvements and update the software.

![image](https://gyazo.com/ca5d00223ab48a2f1628787d631c4d7c/thumb/1000)
Adaptation to changing environment
- Example: Web service load balancing (e.g. Amazon EC2)
    - Since they do not know in advance how much access they will receive, they cannot invest in appropriate equipment. Therefore, a mechanism was introduced to observe access and increase facilities after the fact.
    - Unpredictability, speed of decision making is important → Automation
    - Automation has eliminated human judgment intervention!

![image](https://gyazo.com/ae50fcd6d8f6f7ea381eb9e4cbd671ed/thumb/1000)
Becoming an Organism p. 261-262
- Isn't this what we call "learning"?
- Hasn't technology acquired intelligence?
- Could technology become biology?
- Nishio: "The gap from 'acquisition of intelligence' to 'biology'..." and not 'biology'?"
    - →Discuss organisms in detail in Discussion 2.


![image](https://gyazo.com/2051e244c2e42427161a58a694cb0a99/thumb/1000)
Introduction 4
- Sources of Competitive Advantage
    - p.265
- Not "the ability to store resources, combine them, and produce output."
- Competitive edge" comes from "the ability to accumulate knowledge and combine it to create new [[Combination Strategies]].
    - It's mostly the same thing Drucker is talking about.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

![image](https://gyazo.com/eecc7bcbc8254abbf217f57af67e19d1/thumb/1000)
Sources of Competitive Advantage
- Competitive advantage at the time of the Industrial Revolution
    - We have a lot of resources.
    - Has processing facilities
    - Competitive advantage in [knowledge-based economy
    - I have a lot of knowledge.
    - We have the ability to combine them.

![image](https://gyazo.com/8033157cbfc6cfd01aa3db142940ec0c/thumb/1000)
- [[Organizational Learning]]
- The ability to combine knowledge" is often thought of as an individual ability, but it is also important to strengthen organizational capacity.
- in management strategy [[learning school]].
    - →Mintzberg, "[[strategic safari]]"
- Human capacity is enhanced by language, artifacts, and methodology
    - → [[Engelbard]]  "[[Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework]]" (1962)
- Enhancement by e.g. [[groupware]] (artifacts)

![image](https://gyazo.com/6bb8d7bd5eb5cb9d7cae3e39d78d460a/thumb/1000)
Introduction 5
- How to deal with technology
    - p.269
- It is important to distinguish between technology that enslaves nature and technology that is an extension of nature.
- (Nishio) I don't think it's very important.

![image](https://gyazo.com/4c8061049d269c5fc785b780fafb165b/thumb/1000)
Consideration 1
- What about the human will?
    - Why do the authors ignore the "human will"?

![image](https://gyazo.com/cf818b6d43a4784ae1d29680a2a1db73/thumb/1000)
- [[selfish gene theory]]
- 1970s
- Why do some individuals engage in "[[altruistic behavior]]" that does not contribute to their own genetic survival?
- From that individual perspective, it is not rational, but from the genetic perspective, some altruistic behavior is rational.
    - Disadvantageous to that individual but advantageous to another individual with the same genes.
- The subject is not the individual, but the gene
- →The individual is merely a genetic "vehicle."

![image](https://gyazo.com/d874657c222c2eb1069231e10360c949/thumb/1000)
- [[meme]]
- 1976 "[[Selfish genes]]" R. Dawkins
- Information is replicated by the human brain.
- Some are more efficient at replication than others, the good ones spread and the bad ones are weeded out.
- In other words, information is like genes, and like genes, it evolves through natural selection.
- →The human brain is merely a "vehicle" for memes.

![image](https://gyazo.com/0781adf64c9260ccc37db9ad484e8123/thumb/1000)
- [[technium (Tc)]]
- K. Kelly 2011
- Original title "[[What Technology Want]]"
    - The subject is Technology
- Technium = a collection of technologies
- Comparing the Evolution of Life with the Evolution of Technium

![image](https://gyazo.com/4a241f9a279de81119f90286032f1dac/thumb/1000)
- Structural necessity and historical contingency are common among the forces at work in evolution
- The third force at work in the evolution of life is blind natural selection
- The third power of the Technium is the social [[collective free will]].


![image](https://gyazo.com/ccf2dacdf2705dc9d94c61830e820b29/thumb/1000)
- Q: Why do the authors ignore the "human will"?
- The idea that, like genes and memes [[humans are merely vehicles of technology]], technology evolves independently of human will.
- K. Kelly argues that "human will causes technology to evolve faster than genetic evolution." The distinction between this?


![image](https://gyazo.com/414ed04ba8365147000b3bb32d3f72aa/thumb/1000)
Consideration 2
- What about the ends?
- If we define "X is all combinations of elements + element X", X would be an infinite hierarchy. What about the ends?
- First technology, first life, first economy

![image](https://gyazo.com/8fb93ad4bf83ed2c00ea5732d19bc149/thumb/1000)
First technology
- Woodpecker finches using branches to catch insects
    - [Darwin's finches - Wikipedia](http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ダーウィンフィンチ類)
- Bearded vulture dropping bones and turtles on stones to break them and eat them.
- Using the phenomenon to satisfy the need of appetite
- Not a combination.

![image](https://gyazo.com/e49f1b3091c1d9ce9843f734fbc92443/thumb/1000)
first life
- [[The Yulee-Miller Experiment]]
    - Repeated discharges into the primordial atmosphere happen to produce organic compounds such as amino acids
- [[GADV hypothesis]]
    - Peptides formed by the polymerization of amino acids created in the above experiment have catalytic activity → promote the reaction.

![image](https://gyazo.com/5e952dce9eea39dd986b9f09a943597b/thumb/1000)
first life
- [[Coacervate]]
    - A spherical object whose shape is maintained by the hydrophobic interaction of water and oil. Alexandre Oparin claimed that it may be the origin of life.
        - (Cell membrane: lipid bilayer)
    - ...In a random combination of these various factors, something with the ability to self-replicate may have proliferated by chance (Nishio).

![image](https://gyazo.com/221e3b94d193051ffadf76f2712710b5/thumb/1000)
First Economy
- Mycorrhizal fungi (and other symbiotic relationships) 400 million years ago
    - Absorb phosphate and nitrogen from the soil and supply them to the host plant, and obtain carbon compounds produced by the host plant through photosynthesis
- For humans: barter
    - Offer fish and get wild plants instead

![image](https://gyazo.com/a755eafbf965eb7ba632465ed1c4eb22/thumb/1000)
by chance
- If you happen to drop a turtle on a stone, it will crack.
- I happen to be able to self-replicate.
- Two parties who happen to benefit from the exchange met.
- The first X is born by chance.

![image](https://gyazo.com/03b41dcf69dbfd90a8dd000615d64b4c/thumb/1000)
Consideration 3
- Darwinian evolution
    - The Darwinian principle of evolution is "random -> more successful by chance."
    - Random variation Gene Random combination Individual Natural selection Surviving individual
    - Random change Knowledge Random combination Application Success Survived Application

![image](https://gyazo.com/412e80e57ad1c4ce0f06dd06584c9173/thumb/1000)
Beyond Random
- Mechanisms of technological evolution differ from Darwin's theory of evolution (p. 258)
- The science of creating [[techne]] that is more efficient than random = [[methodology]].
    - 2024-06-13 Explanation of this phrase: [[The connection between technology (techne) and academia (ology)]].

![image](https://gyazo.com/26140a21c45891ac3e194c0a2a1ed2fa/thumb/1000)
Beyond Random
- Human capacity is enhanced by language, artifacts, and methodology
    - → [[Engelbard]] "[[Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework]]" (1962)
    - Artifacts → tools, measuring instruments, processing equipment
    - Language → Nomenclature Arrangements for concepts/phenomena e.g.: "power
    - Methodology → Scientific Methodology and Experimental Techniques
- Added 2024-06-13: [[nonexistence of power]].

![image](https://gyazo.com/bb5920dfffd497aefe7d64d30e2a7980/thumb/1000)
Consideration 4
    - [[scientific method]]
    - [[Descartes]] 「 [[introduction to the method]] 」
    - [The rule of clarity: Only what is clearly recognized as truth should be the criterion of judgment.
    - [[Elemental Decomposition]]: Consider breaking down the problem into elements that can be resolved.
    - [From the concrete to the abstract: The recognition of the simple to the complex in turn.
    - [[Synthesis]]:The whole is reconstructed by complete enumeration and reconstruction, making sure that nothing has been overlooked.
    - Early works on [scientific methodology
- →But what [[clarification]]?
- [Scientific method - Wikipedia](http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/科学的方法)

![image](https://gyazo.com/d6e975df3d55c9a89944c68dd771142b/thumb/1000)
Descartes
- 「 [[I think, therefore I am]] 」
    - Only God-given "[[reason]]" is correct.
    - Human cognition and [[experience]] cannot be trusted.
    - Of course, experimental and observational data are also unreliable.
- Using that reason, I questioned everything, and the only thing that remained was "my existence.
    - → [[methodic doubt]]
    - → Believed in God and doubted the correctness of science

![image](https://gyazo.com/3d3c291386c347b85c230907e2ad7481/thumb/1000)
historical background

How the world came to be
- Christianity: The idea that "God" [[absolute order]] "created the world.
    - →39% of people in the U.S. believe in [[theory of evolution]] (2009)
    - ←1859 "[[Origin of species]]"
- 1882  [[Nietzsche]] 「 [[God is dead.]] 」
    - → [[will to power]]
    - p. 268 "[[All the various movements of the twentieth century that had pure order as their basis have collapsed]]."
        - ← oversimplification
            - [[ID Theory]]:Design Science Education by Advanced Intelligence, coined with Evolutionary Theory.
            - 2005 [[Dover trial]] → Unconstitutional
- Greece: "The world is born and grows" philosophy
        - [[nature=birth, nurture]]
    - [[Plato]], [[Judaism]] influence on the ideal world "[[idea (in Platonic thought)]]"
    - →Reality was "made" in its image.
    - Christianity: inherited the concept of [[the transcendent]] from Judaism, used Plato as justification in the Middle Ages
    - Descartes: Human reason is [[guardianship]] by [divine reason
        - → [[Kant]] :  [[Critique of Pure Reason (Kritik der reinen Vernunft) (Kant)]] (1781)

Consideration 5
- Evolution of Technology
- Why go beyond Darwinian evolution?
    - →What is the methodology derived from?
    - →How is the direction of selection determined?

![image](https://gyazo.com/80e1a869238c62f931688cd1e835f7a2/thumb/1000)
What is it made of?

![image](https://gyazo.com/22722fdd009411a0cc39fd49246366f1/thumb/1000)
Methodology is also hierarchical.
- Methodology is a value-generating decision to "create good applications.
- → Technology as well as the economy
- Edges are "random".

![image](https://gyazo.com/45cb3619d20fd8c73d5cb83137abd7bf/thumb/1000)
What decides?

![image](https://gyazo.com/1936f57f4d1270abf39fcb0a4c38a31b/thumb/1000)
Role of the Economy
- Test for commercial availability
- (Kelly) Collective free will of society
- Acceleration by Market
    - Unexpected success: meeting a different need than intended
    - Improvement bias of widely used
    - Diverse use bias ([[openness]])

![image](https://gyazo.com/1383fc2d9e28af40f2e65fba8b41080d/thumb/1000)
summary
- Arrangements = concepts as well as objects create value
- Methodology allows for more efficient search for "combinations" than Darwinian evolution
- Methodology is also a hierarchical technology
- Market bias toward greater openness
    - → Openness makes the combination of elements more complex
    - → top-down design becomes impossible ([[bio-]])

bonus
- programming
    - Function Definition: Gives a name to a complex series of processes so that they can be performed under that name in the future.
    - = "Designed like words in a language" (Chapter 4)
    - = "Arrangements" that reduce cognitive costs.
    - = hierarchical components (functions can be used as components to create other functions)

History of Programming Languages
- Before birth: A computer that can change its calculations by wiring it with wires.
- Wiring is troublesome → Computers that can change the calculation by writing data
- Data is difficult to understand in 01001010 -> Program to convert human-understandable alphabet to 01001010
    - It is "up to you" what notation to use.

![image](https://gyazo.com/c88fc9ab0df3295bf29ac2b72e38ee34/thumb/1000)
History of Programming Languages
- Writing similar processes over and over is tedious.
    - →Decisions for reusing program fragments
- I have trouble keeping up with the rules.
    - → Add instructions for program reuse to the computer (ret)
- Cumbersome to remember the numerical location of programs to be reused
    - →Notation for naming and calling program fragments, a decision to be made.
    - →Birth of the concept of "function
