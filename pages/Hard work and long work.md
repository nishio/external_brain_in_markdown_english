title: "Hard work and long work"

> [shu_yamaguchi](https://x.com/shu_yamaguchi/status/1851763234858242316) There are so many people who mistake [[hard work]] and [[long work]]. Simply "working long hours = long work" does not increase [[human capital]] or [[SOC]], and all that remains is "[[fatigue]]". It is "work that is a bit harder than one's ability = hard work" that brings [[growth]]. Do not confuse the two.

- [[long working hours]]
- [[Stretch Goal Setting]]
