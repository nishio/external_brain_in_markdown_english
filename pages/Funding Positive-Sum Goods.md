[[Limitations of traditional classification of economic goods]]
- Classification of public goods, commons, private goods, and club goods is at variance with reality
- Attributes of goods are not fixed, but a matter of choice (e.g., transition from commons to private goods through privatization)
- The [[excludability]] of goods is a matter of cost (e.g., excludability of PDFs through DRM)
- Exclusivity should be kept as low as possible to maintain maximum incremental yield

The concept of [anti-rival goods
- Goods whose value increases the more they are used (open sources, ideas, institutions, etc.)
- Anti-rivalry is systemic, with some elements of rivalry in individual cases (e.g., language, traffic signals)
- In anti-rival goods, benefits increase with the degree of sharing
- To make the system anti-rivalry, we need to strategically consider the balance of exclusivity.

[[anti-rivalry financing and governance]].
- [[data governance]] (input to AI): balance between exclusionary and anti-rivalry through [[data cooperative]] and [corelations
- [[Internet Protocol]]: New protocols and standards need to be established to enable positive-sum networks.
- Anti-rivalry approaches are also useful in areas such as [[local journalism]], [transportation networks

Importance of [collective knowledge mechanism
    - Implement collective knowledge mechanisms to ensure alignment between [[decision-makers]] and affected parties
- Obtain feedback from stakeholders (citizens, institutions, businesses, etc.) to determine the appropriate balance

Overcoming the [[public/private dichotomy]] ([[public/private is a false dichotomy]])
- Need to view goods as a network and create mechanisms to create positive-sum externalities #Network goods
    - In the case of [[public goods (i.e. goods or services such as parks or highways)]], the democratically accountable state is responsible for the checking function, but in other cases checking by stakeholders is essential
- Corporate governance structures also need to incorporate [[internalization of externalities]] mechanisms (e.g., assessment of labor market impacts)
