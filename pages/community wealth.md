[[Pre-wealth theory]]

> Alibaba Group, the largest online retailer, plans to invest 1.7 trillion Japanese yen by 2025, including support for the construction of model districts that embody the philosophy of "common wealth.
> Tencent, the IT giant, has committed 850 billion Japanese yen to support low-income people and promote rural areas.

> There is a view that this may be related to the "IT company beatdown" by the Chinese government that took place one after another between 2020 and 2021.
>  In April 2021, "[[Alibaba]]" was fined a huge sum of about 300 billion Japanese yen for alleged violation of the Antimonopoly Law.
>  "[[Tencent (Taiwan)]]", whose online games, one of its revenue pillars, are now subject to government regulations restricting underage use.
>  Given this, it is possible that the IT companies decided that it would be in their best interest to follow the "joint wealth" approach in order to avoid further pressure.
