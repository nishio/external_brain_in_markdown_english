People who do not create accounts

When I tried to sign up for the event, there were input fields for [[Solana address]] and [[Ethereum address]].
I am still in a position to empathize with those who think, "Why do you need it?" I am still in a position to empathize with those who think
On the other hand, I can understand the feeling of, "It's optional, so why don't I have to explain it to you?" on the other hand, "It's optional, so there's no need for an explanation.
I'm not too familiar with Solana, so I'm like, "Why?" but I don't think I would have particularly cared if the Ethereum address was made a required field without explanation.

The reverse pattern of this
I once had an event where they told me they were going to use Scrapbox, and when they asked me to log in with my [[Google account]], I was told "I don't have a Google account.
I don't remember if it was ...... or not.
But there's no barrier to creating a Google account, and those who don't want to create a Google account because of their own ideology or emotional rebellion will cut it off without any particular hesitation because there's nothing they can do about it.

Especially if you are unfamiliar with that blockchain technology or cryptocurrency, you may feel uneasy if the reason for the request is not clear. On the other hand, if you are familiar with the technology, you may not question too much about why it is needed.

Reasons for needing an Ethereum address could be to use a specific token at an event, to network with other participants, or to provide access to specific digital content. If this is optional, there is a choice for the attendees, offering it if they are interested and skipping it if not.

On the other hand, in cases like Scrapbox and Google accounts, using them is directly related to the event experience; without a Google account, using Scrapbox itself becomes difficult, so the requirement is more fundamental. The choice here tends to be between creating an account or not attending the event. This may be due to personal privacy awareness and philosophical issues rather than technical barriers.

Both cases illustrate how technology is integrated into our lives and how individual responses to it vary. I think transparency and freedom of choice are key factors for users in both scenarios.
