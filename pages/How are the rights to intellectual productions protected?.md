#Engineer's Intellectual Production_Additions
- [[Intellectual Production and the Law]]

- I am planning to add an Appendix to the future edition of "The Intellectual Productivity of Engineers" entitled "[[Having legal knowledge is beneficial]]", and I think it would be quite interesting as a practical example to introduce in the Appendix.
    - [[Keisuke Sogawa]] : I feel that not only legal knowledge but also money literacy, economics, and engineering +α will expand the scope of problem solving.
- Of course, it is true that the value of knowledge increases when it is combined with knowledge from other fields, but my point is not so much about the law in general, but rather, "Isn't it bad that we live by selling the products of intellectual production, but we don't understand the legal basis on which those products are protected? Something like that.
- In that light, it's not "it's beneficial to have legal knowledge," but "how are the rights to intellectual productions protected?" would be more appropriate.
