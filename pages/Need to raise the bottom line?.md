title: "Need to raise the bottom line?"

- Tend to implicitly assume that [[raising (the standard)]] is necessary, beneficial, and
- Is that true?

The bottom is already won. Rather, the U.S. is winning in the understanding that some excellent people are continuing to realize [[moonshot]] that mankind has never seen before, and I would like to aim for that.
