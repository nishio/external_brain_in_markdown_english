title: "Death if you don't GIVE to the young."

> [gdvonly](https://x.com/gdvonly/status/1822200742762938634) This is a little different, it's really more like "if you can't GIVE to [[YOUNG PERSON]] than yourself, you will die".
>  This is a matter of course, and essentially [[younger people are stronger]]. In history, people who have taken too much from the young have usually perished.
>  If everyone realizes this and puts it into practice, then [[revolution]] will soon occur and confusion will ensue, so a system like [[seniority by length of service]] is effective for the sake of overall optimal order. In Asia, [[Confucianism]] is automatically installed.
>  But with [[entrepreneur]] and such, that rule is almost unnecessary. Since it exists for revolution in the first place.
>  So, "[[young people have value in their own right]]" is a bit of a lie. What I really mean is "[[young people have a mass of value]], so it's not good if we don't GIVE them while we still can".
>  It's more profitable to hide your rationality and act like you have good intentions, so that's why you say it that way.
>  By the way, it is even more serious today because young people are stronger and have a much longer average life expectancy.
>  That's the way I am, and I live my life with the help of people younger than me somehow.

> [gdvonly](https://x.com/gdvonly/status/1822244122851471703) So the optimal action on the young side is to GIVE back to the older side.
>  If you are older, you will die if your default is not able to GIVE, but you will be in a heck of a pinch if the opposite is true.
>  As a result, an impossible give may be returned that is not commensurate with the market price.
>  All successful young entrepreneurs do this.

I feel that this statement is a bit of a bosichon talker's flourish with this statement.
- but, well, I think it captures [[Aspects of the truth]].
