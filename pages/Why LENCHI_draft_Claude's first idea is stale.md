Why LENCHI_draft_Claude's first idea is stale
I'm expanding from an abstract concept.
You should connect it to something more specific.
- The parable of the [[rootless person]].
Advice for Unexplored Jr.
Connect to your specific experience in the past
Experience is a hard-to-procure resource
    - [[Activity history is for goods that are difficult to procure on the market.]]
- There should be a link.

Top-down and bottom-up
- If you're going to write down something you already know enough about, just break it down top-down.
- If you are trying to launch a theory that does not yet exist, you must first gather specific information
    - Jiro Kawakita called it exploration, while Young read it as information gathering.
- Creating a written work ultimately needs to be one dimensional.
    - If so, you can make it one-dimensional from the beginning.
        - Many people get lost this way, so as a publisherly safety measure, they would probably try to map it out first in a top-down fashion.
        - It's not reasonable to try to create a map when there is no map and a frontier is opening up that no one has yet understood.
        - Explore and write a journal of your explorations.
            - There are many forms of content to be read.

Fly fast in the high sky or walk slowly on the ground
- →A "car" that moves at high speed on the ground was born, and that is the LLM.
