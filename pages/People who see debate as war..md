title: "People who see debate as war."
---

- Some people take [[question]] as [[metaphor]] for [[attack]].
- Some people see [[discussion]] as a metaphor for [[war]].

The objective is to defeat the opponent.
The goal is to not let yourself be beaten down.
We do not produce anything by discussion.

I would rather spend time with someone who sees discussion as a metaphor for "building sand piles together" than someone like that.

- [[People who see questions as attacks.]]
