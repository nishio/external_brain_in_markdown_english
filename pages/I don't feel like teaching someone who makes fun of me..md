title: "I don't feel like teaching someone who makes fun of me."
---

Mr. A feels that X is valuable.
Mr. B makes a statement that lowers the value of X.
Suppose Mr. A realizes that Mr. B does not know one of the specific advantages of X, Y.
However, Mr. A often does not tell Mr. B about Y.

concrete example
- B "What games are you playing these days?"
- A "I'm playing Dominion."
- B "What? That old game?"
- A (I'm playing online multiplayer on a Steam version released a few months ago, and with a new expansion just recently, probably an image of something released on paper 15 years ago).


(Surprisingly, I didn't write it down? I thought you would have written it, but I couldn't find it, so I wrote it.)
When I wrote it, I felt like I couldn't say "I don't feel like teaching."
- On the other hand, there's a pattern of desperately trying to teach goodness.
    - Maybe it's a case of Mr. A associating "having Mr. B evaluate the value of X" with his own evaluation.
    - In this case, they try to restore their unjustly undermined self-worth and explain that "this is what's good about me".
    - Well, they usually say "hmmm" and leave it unrestored.
