title: "Information presentation in VR"
---

What I thought after doing both a poster display of lecture slides and an information display in VR at the results briefing.
When slides are small, humans approach in the real world
Because the slides on the wall don't come close.
On the other hand, in the [[VR]] space, you can pull the slides close to you and read them.
- The [[draw or pull something towards oneself (e.g. chair)]] action triggers the [[presentation of relevant information]], etc.
