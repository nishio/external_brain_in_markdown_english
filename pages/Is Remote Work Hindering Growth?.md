- Is [[remote work]] an [[inhibition]] of [[growth]]?
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1776883969373724854) I think there is a disparity between young people who are aware that they need to be cared for and are taking care of themselves, and young people who are being cared for by older people who are aware that they need to be cared for and are being neglected. I think this is the result of the disparity.
>  >komitsubo: I have recently realized that remote work is a hindrance to growth for young people. I really think this when I see experienced people walking around the office and solving problems in an hour or so, when problems that would have taken days to solve if they were done remotely are solved by people who are just walking around the office.




> [komitsubo](https://twitter.com/komitsubo/status/1776748944112185796) What I've realized recently is that remote work is a hindrance to growth for young people. I really think this when I see experienced people walking around the office and solving problems that would have taken days to solve if they had been working remotely.

> [komitsubo](https://twitter.com/komitsubo/status/1776750336868487667) In the end, it is difficult to find a solution directly related to one's current problem by googling. It is very important to have someone who is familiar with and experienced in how to summarize the requirements, how to design, how to implement, what approach to take to solve the problem, and how to estimate the cause of the problem.

> [komitsubo](https://twitter.com/komitsubo/status/1776751642861547916) As a result, the efficiency of work and the speed of growth are completely different from those of full remote work. Remote work has expanded rapidly with the Corona disaster, but I think that when the young people who started working at this time become mid-career workers, the bill for this slow growth will be paid in a very serious way at each workplace. In fact, I have a feeling that it is already happening.

> [komitsubo](https://twitter.com/komitsubo/status/1776752190335729697) From a management perspective, there are two main things that I think are actually happening. One is the increase in the number of young people who are clearly not producing results when they are being evaluated (there are no points to evaluate, or they are buried and invisible), and the other is quite serious: the number of young people who can read is decreasing dramatically.

> [komitsubo](https://twitter.com/komitsubo/status/1776752964734210051) As for the former, well, the time for one to solve various problems has been extended, and as a result, all but the most precocious and originally capable people are falling behind the leading group of young people at once. As a result, all but the most precocious and capable are falling behind the leading group of young people. Young people who were able to run like a second group before remote work, even if they were a little far from the front group, are now invisible at once. The subtle recognition around them is fast.

> [komitsubo](https://twitter.com/komitsubo/status/1776753612171231662) And the other one is quite dangerous, there are fewer young people who can really involve others and do big jobs and take the lead. That's right, because even if a team is made up of young people remotely, they have never met or talked with the young people, mid-career workers, and seniors around them. So, they don't bond as a team.

> [komitsubo](https://twitter.com/komitsubo/status/1776754239328702636) And it's pretty hard to judge remotely if a team isn't working, and a young person with almost no experience is suddenly asked to do the reading. It's hard to judge if a team is not working or not. As a result, they can only talk to each other based on the other party's volume. They just throw out requests from their superiors. As a result, it is difficult for them to improve their skills because they have no experience at all.

> [komitsubo](https://twitter.com/komitsubo/status/1776754690933559722) Generally speaking, in a full remote situation, it is very difficult to activate a team function even for someone with leading experience, but this is almost impossible for an inexperienced person. As a result, there is no one who can do leading work that works in collaboration with others. I have noticed that there is a much more serious shortage of leading personnel than before. It is very dangerous.

> [komitsubo](https://twitter.com/komitsubo/status/1776755833495572760) Given this situation, I can understand why companies are asking people to come to work. Stagnant growth of human resources is directly related to the results of the organization and the company. If you know that the situation will lead to a considerable speedy decline in human resources and results, then you have no choice but to ask them to come out of the office. The impact of the Corona disaster is that great. What are we going to do about this?

> [komitsubo](https://twitter.com/komitsubo/status/1776757402538483797) In my own place, young people who are excellent on their own are exposed to a lack of experience all at once at the reading stage. For those who don't have the awareness and methods based on their own past experiences to understand what members are having trouble with, remote reading is almost like walking around with blinders on. It is really tough if you don't make a time and day for everyone to get together in real life, at least at the team level.

>  I think it's totally fine to be on your own or even remotely if you have an attitude of listening immediately and an environment where you can listen.

> [tamanegikenshi_](https://twitter.com/tamanegikenshi_/status/1776898059928310141) With all due respect, I don't think that's true. I've seen many cases where the "experienced person walking around the area will take care of it" is simply because that person is just being nice, and I've seen many cases where the person sits next to you and talks about what seems to be a problem and knows the solution, but doesn't join in the conversation. ...

Compared to in-person, the amount of communication with senior staff is much less. It is also difficult to confirm whether my ideas and work procedures are correct. If you are in-person, you could watch your seniors and steal their work, but if you are remote, you only see the results of your seniors' work...

Being in the office offers more direct collaboration and learning opportunities. However, remote work also offers flexibility for health benefits, such as reduced commuting stress and greater control over daily life...

> [Hichan00](https://twitter.com/Hichan00/status/1776939760055112143) The difference between remote work and office work is like the difference between "self-study" and "class". When you are self-studying at home, when you run into a problem you don't understand, you struggle alone and time melts away... But in the office, an experienced "teacher" you happen to meet in the hallway will immediately show you the solution. The solitude of remote work...

> [songmu](https://twitter.com/songmu/status/1777218869503119859) It's not that remote work is stunting the growth of young people, it's that the same way that the current generation of veterans grew up working the office main way doesn't work. I'm just saying that we need to come up with a different way of doing things.

> [tap_t](https://twitter.com/tap_t/status/1777559656589910301) If you can't do something (so called) remotely, I don't think you should do it. But I don't want to get in the way of those who can do it (efficiently or efficiently in a team) (roughly).
