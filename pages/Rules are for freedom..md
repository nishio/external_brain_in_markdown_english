title: "Rules are for freedom."
---

There are two mental models for the rule.
    - [[rule]] is to ensure [[freedom]].
    - Costly when multiple people act in concert each time
    - So, set rules and make sure that within the scope of the rules, you can act without consulting each other every time.
- Rules are there to limit freedom.
    - Some people naively believe this, but what is the basis?
