[https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGKKZO86657860R10C25A2MM8000/](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGKKZO86657860R10C25A2MM8000/)

If you wanted to read it properly, it would take an hour, even if it is just a report on [[OpenAI Deep Research]].
- What is the definition of "[[read properly]]?"
    - To be prepared to take it out and use it when needed in your own thinking and editorials to beneficial effect, sort of.
- I read a lot, but people who don't read properly don't grow in their thinking and editorializing.
        - Like [[vector search]].
            - [[Search by Meaning]]
        - Mouthing what you associate with the input.
        - Being able to do this quickly used to be a value.
            - It's the same kind of composition that was valuable to people who had encyclopedic knowledge stuffed in their heads before the Internet made it possible to search encyclopedias.
                - Replaced by Google and Wikipedia
            - The ability to do a fluffy search with no clear keywords present and come up with relevant ones.
                - This too is being replaced by ChatGPT.
- What is a good condition?
    - The links are connected.
    - You can follow the link from the search hit to get down to the application.
        - Related: [[Rootless Knowledge]].

- [[Rectangle to divide the screen into 4 parts]] and [[People have to try...]].
- With the help of AI, [[academic gossip]] develops at a blistering pace, but eventually you have to [[land in reality]], [[keep one's feet on the ground]].
