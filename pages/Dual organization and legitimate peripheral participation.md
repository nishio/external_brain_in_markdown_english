- Clear boundaries for participation
    - Recognized as a legitimate member.
        - [[legitimate participation]]

- Share information about the activities of the authorized internal organization with the rest of the organization
    - Understand what kind of activities they are engaged in.
        - [[Peripheral Participation]]

When I wrote about [[the Duplex organization]] before, I thought the outer boundaries were in and out.
    - It was an image of the [[open source community]] user group.
- But the outer boundary being free to come and go is not a MUST requirement for a dual organization
- For example, in the case of [Cybozu
    - Within the group of employees, there is a subgroup called the general manager.
    - Of course there is a selection process to get into the general manager's group, but there is also a selection process to get into the group of employees.
        - I wrote this on 2018-04-23, but then I started doing [[in-house recruitment of directors]].
    - Information that can be disclosed in discussions at general managers' meetings is made available to employees.
- According to the idea of legitimate peripheral participation, there should be explicit participation rituals (= legitimization of affiliation) at the outer boundaries as well
