Jiro Kawakita's story about how he tried to construct "what points are creative and what points are not creative" by arranging the work he has done.
- Three Articles of Creative Conduct
    - 1:  [[spontaneity]]
        - The more you do something on your own initiative, the more creative you are
        - The act of being told to do something and then doing it reluctantly is hardly creative.
    - 2:  [[lack of a model]]
        - Creative without example
        - It's uncreative to have an example that says, "You could do it this way."
    - 3:  [[keenness]]
        - The more you are desperate for something to be done well, the more creative you are.
        - Not very creative if you don't care what the outcome is.
- rebuttal
    - The more urgent the task that needs to be done well, the more you have to do it, whether you have the initiative or not.
    - The more work you do without a role model, the greater the risk of failure, so you shy away and lose your initiative."
    - Jiro Kawakita could not respond immediately to this point of view and thought about it overnight.
- Conclusion.
    - > "Indeed. Indeed, these three articles of creativity must be mutually contradictory as long as we sit and wait. But to take all three articles and resolve the contradiction in a practical act is what we call a creative act. Why should we call an act creative if there is no contradiction in it from the beginning?

    - I think this is too abstract to understand.
        - I feel what you are saying is right, but I don't think it's clearly explained.
            - [[conceptualization]] I think you're doing too much.
        - You need to be more specific.
    - The more work you do without a role model, the greater the risk of failure, so you shy away and lose your initiative."
        - This is not True.
        - People shy away from jobs that don't have a role model.
        - On the other hand, some people are thrilled to be told they are free to do what they want.
        - The questioner is the former type and just assumes that others feel the same way.
    - The more urgent the task that needs to be done well, the more you have to do it, whether you have the initiative or not.
        - This says, "If the earnestness is high, it will be carried out even if the spontaneity is low."
        - It doesn't refute the statement that "high spontaneity is important for being creative."
        - The "highly motivated, highly motivated" case is more creative than the "highly motivated, low motivation" case.
        - I think this is a concept related to [[making something one's own]] and [overwhelming awareness of the parties involved
            - The difference between thinking, "If it doesn't work, the company will be in trouble," and thinking, "If it doesn't work, I won't like it."
