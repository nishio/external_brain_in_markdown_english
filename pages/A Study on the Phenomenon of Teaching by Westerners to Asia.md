title: "A Study on the Phenomenon of Teaching by Westerners to Asia"

from  [[mansplaining]]
Summary: The[[欧米人]]が [[Asian people]] に教えたがる現象について、日本のユーザー達が「 [[mansplaining]] 」のような名前や「[[宣教師しぐさ]]」、「[[ヨーロッパ中心主義]]」などの表現を挙げながら考察している。<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>

> [niinow_g](https://twitter.com/niinow_g/status/1707929794049122536) It's strange that the same people who gave the name "mansplaining" to a phenomenon that men want to teach women, don't want to give a name to a phenomenon that Westerners want to teach Asians (Japanese). I wonder why they don't want to give a name to the phenomenon that Westerners want to teach Asians (Japanese).

(I don't know if it is an appropriate phrase in English or other languages over there I don't know if it would be in English or other languages over there...)
