title: 'Multi-Head Thinking" and "The Engineer''s Art of Intellectual Production."'

Experiments relating book content to articles
- The book "[[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]]" is mapped to "[[Multi-head thinking]]".

- [[(1.3.4.1) The technique of sutra copying]]
    - [[copying of a sutra]] : It is important to think while transcribing, which leads to "[[clear objectives]]".
    - Does this mean that "it is better to transcribe and execute than to read vaguely" with respect to source code?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

Chapter 4 [[How to Read Efficiently]].
    - Prepare a [[reading notebook]] and fill it out as you read through the book.

### digest
.

In "[[think in writing]]," what is in your head is written down, then read and thoughts are triggered. This is [[one dimensional]], where the latest thing is read and a new thing is written. However, the "[[AI writes research notes daily]]" system is "[[multi-headed]]," with multiple pages for the AI to read and write. Human "writing and thinking" is [[single-headed thinking]], which could be extended to multi-headed thinking, allowing the AI to "read" and the human to read what is written, cut out what is not needed, and write when something comes to mind.

Nishio's "technique of sutra copying" is about thinking while transcribing, which leads to a "clear purpose". This is related to my research and consistent with the idea that AI enables "reading. Also, in "how to read efficiently," prepare a reading notebook and fill it in as you go through the book. This is also related to my research and consistent with the idea of enabling AI to "read".

Q: How does the idea of allowing AI to "read" change human thinking? And how does it affect the way humans learn?
