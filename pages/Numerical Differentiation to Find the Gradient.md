Numerical Differentiation to Find the Gradient

- Vertical axis is goodness, horizontal axis is [[search space]].
- Not sure which way to go if there is only one observation
- Given two observations, we can compare them to know "[[Better Direction]]".
    - This is [[gradient]] by [[numerical differentiation]].
    - The figure determines that the further to the right, the larger
    - In the figure, the search space is only left and right because it is 1-dimensional, but in general, the search space is high-dimensional
- Proceeding in the direction of the gradient yields better results.
    - This is the [[least-descent method]].
