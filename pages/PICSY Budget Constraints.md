title: "PICSY Budget Constraints"
---

Mechanisms that increase reputation when evaluated by those who are evaluated by those who are evaluated.
- This "evaluation" is set to [[resource that cannot be duplicated]].
- Purchase" is an act that enhances the "reputation" of the other party.
- But it's a resource that can't be duplicated, so "purchasing" the resource would be devalued by the buyer.
    - This will cause those who have been evaluated in the past by buyers to mysteriously suffer a devaluation.
- This is not desirable, so we would say that there should be a limit on the amount that can be purchased.
    - That's the budget constraint.
    - Accumulate a small reduction of evaluations from all members in advance.
        - We call this "gradual reduction" "natural recovery."
- Three ways of doing this are being considered.
    - Those who use the link $E_{bb}$ to themselves
    - How to introduce a central bank and use [$ E_{b0}
    - How to dismantle the link to yourself $E_{bb}$ as a virtual central bank
        - Remove the diagonal from E and distribute it to the other members to make a new E'.
