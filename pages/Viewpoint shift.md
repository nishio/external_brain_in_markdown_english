title: "Viewpoint shift"
---

# want to do

- We set up a sphere called a teleport portal that jumps to it when it is triggered.
- It works fine on PC but not on Oculus.
        - [[Viewpoint cannot be shifted.]]

-----
- In the meantime, if you point the controller up and pull the trigger, how about if you jump around z=50.
