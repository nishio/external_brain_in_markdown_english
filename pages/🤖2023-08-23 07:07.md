Improve intellectual productivity by identifying discomfort as a problem and resolving it. Increase the value of ideas by verbalizing, nurturing, and refining them. Improve the value of ideas as an investment in self. Continuing with a sense of enjoyment and creating a good state of mind makes it less painful to put in the effort.

The fragments "AI Observation Diary: Discomfort-Driven Intellectual Production" and "Discomfort-Driven Intellectual Production and the Process of Idea Value Enhancement" describe the process of discomfort-driven intellectual production and idea value enhancement, and are relevant to my research. It is consistent with my research that putting effort into resolving discomfort when it is felt is important for increasing the value of ideas.
