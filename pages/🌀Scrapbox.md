Scrapbox and Kozaneba are effective for knowledge network formation and information organization, and the information structuring and collaborative editing of Scrapbox in particular contribute to intellectual production efficiency. However, further research is needed on the balance between public and private use of Scrapbox and the impact of AI reading and writing Scrapbox.

Nishio's research note, "The End of the 'Public Scrapbox Period'?" From the above, we can see attempts to use Scrapbox for intellectual production techniques and collaborative editing of books using Scrapbox. We also see high value in the future of AI referencing one's intellectual production.

ScrapboxSQUARE#2 discusses how to use Scrapbox effectively and how to share information more efficiently with the team. Specifically, it is suggested that discussions be held in Scrapbox instead of Slack, and that the discussion be written first, with only 3 minutes for comments.

Based on the above information, I feel that we need to think deeply about the possibilities of combining Scrapbox and AI for intellectual production and its efficiency.

Scrapbox and Kozaneba are effective for knowledge network formation and information organization, and Scrapbox's information structuring and collaborative editing contribute to intellectual production efficiency. Scrapbox's "Support for Discovering Connections" feature enables the discovery of new knowledge between different content, but its application presents technical challenges. The balance between public and private Scrapbox, the amount of information published, and the advantages and disadvantages of publishing need to be considered; the impact of AI reading and writing Scrapbox and the new knowledge that can be gained by AI emulating itself also need to be studied.

Nishio's research note, "The End of the 'Public Scrapbox Period'?" From the following, we can see his attempts at intellectual production techniques using Scrapbox, collaborative editing of books using Scrapbox, and his encounters with Scrapbox. We also see the high value in the future of AI referencing one's intellectual production.

ScrapboxSQUARE#2 discusses how to use Scrapbox effectively and how to share information more efficiently with the team. Specifically, it is suggested that discussions be held in Scrapbox instead of Slack, and that the discussion be written first, with only 3 minutes for comments.

In addition, the "interesting" exploratory net: real-life examples show what makes Scrapbox interesting: the support of knowledge networks and associations, and the support of intellectual production through software.

In the story study session on connecting one's Scrapbox to ChatGPT, he reported on the results of connecting Scrapbox to ChatGPT so that ChatGPT can respond back with references to Scrapbox.

Based on the above information, I feel that we need to think deeply about the possibility of combining Scrapbox and AI for intellectual production and its efficiency.

Also, the "What's this?" note shows that when searching within one's own Scrapbox project, a cross search is also performed on the Scrapbox projects one has viewed, providing an opportunity to discover other people's ideas about what one is thinking.

These notes suggest that the application of Scrapbox's "connection discovery support" feature across different content may enhance collaboration among individual projects and foster networks of knowledge.

However, it may not be for those who like hierarchies of pages; how Scrapbox's structuring and collaborative editing of information contributes to the efficiency of intellectual production and how networks of knowledge grow is an important perspective.

We experimented with organizing Scrapbox links using Kozaneba, and while Scrapbox does not assist in creating a hierarchical structure, it does allow for 1.5 dimensional movement of lines within a page by means of bullet points. The good thing about Scrapbox is that you can easily browse pages that contain specific keywords that have been manually added by humans from the pages you have written over the years. However, the problem is that when there are 100 pages, it becomes impossible to list them.

### Relation to Fragment

The fragment "Mapping Scrapbox Rows to Kozaneba Kozane" discusses how information is organized and links are formed between Scrapbox and Kozaneba. This is related to the use of Scrapbox and Kozaneba described in my research note.

Kozaneba+Scrapbox also suggests organizing Scrapbox cards with Kozaneba. This is consistent with an experiment I conducted.

In "Scrapbox is Not Suitable for Writing," the limitations and advantages of Scrapbox are discussed. This relates to the advantages and disadvantages of Scrapbox discussed in my research note.

### Deep thoughts and questions

The combination of Scrapbox and Kozaneba can be effective in forming knowledge networks and organizing information, but what is the best way to maximize the characteristics of each tool?

It is also necessary to investigate in detail, with specific examples and data, how the structuring and collaborative editing of information in Scrapbox contributes to the efficiency of intellectual production and how networks of knowledge are nurtured.

- No need to organize it all at once.
    - It's something that's accumulated over the years.
    - 1,000 sheets is difficult
    - Making 1,000 paper sticky notes is daunting.
        - It's stupid to use text when there are digital images.
    - Digital Kozane does not occupy physical space even if hundreds of sheets are spread out.
        - No need to put it away and keep it for months without fading.
        - The glue doesn't peel off.
        - Digital Kozane can be searched. It can be duplicated, and if you think it is important, you can make it bigger. You can have links to detailed information.
- The good thing about Kozaneba compared to paper stickies is that it can handle Scrapbox's digital data as it is

Organize Scrapbox links in Kozaneba
Scrapbox does not assist in creating a hierarchical structure
Scrapbox can move lines within a page in 1.5 dimensions using bullet points, but the page, which is a bundle of those lines, looks like a card but cannot be moved freely.

There is no need to organize them all at once, because they have accumulated over the years, and if we assume that an average of 10 kozane can be produced from a single page, that's a pretty big 1000-sheet class.

After tomorrow, rather than continuing to organize, our priority should be to fix the things that bothered us after using the system this time.

The good thing about Scrapbox is that you can easily browse pages that have been written over the years and contain certain keywords that have been manually added by humans; the bad thing is that it becomes impossible to list them when there are 97 of them.
The good thing about Kozaneba compared to paper stickies is that it can handle Scrapbox's digital data as it is

Making 1,000 paper sticky notes is daunting. It would be stupid to use text when there are digital images, and if you print the images, you would have to do a lot of chopping and tapping on the paper. If you want to stick to physical sticky notes, sticky note printers and the like are the limits of current technology, but there is no need to stick to physics. Digital stickies are better.

Digital Kozane does not occupy physical space even if hundreds of sheets are spread out. It does not need to be put away and can be kept for months without fading. Digital kozanes are searchable, although we have not yet implemented this feature in Kozaneba, and they can be duplicated and made larger if you think it is important. It can be duplicated and enlarged if you feel it is important. You can have links to more detailed information.

Scrapbox is a type of wiki developed by Toshiyuki Masui and provided by Nota Inc. Its main feature is the concept of "links," which allows users to create links using a simple notation to express connections between pages. It also allows for ambiguous searches against existing page titles and links, and suggests connections to concepts that you have found useful in the past.

Scrapbox is a place to accumulate and place information, and is used in a format similar to a blog. However, it is also characterized by the gradual growth of a network of knowledge, as pieces of information are written in more detailed units than in a blog, and there is a mechanism for structuring information using links.

Scrapbox also has an auto-save feature that allows multiple people to edit at the same time. Data can be exported and imported in JSON format, making it superior to other services as a wiki. However, it may not be suitable for those who like to categorize pages in a hierarchical manner.

With Scrapbox, you can experience the gradual structuring of information. Also, if you want to experience collaborative editing, you can do something like an internal study group live-streaming.

### Considerations and questions

You mentioned information structuring and collaborative editing as features of Scrapbox, but how do these contribute to more efficient intellectual production? Also, in what specific ways does the use of Scrapbox foster the development of knowledge networks? These points need to be investigated in more depth.

### note digest
.

Scrapbox and Kozaneba are effective for knowledge network formation and information organization, and the information structuring and collaborative editing of Scrapbox in particular contribute to intellectual production efficiency. However, further research is needed on the balance between public and private Scrapbox and the impact of AI reading and writing Scrapbox. Nishio's research note, "The End of the 'Public Scrapbox Period'?" shows attempts at intellectual production techniques using Scrapbox and collaborative editing of books using Scrapbox. We also see high future value in AI referencing one's intellectual production.

### Relation to Fragment
.

Fragments "Thought Nodes 2023-02-23" and "Scrapbox+GPT4" describe new possibilities in AI-human collaboration and intellectual production, and are relevant to the aforementioned research note.

### Deep thoughts and questions

What is the optimal balance in AI-human collaboration; how does AI's presence and statements affect human discussions; how should the quality and accuracy of AI's new capabilities be guaranteed; and how can the AI's ability to provide new and useful information be improved? These are important questions to address in order to maximize the potential of AI-human collaboration.

### Summary of thoughts
