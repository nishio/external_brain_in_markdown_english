The KJ method is an information structuring methodology developed by Jiro Kawakita, which can be used to train metacognition. However, it is unclear why it is not widely used and how it can be disseminated overseas. In the "KJ Method Discussion in Problem Solving Compendium," the importance of the sense of "fit" in "group organization" is pointed out, which is related to the "pleasure response" in "Synectics" and the "felt sense" in "Focusing. In the [[Area type]] of the "NM method," it is recommended that the most distant objects be linked to each other.

Nishio's research notes provide insights into understanding and teaching the KJ method, the process of learning and practice, clarity of objectives and results, feasibility with machines, comparison with other methodologies, and learning costs. Given these considerations, it is clear that not only an understanding of the theory, but also experience and reflection through practice are important for the dissemination and education of the KJ method. It would also be useful to clarify the objectives and results of the KJ method and to understand the characteristics of the KJ method through comparison with other methodologies.

### Considerations and questions

For the dissemination and education of the KJ method, not only an understanding of the theory, but also experience and reflection through practice are considered important. However, further research is needed to determine what specific practices are necessary and what kind of reflection is effective. It is also considered useful to clarify the purpose and results of the KJ method and to understand the characteristics of the KJ method through comparison with other methodologies; however, further research is needed on what specific comparisons are effective and how to clarify the purpose and results.

The KJ method is an information structuring methodology developed by Jiro Kawakita that can be used to train metacognition. But what is the reason it is not widely used? Is it bad education, bad tools, or is it only learned through practice? What approach would be needed to disseminate it to an international audience?

According to the KJ Method Considerations for Problem Solving Compendium, the "[[nicely]] felt sense" in the "[[grouping]]" of the KJ method is important and is related to the "[[pleasure reaction]]" in "[[synectics]]" and the "[[felt sense]]" in "[[focusing]]. The "[[felt sense]]" of "[[synectics]]" and "[[focusing]]" are related to the "[[felt sense]]" of "[[synectics]]". In the [[Area type]] of the [[NMDA]], it is recommended to link the most distant objects.

Nishio's "Reasoning for the English version (chapters 4 and 5)" and "[/intellitech-en/(5.2.4.1) Group organization is not objective](https://scrapbox.io/intellitech-en/(5.2.4.1) Group organization is not objective)" are related to understanding and teaching the KJ method. The "Emulator" details the process of learning and practicing the KJ Method. The "Landing Point of the KJ Method" discusses the clarity of the KJ Method's objectives and outcomes. The "Nodes of Thought 2019-02-18" considers the possibility of a machine performing the KJ method. Diary 2022-06-04" proposes a comparison of the KJ method with other methodologies. The Cost of Learning KJ" discusses the time and effort required to learn the KJ method.

Taking this information into consideration, it is clear that not only an understanding of the theory, but also experience and reflection through practice are important for the dissemination and education of the KJ method. It would also be useful to clarify the objectives and results of the KJ method and to understand the characteristics of the KJ method through comparison with other methodologies.

In "KJ Methods Are Not Powerful Without Individual Work," the author points out the problem caused by the widespread use of KJ methods performed in groups. People who have experienced only group KJ method from the beginning will not develop the basic ability to do individual work.

### Deep thoughts and questions

- What approaches would be needed to promote these technologies to an international audience?
- How important is the sense of "fit" in the "group formation" of the KJ method?
- How might the advent of PCs and smartphones change the way the KJ method is applied?

The KJ method is a methodology developed by Jiro Kawakita for structuring large amounts of information and for training metacognition. The "Exploratory Net," which Kawakita mainly used, can be considered a practical application of the KJ method. The elements of thinking are almost identical to the KJ method, but the combinations and procedures are different. In addition, the Kozane method, an intellectual production technique for singular individuals, is considered part of the KJ method.

The first BMOT special class, "Intellectual Production," emphasizes investing in knowledge-producing techniques and confirms the usefulness of the KJ method. However, it was noted that the problem is that few people have started using the KJ method.

In "Summary of Reactions to the Intellectual Production Techniques of Engineers, Part 2," it is shown that the KJ method and abstraction are linked. In addition, the "Summary for the 2021-08-08 Kozaneba Interim Presentation" highlights the need for people overseas to use the KJ method and the Kozaneba method.

In "Knowledge, Capitalism, and the Technologist Condition," the KJ method is presented as a method for streamlining the combining of information. Also, in "Digest for Sticky Notes," the KJ method is recognized as part of an engineer's intellectual production technique.

### Deep thoughts and questions

Intellectual production techniques such as the KJ method and the Kozane method are important tools for efficient information combination and structuring. But why are these techniques not widely used? And what approaches are needed to disseminate these techniques to a foreign audience?

And while the KJ method and the Kozane method are recognized as intellectual production techniques for singular individuals, are these techniques applicable to the intellectual production of groups or entire organizations? Or are new methods and tools needed?

Further research and practice is needed to answer these questions.

The KJ method was developed by Jiro Kawakita, and its application and interpretation depends on the purpose and situation. I would like to know more about "Exploratory Net," which Kawakita primarily used. Are there other methods or tools that aid in intellectual production?

In the "Exploratory Net Study Group," "Exploratory Net" is called a practical application of the KJ Method, and Jiro Kawakita himself states that he creates about 90% of his works not using the KJ Method but using Exploratory Net. In the "KJ Method Study Group @ Cybozu," the history of the KJ Method and the diversity of its application are explained. The Kozane Method is an intellectual production technique for singular individuals, and is considered to be part of the KJ Method. In "Organizing in Reverse Chronological Order," the process of collecting materials before the KJ Method is described as a new bottleneck.

In "Exploratory Net Study Group Kozaneba4," it is stated that the elements of Exploratory Net thinking are almost identical to the KJ method, only the combinations and procedures are different. In "Be Brave to Survive the Chaos; the KJ Method is Punk!" describes KJ as a problem-solving method that is full of humanity and vitality, and has a punk spirit that destroys assumptions and biases.

In "Exploratory Net Study Group Kozaneba5," it is stated that Exploratory Net and the KJ method are twin brothers, and that the KJ method is a metacognitive exercise. In "Interesting" Exploratorium: Examples, it is stated that KJ and Kozane methods are useful but paper is expensive, and that digitization allows "connecting lines," which is difficult to do with paper.

The above information confirms that the KJ method and exploratory nets are important methods that aid in intellectual production, and that the diversity of their application and interpretation leads to ambiguity in understanding. It also confirms that the efficiency of intellectual production is increasing due to electronic production.

The KJ method, which Jiro Kawakita called the "paper-kire method," was intended to summarize large amounts of qualitative data ("the term KJ method is ambiguous"). However, in the process of teaching the KJ method, it was applied to a wide variety of purposes by Jiro Kawakita himself and others around him, and as a result, the term "KJ method in the narrow sense" came to be used to distinguish the original KJ method from these applied methods ("KJ method study group @ Loftwork_Lecture Material v1").

However, in "On the Correctness of the KJ Method," he states that the goal is not to do the KJ method correctly, but to choose the appropriate means to achieve the goal. Also, 90% of the diagrams created by Jiro Kawakita were not created using the KJ method, but using the "exploratory net.

In "Beyond the KJ Method," Jiro Kawakita shows how the KJ method has changed over time and has been applied to a wide variety of purposes. While many people recognize the KJ method as an activity in which a large number of people write down and summarize information on sticky notes, Jiro Kawakita himself stated that undesirable compromises can occur if a person does it alone first and does not have sufficient maturity in his/her abilities.

From this information, we can draw the conclusion that the KJ method is one method, its application and interpretation depends on individual objectives and situations, and that there are other methods as well as the KJ method, and it is important to select and use them appropriately.

### Considerations and questions

The diversity of applications and interpretations of the KJ method demonstrates the flexibility and broad applicability of the method, but also seems to introduce ambiguity in its definition and understanding. What impact does this have on the teaching and dissemination of the KJ method?

I would also like to know more about the specific methods and effectiveness of the "exploratory nets" that Jiro Kawakita primarily used. what are the differences between the KJ method and exploratory nets, and what are the situations and purposes for which each is appropriate?

Furthermore, are there other methods and tools besides KJ-method and Expedition Net that aid intellectual production? Can those methods and tools be combined with the KJ method and Expedition Net to make intellectual production more effective?
