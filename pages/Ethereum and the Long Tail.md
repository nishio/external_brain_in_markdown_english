[[Ethereum]] and [[long tail]]
- The "no killer app" and "helps the long tail" that came out of this.
    - [Ethereum founder: "Blockchain is a magic computer" | Nikkei Book Plus](https://bookplus.nikkei.com/atcl/column/021700205/021700002/)
- The emergence of [[ethereum]] appears to be a no-brainer, as it will be implemented at a cost in areas where high demand can be expected.
- Lower [[infrastructure costs]] will allow for the emergence of things we haven't seen yet on the periphery that haven't received much attention.
    - What was ignored because demand and cost did not seem to match is now being realized
    - This is "something that is not recognized as being in high demand at this time," so there is no way to answer the question of what the killer app is at this time.
        - [[What does electricity do for you?]]

- Predictability of demand
    - In the graph, demand is drawn as a simple line for pictorial reasons, but of course it is not possible to predict accurately in advance, so the line will be wide and blurred.
        - The same thing can be estimated higher or lower by different people.
    - Therefore, after a product is made, its value is often evaluated as "this is surprisingly convenient," and demand often increases later.
        - [[Easier to evaluate after results are achieved]].
        - That a killer app can be created after the fact.
        - When computers were created, it was unforeseeable that software services would be created that would be used by billions of people around the world
    - The act of trying to get attention by talking about an idea while the thing is not yet ready may be a streak in this composition.
        - It's faster to talk about an idea and get feedback than to build it and get feedback, so they gravitate to that.
            - But in this composition, if you talk about an idea and get positive feedback, it's not the right answer.
                - [[Distracted by fast feedback]]
            - [[Ideas without implementation are no longer needed.]]
        - Trying to talk about an idea without implementation takes away from creating something "humble, but not yet, and beneficial when it can be done".
