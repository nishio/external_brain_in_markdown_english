- For daily commuting
- Completely waterproof, so your electronic equipment is safe even if you encounter a guerrilla downpour
- I used to have a 20L in a similar color (from 6/25/2013) I replaced it because it was sore after 4 years of use (I stepped on the metal fittings of the waist belt with a chair and destroyed it).

- I don't commute anymore, so it's less frequent.
