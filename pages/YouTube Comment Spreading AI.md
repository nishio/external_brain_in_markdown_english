title: "YouTube Comment Spreading AI"

- GitHub Actions looks better than adding functionality to the [[public information AI]] UI
- It would be easier for non-engineers to do the analysis if you put the YouTube URL in the UI.
- However, a human being should not perform the routine task of "starting analysis of videos on the target channel after a certain period of time has elapsed since their release" in the first place.
- In any case, it is essential to turn on [[YouTube Data API]] in GCP and do some other engineering work.
