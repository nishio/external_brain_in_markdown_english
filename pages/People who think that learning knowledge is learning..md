> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1904040218703065176) Someone who does online education was worried that if he gave a test with different numerical values from the problems he did in math class, he would get complaints that "I didn't learn it" or "the numerical values are wrong". The approach of acquiring the ability to solve unknown concrete problems by acquiring abstract problem-solving methods seems to be rather poorly understood.

- [[problem-solving ability]]
- [[abstracted problem solving]].
        - [[manner of solving]]
        - [[model]]
- [[Ability to solve unknown specific problems]].
    - [[unknown problem]].
        - [[problem for which there is no answer]]
    - Acquire the ability to solve unknown concrete problems by acquiring [[problem-solving mechanisms]] that have been [[abstraction]].
