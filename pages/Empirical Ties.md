<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The "experiential nexus" is one of the key concepts that characterize the [[pragmatism]] worldview.

Pragmatists do not see the relationships between the elements that make up the world as [[a priori]] and absolute, but as practical [[connections]] that are [[confirmed through]] experience. In other words, [[the relationships between things]] are functional bonds [[found in]] our concrete [[experiences]].

For example, [[cause and effect relationships]] are derived inductively from the succession of events we observe in our daily lives and are not determined a priori. Also, [[the similarity of things]] is based on the practical commonalities we find in our experiences.

Thus, the pragmatist asserts that the unity of the world is secured not by a priori principles, but by [[a network of]] relationships [[found empirically]]. This position is in contrast to the [[rationalist]] view of the world, which seeks absolute unity.

In a modern context, this emphasis on experience can be seen in [[attempts to gain insight from empirical data]], such as [[inductive approaches]] based on [[big data]] and analysis of complex network structures. Pragmatism's concept of "empirical connections" may be said to have been a precursor to the modern way of thinking about the world as "flexible and dynamic.
