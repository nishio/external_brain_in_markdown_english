<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The parable of the "laborers in the vineyard" is commonly used to refer to "[[the parable of]] the laborers in the vineyard," as described in [[the New Testament]]. This parable is interpreted in Christianity as a sign of God's fairness and grace in heaven.

The parable is as follows:

- One morning the landlord goes to the market to hire workers for his vineyard. He hires the first workers with the promise that they will work for one denarius for one day. But in the middle of the day, the landlord goes to the market again, and again, and again, and hires additional workers. Then, in the evening, the landlord again went to the market and hired workers who could only work for a few hours.

- When it came time to pay the wages, the landlord began paying the last workers he hired and gave them one denarius. The workers, who had been working since the morning, expected that they would receive more. But they, too, received only one denarius. They complained, but the landlord said, "Did I not make a contract with you for one denarius? It is not unjust to use what is mine at my will. Why should you feel bad because I do something good in front of you?" I replied.

This parable conveys a message about God's grace and fairness. It illustrates the idea that heaven is not a reward based on effort or merit, but on God's grace, and that God can freely bestow that grace.

This story teaches that while people may feel jealous and complain about the grace and favor from God of others, in reality God's grace is infinite and our entitlement to receive it is not based on our effort or time.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Of course, the Tannisho is one of the documents that summarize the teachings of [[Shinran (third highest of the eight hereditary titles)]], the founder of the [[Jodo Shinshu (offshoot of the Jodo sect)]] in Japan. The Tannisho is said to have been written by Yui En, a disciple of Shinran.

Akkinin Shoki-setsu is one of Shinran's central teachings in Tannisho. This theory holds that evil people are the most appropriate subjects for "shōki," or rebirth in the Pure Land.

The core of Shinran's teaching is based on the recognition that it is extremely difficult to achieve Buddhahood, or attain Buddhahood, on one's own, and that it is almost impossible for us to attain enlightenment on our own. Therefore, Shinran taught that rebirth in the Pure Land (Osho) is possible only through the wish of Amida Buddha (the vow of the Pure Land).

Based on this idea, it was believed that evil people were the ones who truly needed Amida Buddha's salvation, and therefore they were the "righteous ones" for rebirth in the Pure Land. Only those who deeply repent of their evil and recognize the impossibility of salvation by their own strength can truly accept Amida Buddha's salvation.

This theory of the righteousness of the wicked emphasizes the importance of being deeply aware of one's sins and vexations, and the importance of being grateful for the blessings of Amida Buddha's unconditional salvation. Shinran's teaching carries a message of hope that no matter how sinful we are and how much we are trapped by our vexations, salvation is possible through Amida Buddha's vow.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Although the Parable of the Laborers in the Vineyard and the theory of the Righteousness of the Evil One are different concepts that come from the teachings of Christianity and Jodo Shinshu, respectively, common themes and values can be found in them. Let us examine the relationship between the two below.

Unconditional grace and salvation:.
- In the Parable of the Laborers in the Vineyard, the fact that the landlord pays everyone the same salary regardless of which worker worked how many hours suggests that God's grace is unconditional, not based on effort or merit.
- The theory of "the righteousness of the wicked" also indicates that no matter how sinful a person is, he or she is promised to be reborn in the Pure Land through Amida Buddha's vow, which also indicates unconditional salvation.

Recognition of one's own inability:.
- Among the laborers in the vineyard, those who worked early on saw the value in their labor and expected to be paid more. From God's perspective, however, the length and quality of their labor is not a condition for receiving grace.
- In the theory of the righteousness of the wicked, one must also recognize one's own evil and impotence and understand that one's own salvation is impossible. This recognition of one's own impotence is the attitude that seeks true salvation.

Jealousy and comparison nonsense:.
- The workers in the vineyard are frustrated because of comparisons with other workers. However, this parable shows that such comparisons and jealousy are meaningless before God's grace.
- The theory of the righteousness of the wicked also shows the meaninglessness of comparison with others and having a sense of superiority. True salvation lies in a deep awareness of one's own inability and belief in the vow of the Pure Land.

These considerations indicate that Christianity and Jodo Shinshu share the idea of unconditional grace and salvation that is not based on human effort or values. Both teachings emphasize the importance of being free from human values and social standards, and of truly believing and accepting the infinite grace and vows of God and Buddha.
