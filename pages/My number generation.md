> The Problem of Subjectivity Part Over The “Restrictions on the Provision of Specific Personal Information” on the Act on the Use of Numbers to Identify a Specific Individual in the Administrative Procedure
> Yoichiro Itakura, Asuke Terada
> The Act on the Use, etc. of Numbers to Identify Specific Individuals in Administrative Procedures (Act No. 27 of 2013) restricts the provision of specific personal information (Article 19, Pillar 1 of the Act). Since the Law on the Use of Personal Identification Numbers is a type of administrative regulation, in principle, the subjective aspect is not an issue in the violation of this article, but it is said that specified personal information includes the personal number itself, and if interpreted literally, simply stating a random 12-digit number would be illegal, and reading out all 12 digits would be an enormous illegal act. If all 12 digits are read out loud, it would be an enormous amount of illegal activity. Such an interpretation is too far removed from reality, but in the absence of a requirement for a subjective aspect, we will consider how far we can place a limit on illegality.

I was going to make a file with all of them and say, "If you can arrest me, do it", but the legal risk seems serious.

> As described above, it is illegal to post a 12-digit number, which is a personal number, on the Internet regardless of whether there is negligence or not. In addition, an administrative penalty is theoretically possible. It could also result in a claim for damages from the person in question or a breach of the representations and warranties clause, which is undeniably distortionary.

This issue should not be reduced to a question of whether or not the Personal Information Protection Commission should enforce the law.
>  This means that if pi is displayed with a large number of digits, if someone's personal number happens to be hit, that's it, you're out.

> [Archangel_HT](https://x.com/Archangel_HT/status/1860171111016857875) On the other hand, it might be possible to raise a legislative issue by naming names and doing it in a dignified manner (of course, consult with a lawyer in advance so that if there is any problem, he/she can respond immediately). (Of course, you should consult with a lawyer in advance so that he/she can respond immediately if something happens).

> [yayoi_mizuha](https://x.com/yayoi_mizuha/status/1860688516700856758) I made a program to generate all my numbers, it can run fast using GPU. (Actually, storage is the bottleneck)(theoretically it needs 13TB). Please try to generate it and turn in to the police.
