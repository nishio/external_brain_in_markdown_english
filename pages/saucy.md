title: "saucy"

> [nagise](https://x.com/nagise/status/1797907000300581009) One word I don't use intentionally is "cocky", which is a word that only comes up if you [[contempt]] the other person.
>  I didn't want to be treated that way as a boy, and that's why I made cockiness a banned word.

> [onishi_feuer](https://x.com/onishi_feuer/status/1797916367452266742) I liked being called "sassy" so I have some good impressions.
>  (Probably because most of the main characters in shounen manga are told this, the nuance of "cocky = awesome for a young guy, [[potential to make it big]]" has been imprinted on them.)
>  But I don't use it in reality.

I like the latter interpretation.
