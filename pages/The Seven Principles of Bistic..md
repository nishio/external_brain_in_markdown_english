Biestek's seven principles are the basic principles of the helping relationship in social welfare [[casework]] (Felix P. Biestek, The Casework Relationship, 1957).

    - [[individualization]] : Understanding and responding to each person as a unique entity.
- [Intentional acceptance of emotional expression: Intentional encouragement and acceptance of emotional expression.
- [[Controlled Emotional Involvement]]: Empathically involved, yet professionally emotionally controlled.
    - [[reception]]: Accepting the client as he/she is, without assigning value.
- [[non-judgmental attitude]]: no judging or labeling of right and wrong.
- [Respect for self-determination: Leave choices and decisions to the individual and support his/her ability to make them.
- [Confidentiality: Protect information obtained (with legal exceptions such as crisis avoidance)

*Also called "bistick" or "[[bistick]]" in Japanese.
