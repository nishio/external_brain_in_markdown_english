[[The Fulfilled and the Hungry]]

volunteer group

One person had a very negative view of volunteer groups in general
- This seems like an excessive abstraction.
    - [[permissionless]]

Same permission-less, but with a difference.
- Percentage of "crazy people" called in

Where is the [[source of value]]?
- A group of people who are their own source and are willing to create even greater value by combining their output with each other.
- People who think they can take something from the place.
    - For example, attention, respect, admiration...
- [There are people who want to contribute but don't know how.
    - These cases are win-win if you can provide the opportunity well
    - Some people do [[boost contribution opportunities]].
        - Give me the opportunity to contribute in a way that I can easily contribute and be admired by those around me."

Roughly proportional skin feel
- 30 out of 1000 can run on their own.
- By creating opportunities for these 30 people to contribute, 300 people can contribute.
- There is value in people who can run themselves getting to know each other.
    - [[Building Human Networks]]
- 300 people may not be working full time, but it's like the emergence of one small business with 100~200 people.
    - This effect is very significant.
    - Not everyone can do it, but the top charisma effect
- There are about three "crazy" people.
    - Just one person has a negative impact on about 100 people.
    - I think we have no choice but to expel them.

60% of Homo sapiens are takers.
- Percentage depends on the range of observation
    - Some may say, "Nishio's estimate is wrong," and the number itself has no deeper meaning since it is not clear where to draw the boundary between giver and taker in the first place.
- Givers are getting together in givers because they're worn out when they're surrounded by takers.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/567efc1f233ce83d53c5bbdaab6dce57/thumb/1000)
- People who grew up in a giver group overestimate the percentage of givers.
- People who are not allowed in the giver group underestimate the percentage of givers.

[[plan to achieve distant goals]].

suggestion
    - [[The social network that keeps escaping]]
        - [[Move the good stuff.]]
- [Communities tend to become an end in itself.
    - Project teams are disbanded when finished.
        - [[Community as a bundle of projects]]
- Personally, I thought that the purpose-oriented organization for the Upper House should be disbanded after the Upper House election, but it pivoted to a nullification and became a fan group positioned as a fan group.
    - That's being utilized, and I think it's swell.
    - There was a bit of confusion during the pivot period, including a loss of purpose.
    - [[Strong and wide groups]]
