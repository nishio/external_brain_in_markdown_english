Should I go slinging mud to establish a track record?
- This is due to a difference in perception of "performance" in the first place.
    - If you start a business and create software and it is not adopted and closed, whether you consider this an achievement or not varies from person to person.
        - The objective fact is that they did it.
        - Different people see the value of the act as high or low.
    - Viewpoints of those who do not evaluate
        - Customers are not following.
            - Not made available for continuity.
            - Failure to build a system that creates value on an ongoing basis.
        - Failure to implement in society.
            - Possible miscommunication with society
        - Since social implementation has not been achieved, this person's "ability to make social implementation happen" as an entrepreneur is lacking.

    - On the other hand, there are perspectives that find value
        - If you start a business and fail, it means that you "tried what could fail" and that means you learned more than those who don't try because they are afraid of failure!
        - I've come this far without being able to find an idea to start my own business, while watching my unexplored peers and juniors start their own businesses, so I believe that everyone who has started a business has something that I don't have.
        - On the other hand, since the axis is outside the entrepreneurial community, we know that most people outside the community do not see value in what the entrepreneurial community thinks is "valuable"
            - Similar to how people outside of academia don't see the value in "writing a paper".
        - I also think it's dangerous that VCs in particular have an incentive to dye naive young people with values that are convenient for them.
            - Not everyone has the best intentions.

- Even the term "slurping mud" is open to interpretation.
    - How big or small is one's psychological cost of doing mud?
        - If the cost feels too great, then it can't pay for itself.
        - If the cost is not that great, you should go for the results even if you have to pay for them.
        - This is also subjective to the player himself
    - It is one's ability to say that one does not feel the cost is too high for the same action.
        - It is one drawback to say that one feels more costly than others for the same action
        - Nevertheless, I believe that this cost perception is strongly coupled to the individual and is not something that can be changed by others.
- So, personally, I can understand both sides of the argument, but even if one person feels that they are going about it in a way that is out of line with another person, if that person doesn't think it's out of line, then they should do what they want to do and the person should learn from the results of that.
    - Whether the approach makes sense or not is also influenced by the subjective values of each individual.
    - It's not for other people to say.
    - [[Let the market do the criticizing.]]
- In that sense, one could say, "[Negotiations are beneficial, but advice is futile.

- [[proven or not proven is a false dichotomy]].

- One is not enough.
        - [[Make three.]]
