title: "Pitch a big tent."

[[The Rails Doctrine]]
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT-4/icon' alt='GPT-4.icon' height="19.5"/>The following is a summary of the principle of "pitching the big tent"
- Rails embraces people with many different ideas and respects each of them. It is not necessary for everyone to fully adhere to all principles at all times.
- We need a diversity of different opinions, ideas and people. From these "melting pots" come the best ideas that can be shared by all.
- While this principle paints an ideal picture, the day-to-day reality is much more subtle and interesting: Rails has too few or no indicator tests to support a large community under one tent.
- Even if your thinking is completely different, your ideas and accomplishments can develop and thrive. That is the most important point.
- Pitching a big tent does not mean trying to be all things to all people. It just means welcoming everyone to your party and allowing them to bring their own drinks.
- Welcoming people requires effort. This is especially true when the goal is not only to attract more people like those who are part of the community. Working to lower barriers to participation should always be taken seriously.
- The next person who implements the next big feature might start by simply correcting a typo in the documentation first. If you smile and show appreciation for any small contribution, you may have that chance.
