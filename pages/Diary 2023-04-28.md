One of the things my wife taught me, who has poor task management skills, is to manage tasks on paper.
- Why is this good?
- The bottom line is that the burden of the task is visualized by the number of sheets of paper.
- I'm not sure why I thought that, because I have six notes on my desk that clearly need to be organized.
- In other words, if you're in that kind of situation, you decide that new stimuli should be suppressed for a while or something like that.
- Ultimately, training the eye on one's internal state
- If you don't notice, you can't improve.
- I don't know why there were six notes, so I sorted them out.

Oh, I thought I'd have to be careful to make my English school appointments so I don't bump into you, but it doesn't seem to be hurting you in any way.

I was having symptoms of blurry vision and difficulty seeing text, so I used a microwave to warm my eyes, and sure enough, I fell asleep and woke up at 23:00!
- I woke up and said, "No, isn't this a sleep deprivation debuff?" I was like.

Today is Friday, no English conversation school due to a prearranged meeting.
- That's part of the reason I don't get enough exercise, so I'm going to have to take a walk.
- I won't even listen to English today.

looking back
- I put in two English conversation schools every day for six consecutive days.
- To turn on the rusty English switch, you just need to turn it on every day for a week or so.
- When I was putting in a skipped schedule, I wasn't a fan of the banter at the beginning of the lesson, but in the end, I'm just looking for a conversation starter, so I don't have to answer the questions as they're asked, I can just take the wheel.
    - What's the news today?" Or, "I don't have any news, so just ask me what happened in yesterday's lesson."
    - Or, "I was reading a book today on the subject of X. We need to talk about this."
- If the other person perceives me as non-native and speaks slowly, I can have a conversation with them in a two-person conversation while still being fairly interactive.
    - In other words, conversely, it cannot be understood if
        - When the other person is speaking at native speed
        - If you're having a conversation between people other than yourself
        - If you cannot interrupt (e.g., lectures)
    - I don't think you can learn listening comprehension in these cases by going to an English conversation school.
        - I was wondering what I should do, but it seems like a good idea to have independent hearings with several experienced people on this matter.

Conversation Skills
- Even if you have a huge amount of thoughts, you need to narrow down what you say because you are limited by the other person's capacity and your own ability to verbalize them in English.
- What's your research?
    - When I was in the doctral course, my major was the visualization of high dimension data.
    - Currently I'm interested in the visualization of the thought of handreds of people.
    - For those who don't have background knowledge, this is about the best explanation to start with.

About the Weekly Journal and Diary
- There were times when the diary was blank.
- Sometimes the diary is full.
- After all, the environment that surrounds us changes, so the vessel that accepts it must also change, right?
- When I didn't have a diary, my weekly journal was like, "If you don't write at least once a week, you won't know what you did at the end of the year."
- When there is a diary, there is a sense of "it's already written."
    - In the short term, I'm not sure I'll "need" to do without.
    - But on the other hand, it becomes, "If you don't summarize at least once a week, you'll have too much information at the end of the year!"
        - This value will not be known until the end of the year, so a short-term perspective overlooks it.

Writing a weekly journal is beneficial
- By getting away from the day-to-day perspective and looking at it from the perspective of the weekly review, "Then maybe we should do this." or something like that.
- It is not clear what gives rise to this idea.
    - It's created by the workings of the deep recesses of the brain that are not verbalized.
    - Ideas generated
        - Create a Twitter account called JapanPolis and link Polis information with the question text in Japanese.
    - [The process of creation is a language that can be used to
        - I took a leisurely 20 minute bath and organized my weekly journal.
    - Subsequent thoughts
        - Better to create a hashtag than an account.
        - The account is
            - And I was about to write the difference here and said, "No, why don't we just make both?" and then I realized
        - Account is [[cold start]].
            - I was going to write that this is the problem.
        - Hashtags can connect tweets bottom up, but there is no place to put aggregate

vision
- To increase opportunities to experience Polis (and other broad listening technologies) in Japanese
