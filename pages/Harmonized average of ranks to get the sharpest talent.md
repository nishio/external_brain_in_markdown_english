title: "Harmonized average of ranks to get the sharpest talent"
---

When making employment selections with multiple assessors with different values
It is easier to get [[sharp and talented]] by selecting by [[harmonic mean]] of rank than by selecting by [[arithmetic mean]] of rank. #sharp and talented

- The value rank, which is [[non-linear]], has a significant impact.
    - Because of the high concentration of people around the average, the slightest difference in ability will cause a significant drop in the rankings.

- arithmetic mean
    - The additive mean places an implicit process where the difference between the 1st and 10th ranks is equal to the difference between the 10th and 19th ranks.
    - Assuming there are 100 applicants, person X who assesses that assessor A is ranked #1 and B is ranked #100, and person Y who assesses that both A and B are ranked #50, would judge Y to be superior.
    - (10, 100) and (55, 55) are equivalent.
    - Those who have sharp abilities and are highly valued only by some assessors will fall.
    - It would take a mediocre person that all assessors would consider "better than average".

- harmonic mean
    - In the case of the harmonic mean, the difference between first and second place is greater than the difference between second and last place.
    - (10, 100) and (18, 18) are about equal.
    - This results in a neat evaluation of sharp talent.

It would be interesting to compare which team performs better in [[Average orientation is the worst environment]], when selected by additive average or when selected by harmonic average. Perhaps the team selected by harmonic mean is higher. #Experiments required

- I noticed [[Reciprocal Rank Fusion]].
