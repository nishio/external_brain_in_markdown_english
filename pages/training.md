- Different people imagine different things when they think of the word "nurture."
    - A: "There is a training subject X and a mentor Y. X listens and learns from Y." Image
    - B: "Subject X will be able to collect information on his/her own and choose his/her own path".
- From Mr. B's perspective, Mr. A's "nurturing" is counterproductive because it deprives him of [decision-making opportunities

- About the subject of the training finding another consultant Z on his own.
    - Mr. B. "Very favorable."
    - Mr. A. "It's a bad practice that neglects the leadership."

- Suppose training target X has multiple advisors, Y and Z, and the advice of one advisor, Y, is completely ignored.
    - Mr. A. "It is not good that X neglected Y."
    - Mr. A. "Having more than one person to talk to is the cause of the problem, so you should limit yourself to one."
    - Mr. B: "X used his own judgment in [[selecting]] the advice. That's great."
        - If you incorporate all the advice you hear, you will not succeed.
            - It is a great growth to have [[Throwing Away Advice]] [[decision-making]].
    - Mr. B: "The problem lies on the part of Y who failed to give useful advice."
        - Single consulting partner increases the probability that you will be unlucky enough to get a consulting partner who cannot give you useful advice: [[Teacher Gacha]].
        - There is no way to know these probabilities in advance, so the only way to reduce the luck factor is to increase the number of consultants.

- case
    - I'm trying to do a project with training target X.
    - Y thought it was better to take means A for the success of that project.
    - Y advised X that "means A is good.
    - But X ignored the advice and took means B.
- Opinion of Mr. B (me)
    - When working on a type of project with uncertain outcomes, it is impossible to know in advance whether means A or means B is better.
    - Y advised that he thought "means A is better than means B."
        - This is only an interpretation.
        - There is no guarantee that it is correct.
    - X took measure B.
        - That's because X didn't agree that "means A is better."
        - Because Y failed to provide a convincing decision.
    - When Y blames X
        - Harmful because it is an action governed by the desire to "control others."
        - In this case, Y is a toxic person and should be eliminated.
