title: "Originality v.s. Top market share"
---

- There are people A who think it is good to be [[original]] and people B who think it is good to be [[market share leader]].
A does not imitate the actions of X that were done before him. Because imitation does not make one an original.
B imitates if he thinks he can [[catch-up]] and [[overtake]] by [[imitating]].
What is important to him is to get to the [[share]] top, and the order in which he starts is irrelevant.

The referenced article discusses the argument attributed to the Japanese and Chinese mentality, which I abstracted from because I thought it would create unnecessary friction in an inappropriate interpretation.
