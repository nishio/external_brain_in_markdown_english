### Summary of notes
.
A discussion of Scrapbox's English-language version, with a new idea for "writing" rather than translating using AI. However, not all articles are "wanted" to be read, and the distance from those that are "wanted" to be read is considered important. Another problem noted is that there is no way to control the quality of the translation.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The fragment "Diary 2023-09-04" is closely related to the note. The note discusses the Englishization of Scrapbox and the use of AI, while the fragment discusses how to combine Scrapbox and AI. In particular, the perspective of extending the network of knowledge by reading the network of knowledge is related to the idea of distance from the "articles to be read" in the notebook.

### Summary of thoughts
A balance between the use of AI and human thought is important for Scrapbox to be translated into English. Instead of translating all articles, only those articles that are desired to be read should be translated and their links should be guaranteed. The quality of the translation and the degree of editorial freedom must also be considered.

### Summary of notes
.

The English-language version of Scrapbox is discussed, with emphasis on communicating one's own experiences, such as the experience of letting an AI live in Scrapbox and the Polis experience report. The report also discusses texts and new modes of exchange that are considered valuable in the long term, from the perspective of one subjectivity to many, rather than subjectivity or objectivity.

### Relation to Fragment
.

The fragment "Let AI ask questions" is related to the experience of having an AI live in Scrapbox; Scrapbox currently does not have a comment function and only has the roles of reader and writer, but it is suggested that interaction could be increased by having an AI ask questions. The "agent living in Scrapbox" is also related to the experience of having an AI live in Scrapbox, and it is considered that the AI will pick up keywords and ask questions to humans.

### Deep thought
.

Having an AI live in Scrapbox could create new interactions between readers and writers, leading to deeper understanding and new perspectives. In addition, the AI could pick up keywords and ask questions of humans, which could improve the depth of information handling and understanding.

### Summary and title of discussion
.

The combination of Scrapbox and AI has the potential to contribute to knowledge sharing and deeper understanding. This is due to the creation of new interactions and improved handling of information.

### deep thinking

The translation of the Scrapbox into English is an important step in providing users with the information they need in an efficient manner. However, the approach of translating only those articles that users want to read, rather than translating all articles, raises issues of information selection and prioritization. The need to consider the quality of the translation and the degree of editorial freedom also indicates that the translation process requires an understanding of culture and context, rather than mere language conversion.

[* Summary].
A discussion of the English translation of Scrapbox is discussed: the decision to move from DeepL to GPT 3.5 to translate Scrapbox into English has been made, but some feel that there is no customer value in doing so. Instead, "writing" by GPT has been proposed. However, not all articles are "wanted" to be read, and the degree to which they can be read is considered to have no customer value in English. The real need is for some of the articles to be read, and it is suggested that the surrounding articles be "readable" based on those articles. Also, although the DeepL translation has brought the number of articles from 0 to 1, the missing piece is whether the translated "articles you want to read" are really of a quality that will be read.


### nishio/🔁Nodal point of thought on Scrapbox Englishization

 [You may read] 

To translate this Japanese Scrapbox into English.
Already realized at DeepL
I, the customer, don't feel I have customer value.
I wouldn't be too sad if the English version or the translated program disappeared.
Not the right product if it is

GPT makes you "write" instead of "translate into English".
This is a great idea.
[An experiment in having GPT create blog posts].
 [Blog post generation experiment from Scrapbox] 
 [AI Shaman] 
Useful descriptions can be refined even from fragmented descriptions.

Why haven't we introduced that?
Unlanguageized discomfort
Not all articles are "wanted" to be read in the first place.
The degree to which it is acceptable to read
There is no customer value for me, the customer, whether I can read the article in English or not.
What are the real needs?
That a very small percentage of the articles you want to read will be read.
You can use that as a base from which to "read" the surrounding articles."
If I cut out the information from the Scrapbox and scribbled it into a blog post, I would not be able to communicate it as a network of knowledge, which I find valuable.

Links that are connected on Scrapbox should be connected.
Individual guarantees are most important.
If 100% is difficult, it should be guaranteed from the most important part.
So what is "important"?
That's how far we're from "articles we want you to read."

 　　Write your thoughts?
 　　People don't react to everything they read either.
 　Give prompts for project objectives, etc.?
 　I should make a script to run this locally before I automate it...

 [Blog text generation instead of translation] 
 How about an agent who reads this Scrapbox and blogs about his/her impressions, rather than translating or blog writing?
 　Sometimes he throws out questions.
 	If your impressions are good enough to write in Japanese, you can have them written in English.

### nishio/engineer's intellectual production English project

　Translation is required in advance because the title and links have to be determined.
　When a page is displayed, it must link to a translated page and a page originally in English.

　What they value is "connection.
　	There are two kinds.
	　	Connections that help me think
　		Connections that help readers read and understand
		The former "connection for me" is the more valuable "connection"
			The latter "connection for the reader's understanding" cannot achieve its purpose if it is machine-generated in large quantities.
				It should be a small number of useful links that have gone through a selection process by the author.
			The former connection for me is beneficial in making sure I don't overlook the latter connection option
		With that in mind, it is better to merge the Scrapbox project in terms of providing a connection for authors
In light of this previous discussion.
　Machine translation results should go into Scrapbox instead of caching machine translation results in Firebase and mem displaying link joins

 　　On the other hand, what I'm trying to do now is to present a table of contents to the reader based on the assumption that all the content is on Scrapbox.
　 There is certainly a difference between capturing only the inductive path of content and capturing the entire content.[/villagepump/takker.icon]
 The concept of "link" in Scrapbox, if you ask 100 people who have no experience with Scrapbox, more than 90 of them will think it's a one-way link.
 So in that sense, Scrapbox is an "easy to create two-way links" system.
 　It's hard to represent bidirectional links in a tool that is primarily one-way links, so it's not going to get done.
 [Japanese translation of Scrapbox Reader https://scrapbox--reader--nishio-vercel-app.translate.goog/nishio/(6.2.4)_Parable,_metaphor,_analogy?_x_tr_sl=en &_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US&_x_tr_pto=wapp]
		I'm using Scrapbox Reader to display the human translation of "The Art of Intellectual Production by Engineers" in Scrapbox, and then using Google Translate to convert it into Japanese.
		　The logic is that publishers complain when the content of a book is put directly on the Web, but they cannot prohibit users from reading English content translated by machine.
　　I have Vercel configured to return responses without blocking, so "loading" appears in the translation results.
