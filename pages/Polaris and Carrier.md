- [[Top of the pyramid]] is like the North Star, a guide to the direction we should go.
This is not a strict determination of the path to be followed.
Sometimes you will encounter obstacles as you walk.
Sometimes you may discover an unexpected oasis in a direction slightly off from the direction you are traveling.
Sometimes it is more beneficial to turn than to keep going straight.
If you know which way is north when you turn, you can go farther in the long run.
