    - The decisions, the money flow, the process.
    - We walk with transparency, integrity, and trust.

    - The other parties and politicians are all friends who will create the future of Japan.
    - We look for areas where we can cooperate and proceed together.
- We will not [[incite division]].
    - We speak with data and facts, not emotion.
    - [Suggestion rather than criticism. [Solution rather than division.

    - [[There is more than one correct answer.]]
    - We listen to diverse voices and are flexible to improve if there is a better answer.
