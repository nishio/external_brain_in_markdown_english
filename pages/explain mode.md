        - When I'm writing for a one-person project, I often don't explain what I know about it.
        - It's as if trying to explain something switches my state of mind and causes a different [[chemical reaction]] in my mind than when I'm writing alone.
        - I think it's basically good to remove [[Unnecessary Constraints]] in putting into words what hasn't been put into words yet, but sometimes things are created by constraints, right, at what point should we switch?

- [[Questions encourage verbalization.]]

this (indicating an item near the speaker, the action of the speaker, or the current topic)

- It's come up in the past.
    - Memories drawn on paper notepads

- [[Digging deeper with questions]]
- [[Dig deeper as needed]]
- [[Whether or not to connect the islands]]

There it is.
- [[People who memorize the whole thing can't dig in.]]
