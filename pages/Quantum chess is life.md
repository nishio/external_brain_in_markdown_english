title: "Quantum chess is life"
---

- [[quantum chess]] is [[(human) life (i.e., conception to death)]].
- At first, all 20 pieces are equally indeterminate, but the first one to act as a flying car will become a flying car. The one who did not move until the end usually becomes a pawn.
- The player wishes to keep as many [[possibilities]] as possible, but with each move forward, the number of possibilities decreases rapidly.
- To maximize potential is to do as little as possible. But that strategy will not win.
- If we are proactive without fear of narrowing the possibilities, we can obtain new possibilities (pieces).
- Life indeed.
