> [asami81](https://twitter.com/asami81/status/1738012426489229642) Today from 6:30pm to 10pm in Shibuya, there will be a drinking party for "people who have been using the internet for about 20 years" (a name I just gave myself).
>  We have about 30 participants now, but there are still about 5 people who can join us! If you want to go, please DM me. If you have not been online for 20 years or more, but have been online for 30 years or more, that's OK too.
> [asami81](https://twitter.com/asami81/status/1738029783823568913) [[Internet Senior Citizens Association]] is the one I was going to say but didn't. www.

> [amachang](https://twitter.com/amachang/status/1738014683918107083) Year-end party today. I'm looking forward to seeing nagayama after a long time!
>  If you're not invited, please contact me so I can jump in.

> [fshin2000](https://twitter.com/fshin2000/status/1738031654273433823) It is a drinking party of divine development that I initiated and asked amachang to manage!

> [Yappo](https://twitter.com/Yappo/status/1738180355029614935) I'm at the second one of the first Twitter offline ones held in Japan.
- By the second, Twitter was X'd out.
- X will be gone by the third installment.

- The [[Space Market]] system, which seems to be the most efficient, is good because anyone can open the doors just by giving their number.

    - It was spacious.
    - Mysterious simulation golf space

- Somehow, unbeknownst to both of us, we found ourselves out of the X DM group.
- Not sure why they both left.
- And then the secretary arrived with drinks and food in a car.

> [mizchi](https://twitter.com/mizchi/status/1738197346046058560) Note: I've been reading about how AI code generation is an implementation/testing/documentation trinity, and that implementing any two will bury one, while implementing only one will fail due to self-bias and over I'm writing that article because of the popularity of the story about failure in learning.

> [tkihira](https://twitter.com/tkihira/status/1738371566105440554/photo/1) with @fshin2000 yesterday. We got some very good wine and drank so much that we got drunk for the first time in a long time!

> [asami81](https://twitter.com/asami81/status/1738369578143789286/photo/1) The party was too much fun. I'll send the photos to the participants later, but for now, I'll just post the photos that were allowed to be X-posted after the engineers made a big fuss about "this lineup is bad!

>  Yellow: me

> [asami81](https://twitter.com/asami81/status/1738375643396808773/photo/1) What I found out is that it is so much easier to pay the bill for a drinking party where people who have sold companies or have tens of millions of dollars in annual income are all around. I was ready to make a huge deficit after buying too much at Costco, but I was almost red-free...adult, cool!
>
>  I know you all thanked me, but I am also grateful for the experience of buying at Costco!

> [mayumine](https://twitter.com/mayumine/status/1738204444012237311/photo/1) I'm doing the after party one of the internet senior citizen group. (Express Shonan is the best.) It was fun!
>  @asami81 and @amachang Thanks!
