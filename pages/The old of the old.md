- An [[old person]] who has made [[comments made by an elderly person]] and can look back and say, "I made a bad comment," is a better elderly person. An old person who has lost the ability to even recognize that he or she is making a comment [[err and not change one's ways, this is what it is to err]] in the sense of [[problems caused by the elderly (esp. gerontocracy, and elderly people's control over the young)]] of the elderly.
