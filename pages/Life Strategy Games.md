title: "Life Strategy Games"

- I think it would be a good idea to make [[Life Strategies]] a worker placement type game.
- Players are given a certain number of tokens each turn (time)
    - Three tokens, for example.
- Placement of this
    - Going part-time gets you money.
    - Paying to go to school gives you skills.
        - There are about A to J skill places and you can decide where to put one point.
        - D. degree if you accumulate a certain number of specific skills.
    - Employment (fixed term/permanent) remains token placed unless expiration, termination, or other reason occurs
        - Post is naturally limited.

- stock (company)
    - You get 1 gold every round (dividend)
    - The first purchase is fixed at some higher amount.
    - After that, auction at the timing when someone wants to sell.
- heritage
    - There is a difference in the initial starting amount.
    - Those who drew the "Heritage" card start with money.
        - However, a catastrophe occurs in the middle of the game
        - Like incarceration.
        - I hear the shares go to zero.
    - class card
        - Gain +1 knowledge tokens only 3 times during the game
    - non-production class card
        - Instead of giving nothing, the victory condition changes to "not being the last one".

- Chance Card
    - Or a project generation that only people with certain skills can participate in.
