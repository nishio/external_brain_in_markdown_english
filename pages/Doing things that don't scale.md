「 [[scale]] しないことをやる」って言葉だけだと文脈がいまいちわかりづらいよなと思ってた。これは4ページの漫画で説明されていてわかりやすいと思う<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

Let's do what doesn't scale" is not "don't do what does scale."
- If you can [[scale]], of course you should do it.
- The story is that the decision to "not do it because it doesn't scale" is a fallacy.
    - Thinking, "Let's just do what scales," leads to thin relationships.
            - [[Trade-off between depth and breadth of cooperation]] : The wider the breadth, the thinner the trade-off.
    - It is more beneficial to build "deeper relationships" that do not scale first

[[meeting the user]].
- When I saw [[Takahiro Yasuno]] meeting and listening to voters in the [[Tokyo Gubernatorial Election 2024]], I thought "Oh, this is "doing things that don't scale", "going to meet users"".
