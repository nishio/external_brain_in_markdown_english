        - My first encounter with [Drucker.
        - I must have read it in college, but I don't remember anything about it.
            - > like reading a textbook on a sport you've never experienced.
        - I read it again when I was put in charge of my parents' business, but it didn't ring a bell.
        - When I read it again when I had almost 100 employees, I had a different impression.
            - A sense of crisis where failure is fatal
            - > Drucker explains what I have been doing theoretically and clearly.
            - There is a posteriori verbalization occurring for the experience.
- The lead role is "[[knowledge worker]]."
    - [[Businesses are public institutions of society]].
