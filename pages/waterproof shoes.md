- 25.0cm
    - I was unsure about the 25.5cm, but the 25.0cm had a better overall fit
    - Decided to wear them for a while and if there is a problem, I can buy 25.5.

[[Vibram Fivefingers]] were easy to get wet in the rain, and I didn't want to get my feet wet in the winter because of the stones, so I wore waterproof shoes, but they got ragged, so I bought a new pair.
- Waterproof for 6 hours in water 5cm from the sole
- My previous shoes were shinier, but that part of the shoe has deteriorated and peeled off, making it look shabby.

- 2025-09-13 At 6 months, I started getting my sock toes wet just by wearing them on a normal rainy day!
