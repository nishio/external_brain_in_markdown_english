[[Vibram Fivefingers]] were easy to get wet in the rain, and I didn't want to get my feet wet in the winter because of the stones, so I wore waterproof shoes, but they got ragged, so I bought a new pair.
- Waterproof for 6 hours in water 5cm from the sole
- My previous shoes were shinier, but that part of the shoe has deteriorated and peeled off, making it look shabby.
