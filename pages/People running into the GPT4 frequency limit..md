## Account management is a hassle
.
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1647062662759714816) It just occurred to me that regardless of the fact that you're using so much that you're running out of your daily allotment and you feel it's worth it to use it, it's strange that you don't want to buy additional It's a strange behavior > who is running into the GPT4 frequency limit.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1647063030767968256) If this were an onigiri, it would be natural to say "one is not enough" and "let's buy another one", but what is the reason for not behaving like that?
- > [ringo](https://twitter.com/ringo/status/1647065786144665604) Because you don't need account management to buy onigiri?
- > [arinco2023](https://twitter.com/arinco2023/status/1647069708112519168) I bought two of these, but I can't carry over the conversation history.

## Simply not enough money
> [@sizzuneko](https://twitter.com/sizzuneko/status/1647143457947889665?s=20): simply not enough money?
> The average amount of pocket money spent by company employees was 38,642 yen (down 68 yen from the previous year), while the average amount of pocket money spent by female company employees was 33,278 yen (down 1,120 yen from the previous year)

- > [@sizzuneko](https://twitter.com/sizzuneko/status/1647144315142148096?s=20): how to spend your allowance.
- >  "Lunch" cost 9,444 yen, "Cell phone" cost 6,230 yen, and "Hobbies" cost 11,063 yen.
- > So it seems, I guess I'll have to use it for hobby expenses, but it seems like a fair burden.

> [TakashiSasaki](https://twitter.com/TakashiSasaki/status/1647064228950585344) If it's work, you haven't finished the procedures to pay out as business in the new year. If it's not work, you simply don't have enough spending money. Even if you value it, you can only spend it within your allowance if your spouse does not value it.
- > [TakashiSasaki](https://twitter.com/TakashiSasaki/status/1647064536284024836) This also means that if I buy another one today, I will have no onigiri tomorrow unless you raise the cost of lunch per day. That's hard. That's hard.

- > [TakashiSasaki](https://twitter.com/TakashiSasaki/status/1647065772559302656) Well, you just have to earn enough to convince them in the first place, so you are responsible for your own lack of resources.

- So if there's a [[cap on disposable income]], the transaction doesn't take place even if the person feels [[effect]].
