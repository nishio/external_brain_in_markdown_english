title: "Words as Public Goods English Replay(WIP)"

This is a replay of the different presentations at the event in ~.
This event was conducted in Japanese, as most of the audience was Japanese.
But in essence, it is not limited to Japan, but is aimed at speakers of many minority languages
So I made an English audio version.
The intended audience is minority language speakers who are not native English speakers, and the GPT-4 allows them to translate using simple vocabulary and a synthesized voice without an accent for ease of listening
