        - Through extreme examples, this expression presents the perspective that political participation is not always peaceful and orderly, but also includes violent actions and revolutions.
        - Historically, there are many examples of people or specific groups of people resisting governments or authorities by force or violence and overthrowing them, such as the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Russian Revolution]]. In these cases, [[acts of violence]] can be seen as a kind of "[[political expression]]" that served as a means for people dissatisfied with the regime to act in search of a new order.
        - In other words, the interpretation is that political participation is not necessarily only through elections and debates, but in a broader sense also includes acts of protest against the system and calls for change. This statement is an example of the diversity of political actions and how resistance to power can be manifested.
    - It's no surprise that young people don't see the point in voting in the context of [[silver democracy]].
        - [[Righteous bandits could become popular among young people.]]
        - There is a cultural climate in which righteousness is considered social justice.
    - I would like to avoid a society in which violence and fraud against the elderly are considered social justice.
        - We need to create better channels for the use of force to achieve this.
                - [[technological use of force]]

- [[young man]]'s [[political participation]].
