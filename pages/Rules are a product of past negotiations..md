- [[Rules are the product of negotiation.]]
- Unlike [[natural laws]], rules are man-made.
- People negotiated with each other in the past, and the conclusion at that point in time becomes the rule.
    - Existing [[rule]] is a product of past [[negotiations]].
- So even if what you want to do goes against existing rules, that's no reason not to do it.
    - Negotiate [[Change the rules.]] I have a choice.
- In the process of growth, a human being first experiences a state in which he or she does not have [[negotiating ability]].
    - So it is easy to forget that there is [[room for negotiation]] in the rules.
    - So it's easy to give up on an action just because the rules prohibit it.
        - [[The Parable of the Elephant and the Chain]]
            - [[learned helplessness]]
    - We need to learn that "[[rules]] can be changed."

- Even now, as an adult, it is not easy to negotiate a change in criminal law after committing a crime that violates it, for example.
- On the other hand, [[company rule]] etc. could be changed by proper negotiation.
