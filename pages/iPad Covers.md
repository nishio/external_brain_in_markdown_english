- I used it for five years.
- The surface sheet deteriorated and started peeling off, so I had to replace it.

- I've been using it for a month and I'm starting to feel it's not good enough.
- First of all, in order to rotate, the cover is a rotating joint where it connects to the iPad, so it is depressing that the cover rotates when opened for normal use.
- The power button is hard to press. This is a bit annoying as I use it often to take screenshots.
- The pen holder is tight. I have a grip on the pen now, so I have to press down firmly to fit it into the pen holder. If I had fitted it properly, it would not have charged.
- To begin with, the center of gravity is unstable and scary when vertical with this structure.
