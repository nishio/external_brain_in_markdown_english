title: "Diversification of media revenue sources"

[[Audrey+Glen+Halsk@Cybozu]] after casually posting something like this.
- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1816742799363977284) We have received several requests for the content of the talk, which can be read free of charge on the web media "[[Cybozu style]]"!
- Cybozu Style is a free media, but I thought the reason why it is sustainable is because the software is profitable.

The feelings that came to mind after Mr. Anno's election campaign and the subsequent [[Funding the Commons Tokyo]].

Very good content was created with Mr. Anno's involvement.
Part of this was paid content.
- I don't mean to imply that that in and of itself is a bad thing.
- X/Twitter and other social networking sites maintained by advertising have an incentive to make people emotional and spend time with the goal of increasing engagement
- Media maintained through paid membership contracts from customers
    - Web media needs the perks of paid subscription to sustain itself.
- It's hard to spread the word even if you think, "I found some good information, I want a lot of people to see this.
    - This is a [[gated community]].
        - And that's not a bad thing.
        - By creating a community where only those with money can participate, the comments are of higher quality than those in the Yahoo News comment section.
            - I don't think "high quality" is appropriate, it's just that it's so in some communities' values.
    - Even some subscribers are financially resistant to multiple subscriptions
        - Nothing to do with web media, people have always said "take several newspapers and compare them".
            - Was he a politician or a president?
        - Ideally, you should also subscribe to several paid news media companies and compare them.
            - [[In and out of filter bubble]]
            - I think most people don't have that kind of money or time.
- [[[Radical Change]] "Elon Musk Dictatorship" is turning X into chaos []](https://newspicks.com/news/10311334/body/)
    - The title is too incendiary.
    - As far as free reading goes, it's not the speaker's argument, it's the reporter's argument and the speaker's introduction, and that's it.
    - I think it's a terrible use of the word, even though the speaker doesn't agree with the reporter's assertion.
- It's not enough to get excited within the gated community in propagating the idea of smoothing the boundaries of society called Plurality.
    - So, it is preferable that the media have diverse sources of income
    - Preferred?
        - Example of [Harimaya Honten
            - [Japan's No.1 Okaki Restaurant Harimaya Honten](https://www.harimayahonten.co.jp/)
            - Delicious rice crackers transmitted with revenue
        - It is up to the reader to choose it after it is sent out.
        - Whatever the claim, it contributes to increasing diversity.
    - In the first place, even newspapers are maintained by real estate income.
        - [Why there is "no sense of crisis" at Japanese newspapers even though circulation is declining: "Real estate agent" reporters have no sense of urgency (Page 3) | PRESIDENT Online,](https://president.jp/articles/-/29765?page=3)

PIVOT], which I learned about during Mr. Anno's campaign, announced this past July that all videos would be free of charge.
- [PIVOT aims to be a technology company｜Hachi @ Product Manager of PIVOT Corporation](https://note.com/hiroki_hachisuka/n/n6e66b0f95dce)
    - I don't know anything about how to go about revenue generation.
- I just watched the video with Mr. Yasuno and he was very prepared and had a very productive discussion.
    - I felt like, "There is good media out there, I just didn't realize it."
