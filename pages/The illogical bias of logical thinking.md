title: "The illogical bias of logical thinking"
---

observed fact
- Human beings do not operate on logic alone.
- Inseparable from emotions.

But humans can have beliefs that contradict the observed fact that "humans operate by logic."
- This belief is illogical.
- Is it born of some emotional bias?

hypothesis
- Damaging when feeling strong negative emotions.
    - At such times, "[[Distance yourself from your emotions.]]" and the damage is mitigated.
        - This is related to [[cognitive therapy]], [[associate]], etc.
    - Some people give a negative connotation to this act of "distancing oneself from emotions," for example, "[[escape]]" or "[[avoid looking directly at something]].
        - The reason "this is the right thing to do" is created after the fact as a counter to the negative feelings of not wanting to think that one's actions are negative.
