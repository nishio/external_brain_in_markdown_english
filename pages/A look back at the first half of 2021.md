[[2021]]
as planned
- I made a listening chat [[Keicho]].
- I did a connection from the listening chat to [[Regroup]].
    - I used it to prepare materials for Saturday lectures at Nada School, etc.
    - The goal was to lower the psychological hurdle for Regroup newbies to make stickies, but I don't think it's gone down.
        - There's a hurdle in properly inscribing chatty long sentences on a sticky note.

Plans not done
- Create an explanation of how to use Regroup for specific applications.
    - Before adding more explanations, it is necessary to make the basic functions work stably without bugs and make the UI easy to understand.
    - Since it is difficult to fix it in the current situation without much testing, we decided to rebuild Movidea
    - Write user-friendly explanations for [[link suggestion]], connect to Regroup

What we did without a plan
    - [[Preparation for Nada 2021 Lecture]]
    - [[Unexplored Junior 2021 Boost Conference]]
