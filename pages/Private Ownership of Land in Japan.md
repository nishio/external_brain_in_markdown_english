title: "Private Ownership of Land in Japan"
---

>  The Meiji Restoration, which issued land certificates to private citizens and allowed them to "own" land for the purpose of converting the land tax to payment in gold, was a major change in Japan's land ownership system. This was "the greatest reform since the dawn of Japan" that changed the ancient "national ownership" of land to "private ownership by the people" (Yukichi Fukuzawa, "Jitaku Ron" [[Jiji Shimpo, April-May 1892]]).
