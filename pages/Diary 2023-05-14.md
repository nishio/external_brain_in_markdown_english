> I am interested in an approach that gives up absolute truth sharing, assumes a loose/[[intersubjective]] sharing of reality, and then considers how to [[consensus building]] on that basis.

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1657594671009509376?s=20): today is my day off! I thought I'd come out for lunch, and now that I've eaten, I'm trying to think of what to do, but I can't think of anything!

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1657626721229889536) [[Sparacoor]]. When I got off at Iidabashi (I mistook it for Suidobashi), I thought "Oh no, it's Sunday afternoon, isn't there a long line?" But it was not the case and I was able to get in easily. The purpose of today's visit was to see the bedrock bath zone on the upper floor.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1657627607339524097) Unlike the image of the word "rock bath", it is like a zone to eat in a super public bath. Of course, the original bathing fee is high and an additional fee is required, so there are no children running around or old people screaming loudly. There are young men and women having a good time, but it is like a Bali-style cafe.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1657628650706182144) I saw someone bringing in a book to read, and I thought that was nice. When you raise your eyes, there is a big window with Tokyo Dome, Ferris wheel, and roller coaster, so it is a perfect place to rest your eyes by looking far away when you are tired from looking too close.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1657630318306934784) It's not a very nice day, but you can lie down in the open air. I've come to recognize it as "a cafe where you can move around looking for a comfortable place" in my mind.

- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1657631340806955008) Nothing rock solid to get to the bottom of it.
- >  I said, "I brought my phone with me, but what do people do when they go to bedrock baths?"
- >  Staff "Many people bring their own items, but if it bothers you, you can leave them in the lockers in the locker room."
- >  I see. I will.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1657639552767647746) I was going to experience all kinds of rock baths, but after experiencing two, I wanted to take an outdoor air bath. When I first entered, I thought, "Huh? Not as good as I thought it would be. but soon I was sweating. Is this the power of far-infrared radiation? Are there people snoring in their sleep? Won't that cause blood clots? Hydration is important. After this, it started to rain.

- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1657653356050157568) I went into a room with a phone ban, [[speculation]] away from the [[stimulus flood]], came out and [[wrote down]] what came to mind as a result of my contemplation, and then went back in. I thought it was an environment where the overhead of the cycle of going into a room with a phone ban... is low. In the case of bathing, you have to wipe your body, but not in the bedrock bath.
