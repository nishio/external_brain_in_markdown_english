title: "Post-It (note)"
---

- sticky notes
- Post-it is a trademark of 3M Company
- Launched in 1980
- So the KJ method and Young's "How to Create Ideas" created in the 60s and 70s use cards, not sticky notes.
- When the author tried the KJ method in 2011, he was going to buy information cards according to the information in the book, but his wife, who was working as an assistant at Tama Art University at the time, recommended post-its, so that's what he got.
