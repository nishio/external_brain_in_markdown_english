title: "The more important the project, the more messy it starts."
---

    - [[Problem Solving Phase]]
    - I was trying to figure out what was the spike that stuck in my mind when I heard Yucai's story, and I have just verbalized it a bit.
    - Level 2: Self-consciousness that I have a lot of things that I haven't started to work on, even though I have an idea for a solution.

    - [[Lack of time]] is an excuse
        - [[procrastination]] is not a solution because time will not spring up.
    - [Is it a "lack of self-confidence"?
    - When you start a project, there are so many parallel projects that you can't [[control]] them [[anxiety]].
        - The more important the project, the more negative the bias toward [starting a train (or bus, etc.) before all the passengers are on board
        - The more important the project, the less likely it is to be initiated.
        - [[Lack of self-confidence]] for [[Project management skills]]
    - This is the one I wrote about earlier [[How to take the load undetermined task]].
        - There is a bias that "[[emergency]] things" with deadlines are given [[priority]].
            - Perhaps "the more [[important]] the project is, the more [[miscellany (classification of Japanese poetry)]] it should begin.
                - see  [[Urgent/Important Matrix]]
            - Or "don't limit my [[Resources]]" or something like that.
            - Tasks that are important but not urgent and have [[procrastination]] status."
                - That hasn't caused any problems, so failure to allocate resources shouldn't be a big problem.
                - There is a possibility that the level of urgency could increase after the start of the program.

- For example, I have applied for two online secretarial services at the same time. The reason why I haven't started the third one yet is that the vendor has started e-mail consultations, and that has slowed down my momentum.
