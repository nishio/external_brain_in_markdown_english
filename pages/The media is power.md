> [shioshio38](https://x.com/shioshio38/status/1967873578881388740) The reason the left wasn't too afraid of Cancel Culture was because they were high on the idea that the media, with its close partisanship, wouldn't cover gaffes and other gaffes by leftist cultural figures. I guess.
>  The media is just as powerful as the government, and the cancellation culture is probably largely due to the influence of the power of the media.
>  The figure below shows what is called an online flame war, but in reality, the figure shows that the media has the greatest impact.
>  After all, if it is only an online flameout, it will not have that big an impact, and the media will pick up on it, leading to cancellation culture.

> [shioshio38](https://x.com/shioshio38/status/1967873888739836170) There are many problematic statements in leftist culture tweets, etc., but the background is that the media does not pick up on them, so they do not lead to major cancellations.

> [shioshio38](https://x.com/shioshio38/status/1967891866730500453) The leftists are starting to cancel power, but even the media, which has been pushing for the cancellation so far, is a separate power from the government.
>  We have just been pretending not to see the power that that media has for a long time.

> [shioshio38](https://x.com/shioshio38/status/1967921355023950276) Since power is the ability of A to make B do something "against B's will," the media with the ability to cancel a project or make someone resign is a fine power A media outlet that has the ability to cancel a project or make someone resign is a powerful person, isn't it?
>  You are a powerhouse with different powers than the government.
>  Leftist Culture For some reason, you think the government is the only power and ignore the power of the media.

> [shioshio38](https://x.com/shioshio38/status/1968388100373291325) Someone says "if power cancels, wag your tail", isn't this power also the media?
>  Who was it that applauded the cancellation by the media?
>  The government is power and the media is power.

> [shioshio38](https://x.com/shioshio38/status/1968941685657739468) Some people in Cancel Culture are comparing the administration to the average person in the city, but I think that's not true.
>  Precisely, it is the power of the media and the power of the regime.
>  Not the average person on the street. They have used the power of the media to cancel.
>  The administration is power and the media is power. Both are the arrogance of power.

> [shioshio38](https://x.com/shioshio38/status/1968943664924864845) CancelCulture has shown me that some people think only public power is power and not the media and influencers. [[shioshio38]].

>  Power is something more universal, defined by Dahl as "A has power over B if A causes B to do something that B would not normally do.
