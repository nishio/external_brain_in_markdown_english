title: 'Member or not," is a false dichotomy.'

[[Vitalik talks about smooth society]].
from [[Plurality philosophy in an incredibly oversized nutshell]]
> A big theme of Plurality is expanded on in much more detail in Ken Suzuki's Smooth Society and its Enemies: the idea that membership in an organization should not be treated as a "true-or-false" question. Instead, there should be different degrees of membership, and these different degrees would carry different benefits and different levels of obligation. This is an aspect of society that was always true, but becomes much more important in an internet-first world where our communities are no longer necessarily nested and fully overlapping.
