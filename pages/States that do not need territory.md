title: "States that do not need territory"

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1658114135979184131?s=20): I was talking to a friend about putting the electoral system on Ethereum, and he pointed out that if that were to happen, people could participate in elections anywhere in the world. If it is realized, people can participate in elections anywhere in the world, and even if physical elections cannot be held for some reason, democratic governance can still be maintained. I see.
- > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1658115793505189889?s=20): that's how a state survives as long as its people are there, even if the land is gone.

> [@dmikurube](https://twitter.com/dmikurube/status/1658137480829480960?s=20): @nishio [[Estonia]]'s (risky, but acceptable) decision to introduce nationwide online voting is precisely the reason (1), and I'm quoting from (2). This is exactly the reason why @nishio [[Estonia]] introduced nationwide online voting (accepting the risk) #dmikurube

- > Although the former Soviet Union has collapsed, the threat from the neighboring great power of Russia has not decreased to zero. Estonia still has a strong sense of crisis that its land may one day be controlled again. It is not only rooted in the government, but even in the people.
- >  Naturally, the government does not want this to happen, but the idea is that even if a country is invaded and physically loses its "[[territory]]," the nation can be revitalized as long as it has the "data" of its citizens. In fact, Estonia is promoting the idea of "[[data embassies]]" where all national data is stored in embassies outside the country, with the first one to be opened in Luxembourg in 2018.
- >  Even if the government ceases to function due to physical occupation of the territory, if there is a government as software on the Internet, citizens with ID cards can access it and function as a country called Estonia. This is the very idea of "[[Government as a Service]]. And the former CIO of the country's government also said that this idea is the ultimate goal of national security that the country should strive for. --- [Three Success Factors That Made Estonia's "e-Government" Possible](https://forbesjapan.com/articles/detail/19386/page1)
