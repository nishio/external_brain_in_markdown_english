The main contents are as follows
- University officials attended the meeting and testified about their efforts to address anti-Semitism. The committee chair accused Columbia University of being a hotbed of anti-Semitism.
- The president of the university complained about the difficulty of balancing [[freedom of expression]] and the protection of Jewish students and explained the measures to be taken.
- The council members made a series of harsh inquiries about the professor's employment status, his response to the protests, and the merits of his anti-Semitic shprayer calls.
- Fifteen students suspended and six admonished for anti-Semitic incidents. The faculty member in question is also under investigation.
- Ten students involved in a controversial March event were suspended.
- Rep. Ilhan Omar criticized the investigation and punishment of student activists who support Palestine.
- The chairman noted that certain measures have been taken, but that more visible progress is needed, and he is prepared to continue to monitor the situation closely.
Columbia University came under intense congressional scrutiny as it was forced to navigate the difficult line between freedom of expression and discrimination.

[President Shafik already persecutes pro-Palestinian students. Will that be enough for Congress?](https://www.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2024/04/17/president-shafik-already-persecutes-pro-palestinian-students-will-that-be-enough-for-congress/) 4/18
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>In this opinion article, Maryam Alwan, a Palestinian-American student at Columbia University and a member of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), harshly criticizes the university administration's response to tensions between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian students.

The main issues discussed are as follows
- There is a double standard in the university's treatment of Zionist and anti-Zionist students, with pro-Palestinian students subject to more severe disciplinary action and scrutiny.
- The university has not condemned the harassment and attacks against Palestinian students and supporters as strongly as it did the incidents targeting Jewish students.
- The university's cooperation with a congressional anti-Semitism investigation could jeopardize the privacy and academic career of pro-Palestinian student activists like her.
- Despite being harassed and discriminated against by pro-Israel students and outside agitators during protests, SJP activists are being punished by the university for "disruption".
- Efforts to address Islamophobia and Arab hatred have taken a back seat to the anti-Semitism task force, which claims to focus on silencing pro-Palestinian viewpoints.
- As the president testifies before Congress, he appeals for protecting students rather than leaving them to die in order to relieve outside political pressure.

Alwan offers the perspective that the Palestinian student community feels unequal treatment and censorship from a university administration beholden to pro-Israeli interests. It is a strong indictment of how Columbia University has managed a very complex and sensitive campus political issue.

[Pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, NY, arrest more than 100 people (1/2) - CNN.co.uk](https://www.cnn.co.jp/usa/35217994.html?ref=rss)

> [blu3mo](https://twitter.com/blu3mo/status/1781539371071553974) Over 100 people were arrested yesterday, and more students were arrested today.
>  The student newspaper, the student government, and some departments harshly criticized the president for allowing the police to intervene in a peaceful movement.
>  On the other hand, some Israel supporters criticize the president for cracking down more strictly.
>  The movement has taken off and similar occupations have begun at other universities such as Yale and UNC CH.

> [blu3mo](https://twitter.com/blu3mo/status/1781541617125507389) The occupation happening on campus looks like a perfectly peaceful protest movement to me.
>  (On the other hand, if I had Israeli roots, I doubt I would see it the same way)
