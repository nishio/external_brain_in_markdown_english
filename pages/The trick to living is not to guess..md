> [@windymelt](https://twitter.com/windymelt/status/1680255631863984134):[[tips for living]] is to not [[guess]], I'm getting the feeling. Same with [[performance tuning]]. Don't guess at other people's [[intentions]]. Don't guess about the world. Not trusting other people's guesses, and being able to tell if it's a guess or not...

- [[Don't guess, measure.]]
- [[Inference of the inner life]]
    - [[Ignorance of the inner life of others]]
