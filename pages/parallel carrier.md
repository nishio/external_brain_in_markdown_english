title: "parallel carrier"
---

- A concept proposed by Peter [[Drucker.]] in his book "[[What will govern tomorrow]]".
    - Chapter 6 Managing Ourselves Section 5: Second Life

- Humans have outlived their organizations.
    - One cannot rely on a single [[organization]].
    - get tired of one's work
- A second life is needed there.
- There are three ways.
    - Changing organizations, changing jobs
    - parallel carrier
        - Keep the work that is going well and have another world.
    - social entrepreneur
        - Reduce the amount of time you devote to your job and start a new one

Drucker describes the former as "often working for a non-profit organization" and the latter as "starting a new job, especially a non-profit job," and it is assumed that the distinction is between joining an existing job and creating a new one. The choice of the name "entrepreneur" also suggests this.
    - It is not a ratio of hours. There is a reference to the fact that there is an option of part-time or consultant-like contract work as well as continuing to work 40 hours a week in one's main job with respect to a parallel career.
    - Being a non-profit organization does not seem to be a requirement. At the time he wrote this book, there may not have been many examples of working practices with multiple payroll entities.

- terms
    - It has to be aided and abetted even before we take the plunge in earnest.

- Opportunities for Success
    - For each person, "to [[contribute]] to something" is important.
    - One main business alone can lose it due to uncertainty.
    - By having multiple lives, you have an opportunity to contribute even if one doesn't work out.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Drucker describes this as an "opportunity for success," but I think this term is misleading, like "let's give it a shot. He does not mean "big financial success," but the feeling of having made a contribution is what he means by "success.

- About Japan
    - Assumptions implicitly assumed by previous societies:.
        - Organizations are longer-lived than those who work for them.
        - What works is fixed in the organization.
    - Japan has succeeded by ensuring that "workers do not move to other organizations" through its lifetime employment system.
    - The challenge for the future is to realize freedom of movement for [[knowledge workers]] while maintaining social stability through lifetime employment.
    - Kizuna is essential for a society to function, and Japan's challenge will serve as a model for other countries.

- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>For example, Cybozu's childcare leave system guarantees reemployment after leaving the company to take on other challenges, and can be said to be a system that balances "maintaining ties through lifetime employment" with "working but taking on the challenge of a second life.
    - The subsequent use of the word "compound" with multiple "double" characters is also in line with Drucker's idea that "one must be aiding and abetting before taking the plunge in earnest.
    - How can we make this happen? Draft [[Ensure that the bond is not broken when you move on.]]
    - Linda Gratton's [[Linda Gratton]] [[work shift]] and others have a similar concept in terms of emphasizing bonding = [[SOC]].
