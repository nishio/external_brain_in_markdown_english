title: "progressivism"

2021-04-16
From the point of view that sees value in [[the progress of civilization]], there is no value in [[an entity that stands in the way of civilization's progress]].

- When [[space aliens]] come to Earth and try to intervene so that Earth's [[civilization]] can progress, they are [[exterminated]].

At this time, [[human rights]] are not relevant. Aliens do not necessarily identify whether the target of their extermination is human or not.

Human rights are rights that Homo sapiens grant to other Homo sapiens in the present civilization, and there is no guarantee that other species will grant human rights to Homo sapiens.

Human rights are just local rules among homo sapiens.

Thinking neutrally, when humans remove rotten oranges from a box of oranges and throw them away, they might ask, "Don't oranges have human rights?" Just as humans don't think that Homo sapiens have human rights when they take a box of oranges and throw them away, aliens don't think that Homo sapiens have human rights either.

I'm not really interested in [[the prosperity of homo sapiens]]."
Well, maybe."
You'd be willing to [[terminate]] half of Homo sapiens in order to advance Homo sapiens civilization."
'No, it doesn't even have to be a civilization of homo sapiens. [[Like]] if an alien civilization advances by absorbing Homo sapiens, it is preferable to be absorbed."

"The majority of homo sapiens are not aiming for the prosperity of homo sapiens in the first place, but for [[their own]] happiness, so why not if they are [[absorbed]] into happiness?"

- A little more resolution.
    - First, "[[one's]] own happiness" is the top priority.
    - After that, "progress of civilization" takes precedence over "happiness of others."

    - The following behavioral differences can be observed between those who prioritize the "advancement of civilization" and those who prioritize the "well-being of others."
        - Decision-making criteria:.
            - Priority of civilizational progress: In some cases, the feelings and well-being of individual people are sacrificed for the sake of scientific, technological, or social institutional development. For example, workers' burdens are allowed to increase in order to develop innovative technologies.
            - Prioritizing the well-being of others: placing importance on people's feelings and quality of life, and whether technological innovation or social change directly contributes to people's well-being. For example, they place the highest priority on the well-being of workers and prioritize the creation of a less burdensome environment.
        - Leadership Styles:.
            - Civilization Priority: Demonstrates strong leadership and often makes tough decisions to achieve goals. Focuses on efficiency and results, and is willing to make difficult decisions.
            - Prioritize the well-being of others: value the opinions and feelings of members and exercise leadership based on empathy. Prioritize team harmony and individual member satisfaction.
        - Social Contribution Attitude:.
            - Civilizational progress first: Often involved in large-scale social change and infrastructure development for future generations. Act with a long-term vision.
            - Prioritize the well-being of others: Actively engage in direct human and community support. Choose actions that directly affect the well-being of those closest to you.

    - I think this is the difference between [[desire to achieve]] and [desire for affinity
