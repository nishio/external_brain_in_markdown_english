- [[A series of pictures of two people saying different things]]
- Left: People who think "A has changed to B
- RIGHT: People who think "A has changed to a new A".

The person on the right calls the new A "A" while recognizing the change that 'the "current A" has changed to a "new A"'. This expands the scope of the concept of A.

When I heard the story of "adapting democracy to the new environment," I thought, "It depends on the person whether the adapted new X is called a democracy or not.
