The [[blurred circle]] has no clear boundary, but if it is actually drawn as a blurred circle, it is not well recognized by humans, so it is represented as a combination of dark and light areas.

- [Created to explain [[Aspects of Experience]] in Study Session 3 on "Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning.
    - I think [[Story intersections become atoms.]] was the catalyst.

- The [[nested set]] depicted by [[Both "is X" and "is not X" are compatible...]] etc. can be interpreted as a line drawing of the boundary between the two colors in this figure.
- If it is essentially a [[blurred circle]], then the line is not real either.

- [[Neither "is X" nor "is not X" correct.]]
