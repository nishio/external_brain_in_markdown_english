title: "Endure now, it will be easier later."
---

- [[People get good at what they do repeatedly.]] So those who are told [[withstand]] repeatedly, "If you endure now, it will be easier later," will be better at enduring than others.

- If [[burden]] is constant, it will be [[raku]], and if the load increases in step with the increase in "endurance," it will not be easy.
