> What would reading in the run time direction equate to in a book? I do not have the answer.
- [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]]  p.125  [[(Column) Time Direction Reading]]

I thought it was to observe how the author, or someone who fully understands the contents of the book, behaves in his/her daily life.

As for reading in the direction of creation time, when one person writes several books (or articles or lectures), I imagined reading them in order from the oldest to the newest. However, this is more like "reading the person" than "reading the books.
It would be nice to have a commit log of the book writing process, but many authors don't make it available, and the Stream on Scrapbox is very detailed, but now it's too hard for the reader.
