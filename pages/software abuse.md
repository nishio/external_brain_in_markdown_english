title: "software abuse"
---

Under current law, pets are treated as property, and damaging them is a crime of destruction of property.
If so, can we argue that there is a [[humanity]] problem in abusing software, which is treated as an object under the current law, and that it is a crime of destruction of property if it is damaged?

Since there is too big a gap with current law to allow software to have human rights, the first line of action is to allow it to have the same status as a pet.

- There was a time when [[slave]] was considered "property" and that was not good.
