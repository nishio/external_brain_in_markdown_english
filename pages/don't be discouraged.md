- [[I don't want a manual future.]]

> "don't be discouraged" (ドン't be discouraged) is the 15th single by [[Megumi Hayashibara]], released on April 23, 1997 by Starchild... It was the theme song for the TV anime "Slayers Try" by Megumi Hayashibara, who was establishing herself as a voice actress (and singer) at the time, and it debuted at No. 4 on the Oricon Singles Chart, the highest ranking for a voice actress singer at the time. This is the only single released after 1990 under the name of an individual voice actress to have initial sales exceeding 100,000 copies on the Oricon.
>  The total number of copies sold on Oricon is second only to "Give a reason" as Hayashibara's biggest-selling single. However, depending on the nature and treatment of "Give a reason" as a work (see the article concerned), it is treated as Hayashibara's biggest hit single.
