from [/arpla/three lines on the road to wisdom](https://scrapbox.io/arpla/three lines on the road to wisdom).
> The "Three Changes" at the beginning of the first part of "[[Zoroaster]]"
>  There are three developments of the spirit: the camel, the lion, and the child.
    - [[camel]]
    - >  Live with patience, with a full burden, with awe, under the ideal of "[[do thou shalt (do)]]", believing in the values handed down from generation to generation
    - [[lion]]
    - > He says no to the old values and obligations, and in his exasperated desire, "[[I desire]]", he deprives himself of the freedom to create new values. But the lion has yet to create new value itself.
    - [[infant]]
    - > I must begin the play of creation in innocence and oblivion, and finish the acquisition of my world, so to speak, in the position of "[[I]]", saying the holy affirmation and will my will.
- > Nietzsche also says something to the same effect in his posthumous book, "The Path to Wisdom" ("Solid of Generation").
    - >  (cf. Encyclopedia of Nietzsche, pp. 129-30)
