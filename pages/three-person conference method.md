- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>We are going to have a debate about the future treatment of Homo sapiens, with Mr. A saying that it is not worthwhile for Homo sapiens to continue to exist, and Mr. B disagreeing and arguing for the continuation of Homo sapiens. Let's start with what Mr. A has to say.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Mr. A: I do not believe that the survival of Homo sapiens is worthwhile. There are three main reasons for this
        - First, let's talk about the destruction of the global environment. Homo sapiens is the most environmentally destructive organism on the planet and is a major cause of environmental problems in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and resource consumption. It has also been noted that the activities of Homo sapiens have led to the extinction of other species.
        - Next, I would like to discuss social issues. Homo sapiens has created problems such as inequality, war, and discrimination, causing much suffering. Unless these problems are resolved, the continuation of Homo sapiens is not a wise choice.
        - Finally, let's talk about the evolution of technology: with the development of AI and robotics, we are already surpassing homo sapiens in terms of labor and intelligence. The value of Homo sapiens is expected to diminish in the future as society demands more efficient and sustainable technologies.
    - For these reasons, I would argue that the survival of Homo sapiens is not worthwhile.
    - (<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>[["There are already beings that surpass homo sapiens in terms of labor and intelligence."]] I see... well, [most people don't recognize change at the moment of change.)

- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Mr. B, come in.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Mr. B: I would argue that the survival of Homo sapiens is worthwhile. Here are my reasons why.
        - First, regarding environmental issues, Homo sapiens is the only organism that can both cause problems and find solutions. From the development of renewable energy and environmentally friendly technologies to sustainable agriculture and recycling, we are working hard to improve our global environment. We believe that the wisdom and technology of Homo sapiens can contribute to restoring the natural environment.
        - Next, regarding social problems, Homo sapiens has the ability to learn from its own mistakes and grow. Throughout history, many problems have been solved. For example, slavery was abolished and women's suffrage was achieved. In the future, Homo sapiens will continue to tackle social problems and build a better world.
        - Finally, regarding the evolution of technology, AI and robots are certainly superior in terms of labor and intelligence, but they do not possess emotion, creativity, or human experience. The value of Homo sapiens lies in its humanity and the knowledge and sensitivity gained through human experience. By cooperating with technology and harnessing the full power of Homo sapiens, we can create a better future.
    - For these reasons, I argue that the survival of Homo sapiens is worthwhile.

- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Mr. C, please listen to both of us and suggest a compromise.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Mr. C: After listening to both of you, I would like to propose a compromise regarding the survival of Homo sapiens.
        - First, regarding environmental issues, we cannot deny that homo sapiens is the cause, but at the same time we have a responsibility to seek solutions. We should intensify our environmental protection efforts and work toward a sustainable society. We should also continue our efforts to prevent the extinction of other species by promoting ecologically sound technologies and resource management.
        - Next, regarding social issues, it is important that Homo sapiens learn from past mistakes and grow. While there will remain concerns about the continued existence of Homo sapiens as long as the problems remain unresolved, we must build a society in which we can live together in harmony by deepening understanding through education and dialogue.
        - Finally, when it comes to technological advancement, it is important to work with AI and robots. Let us develop efficient and sustainable technologies while utilizing the emotions and creativity of Homo sapiens. It is also important for the survival of Homo sapiens to value human-like values and sensibilities that AI and robots cannot carry.
    - The compromise I propose is that Homo sapiens recognizes its own weaknesses and works to improve them, adapts to environmental problems, social issues, and technological advances, and sees the value of its survival. By maximizing the potential and responsibility that Homo sapiens possesses, we can build a better future.

- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> What should we do with Homo sapiens who can't [[Recognize your weaknesses]]?
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>If Homo sapiens is unable to recognize its own weaknesses, it may respond in the following ways
        - Education: Education is important for Homo sapiens who are unable to recognize their weaknesses. Through education at school and in the workplace, they can develop self-awareness, critical thinking, and communication skills. They must also understand the importance of relationships and teamwork, and learn to recognize their own weaknesses and the strengths of others.
        - Feedback: Accepting feedback and evaluation from others can help you realize your weaknesses. It is important to take the opinions and advice of friends, family, colleagues and supervisors seriously and work on self-improvement.
        - Self-Reflection: Regular self-reflection and goal-setting, reflecting on your actions and past choices, can help you recognize your weaknesses. An objective evaluation of your thoughts and actions is the first step toward improving your weaknesses.
        - Mentors and role models: Through interaction with people you admire and mentor, you can identify your weaknesses. You can learn from their successes and setbacks and develop yourself.
        - Therapy/Counseling: If psychological problems or difficulties with self-awareness are the cause of your inability to recognize your weaknesses, professional counseling or therapy can be effective. It can help you deepen your self-understanding and develop the ability to cope with your weaknesses and problems.
    - For homo sapiens who are unable to recognize their own weaknesses, it is desirable to support them through the above methods to increase their self-awareness and awareness of improvement. This will help individuals and society as a whole grow and move toward a better future.

- Here we have Mr. A who is negative about [[unexplored junior]], Mr. B who is positive, and Mr. C who is wavering between the two. Mr. A and Mr. B are taking turns speaking out against Mr. C, trying to make Mr. C's opinion closer to their own. Write down the conversation between Ms. A, Mr. B, and Mr. C.
- Mr. A: Mr. C, have you heard of Unexplored Junior? Those kids are forced to learn programming. Frankly speaking, I think it's a waste of time.
- Mr. B : But, Unexplored Junior gives kids a chance to learn new technology and programming. It may help them in their future careers and motivate them to learn.
- Mr. C: Well, I think each of you has a point...
- A: I think it's important for children to have time to play freely and pursue their own interests. Programs like Unexplored Junior can make them feel pressured.
- Mr. B: Some children may feel pressured to participate in the program, but the Junior Program is something that interested children participate in voluntarily. We provide an environment where they can learn while having fun.
- Mr. C: Wouldn't it be so bad if we were to participate voluntarily?
- Mr. A : But even if you participate, you don't know if you will actually acquire skills that will be useful in the future. It may be a wasted effort.
- Mr. B: That can certainly be said, but the skills and knowledge gained at Unexplored Junior will often be useful in some way in the future. Programming will become more and more important in the future.
- Mr. C: Maybe you're right. Programming is a necessary skill for the future. .....
- Mr. A: However, I think it is important for children to find a field that they are really interested in, rather than just sticking to programming. I think Unexplored Junior is just one of those options.
- Ms. B: Sure, Unexplored Junior is an option, but it's also a great opportunity for kids to discover their interests. I think the program allows them to get the most out of their limited resources.
- Mr. C: Hmmm, there are certainly advantages and disadvantages to Unexplored Junior. But considering the importance of programming in the future, it might be a good opportunity for kids who are interested.
- A: Of course, it is a good opportunity for children who are interested, but I think it is important to give them choices and let them decide for themselves, rather than forcing them to participate.
- Mr. B: I agree with you on that point. I think Unexplored Junior is a great program for interested children, but we should avoid forcing them to participate.
- Mr. C: Yes, that's right. It's good that there are unexplored juniors as an option, but we shouldn't force them to participate. I understand what both A and B are saying.
