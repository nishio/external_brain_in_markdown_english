title: "Landlord and SALSA"

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1681374806938361856) If you [[SALSA]] a house that you can live in for a year for 50,000 x 12 months for 600,000 under a normal rental agreement, the assessed value is going to rise to where the tax amount is 600,000, If the tax rate is 10%, that translates to 6 million. Most of the potential users can't afford to pay 6 million immediately, and they don't have the risk tolerance to withstand the risk of not being able to sell in a year, do they?

- > Peer to Peer lending locks liquidity (funds) and NFTs into a smart contract once the contract is signed and returned when repaid. In the event of default, the NFT goes to the lender. The funds provided by the lender are unused while waiting for the loan to be executed and can only be offered to NFTs that have already been escrowed.

- Maybe derivatives will be created for people with low risk tolerance, like [[Curve Finance]].
