Why?

- The rise in the value of Worldcoin (WLD) in February 2024 can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the release of OpenAI's 'Sora' video tool has contributed to the surge in Worldcoin's value, with the token experiencing a significant increase in price and trading activity.

- Additionally, a notable transaction by a cryptocurrency whale, which earned $2.15 million from WLD within a two-day span, has also drawn attention to Worldcoin and likely influenced its price movement.

- Furthermore, there are indicators that the cryptocurrency market is entering a new era, leading to expectations of increased attention and potential price surges for WLD in the long run.

- These factors, along with the broader upswing in the cryptocurrency market and growing investor interest, have likely contributed to the rise in Worldcoin's value in February 2024.

- The price of Worldcoin (WLD) is predicted to rise in the long run, with various price predictions for 2023, 2025, and 2030. For instance, some analysts predict that WLD could reach a high of $0.12 by 2025, and there are even more optimistic predictions, with some suggesting that the price could eventually reach $0.21 by 2025. Additionally, there are forecasts that the price of WLD could be around $0.92 in 10 years. These predictions indicate a positive outlook for the long-term value of Worldcoin.

        - Let's ignore (1).

- The surge in Worldcoin's value is also linked to the release of its tokenomics, which revealed that the WLD supply will be capped at 10 billion tokens for 15 years, after which the network's governance can decide to implement an inflation rate of up to 1.5%. This information about the tokenomics and the allocation of tokens has likely influenced investor confidence and contributed to the positive sentiment surrounding Worldcoin.

- In summary, the rise in Worldcoin's value in February 2024 can be attributed to various factors, including the release of OpenAI's 'Sora' video tool, a significant transaction by a cryptocurrency whale, positive long-term price predictions, and the release of Worldcoin's tokenomics. These developments have contributed to growing investor interest and confidence in Worldcoin's potential, leading to an increase in its value.

You're saying a lot, but it's because you bought $2.15 million in two days, and it jumped up because of low liquidity.
- I think it's possible that it's trading with the intention of being itself, i.e., [[a]] workhorse that's covered by the Sora release.
    - [workmanship - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BB%95%E6%89%8B)
- Sora is 2/15, price movement started before that, could be [[insider]].

Speculation aside, the fact is that as of 2024-02-21 the amount I received from Worldcoin was about $60,000.
