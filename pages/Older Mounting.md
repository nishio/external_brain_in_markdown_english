title: "Older Mounting"
---

I've seen people say things like, "It takes five years to master something," but if you've been consciously working on mastering it, but you've only been doing it for five years, isn't it just [[mounting]] "I'm better than you because I have more experience than you" to say that to someone who hasn't been doing it for five years yet? I have more experience than you, so I am better than you.

Even if it took you 5 years of conscious effort to master it, any sane person would express "it took me 5 years to master it" and it is simply [[overgeneralization]] to [[generalize]] it so that it takes anyone 5 years. That it took you personally so long to master it is a sign of your [[incompetence]], so why you are so high and mighty is a mystery. Are you unable to [[relativize]] yourself?

Isn't it a harmful behavior to say "it will take 5 years" when someone is enthusiastic about learning something, because the speed at which things are learned is greatly affected by the presence or absence of [[enthusiasm]]?
