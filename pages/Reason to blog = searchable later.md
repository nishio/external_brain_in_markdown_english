You say, "I write on Twitter so I don't have anything to blog about," but at least one reason I blog is that "[[You can search later.]]" So it's hard to substitute Twitter. Fourier analysis? I did that in Python, easy, easy, wait a minute, I'll search. I'm writing this to do something like "[Spectrum analysis in Python @ NISHIO HIROKAZU # Archived COREBlog](http://www.nishiohirokazu.org/archived_coreblog/962)" I don't remember the code from 3 years ago. And I don't remember.

Twitter is a service that seems to have expanded the "communication aspect" of blogging. In blogging, if you want your blog to have value as a place for communication, it is important to update it frequently to some extent. [If you are writing well-written articles late, it is better to write them in a speedy manner. The limitation of the number of characters on Twitter lowers the psychological threshold for writing a poor article.

On the other hand, it is not suitable for writing coherent sentences, and it is difficult to read the flow of the timeline before and afterwards when searching later.

Blog entries that reprint Twitter posts as is, saying "Tweet of the Day" are hard to read, but I wonder what I'm missing.

And well, this is the kind of coherent writing and blogging [There is no law that says it's wrong.

    - [[Why go public?]]
    - In retrospect, I think it was a time of "it's easier to search publicly."
    - I think it was a time when if you wrote your own technical notes for future searches for yourself, other technicians would find and read them via search engines and reap the benefits of increased visibility.

        - The cost of creating a public blog has gone down and down, and as a result, the value has gone down.
