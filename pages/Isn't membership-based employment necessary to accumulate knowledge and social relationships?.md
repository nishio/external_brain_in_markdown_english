title: "Isn't membership-based employment necessary to accumulate knowledge and social relationships?"
---

2024-02-11
- In order to accumulate [[knowledge capital]] and [[SOC]] in a company, doesn't it have to be [[membership type]] [[employment (long term)]], rather than [[job type]]?
- Unlike money or plant equipment, which can be owned by a "corporation" separate from individual employees, knowledge is owned by individuals.
- Social relational capital is also accumulated in "concrete individuals" and "relationships between concrete individuals.
- If that is the case, then the company can only maintain these capitals if that "specific individual" remains in the company.

Even with membership-based employment, individuals still have the freedom to resign, so it is necessary to implement "measures to allow individuals to choose not to resign of their own free will".
    - [[left taken after the compulsory maternity leave]] and so on could be positioned as having been that.
    - [[Blurring of company boundaries]] and allowing individuals to take their preferred distance from the [[campfire (usually large, and for gathering and singing, etc.)]] of the company vision [Campfire Management
- Community formation in the form of "[[alumni]]" and other forms to prevent dissipation for retirees who would be external if separated by employment relationships.

Reconsider in light of these discussions

- There are three types of "knowledge."
    - A: Unlanguageable
    - B: Can be verbalized but not yet verbalized due to lack of ability or time
    - C: Linguisticized
- C can be stored in the company, detached from humans.
    - A, on the contrary, cannot be accumulated in isolation from humans.
        - (At least until craftsmanship-mimicking AI is put to practical use.)
    - So the only thing we can control is B
        - B changes to C with sufficient capacity and time, but individual inventory increases depending on workload and other factors.
        - Language is encouraged by asking questions to those who are carrying B inventory.
            - Conversations are conducted through an online text communication tool that automatically saves the exchange as a C
            - This is one of the customer values that groupware offers

- I've noticed that there are also two "social capital" books, and I've noticed some shifting interpretations between them and the reader.
    - A: Internal Relationships
    - B: External Relationships
    - I was picturing the B's.
            - [[Parallel work is an opportunity for knowledge inflow]]
            - [[There are two channels for information to flow into the organization]]
            - [[path dependency]]
    - In short, it was overly abstract about knowledge inflow channels that are tightly coupled to individuals.

- Retention strategies are needed regardless of whether it is a job or membership type.
    - This one certainly does.
    - The membership-based employment component, "[[lifetime employment]]," that's retention.
    - The "[[seniority by length of service]]" that was once used as an incentive for this is nowadays widely said to be damaging to the acquisition of young talent.
