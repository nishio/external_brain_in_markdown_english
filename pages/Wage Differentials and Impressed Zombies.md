    - [Pakistan | Monthly Income | 2008 - 2023 | Economic Indicators | CEIC](https://www.ceicdata.com/ja/indicator/pakistan/monthly-earnings)
        - Monthly income is 150USD
        - Average annual income would be about 270,000.
    - Well, here's the big picture.
        - The wage level is lower than in Japan, which means that actions are taken that would not be taken in Japan.
        - That the Internet has made it possible to communicate with people in such "different environments".
            - That the [[language barrier]] has been removed thanks to [[pictograph]], [[LLM]], and "those who make money by educating people about such acts.
