Processing information from events

Events include many events.
- Recording the event creates various pieces of information
- Scrapbox allows you to "cut out" pieces of information
    - But is the cutout really appropriate?
        - Is there a risk that important parts of the information will be cut out, resulting in content that is difficult to read?
    - Case Study: [[Unexplored Junior Shenzhen Tour 2019]].
        - The 5-day Shenzhen tour is summarized on one page ("Event Page").
        - but the parts that I found conceptually useful are cut out on a separate page. Example: [[RoboMaster2019 Finals]].
        - People who read only the event page will read [[dashigara]] after the important stuff has been cut out.

- What happened to [[Jiro Kawakita]]?
- In the first place, the means of recording were scarce, so they were recorded as fragments in the form of point memos.
        - [[A practical example of information granularity by Jiro Kawakita]]
- Those fragments were used as triggers to recall the events and details of the day and to make cards containing more detailed information.
    - Record the date, time, and collection location at this time.

So you'd rather cut everything out of the event page?
