- Summary
The Plant Metaphors offer a rich array of words and images that symbolize our minds, emotions, growth, and change. Through these metaphors, we are offered a new perspective from which to feel our connection to the natural world and ourselves, and to understand the many and varied aspects of life.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamed-project/neko/icon' alt='/unnamed-project/neko.icon' height="19.5"/>


## Editor's Postscript

- Now that the headings are in place, I distributed the bullet points.

I didn't want to make a page titled "Plant Metaphors," so I put it here, but there's a lot more here than I thought there would be.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamed-project/nishio/icon' alt='/unnamed-project/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
