*1227327883* The "I have no appetite" trap.
I don't eat because I don't have an appetite, wow I lost a lot of weight, yay!


What a bad idea! Without food intake, the body thinks it is starving and secretes cortisol. Cortisol is an adrenal corticosteroid hormone that is released when life is in danger, such as when you are under severe mental stress or in pain from an injury. Cortisol suppresses appetite, suppresses the secretion of estrogen in women (this is the reason why menstrual irregularities occur when dieting too hard), and inhibits other activities,


What a surprise, it seems that too much cortisol causes atrophy of the hippocampus, the part of the brain that controls memory! Oh no, I'm going to get demented! I need to eat something!
