<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/> The term "[[鳥居]]" (pronounced [[torii]]) in Japanese refers to a traditional gate that is most commonly found at the entrance of a [[Shinto shrine]] in Japan. These gates are iconic and symbolic structures in Japanese culture, signifying a sacred space where gods (known as [[kami]] in Shintoism) are believed to reside.

The word "torii" literally translates to "bird perch" in English, which comes from the traditional belief that the gates served as perches for roosters to welcome the sun goddess [[Amaterasu]].

Torii gates are typically made of stone or wood, with a painted vermilion red and black color scheme. They consist of two upright pillars (hashira) connected at the top by two horizontal crossbars, the upper one curved upwards and the lower one straight. This simple but distinctive design is recognized worldwide.

When you pass under a torii gate, you are said to be moving from the profane to the sacred, as it's a [[boundary]] between the physical and spiritual worlds. Respectful behavior is expected when passing through a torii, such as a small bow before entering. It's also generally considered improper to walk through the middle of the gate, as this path is thought to be reserved for the gods.

The presence and style of torii gates can vary greatly. Some shrines may have a single gate, while others may have dozens lined up, creating a pathway known as a torii tunnel. The most famous example of this is the [[Fushimi Inari]] Shrine in Kyoto, which has thousands of torii gates forming a path up a mountain.

In essence, torii gates are important symbols in Japan that demarcate the boundary between the earthly and the spiritual, reflecting the deep-rooted Shinto belief in the omnipresence of gods in nature.
