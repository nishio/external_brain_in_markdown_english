- [[priority]] is determined by [integrity

    - [[Developed with Scrapbox]]
- >  You can't prioritize in the "things I want to do" state, and you can't force it.

- Tasks are interrelated.
- > (Github Issues)relationship between multiple issues at different times.

- > More features is a bad thing.
    - >  Combining [[general-purpose small features]] is the fun part!
    - > Small features that can solve multiple requests
    - >  On the contrary, we want versatility that will give birth to uses not anticipated by the developer.

I thought this was related to the [[knowledge consistency]] I wrote on p.167 of [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]].
There is no "right answer" to "what should be prioritized" when there are multiple tasks.
This is similar to the state of not knowing if "knowledge" is "correct" or not.
It is the [[consistent theory of truth]] ([[theism]]) that brings in the criterion "knowledge that is [[coupled]] without contradiction with more things is more credible" in that state.
