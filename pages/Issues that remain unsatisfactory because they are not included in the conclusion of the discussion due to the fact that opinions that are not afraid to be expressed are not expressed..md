Issues that remain unsatisfactory because they are not included in the conclusion of the discussion due to the fact that opinions that are not afraid to be expressed are not expressed.
- Shouldn't we be able to give our opinions anonymously?
    - [[User prefers to remain anonymous.]]
- Some users have not acquired the belief that "expressing an opinion will not cause damage."
        - [[psychological safety]]
        - Belief that there is no social risk in expressing an opinion
    - I don't express my opinion because I feel it's a risk.
    - I don't feel like my opinion is incorporated into the conclusions of the council because I don't express my opinion.
    - So I'm not convinced by the conclusion.
    - Of course...
    - Nevertheless, if the goal is to "maximize the percentage of people who are [[convinced]]" when there are many people in such a state of mind, we should create opportunities for these people to express their opinions
        - I guess we'll just have to allow people to post their opinions anonymously.
        - Nishio personally can't relate to these types of people at all.
