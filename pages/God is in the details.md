> Der liebe Gott steckt im Detail" ("God dwells in the details"), a phrase attributed to the 19th century German art historian Warburg or the early 20th century architect Mies van der Rohe, is suggestive in many ways. It is so suggestive in many ways, and surprisingly, so profound that it is almost the same when the subject is changed to "[[devil]]"....
>  In the world of surface science, there is a proverb by Wolfgang [[Pauli]] that says, "God made the solid (bulk), but [[the surface was]] made by the devil. In surface science, it may be factored in from the beginning that what dwells in the details is the devil.
