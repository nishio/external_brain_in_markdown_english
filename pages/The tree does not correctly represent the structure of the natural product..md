title: "The tree does not correctly represent the structure of the natural product."

> The tree is an orderly and beautiful way of thinking and provides a simple and clear way to divide a complex whole into units, but it does not do justice to the structure of a naturally formed city, nor does it depict the structure of the city as we need it to be.
    - [[Cities are not trees.]]   [[Christopher Alexander.]]

- Is not naturally formed "knowledge" likewise [[(Christmas) tree]]?
- Only those composed [[top down]] by one or a few people are trees
- A tree is not a tree if a lot of people have come together to make it.
    - If you try to describe it as if it were a tree, you distort it.
- Made top-down v.s. made by many → [[Monastery and Bazaar]] like metaphor
