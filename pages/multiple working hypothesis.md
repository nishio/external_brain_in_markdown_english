title: "multiple working hypothesis"
---

    - [[integrative thinking]]
- Thomas C. Chamberlain
- Proposed the "Multiple Work Hypothesis" in 1980.
- When one is chasing a single hypothesis, it is inevitably easy to come back to a simple explanation for a phenomenon.
- But since many phenomena are the result of the combination of multiple factors in various proportions, multiple factors must be involved to properly explain them.
- Thus, the correct explanation is necessarily complex.

- A thinker who can contrast conflicting ideas to arrive at a new solution will have an advantage when tackling difficult problems over someone who can only follow one idea. The ability to deal with multiple opposing options simultaneously is always valuable.
