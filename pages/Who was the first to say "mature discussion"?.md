The American political philosopher John Rawls was the first to systematically propose the concept of "[[careful deliberation]]" ([[deliberation]]). In his book "[[justification]] ([[A Theory of Justice]])" (1971), he discussed [[the selection of principles of justice through deliberation]]. Rawls argued that deliberation is necessary for the formation of a just social contract, and the discussion of "[[deliberation democracy]] ([[deliberative democracy]])" developed in the subsequent fields of political philosophy and democratic theory.

In addition to Rawls, [[Jürgen Habermas]] ([[Jürgen Habermas]]) is also an important theorist of deliberative democracy, and his communication theory has influenced the concept of deliberation.
