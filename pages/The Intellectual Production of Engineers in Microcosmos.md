- Use [[CustomImages]] to put up a diagram of [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]].
- The fact that the original diagram is from a book naturally creates a sequential order and a museum-like feel.
    - But if you have the book, you might notice that the order has changed if you compare them.
    - The lack of explanatory text allows for more flexibility in placement.
- Another difference with books is that you can post the important stuff as often as you want.
    - If the same figure appears over and over again in a book, people say it's padding,
    - The same picture appearing again and again on the aisle wall is a familiar sight in advertisements.

- One of the good things about microcosmos is that you can freely decide where and how to make a pathway. If you have a fixed room and place things there, you can only "place it in the room" if you want to put an iceberg.
    - Micra has a lot of flexibility, so after building the iceberg, I could say, "Let's pull the glass to the side so we can see it from the side, and take the stairs down.
- After I got off the iceberg, I thought to myself, "Now that I'm down there, I'll dig out the lower part of the iceberg and make it a sequential route.

    - I decided to make the middle room a dead end and use a teleporter to make the two jumps.

- Mr. Moriya, who worked on VRSandbox at Unexplored Junior, has created something amazing. I can't believe he could make an animation with Enderman!
