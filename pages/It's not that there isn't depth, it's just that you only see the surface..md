title: "It's not that there isn't depth, it's just that you only see the surface."

An [[old person]] on the street was talking about how "the kids are playing [[games]] all the time, they don't have that kind of depth" kind of thing.
I'm sure that they don't even look at the game as a [[personal experience]], they just glance at the [[surface]] and [[criticize]].
And I thought that I would die without knowing the [[depth]] of the game.

    - [[Attacking something you don't know well without trying to know it.]]
    - [[Criticism is easy]]
    - [[I don't feel like teaching someone who makes fun of me.]]
