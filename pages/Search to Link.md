title: "Search to Link"
---

- From [[search (e.g. for someone using a search engine)]] to [link

- The presentation suggested "link count sorting" as a near-term goal.
- Lab-like distant goal
    - We want to support the process of structuring knowledge through programs
        - It doesn't have to be fully automatic.
    - We want the information stored in the groupware to be in a state similar to "the state where knowledge is internalized in a human being".
            - If [[a flesh-and-blood person]] has to internalize knowledge to use it, then flesh-and-blood performance becomes a bottleneck.
        - The groupware should already have accumulated information beyond the capacity of a live person.
        - I want to be able to take advantage of this.

- Not clear on "the state of internalization of knowledge in man."
    - What exactly do you want to achieve?
    - I want to be able to look at the inputs and present "what might be relevant".
        - 「 [[suggestion]] 」
        - Scrapbox can externalize associations in the form of "[[link]]"
                - [[Stock of associations]]
            - By externalizing it, it becomes possible to mechanically follow it, search for it, etc.

- However, in the current Scrapbox, "links" are manually assigned by humans
    - If you put in data from sources other than Scrapbox, it becomes a "poorly linked pile of data
        - Unfavorable
    - Still, it has the advantage of being "searchable."
        - Conversely, just importing data is just a "searchable box.

- experiment
        - [[Link Creation Support]]

- If you want to apply it to a kintone application
    - Give a record a link to another record
- Other Applications
    - Try to break up each article of the Cybozu formula into separate entries for each individual statement.
