- Automated study groups are study groups that are held online about once a month, with participants stacking topics of interest in a queue. The stacked topics are digested in order from top to bottom.
- The name of the automatic study group comes from the fact that the study sessions are held regardless of human will.
    - This system is unlikely to cause the event to be canceled due to low participation.
    - Minimize pressure on organizers
- Automatic study groups allow participants to attend without any preparation and to gain a lot of information if someone is familiar with the subject. If they are not familiar with a topic, they can learn by reading introductory websites together.
- In the automatic study sessions, I make a table of contents before I speak to avoid complete banter.
    - In addition, writing in real time on a joint memo allows even those who are not comfortable with voice chat to participate.

- The automated study group will be held online and the way it is done is still in the trial and error stage. We expect it to be customized by other communities.
- Automatic study groups can be enjoyed whether there are many participants or only three.
