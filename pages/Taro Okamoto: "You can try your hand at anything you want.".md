- Taro Okamoto
    - > Don't worry about starting something that won't last, or that you'll end up a three-day monk. It doesn't matter if it's on a whim or not. If you suddenly find something you are attracted to, just take a chance and do whatever it is you want to do, without thinking about a plan. If it doesn't work out, in other words, if it doesn't last, it doesn't matter. You should feel good about it.
