title: "Effection as an organization"
---

- I personally had understood and implemented [[effectuation]] as a [[skin feeling]] before I knew it in words, so I only thought "huh, that's how you express it", but I wonder what the conditions are for "[[organization]]" to "effectuation".
The team I'm watching now is definitely effecting as an organization, I think it's because the majority (majority?) of the members are effecting, and when they hesitate, the top management encourages effecting.
