> [kasumin_gechi](https://x.com/kasumin_gechi/status/1907681754057683337) - There is ADHD higher education
>  Sub ([[creative thinking]] and [[ability to verbalize]]) is very high, but the logistics ([[planning]] and [[ability to get things done]]) are ruined.
>  → Become a mass-production machine for "[[picture painted rice cake]]".

> [kasumin_gechi](https://x.com/kasumin_gechi/status/1907682789824278814) Politicians and managers, who are required to make highly uncertain, big-picture decisions, and researchers, who are required to be creative, can easily take advantage of their "strengths," but as a worker at the frontline level, they can only be harmful because they "talk a lot while doing little with their hands.

- The difference between focusing on painting and focusing on making rice cakes

He works brilliantly with tremendous concentration for a time, and then ruins it with everything else. If I could manage it, I could make a lot of money, but I don't have the confidence to manage it.

>  In a video I saw recently, President Makonari did a way to clear this up by doing non-urgent but important tasks together in the morning activities, which I thought was a nice device.

>  Based on the premise that it is impossible for one person to manage alone, it's better to outsource the planning of weaknesses to others.
