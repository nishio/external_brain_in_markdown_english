title: "Courage to implement ideas that you think are good."
---

- There are many people in the world with good [[IDEA]], but few with [[COURAGE]] to implement ideas they think are good.
We just have to do it [[gamely]]. --- [[Akio Morita]] [One of the founders of Sony

## courage
I want to make a resolution about courage.
- [[The courage to embark on an idea.]]
- [[Courage to admit that something is wrong with your behavior when it doesn't work]].
- [[Courage to try again after failing once]].
- [[Courage to invest time until you succeed, even if you fail again and again]].
- ⇔ [[Courage to quit after deciding that what you have spent a lot of time on is a failure]].
    - Without it, you get the [[Concorde effect]].

What is Gansha?
- [It's an investment of time.

I was watching [[The Night of the Magic Modification]] and it came up and I thought it was a good line.
