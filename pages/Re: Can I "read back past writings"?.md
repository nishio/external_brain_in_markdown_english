`? I know many of you at this camp do a lot of writing, but have you ever felt this kind of psychological barrier?`
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamedcamp/nishio/icon' alt='/unnamedcamp/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>There are no psychological barriers at all, and I can explain why.
    - Because we don't just write Japanese, we also write programs.
    - Programming rarely works as it is the first time you write it, and you spend about 10 times as much time "debugging to find bugs that you put in somewhere because you are stupid.
    - Debugging is an essential phase of creating a functioning program, so you have to read it.
    - My feeling is that it has nothing to do with liking or disliking to read.
