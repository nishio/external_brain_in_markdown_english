title: "Have Grok look up Yasukazu Nishio."

It's too interesting to let an AI do a preliminary check on who's interviewing for a job [link](https://x.com/nishio/status/1892125288148107554).
- Interesting that you suggest "interview topic tips."
- prompt: he came in for an interview and is trying to do some preliminary research. Put together a list of things that might not be on his resume.
    - I couldn't fully identify him if he just said "nishio," so I added "nishio hirokazu nishio hirokazu" and instructed him to find information that wasn't on his resume, because I found some resume-like information.
- Some of the responses to this post that made sense to me
    - People with the same name get mixed up.
        - This is for sure! Generated with high purity because I don't happen to have any major homonyms.

Since Mr. Nishio Hirokazu (Nishio Hirokazu) is coming for an interview, I will try to summarize information that may not be included in his resume, especially his personality, recent activities and interests. We will naturally organize what we can infer from public information, his transmission on X, and interviews.

[### 1. Passion for technology and learning attitude
]
- Mr. Nishio has a strong interest not only in the technology itself, but also in the principles of "why it works. For example, in his book "[[Technology Supporting Coding]]," he delves deeply into the "design philosophy behind programming languages," revealing an intellectual curiosity that goes beyond mere skill acquisition.
- As evidenced by the episode in which he received his Ph.D. at the age of 24, he has been searching for ways to learn efficiently and produce results since he was a young man. In his book "[[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]]," he systematizes how to learn, how to memorize, and how to conceive ideas, and he has a strong [[commitment to self-improvement]].
- Looking at your transmission on X, I can see that you are always [[trying to stay in touch with the forefront of technology]], trying out new tools (e.g., "[[Devin]]") and thinking about how to use them.

[### 2. Interest in social issues and digital democracy
]
- In recent activities, I have been deeply involved in "[[digital democracy]]" and "[[broad listening]]", and have worked as a member of [[Takahiro Yasuno's]] technical team for [[Tokyo gubernatorial election]] in 2024, utilizing "[[Talk to the City]]" to efficiently aggregate many opinions. I have worked on technology. This experience represents his orientation [[to give back to society through technology]].
- He is also interested in the concept of "[[Plurality]]" and is looking for ways to use technology to integrate diverse opinions and scale democratic decision-making. He is characterized by his awareness of [[Social Impact]], rather than being a mere technologist.
- He seems to see value in [[technology functioning as a public good]], mentioning the "[[Digital Public Assets Fund]]" and the "[[open source philosophy]]" on X.

[### 3. Dual employment and flexible work styles
]
    - [While working at [[Cybozu Labs]], he also serves in multiple roles, including a dual role at B-Ploud, a visiting associate professor at Tokyo Institute of Technology, and a board member of the [[General Incorporated Association Unexplored]]. I'll do multiple jobs] even if I get zero compensation," and has a strong [[mindset that prioritizes new learning and challenges]].
    - He is interested in [[teamwork]] and [[increased productivity]], and is eager to [[contribute to organizational culture]], having conducted workshops using broad listening within Cybozu.

[### 4. Personality Inference
]
- X's posts and Scrapbox (his "[[external brain]]") show that he is thoughtful and logical, but at the same time he has a sense of balance, as when he mixes private topics such as "[[climbing a mountain]] for two days in a row" into his diary. We can also glimpse a side of him that enjoys "physical challenges" such as mountain climbing, and this gives us a picture of a man with not only brains but also energy.
- They are active in open source and [[knowledge sharing]], have a habit of publishing their thoughts on Scrapbox and Notebook, and seem to value [[transparency]] and [[contributing to the community]].

[### 5. Recent Interest (as of February 2025)
]
- The latest post at X (e.g., February 17, 2025) explains the importance of discussing the "[[good]] direction" of technology, and there seems to be a growing tendency to consider the purpose and ethics of technology rather than simply advancing it.
- Scrapbox updates such as "Weekly Diary 2025-02-09~" and "Diary 2025-02-12" indicate that he continues his habit of organizing his thoughts and recording his findings on a daily basis. Recently, he has also mentioned "[[Scalability of Democracy]]" and "[[MITOU2024 Demo Day]]", and his interest in [[supporting the next generation of creators]] seems to be expanding.

[[**Tips on interview topics]].
- technical digging: His favorite "why?" to him, you may hear deep insights. For example, "What are some interesting principles of technology you've been paying attention to lately?" etc.
- Applications to Society: The topic of his interest in Digital Democracy and Plurality will give us a glimpse of his vision. If you were going to use technology to solve social problems, where would you start?" Etc.
- Private aspect: You can also lightly break the ice by talking about mountain climbing or hobbies. What was the most impressive mountain you climbed recently?" And.

We tried to focus on his "now" and "inner life" that does not appear on his resume. If you have interview objectives or specific questions, we can further refine and tailor the interview. What do you think, is there anything additional you would like to know?
