title: "Ground not required"
---

- To begin with, the Oculus Go does not need [[ground]] because it does not move continuously, but teleports
- It's not a good UI design if the lower half of the field of view is not effectively utilized due to the presence of the ground.
- I put a small board at his feet.
    - If you turn off the physics, you shouldn't even need that.
- Metaphor standing on something floating
        - [[flying carpet]]
        - [[magic square]]
        - [[cirrocumulus cloud]]
