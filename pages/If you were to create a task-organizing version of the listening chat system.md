---

I want to organize what it would be like to create a task-organizing version of a listening chat system.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of chat system is that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>As you ask questions and dig into keywords, you can only dig into one task if you use it to organize tasks as it is.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of task is the task?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>There are two states, first, it is beneficial to have this system specifically verbalize the things that are in the mind with the blurring that has not yet been verbalized. I think what doesn't work is taking care of the state where there are multiple verbalized things and prioritization is not possible.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>State that something should be done, but it is not clear what.

- Is there anything else you would like to share about this chat system?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I thought that if we came up with a different form of the current listening scenario, we could see what we have in common and what we don't have in common and make improvements.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of scenario is that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>In the listening scenario, repeat the question to the words that seem important, then ask what they value, and then ask about the relationship between the symbols that have become more concrete.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that scenario?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I am wondering if it would be possible to create another pattern for that scenario. If it were task management, I would first have them write down everything they can think of, and then ask, "Is this feasible now?" What is needed to make it feasible? and "What do I need to do to make this feasible?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is that scenario?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Not yet. It's in a state of fuzziness in my brain.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>If you have multiple tasks on your task list and you are thinking about which one to do first, and if you can verbalize which one to do first by talking to the chat system, you can do the task without worrying.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is that chat system like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Coach. There are a lot of workouts that look like they should be done, and having a coach say, "Okay, let's do this next one," reduces bias and oversight.

- Where can I find this chat system?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It would be nice to have a coach like that on my phone and be able to talk to him whenever I want.

- How do you know this chat system?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I don't know what to do.

- What should happen with this chat system?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>There needs to be more language about what kind of scenarios would be useful for task management if they could be realized.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What would need to happen in that scenario for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Need to be more specific and verbalize what questions to ask in what situations.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Can that languageization do it?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>If we do this kind of dialogue several times over time, it will gradually become more verbal.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of verbalization is that?
