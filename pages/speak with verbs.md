title: "speak with verbs"
---

> [@y_sumi](https://twitter.com/y_sumi/status/1313777524132835328?s=21): Since we are working on [[Experience Design]], I try to use "[[verb]]" instead of "noun" when discussing the world we are aiming for. We are working on [[Experience Design]]. For example, what we want to create is not a "face-counting machine" but rather "to measure the quantity and quality of daily communication (in terms of the number of people who meet face-to-face).

- [[Experience = verb]]
- [[personal experience]]
relevance
    - [[obsession with the nominative form]]
