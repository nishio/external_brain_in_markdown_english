The "seisan" system is a traditional Japanese [[decision-making process]] that takes a [[bottom-up]] type approach. Proposals usually start with middle management and are circulated to all managers involved.

The approval system has four stages: proposal, circulation, approval, and record keeping. Informal discussions ([[making necessary arrangements]]) prior to the proposal also play an important role.

3. a formal proposal (approval document) is prepared and circulated to each department for approval. Approval is given under the personal seal of the manager.

4. the final approval of the president is a decision, but the president's decision is often based on the approval of other executives.

5. an effective approval system requires harmony among employees, well-organized communication, common understanding and values.

Although there is criticism that it takes time to reach consensus, it is highly regarded as a [[collective decision-making]] process in which [[everyone participates]].

As described above, the approval system is a unique decision-making process that has taken root in Japanese companies and is an important mechanism for creating a sense of organizational unity. However, it has been pointed out that there are some challenges in cross-cultural business in the midst of globalization.
