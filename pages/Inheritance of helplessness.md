    - > I wonder if there are cases where parents with a half-hearted understanding of IT create an aura of "programming is difficult" and this propagates to their children. I'm thinking about it.

- I think there are many adults who, implicitly or explicitly, give an aura of "you can't do it" when a child tries to challenge something they have tried and failed at, or something they have never tried without thinking they could do it, not just in IT. And [[sense of helplessness]] is [[inheritance]].
- We need a filter that converts "X makes it impossible to do" into "It can be done, and even if it doesn't go smoothly, there is a way out, but X makes it impossible, so be careful about that.
- Helplessness is a contagious disease, and as an adult you can take steps to "keep your distance if you see an infected person," but it's very difficult when you're a child and your parents are infected.

    - > Many parents (both explicitly and implicitly) want their children to "do well," and by that logic, it's better to [[stay away from things that are likely to fail]], right? [[Praise them for doing well]] Parents usually do. It's very hard to get them to understand otherwise. I think it's partly because those guardians have been imprinted on them since they were children, too.
        - I think the definition of "doing well" may be at odds with the guardian's and my own.
        - Doing well" means trying many "things that can go wrong," succeeding in some of them, and of course making many mistakes, but they don't happen, and as a result, when outsiders look at you after the fact, you become "a person with some amazing achievements.
            - [[Trying a lot leads to success]].

        - [[Propagation of hidden hostility]]
        - Parent A stops Child B from doing X, which Child B is trying to do.
        - Child B feels anger but perseveres. That becomes [hidden enmity
        - When grandson C tried to do X, child B said, "I was made to quit, why you! and gets angry and makes grandson C stop his behavior.
