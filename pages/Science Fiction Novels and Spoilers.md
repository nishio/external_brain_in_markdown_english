title: "Science Fiction Novels and Spoilers"
---

- [[science fiction novel]] is an exercise in thinking, "What could happen if these possibilities are possible" or "What could happen if these assumptions are made?" but when you run into the idea that "[[spoiler]] is not good" and you think, "Oh, I see, if these assumptions are made, this could happen! I can't write "I see, this is what would happen with these assumptions!" I can't write "I see, this is what happens when you have these assumptions! What a waste.
