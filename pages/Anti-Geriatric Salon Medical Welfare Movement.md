Anti-Saro has two meanings: narrow and broad:
- Narrowly defined anti-saro movement:
    - Critical movement against subsidized health care for the elderly (a health care system that is overly kind to the elderly)
    - As a specific problem, he pointed out the low medical cost burden of 20% for those aged 70 and over and 10% for those aged 75 and over.
    - The argument is that this low burden creates excessive demand for medical care, leading to an increased burden on the working-age population.
    - Includes criticism of the preferential treatment of the elderly in both the medical and long-term care systems

- Anti-Saro movement in the broadest sense:
    - [Raising Questions about the State of the Welfare State
    - Criticism of the attitude of medical associations and practitioners
    - Raising the issue of inefficiencies in the healthcare system in general
    - e.g., [[granting prescribing rights to pharmacists]], promoting [[zero-selling]], and other arguments for [[improving the efficiency of the health care system]].

Movement Characteristics:
- Relatively new social movement that began in the fall of 2022
- Mainly via Twitter and street demonstrations.
- Not necessarily intended as a confrontation with the elderly, but rather a critique of excessive welfare in general.
    - [[Thatcher]]-style market-oriented approach.

This movement has the character of [[raising issues from the younger generation]] against the [[generational gap]] and inefficiency in the Japanese healthcare and welfare systems.
