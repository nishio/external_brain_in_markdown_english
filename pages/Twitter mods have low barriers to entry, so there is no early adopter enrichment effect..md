Twitter mods have [[low barriers to entry]], so there is no [[early adopter concentration effect]].

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1714187683952840892) Why don't you move to the new Twitter mod, I was verbalizing to myself a long time ago!
>  [[Twitter mod]] has low [[barriers to entry]], so there's no point in going there because [[early adopter]] won't be filtered out - I guess...
>  No point in going unless the UI is completely different from Twitter.
- > [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/954658727096823809) The problem of social networking sites that have old men in them is over, this can be explained by the social capital aspect.
- >  Initially, the network converts to [[SOC]] because of all the early adopters.
- >  When laggardly old men come in, they don't increase social capital when they connect, but rather they mount up and suck up social capital.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1714190962694766933) However, even for the clubhouse, the days of early adopters being filtered and interesting are over in about 2 weeks, so this Maybe this way of thinking is already old...

- > [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1714206995296014485) I have an account, but it's like, umm ......
- >  Invitability is not yet a barrier to entry
- >  I'd like to see a little more [[literacy hurdle]].
- > [niku_name](https://twitter.com/niku_name/status/1714217347677122731) I see...I think Twitter has grown along with everyone having smartphones, so by analogy, I wonder if social networking sites suited to the hardware that everyone will have next will become popular. I wonder if there will be a social networking service that is suited to the hardware that everyone will have next. Or a SNS that incorporates AI in a good way.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1738826218794111050) Humans, in fact, don't want to have any kind of conversation with an unspecified number of humans, so they will talk to AI. Humans explicitly "following" other humans [[the concept of "social networking" itself is archaic]] will be replaced by [[personalized AI]] "understanding [[preferences]]" that "this person likes this kind of conversation".

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1714288055400706227) I've been saying for a long time that [[Scrapbox]] is the next SNS, but the literacy hurdle is so high that it's hard to get more people.
>  Get off your ass and free yourself from old-fashioned notions like "[[post]]", homo sapiens.
- > [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1714297744586928325) I like the Etherpad one where the background is colored for each person who wrote it, I hope that one gets implemented soon!
- >  To feel a sense of co-editing afterwards, that is very good!
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1714426449883767203) I think coloring is just a View issue, since there is data for the updater ID for each row, but the icon notation is sufficient and explicit, so it's not implemented. I wonder if this is not implemented.
