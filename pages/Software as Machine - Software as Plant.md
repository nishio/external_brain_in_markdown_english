title: "Software as Machine / Software as Plant"
---

As a mental model for creating software

How to make it machine-like
- Making parts
- Verify that the parts are correct.
- Putting those parts together to make something bigger.

How to make it plant-like
- Instruct asynchronous AI agents and leave them alone for a while
- When I see how they're doing, they can grow up nice or they can grow up weird.
    - It's not plant-like to do that just by saying, "Grow more this way!"
    - If I were to use a plant analogy, it would be like the vine of a morning glory that is not wrapped around where you want it to wrap around, but has started to wrap around something different than what you expected, so you have to unwind it and rewrap it.
    - If things go very wrong, cut branches or throw away the whole plant.

relevance
    - [[Let it grow and then prune it]]
