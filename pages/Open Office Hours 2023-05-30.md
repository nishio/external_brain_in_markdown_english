[[Israel]]: impact on studying abroad and starting a business
- Startups: the highest number per capita in the world." Startup Naion".
- Spin-out from the military: The military plays a talent discovery, hands-on training, and incubation function. Military connections are strong and ideal for finding entrepreneurial friends.
- Strong security
- [[8200部隊]]があるからですかね？<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The ←8200 unit is only part of the story, but yes.
    - [What is the Israel Defense Forces' "Unit 8200" that creates cyber companies? | Forbes JAPAN Official Website](https://forbesjapan.com/articles/detail/46945)
    - [Unit 8200 - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/8200部隊)

- [[military affairs]] A realization that there are seeds of radical startups in technology. Searched for.
- [How the Tomahawk Missile "Pinpoint Bombing" is performed.
    - The CEP ([[Circular Error Probability]]) is raised by matching satellite data acquired in advance with observation information acquired by Tomahawk's own onboard cameras and sensors.
    - The initial idea was that this could be applied to [[drone]] and used for "[[pinpoint delivery]]" of buildings, etc.
        - [[GPS]] accuracy should not be enough, and vertical directional information is also expected to be necessary for a practical drone society.
        - Thesis Statement.
- Pinpoint ≒ If you can get a point, you can draw a line.
    - It could be used to design [[drone flight routes]].
    - It is the 3D data that is acquired both before and now.
    - The business was set up as "[[map for automatic drone flight]]" and started. Funding happened to go well.
    - However, the spread of drones has been much slower than expected. The direction of the project has changed as there is almost no use expected in urban areas.
- Pivot to "[[Map for self-driving cars]]."
    - Considering the market, expansion to the U.S. is a must. The company was reorganized and became a U.S. corporation headquartered in San Francisco.
    - More failures. Two causes of defeat.
    1. Building a [[human network]] in the U.S. ([[sales force]]) is a hurdle.
            - You can't even make a sales appointment without going into the [[inner circle]].
        - Need to build up [[SOC]] in the US
    2. technical capabilities. It attracts some of the strongest people in the US. A start-up guide who has lived in the area for a long time says to me, "What you are trying to do is like watching a Super Bowl (football) game and asking if you can be a part of it. I can hear the sound of your spine breaking". It wasn't far off.
        - [[Waymo]] [Waymo - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ウェイモ)
            - > A self-driving car development company under Alphabet, created on December 13, 2016 through the spin-off of Google's self-driving car development division.
        - The core members are from the [[Google Maps]] team. Maps are extremely important in automated driving technology.
- Currently moving to Street View service for humans

[[OpenStreetMap]] : [[Mapbox]] : [[GoogleMap]]
Why Mapbox was able to become a unicorn
- GoogleMap API is expensive.
- Diversification of map design
- Google is not trying to make it easy for individual companies to use.
- Maybe there's a tendency in Google to focus on big commerce because it's hard to be valued for doing things that meet the diverse needs of individual small companies.
    - Google is truncating the long tail, so there are opportunities buried in the truncated long tail for other companies to become unicorns.
- Like GCP, Google is basically a "lordly" business and is not customer oriented.

Will we move from linguistic data to environmental data in the long term?
- Currently, LLM has evolved using linguistic data only because linguistic data is "easy" to collect
- Training data for image generation AI and data for text-to-image correspondence were needed.
    - The base is data on img tags and their ALT texts collected by crawling the Internet
    - Frankly, it's a pile of garbage, but it still got to the point where [[Stable Diffusion]] could generate images.
    - Then, after seeing that release, [[NovelAI]] did additional training on data from [[Danbouru]], "a site where humans are tagging illustrations with beans," and the "subjective ratings of fans of illustrations" regarding the generation of illustrations jumped!
- Take the easy data first, and eventually you will need "harder data".
    - We can't predict when that demand will jump.

Where does the Mapbox data come from?
- OSM-based
- It's just a bunch of data, no usability or design.
- After all, neither OSM nor GoogleMap were taking a close look at unfulfilled customers to identify "what customers really want"!
- What about [[Mapillary]]?
    - private-sector business
    - Users contribute data by allowing users to create StreetViews.
    - Acquired by Meta.

Operational Know-How
- When data is needed, there is a big difference in the cost of data between "entities that only do data acquisition" and "entities that can acquire data while doing business".
- Using a large number of people to collect data is a bottleneck in the education of that large number of people.
    - Operational knowledge of how to structure and educate people to collect data without expertise will be valuable.
- Being able to brush up on that knowledge while doing business in the long term would be a differentiator.
- The strategy of making high-risk, high-return investments in surplus to meet the demand we see now and generate revenue to sustain the organization in the long term makes sense.
        - [[Barbell Strategy]]

Large amounts of data, storage billing a problem?
- That's as far as we can go...
- You should consider whether the huge video and photo data itself is a differentiating factor
- Danbouru's data that generated significant impact in the NovelAI case study was "a small amount of, but well-tagged data".
- Value could be created not in the video or photo data by itself, but in the data that corresponds to it with other information.
- If I were a "super person who can put all the stored data in my brain," it might be good to think about what correspondence would make each specific job easier!
