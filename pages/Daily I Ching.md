- Daily I Ching: Three Hundred and Eighty-Four Stories
    - [[Kunio Takama]]
    - >  As a hobby and life's work, I am continuously studying public philosophy, Christianity, Hinduism, and Buddhism. As a result of his 50 years of study with the I Ching, he has come to understand that the I Ching has a worldview that combines the principles of [[learning organization]] and [[autonomous decentralized organization]] with the advantages of [[governance structure (e.g., of a company)]], and that it preaches a way of life that adapts a self-interested and altruistic moral philosophy to daily situations. It teaches a way of life that adapts the moral values of self-interest and altruism to daily situations.
    - It was not Senge's "The Learning Organization" but another book with a similar name, I misunderstood at first.

It's interesting that the commentary says "in my own way."
- The question "What should I do?" is not appropriate; "How about this?" "What is the situation?" "What attitude should I take in this situation?" is better.
- If there are two options, divine each, both good or both bad

        - [[Odo Mumon, there are a thousand roads]]
- Do not divine the same thing twice. If the meaning is not clear after divination, reverse the divination by saying, "Well, what if I don't do this?
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>This is interesting.
- Some people avoid dice, but my experience is that they produce a decent oracle, are easy to carry, and take very little time."
