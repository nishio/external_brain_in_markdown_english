title: "OSS is dumping"

> [kmizu](https://twitter.com/kmizu/status/1781460060562157831) "The point of [[OSS]] is dumping" was something my boss at my part-time job said when other [[IDEs]] died out with the advent of [[Eclipse]], and I resented it at the time. I was repulsed at the time, but nowadays I think it's still [[dumping]] economically. (This "dumping" has its positive side, but I think it also had a significant negative side.)

    - > (1980's) A pioneer of integrated development environments that combined an editor, compiler, debugger, profiler, etc., which are common today, and combined with its unparalleled compilation speed, it made a huge impact on program developers at the time.
    - > (Early 2000s) "JBuilder" (J-Builder) grows steadily in the fast-growing Java market, kicking rivals to the curb.
    - > JBuilder, which had been the mainstay of the company, declined due to the spread of Eclipse, an integrated development environment released free of charge by IBM, and its restructuring.

>  I think there is a great deal to be said for the primitive economic design (no boundaries [[common property economy]]) and the religious (reciprocal relationship of free service and unconditional respect by the able-bodied), which excessively excluded any other options.

> [kmizu](https://twitter.com/kmizu/status/1781594211189686688) Yes, ....... OSS has a religious aspect, and in its early days, many people still understood the philosophical aspects of OSS other than its license. However, now that the number of "believers in OSS" is overwhelmingly small, the primitive economic design supported by this belief is also getting old.
>  I don't think that the current younger generation (late 20's) in particular is aware of the OSS story that OSS is free as a license, but in principle does not allow [[free ride (e.g. on train)]] and requires some kind of [[contribution]] to the community. I don't think I've ever heard of it.

> [kmizu](https://twitter.com/kmizu/status/1781594483911806988) This area is probably closer to [[free software]] than to OSS, but the delicate distance between the free software movement and OSS is too complicated for an outsider to discuss. I think it would be too complicated for an outsider to say much about the delicate distance between the free software movement and OSS.
