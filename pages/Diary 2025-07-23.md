- [[Transparency and information flooding]]

Experience and information are scattered all over the place.

I'm wary of people who come to me after they've been successful.
- Because the percentage of people with a [[taker]] disposition to benefit from being part of a successful group jumps.
    - This is also [[Organizational Identification]].
- But, well, a lot of people try to get a job with a company that's already established.
    - A few people try to work in ventures that are not yet sure if they will be successful
            - [[risk tolerance]]
    - Many people are unaware that this mentality creates a huge culture gap between venture founders

> [ume_keizai](https://x.com/ume_keizai/status/1947827074967998700) I am very happy that the party became a national political party and that Mr. Anno was elected. On the other hand, we are also seeing the spreading of various discourses, to which supporters who were active on SNS during the election are emotionally rebutting. It is important to correct the facts while providing sources if they are different from the facts. But I would be careful about anger.
> [ume_keizai](https://x.com/ume_keizai/status/1947835449424417062) Let's do it with a high perspective and high morals. I think that is the strength and flexibility of those of us who supported Team Mirai.

By the way, it's four months after August, so you're right about the 150 million being about 1/3 of the total.

Well, aside from whether the Communist Party receives it and invests it in public goods, I'm hoping that it will draw attention to the fact that each political party that receives it uses it for various purposes, and for what purposes.
