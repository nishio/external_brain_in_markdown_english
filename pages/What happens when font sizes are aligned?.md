title: "What happens when font sizes are aligned?"

Wouldn't it be better to have matching font sizes? I don't think so. I don't think so, but it's an easy experiment, so let's try it.

When font size is aligned

Original Implementation

For policies that set the size of stickies to fixed, it is clear that matching font sizes will look terrible.
- Changing the size of stickies based on the amount of content is difficult to do with the current implementation, so I'll pass. But I think it's not good because organized short keywords will be smaller and unorganized long ones will be larger.
