1. panel overview
- speaker
    - Scott Moore (Public Works / one of the founders of Gitcoin)
    - Cheeky Gorilla (Protocol Guild core contributor)
    - Shinya Mori (moderator: research and public funding systems at Frum Ventures and other firms)
- theme
    - "How to support the funding of public goods in virtual currencies, especially ethereum."

2. focus on public goods brought about by virtual currency
- Open source projects like Ethereum are "infrastructure that anyone can use," but the challenge is that maintainers/developers are not adequately compensated
- Government and traditional grants have been insufficient in the past, but there is a growing movement to "support public goods" through virtual currency mechanisms and community culture

3. background on [[Gitcoin]] and QF ([[Quadratic Funding]])
- Gitcoin Adopts Quarterly Quadratic Funding (QF) to Expand Matching Funds for Community Giving
- QF is a system in which a large matching amount is determined by "how many people have supported the project, even in small amounts".
- Successful examples include [[Uniswap]], [[Optimism]], [[Tornado Cash]], and other leading projects that have received initial support and grown significantly.

How [[Protocol Guild]] works
- Protocol Guild is a mechanism that provides long-term financial incentives for developers and researchers (approximately 180 people) who support the core protocols of Ethereum
- Donation and vesting of native tokens (e.g., for 4 years) to help core developers continue to develop ethereum instead of going to other companies' offers.
- Self-curation method: parties involved in the process build consensus to add or remove members.
- However, since there is a limit to the number of members, the possibility of another guild, such as the "Tool Developers' Guild," is being discussed.

5. the dilemma of supporting public goods
- Focusing on inclusivity can support a large number of projects in a decentralized manner, but risks including noise and low quality projects
- Focusing on exclusivity can more accurately support key developers, but may be too narrow in scope and result in oversights.
- Quadratic Funding and Protocol Guild are complementary to each other as a broad and limited solicitation type, respectively.

6. future prospects
- The "guild" format allows for efficient incentive allocation by allowing a small group of people to self-curate in a focused area.
- In addition to Ethereum Core development, there are moves to establish guilds in other areas such as ZK technology and tool development
- Public goods financing is still being explored, with numerous experiments underway, including Gitcoin and the Protocol Guild

How to get involved with the Protocol Guild
- Non-engineers can also contribute by helping to run the Protocol Guild (operations, fundraising, public relations coordination, etc.)
- As with the core developers, "building long-term relationships" is essential for the continuation of operations

summary
- The emergence of virtual currencies has brought renewed attention to the question of how to support global "public goods"
- Broad QFs like Gitcoin and centralized support measures for core developers like the Protocol Guild complement each other
- Financial incentives to prevent core development from leaving and reliable self-curation are keys to the future.
- Public goods financing efforts are still in their infancy, exploring sustainable mechanisms through much experimentation and learning
