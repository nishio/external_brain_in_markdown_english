Continuous translation" was achieved in [[pScrapboxAutoTrans2023-04-18]].
- What is Continuous Translation?
    - [[Continuous Translation]]
    - The concepts of [[Continuous Integration]] and [[Continuous Delivery]] exist in software development.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Explain shortly about continuous integration and continuous delivery.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt-4/icon' alt='gpt-4.icon' height="19.5"/>Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) are software development practices aimed at improving the efficiency, speed, and quality of software releases.
    - Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of automatically building, testing, and integrating code changes from multiple developers as they are committed to a shared repository. This helps to identify and fix integration problems quickly, reducing the risk of merging conflicts and ensuring a consistent codebase.
    - Continuous Delivery (CD) is the practice of automating the deployment of software changes to various environments (e.g., testing, staging, production) after they pass through the CI process. This ensures that new features, bug fixes, and updates are released to users more quickly and with higher quality, as they are thoroughly tested and validated before deployment.
- Together, CI/CD streamline the software development lifecycle, enabling teams to rapidly iterate, improve, and deliver high-quality software with reduced risk and shorter time-to-market.

- Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery share common patterns such as automation, frequent updates, rapid feedback, and quality assurance. Applying these patterns to the domain of translation and international communication, we can propose a new concept called "Continuous Translation".
- Continuous Translation (CT) could be a system where translations and cross-cultural communication are constantly updated, improved, and refined using automated processes, similar to CI/CD. Key components of Continuous Translation could include:
    - Automation: Leverage machine learning and AI-powered translation tools to automatically translate content as it is created or updated, minimizing manual intervention.
    - Frequent Updates: Implement a system where translations are continuously updated to reflect changes in the source content, ensuring that international audiences always have access to the latest information.
    - Rapid Feedback: Integrate feedback mechanisms (e.g., user suggestions, professional translators' input) to quickly identify and correct translation errors or inconsistencies, leading to higher-quality translations over time.
    - Quality Assurance: Establish a process to automatically test and validate translations, verifying their accuracy and fluency before they are released to end-users.
    - Collaboration: Foster an environment where developers, translators, and other stakeholders work together, ensuring a seamless integration of translation processes into the content creation workflow.
- Continuous Translation would enable organizations to efficiently deliver up-to-date, accurate, and high-quality translated content to global audiences, resulting in improved communication, better user experiences, and stronger international relationships.

(DeepL) [[Continuous Integration]] and [[Continuous Delivery]] share common patterns of automation, frequent updates, rapid feedback, and quality assurance. By applying these patterns to the domain of translation and international communication, we can propose a new concept of "continuous translation.
- Continuous Translation (CT), like CI/CD, is a system in which translation and cross-cultural communication are constantly updated, improved, and refined using automated processes. the main components of Continuous Translation are
        - Automation: Utilizes machine learning and AI-powered translation tools to automatically translate content as it is created and updated, minimizing manual intervention.

        - Rapid feedback: The incorporation of feedback mechanisms (e.g., suggestions from users, opinions of professional translators, etc.) allows for quick identification and correction of translation errors and inconsistencies, resulting in higher quality translations over time.
            - Ah, I see. This is so hard to achieve with Scrapbox.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Quality Assurance Establish a process to automatically test translations and verify accuracy and fluency before delivering them to end users.
            - I wonder if "automatically test translations" means that the LLM reads them and gives feedback on what he/she doesn't understand?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Collaboration: Developers, translators, and other stakeholders work together to create an environment that seamlessly integrates the translation process into the content creation workflow.
            - This is the same developer and translator now, so I wouldn't worry about it.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Ongoing translation enables organizations to efficiently deliver up-to-date, accurate, and high-quality translated content to global audiences, improving communication, enhancing user experience, and strengthening international relationships.
    - Efficiently deliver up-to-date, accurate, high-quality translated content to a global audience" sounds like a good mission.

- > I wish I could quantitatively determine if it's getting better.
- Considering that continuous execution is now possible and we are in the quality improvement phase, it is strange that there are no [[metrics]] to measure the quality (software engineering context).
