- An illustration of what a [[PhD]] is. I saw a picture that expresses the claim that a PhD is to reach the [[edge of human knowledge]] by increasing [[expertise]], and to expand it by pushing the edge for a few years.

- [[Dr. D.'s job is to push the edges of civilization.]]

On the other hand, one of the blind spots of this picture is that by representing the boundaries of human knowledge as circles, it incorrectly states that "the distance to any boundary is constant.
In fact, while people gather and are strongly pushed in "well-known specialty areas," there is a large valley between these specialties, and there is a shortage of people to fill the valley with multiple specialties.

- [[Valleys between specialties]] (related: [[Assumption that it is a circle]])

Movement to further promote sharp "specialty areas

Movement to fill the valley between specialties
- After having a certain level of expertise, expand into adjacent areas rather than deepening that expertise.
