"Many people answered the question as happy, and this was not measuring the degree of happiness, but was in effect classifying the unhappy and the rest. As a result, we were seeing a correlation curve of unhappy people."

For the low happiness group, happiness does not increase after a certain level of income. However, the group with an average level of happiness is not satiated by income, and in the group with a high level of happiness, conversely, the increase in happiness accelerates as income increases.

> [r_ima](https://twitter.com/r_ima/status/1723679720959832181) One of the reasons that led to the wrong conclusion in the first famous paper was the content of the question, as you can see in Fig 1A, many people answered the question as happy, and this did not measure the degree of happiness. This was not a good way to measure the degree of happiness, but was in effect a classification of unhappy people and the rest of the population. As a result, a correlation curve of unhappy people could be seen.

It seems I was experiencing life with four times my annual income for the past two days.

> [r_ima](https://twitter.com/r_ima/status/1723879855966847361) (Added) The author's interpretation of why a group of unhappy people's happiness does not increase with increased income is that problems that cannot be solved even with higher income, such as illness or bereavement are the cause of unhappiness, such as illness or bereavement.

> [r_ima](https://twitter.com/r_ima/status/1723887689848734035) (PS 2) The $75k is frequently cited, but the original paper compares income ranges 60-90k, 90k-120k, and 120k+, and up to 60-90k. 90k is the correct threshold since it states that happiness increases with rising income but is FLAT above 90k. 75k is simply the middle value of 60-90k. Also note that the data is for 2008-2009 and inflation in recent years.
