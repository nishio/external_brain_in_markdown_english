I fell asleep after dinner, slept for 10 hours and woke up, sleep debt eliminated.


> [tokoroten](https://x.com/tokoroten/status/1808565962364571792) I've changed my mind about elections a lot since I looked into how the US presidential primaries work.
>
>  In the process of narrowing down the field of candidates in the primaries, a game is played to see how the remaining candidates can capture the supporters of the candidates who dropped out of the primaries.
>
>  Then there would be a number of times when minorities would have the casting vote,
>  Remaining candidates will be forced to make policy proposals and changes to better engage supporters of the losing candidate.
>
>  Also, it is always visible which minorities are holding how many votes, so a structure is created where information on dead votes is meaningful.
>
>  So, the dead ballots are information about the winner, so let's make sure we leave the right information.

> [tokoroten](https://x.com/tokoroten/status/1808574618309177629) Voting for candidates on the winning side is effective in terms of getting involved in electing politicians,
>  I guess you could vote for a one-issue bubble candidate, since there's no information left in terms of giving the winner information about "how many people are interested in what".

> [tokoroten](https://x.com/tokoroten/status/1808574995863589232) So, I'm afraid that the statement "No, because XXX is not going to be accepted" is a statement of a lack of understanding of the flow of information through the dead ballot.

> [tokoroten](https://x.com/tokoroten/status/1808577466237341896) Maybe the term "dead vote" is too negative.
>
>  Can't you rephrase it in a positive way that includes the meaning of "information left for the winners"?
>
>  Hmmm, opinion polls, or words to that effect, very good!
>  This would make sense for a one-issue type candidate.

> [30years_over](https://x.com/30years_over/status/1808747277143715967) I think that's the system assumption with the preselection.
>  In this gubernatorial election, I can't vote for Mr. Anno because he has no intention of winning.
>  Why? Because the disadvantages are too great if Renho Ishimaru wins.
>  >tokoroten: So I'm afraid that the statement "No, because XXX is not going to be accepted" is a statement that you don't understand the flow of information through the dead ballot.


> [9m](https://x.com/9m/status/1808730817532998097) I think it's true that Mr. Yasuno can get more votes if he wears his hair cropped and parted, but the fact that he knows that and doesn't bend his policy is a statement in itself, and yet people who say that about his hair still say that. I hope you are aware that you are forcing that attitude on others on a regular basis - don't act like an old baseball player.

> [deodora](https://x.com/deodora/status/1808726018464874511) I'm looking at Anno's github.
>  This is a self-serving image, but I think the people who can issue issues and comment on github are young people to some extent, and if there are so many discussions and opinions, it does not mean that young people are not interested in politics, but that there are not enough mechanisms to include the opinions of young people, or it is deliberately so. I think it's deliberate.

I interpreted that he didn't mention the name because he wanted the people of Tokyo to make their own choice. I'm sorry, but I don't want this to turn into an election campaign within the post, just "let's go out and vote".

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1808405488201355756) However, we know that there are many people who cannot openly support the candidates because of various reasons, for example, "I cannot campaign because I am an employee of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government" or "I cannot campaign because I am an employee of a university. We know that there are many people who cannot openly support a candidate. There are also those who support us in a way that does not mention a specific candidate's name. We are very grateful for their support.

> [wagashi_no_yosa](https://x.com/wagashi_no_yosa/status/1808295445611045293) It has been pointed out before why sociology only studies minorities. I think one of the reasons is the idea of "cognitive privilege" that "more accurate knowledge is more likely to be produced from marginal social positions". Majorities have difficulty seeing their own society objectively.

> [Dgoutokuji](https://x.com/Dgoutokuji/status/1808346670209663438) The governor's race is said to have a lot of advance voting. I was happy to hear that they are pushing for Renho, but I was scolded by a well-informed person for being naive. The Soka Gakkai has been given a big mandate and they are visiting the city. The Liberal Democratic Party is also desperate to consolidate its votes, and I was told not to underestimate their organizational votes. They told me not to believe the turnout at the town meetings. I suddenly felt uneasy, but yes, it is precisely because people are uneasy that they move.

Suspicions have surfaced that Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike and the Nippon Foundation were involved in the trafficking of these "Baby Life" children.

Ms. Yuriko Koike, who said she would correct the black box, was herself a black box. The person who applied for the project, the person who approved the project, the person in charge of the bidding, the same person.

I agree with the idea of promoting Japan's economic recovery from Tokyo through digital democracy and support for technicians, and I believe that only he can realize a system that reflects the voice of the people at this speed, through the concrete practice of participatory politics using GitHub.

I was also surprised that the administrative structure of the capital of Japan advertises the projected lights but does not post any call for voting for the Tokyo gubernatorial election. It's not a matter of jurisdiction. There is nothing wrong with posting "go vote for a better future." Discovery to those who don't want voter turnout to go up.

> [hikarin22](https://x.com/hikarin22/status/1806144447501275201) By the way, I'm sorry if this sounds like a chubby thing to say, but women with a certain level of communicative ability have the ability to understand what the other person is trying to say, so saying "I lied" is not a problem. So, it is not a problem if she says "I lied". In other words, women who are distrustful of this statement and give NG are in other words....... It can be said that it was a good decision to break up with her because she has a high landmine rate.

> [hikarin22](https://x.com/hikarin22/status/1806119900794298469) In a case where a woman declines a marriage because she is tired of being lied to immediately by her partner in a marriage, I wondered why the male partner's occupation is always an engineer. I wondered why, so I looked it up. Apparently, engineers have a culture of saying "I'm sorry, I lied" when they make a wrong statement.

I was happy to hear that they are pushing for Renho, but I was scolded by a well-informed person for being naive. The Soka Gakkai has been given a big mandate and they are visiting the city.

> [hazuma](https://x.com/hazuma/status/1808767551847194745) These arguments are really silly. It's fine to talk about the importance of the forests and that it's not good to go under the sun, but please don't let that lead you into a messed up discussion. Private property cannot be nationalized and the state cannot run a shrine. I wish leftist scholars would also stop making childish arguments by denying private property and acting like radicals.
> [hazuma](https://x.com/hazuma/status/1808770085034864651) Opposition to capitalism is meaningless. It made some sense in the political situation during the Cold War, but it doesn't even make sense now. I'm really sick and tired of the fact that we are still in an era where saying such things will make you a star in the debates and activists will follow you.
> [hazuma](https://x.com/hazuma/status/1808769649917710341) Family and private property are the very source of inequality. But when that sense is gone, love and desire are gone. That's why it's so difficult. If you solve the problem by shouting that private ownership is bad, it's a quick story. What is important is that as long as human beings are human beings, there are inevitable limitations, and we should think about a "better" society based on this resignation.
> [hazuma](https://x.com/hazuma/status/1808767980274397503) As I wrote in "Philosophy of Correctability", the denial of family and private property goes back to Plato. It's not a new idea. On the flip side, intellectuals have been saying for ages that the world would be a better place if we got rid of the family and private property, and that hasn't happened at all. Starting from that limitation is really an intelligent argument.
> [hazuma](https://x.com/hazuma/status/1808770230141006235) I'm kind of mad.
>  The story does not stop at Meiji Jingu Gaien.
> [hazuma](https://x.com/hazuma/status/1808771459369873607) If you want to make Jingu Gaien such a national common property, why don't you just buy it from Meiji Jingu Shrine with taxpayer money and make it a national property? Make a public commitment like that.
> [hazuma](https://x.com/hazuma/status/1808771891500626381) The worst thing that can happen is to force the "public" on a private business and then when that business runs out of money and is struggling and wants to do something else, you get in the way, saying that the place belongs to everyone. It is the worst thing you can do. If that is the case, the park should be properly managed as a national or metropolitan park from the beginning.
