> [@ichiro_sakaki](https://twitter.com/ichiro_sakaki/status/1607303776230313984?s=46&t=GwYVDn4Q-mJcTuhLcirwvg): I was told by a writer I knew once, and I've always remembered it. I've been thinking about it for a long time.
> "Whether it's characterization or world setting, don't define it with a negative statement."
> I sometimes see this in the settings of amateurs, but I see it as 'not a Yankee' or 'not strong-minded' or something like that.
> Maybe the person who wrote it thinks he is defining it properly.

- [[negative sentence]] 　 [[negative form]]
- [[Negative instructions are difficult to understand.]]
