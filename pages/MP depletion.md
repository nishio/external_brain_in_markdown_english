title: "MP depletion"
---

What exactly is being referred to in the metaphor of MP depletion?

Example
- When you're working on a project with no finish line in sight, something gets lost, and you lose the energy to move forward.
- Tasks that take a long time to accomplish are unbearable without MP.
        - Is the MP metaphor appropriate?
- When MP is reduced, the antenna that gathers information from the surroundings stops working.
