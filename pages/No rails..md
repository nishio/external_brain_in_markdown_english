title: "No rails."
---

- If you prepare lecture slides in advance, you will speak about the content of the slides
    - If I didn't prepare slides in the [[Classes are physical education]] style, I was told that "the story would [[derailment]] at a high speed."
- Or rather, there is no [[rail]] in the first place.
- The concept of "no rails" seemed important to me!
