title: "Do not attempt synchronous communication via text chat"

> [Nkzn](https://twitter.com/Nkzn/status/1785125370972549129/history) I recently had the opportunity to write a communication guideline for internal use, "If you don't respond immediately to [[text chat]], you are inefficient So it forces [[synchronous communication]] on each other, not [[asynchronous communication]]. If you want to maximize [[the benefits of asynchronous communication]], start the conversation with content that can be responded to back and forth a bit. If you are in a hurry and want to communicate synchronously, consider [[video chat]], [[phone]], or [[face-to-face]] conversations to maximize the speed of synchronous communication. I wrote something like "text chat is not suitable for synchronous communication, so do not attempt synchronous communication.

> [Nkzn](https://twitter.com/Nkzn/status/1785125984062312503) So, well, if you want to maximize the [[agility]] of your organization through synchronous communication that requires immediate response, whether in a real or virtual office. I feel like it's best to put all the people who communicate with each other in the same room and have a system that can start in no time.

> [Nkzn](https://twitter.com/Nkzn/status/1785126865973518583) I don't deny or rather commend the use of synchronous communication to increase organizational agility, but using text communication as a means to do so is a hopelessly bad idea. If you want to increase agility, it is better to use text communication only as a starting point, and to use video chat as a means of achieving it.

> [Nkzn](https://twitter.com/Nkzn/status/1785127613964669263) Asynchronous communication, I think, basically revolves around "maximizing the [[(powers of) concentration]] and productivity of others by allowing replies to be several hours later. If text communication is the main battlefield, we have to be careful not to kill the good points of asynchronous communication.
