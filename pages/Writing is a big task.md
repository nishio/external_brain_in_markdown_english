title: "Writing is a big task"
---

- Dividing the writing process into three phases: [[Make a sticky note]], [[Compose a sticky note]], and [[Putting the structure in writing]].
- Disability in this case
    - Example 1 of Disability
            - [[in the heat of the moment]] in the [[writing phase]] adding something new #writing #delayed #delayed
            - Then it would not fit the configuration.
        - What do we do?
            - Method 1: Move the new things you add to a place where they do not interfere with the composition.
                    - [[Go to column]], [[Go to footnotes]], etc.
            - Method 2: Go back to the sticky note structure again # Repeat KJ method
                    - [[KJ method]], it's like, "Of course you have to repeat it over and over again.
                - In reality, [[trade-off]] occurs within [[limited time]] resources #Limited resources
                - Ideal, but very realistic.
            - Method 3: [[give up]] that the configuration is distorted
                    - Do not delay release in search of [perfect
                - No matter how much time you put into it, it will never be perfect.
                - Even if you think you're perfect now, you won't think so a year from now.
                - Get it out and fix it #Agile

- [[writing (e.g. as a profession)]] is [[Big Tasks]]
