> The benefits packages talked about in NTT retirement entries "eh...that's not common in the IT industry..." are increasing, so it's time for a turnaround move opportunity from HR PR.
- > I'm an outsider to NTT, but I feel that the degree to which the regular leave day is enforced is quite high. We've been doing this for more than 10 years now, and it's well established.

When I saw this exchange, I was shocked and said, "What, you think it's positive that people are forced to leave work on time?
(Maybe it's an antonymic joke.)

My understanding is that a state in which each individual is able to [[self-determination]] how to use his/her life is a good state, and a state in which "uniformly forcing everyone to act in a certain way" is a bad state. Therefore, forced overtime work and forced leaving work on time are equally bad.

    - Some people consider C to be a [[white company]] based on the amount of overtime work y whether [[business that exploits its employees (e.g. unpaid overtime, etc.)]] or not.
    - On the other hand, from a perspective that emphasizes individual self-determination x, both C and A are bad.
    - It is not written here, but it is out of bounds to violate the laws and regulations.

    - [[forced closing of a business or office (e.g. due to taxation)]] also [[discretion]] is low
