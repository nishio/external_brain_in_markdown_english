title: "Synonyms and antonyms"
---

When I use [[word2vec]] to display similar vectors, I get not only [[quasi-synonym (word that has a similar meaning to another, but is not interchangeable)]], but also [[antonym]].
I was wondering if you could add a synonym flag, or a synonym flag [[resultative (refers to a conjunction where what follows is a result of the preceding)]].
What should we do?

Might be related to: [[siamese network]].
