title: "Linguistic knowledge output is not possible without a common linguistic foundation."
---

I noticed that AI pointed this out.
- Linguistic knowledge output is not possible without a common linguistic foundation.
- However, "non-verbal knowledge output" is possible without a common basis in language
- For example, the action "I saw someone in trouble and I will help him" can be performed without language.
    - If the person who is helped by it says, "I see, I should have done that," then clearly knowledge transfer is taking place.
- Language facilitates recognition of needs.

### digest
.
The output of linguistic knowledge requires a common linguistic foundation. In addition, the content of the output is determined first, and the input is based on that content.

### Relation to Fragment
.
This note is related to the "Knowledge Transfer through Coalescence" and the "Technology of Linguizing" fragments. In Knowledge Transfer through Collaboration, knowledge transfer without verbalization is advocated, which is related to the concept of "common linguistic basis" in the note. In "Technology of verbalization," the technology of verbalization is described as a bottleneck in intellectual productivity, which is related to the notion in the notes that the opportunity for output is determined first, and then the input is worked hard.

### deep thinking
These notes and fragments allow us to think deeply about the relationship between language and knowledge output. In particular, the idea that knowledge output is not possible without a common linguistic foundation underscores the importance of the art of verbalization.
