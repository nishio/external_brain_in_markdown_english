I had an image of something a little more messy coming out, but it turned out to be more than I imagined.
I thought it would be enough to display old and new side by side, but you suggested adding a diff, so I left it to you.
The UI changes are making the test fail, that's true.

Improvement of a test case that I was running yesterday and was too busy to review, I looked at it before dinner, commented a little and merged it without looking at it because it was fixed after I ate dinner.
I guess to "do it right" you need to look hard, but this isn't in service yet, and I've tried to make it a priority to reduce my load.
will it turn out to be good or bad?
