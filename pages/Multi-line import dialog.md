title: "Multi-line import dialog"
---

- [[Multi-line import]].
- I started out with a panel of additional sticky notes.
- I decided to hide it without a developer flag to make the demo look better.
- The add stickies panel at the bottom of the screen is not usable on iPhone, so move it to the top.
    - No more space for multi-line imports.
- I learned about [[Material-UI]]'s Dialog, so I rebuilt it with it.

This would be a good way to add a stand-alone sticky note.
