## MEMO
- Fix minor bugs in PluralViewpoints
    - I hear the QR code is not correct.
    - Or that it's hard to catch the eye in the Topic List or Add Topic.
    - Slow response issue because the topic list is read server-side with blocking Firestore

    - > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1755041467960377527) Wait, in the first place, in this view, I think the appearance of the text in a monospace font and line breaks without considering word breaks or hyphenation is sufficient. I guess... then there is no need to get the width.
    - >  In the end, which technology choice is better depends on the unspoken requirement specification of "how you expect it to look like.
    - > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1755041832105550102) Until 5 minutes ago, I was thinking "I can't get the width, so it's impossible to make my own line breaks, Sharp was the wrong choice and I'll choose Puppeteer"
    - If you want to limit it to English, I'm OK with that, but I have a feeling that's going to be a future tie-in.
    - I thought it was something like that because the default OGP Image size was horizontal, but I felt like I only needed the MAGI part.

## 2024-02-13
- ✅fix: QR code is incorrect
- ✅fix: I'm not sure if it's hard to stop looking at the topic list or Add Topic.
- Slow response issue because the topic list is read server-side with blocking Firestore
    - Maybe it's fixed, let's release it (...)
    - Deployment was rubbish due to the OGP part that was in the process of being created.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1757319947351687457) And you've done this twice.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1757325069297328627) Bug that the acquired data itself is in the dependency of useEffect and is reacquired as soon as the acquisition is finished.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1757325545866764482) Oops, the individual pages are still alive in the server-side rendering cache!

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1757326128514293945) Oh, but if you don't fix the bug and deploy again, you'll lose Quota again.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1757327200158949670) oops, I see, the server side static content generation is Over Quota and the deployments are rubbish, this is a pain in the ass...

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1757327727106114031) I've decided to stop read by security rules and deploy the bugfix version tomorrow after Quota recovers.



Other TODOs
- Create a flow line from the individual topic page to the topic list and top description page.


Server-side OGP rendering could be done by ditching the difficult line break process for rendering.
- Spark after all
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/3077fb70e33ffff579b373ac5b5af830/thumb/1000)
    - /api/ogp/7
- It's now 630x700.

I need to think about what to write in the meta tags and how to process the data differently depending on where it is, but I'm too tired for that today.

In the end, the range of what can be seen depends on the environment, so I don't think it's a good idea to try too hard.
I'll just outline the fonts to eliminate the misalignment and be done with it.
