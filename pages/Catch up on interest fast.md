title: "Catch up on interest fast"
---

Fast [[catch-up]] on [[interest]].
- I started using [[Talk to the City]] at the end of May and have been using it for 6 months to verbalize problems and develop improvement plans.
- It's slower because I'm not as dedicated as I was during my master's degree, but the effect of the increased efficiency due to my working experience has resulted in a slower or even faster rate of growth in recognition.
    - [[unearned progress]] as a generalization of the concept of unearned income, [[engine build]], use of capital other than financial capital
