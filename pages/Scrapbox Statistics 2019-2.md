[Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jMib9SruPopbW2fPn9GO4aSedv2OZO44vOF1TfVM_Os/edit?usp=sharing)
- Areas where less than 10% of the pages have no links and less than 10% of the links contain links other than noun-adjective symbols.
    - masui, shokai, daiiz are densely populated
- On the other hand, as for the "percentage of links containing other than noun-adjective symbols," there are more projects around 30%.

[Example of a link containing something other than a noun, adjective, or symbol (must appear at least twice):](https://gist.github.com/nishio/913366753ae05dfb991c0fadaf6576fc)
- Titles of books and presentation materials are available.
    - [[Blog-like usage]], the title of the page is often a sentence, and so is the link to the page.
- Cases involving numerical values (`Provincial Law 41`, etc.)

From the above, I added the condition "not the title of the page".
