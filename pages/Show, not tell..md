Show, not tell, [[prove, not assert]].

> "Miss Taggart, we don't just pretend [[principles]]," [[Hugh Axton]] said. "That is a [[moral crime]] peculiar to the enemy. We don't [[talk]], we [[show]].  We do not [[claim]] but [[prove]]. We are not trying to subdue you, we are trying to win your rational beliefs. You have seen all the elements of our secret. Now [[the conclusion is yours to draw]] --- we can help you reveal it, but we have no power to make you accept it. [[The views, knowledge, and acceptance must be your own]]."

[[You draw your own conclusions]].
