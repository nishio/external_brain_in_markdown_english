title: 'The "link" for those familiar with Scrapbox'
---

The meaning of the word "link" is quite different for those who are familiar with Scrapbox and those who aren't.

I'm not in a position to criticize it, the same composition as the word "app" has a very different meaning for those who are familiar with Kintone and those who are not.

- New concepts are naturally different from existing concepts
    - but the introduction of a new term creates a step in the entrance and reduces its usefulness.
    - As a result of avoiding this, the meaning changes gently with the user's proficiency.
    - The one after the change is obviously different compared to the one before.
