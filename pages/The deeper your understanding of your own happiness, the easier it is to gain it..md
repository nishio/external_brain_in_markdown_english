title: "The deeper your understanding of your own happiness, the easier it is to gain it."

The better your understanding of what situations make you happy, the easier it is to obtain happy situations.

Increased understanding = Increased [Cognitive Resolution
- Example
    - He thought to himself, "I like consommé pastries."
    - Some I like and some I don't.
    - One time I was looking at the ingredients of a candy I really liked, and it said "beef consommé.
    - The "consommé" concept was split into "beef consommé" and "other consommé" to increase resolution.
    - The "beef" aspect was created, which led to "[[beef jerky]] likes it too."
    - I used to think, "I like consommé-flavored snacks," but now I understand that essentially, "I like beef-flavored snacks."
    - This understanding led me to consider trying [[Cup Noodle Beef Bone Comtan]].
