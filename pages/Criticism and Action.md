title: "Criticism and Action"

from  [[Just saying it's a problem is not a solution.]]
Criticism and Action
    - [[criticism]] and [[pointing out the problem]] are close to each other
- Information is replicated, so criticism after the first one has little informational value.
- Resolve known and as yet unresolved issues [[action]].
    - valuable
- People gather around those who create and distribute things of high value.
    - Mr. A, who is a low-value critic, is given relative short shrift and ignored.
    - Mr. A is marginalized as a result of each person's independent decision-making about what to do with their time.
        - Is this democratic?
    - No one has the "right to make others pay attention to them."
        - People who bring negative value to the community by attempting to take attention away from others are ban from the community.
