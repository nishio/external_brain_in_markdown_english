title: "Unsubstantiated Confidence."
---

- Some people use the term "unfounded [[confidence (in oneself)]]" in a positive or negative sense
- Negative people see the "lack of evidence" as a problem.
- But what is this "[[basis]]"?
- How do situations arise that allow us to have confidence based on evidence?
    - [[success story]] is a basis for confidence.
    - But just because it worked last time doesn't mean it will work this time.
    - Not enough to be able to logically base it on.
- Confidence in repeated successes.
- Inherently unable to have "well-founded confidence" in a subject that is not repeated
- You can't have "grounded confidence" when trying something new.
- In this situation, the latter is preferable to those who cannot act because of lack of confidence and those who do
- If this is the case, then "unfounded confidence" would be beneficial.
- This is the way people think about positivity
