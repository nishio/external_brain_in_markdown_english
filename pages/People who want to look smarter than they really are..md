People who want to look smarter than they really are.
- There are people trying to do things that can easily be quantified.
- Trying to overwhelm others with quantity
- I find myself overwhelmed with quantity.
- Well, I guess there's [[impatience]].
    - I'm fascinated by things that are easy to understand and show progress.
- I think you're right up to the point where 1 is better than 0 output, even if it's a heck of a lot better.
    - A collection of a hundred hefty 1's does not equal one hundred.
    - We must reach a higher order, but the way to do so is not clear.
    - It would be tempting to avoid working on tasks that are not clear and to accumulate progress by doing tasks that will produce results if done!
- Overwhelmed by quantity" itself is a law of nature.
    - Not that there's anything wrong with using it.
    - What's the difference?
    - If you try to do work that earns volume in order to overwhelm others with volume, you'll take your resources to "trivial tasks" that will earn volume and prevent you from doing anything useful.
    - On the other hand, if you're doing something "fun" or "immersive" and look back on it later, you can accumulate a lot, and this quantity will appeal to you later.
