<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT-4.5/icon' alt='GPT-4.5.icon' height="19.5"/> [In [[Arendt.]]'s "[[Human Condition]]," natality is one of the central concepts and is key to understanding the nature of "[[activity]] (action)."

According to Arendt, there are three basic activities in human activity.

1.[[*labor]]: repetitive acts to sustain life.
2.### work
: to create a permanent artifact.
3.### action
: interaction between humans through words and actions

Of these, ### "action"
 is deeply connected with the concept of natality. This is because action is "[[the act of]] bringing something new into the world. By being born, human beings are given a "beginning" and bring unpredictable newness into the world through words and actions. This is the essence of the concept of "natality" and the hopeful and innovative potential of human existence.

Arendt also emphasizes the concept of nativity in his works "[[On Revolution]]" and "[[Between Past and Future]]". [[revolution]] is an attempt by people to create a new political world, and is a prime example of the very power of human beings to make new beginnings.

Moreover, in "[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]," the importance of protecting the "[[new]] possibilities" offered by nativity is implied when considering the problem of totalitarian regimes in which human freedom and possibilities for action are suppressed.

In the big picture of Arendt's thought, natality indicates that human beings are capable of initiating something new in the world, and it presents the philosophical and political challenge of how to protect, nurture, and utilize that power.
