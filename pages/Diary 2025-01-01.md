> High-quality illustration in the style of a card celebrating the New Year. A green snake is drawn stylishly and a little comically as the main character, and the background is simple with a white tone. In large handwritten letters, "Happy Quadratic Year! 2025 = 45^2" in large handwritten letters, and the message "Live Long and Prosper" is added in a well-balanced manner. The bright colors create a pop atmosphere that evokes a sense of anticipation for the future. The line drawings are clear, yet soft, with an overall sense of humor. The placement of letters and motifs is well balanced, and the design makes the most of the blank spaces.
Picture painted by Dall-e.

You're still not very good with text.


During the year-end and New Year's holidays, I was running [[AI Look Back 2024]] on o1 Pro, while [[Devin.ai]] was converting Cosense's UserScript to Tampermonkey.
- The look back progressed through August.
