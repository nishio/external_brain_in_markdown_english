title: "Initially output without title"
---

- When it is first output, it is expressed in "just the text without title" such as on Facebook.
    - Then, inspired by it in some cases, the "next comment" will hang.
    - After some time has passed, "[[Title.]]" will be created at the time it is reprinted in Scrapbox.
        - [[The title is not necessarily a summary]] 。
    - A title as simple as a summary can be given only if the content of the expression is simple.
    - For the most part, it's impossible to give it a simple title because it's a jumble of things.

- I've been thinking a lot about adopting Scrapbox as a form of knowledge representation.
    - but "title and text" is still too rich an expression.
    - As I felt when I first started using Scrapbox, requiring titles raises the bar for output.
        - Being able to Scrapbox has led to the following operational avoidance, but not essential
            - Rename afterwards with "ah ah" or something in the title.
            - Write the body of the text, then find two key phrases that seem important and connect them with "and".
            - Canned titles for things that cannot be titled, such as "Thought Nodes YYYYY-mm-dd"

- Short sentences are still the basic format
    - A tentative title for it is the date and time it was created.
    - It is for human beings to give a title that is a summary
    - For the program, anything goes as long as it's indexed.
        - Creation date and time as unchanged ID
        - Vector if you are willing to change
