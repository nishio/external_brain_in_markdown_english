title: "Visualizing What You Don't Know"

>  "[[Knowledge of what you don't know that you don't know]]" adjacent to new knowledge is a red link in the Scrapbox sense

> I feel Scrapbox's deepness of spirit in the way it mixes in what it knows, while clearly stating "I don't know", and then allows the user to decide whether or not to expand on that knowledge. This is originally a method of expression for wikis.
- > Yes, [[red link]] is indeed a clarification of what "I don't know". A door to knowledge that leads outside.
    - > Wikipedia, it was simply a sign of "no entry", but when brought into a personal wiki, it becomes an expression of something "unknown", and it plays an exquisite role. And it is also a door that encourages awareness to "expand".
        - I see, I have been wondering "[[Why is it good to have a personal wiki?]]" for a long time, but it makes sense that visualizing "something I know exists but don't know much about yet" works to inspire me to "expand and learn".

For team use
- [[Share what you don't know]]
Related to.

- [[Scrapbox is good for studying.]]
- This is another [what you don't know is visualized.

- I'm happy when [[red link]] becomes [[blue link]] because I unexpectedly understand something I didn't understand.
- On this page itself, I scrapped a tweet I saw that looked useful, titled "Visualizing what you don't know", and then I remembered "Sharing what you don't know" and added it, and the link was "Scrapbox is good for studying", and in it was the red link "Visualizing what you don't know. visualize what you don't know" was there.
