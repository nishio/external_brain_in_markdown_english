> The reason for the low [[productivity]] of Japanese companies is that everyone just sits at their desks for 8 hours and groans and feels like they've done their job.
> I cried when I saw the commentary that

> [@kis](https://twitter.com/kis/status/1664221998338437120?s=20):[[missiles]] clearly show that successful [[interception]] does not mean successful defense...
