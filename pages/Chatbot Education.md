title: "Chatbot Education"

    - Teach [[chatbot]] a set of [[Keywords.]] and [[reaction]] to them.
- When a human utters that keyword, the chatbot replays the response it was once taught.
- Hopefully human [[emotion]] can be moved.

- Isn't this the same as "[[Link to the Future]]" in [[Scrapbox]]?
