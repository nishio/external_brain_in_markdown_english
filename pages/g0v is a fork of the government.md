title: "g0v is a fork of the government"
---

Taiwan [[g0v]] (gav-zero) started out as a government website (gov.tw) that [[forks itself]] to create (g0v.tw) in the first place.

> The civic tech community [[g0v]], on which the "vTaiwan" community is based, means to "[[folk]]" the government. The word "fork" means "branch" in IT terminology, and g0v was originally intended to branch the government, so that those who can and want to do what the government cannot or will not do (e.g., creating graphics of financial data, measuring and visualizing environmental data, etc.).

## 「フォーク」の具体的な活動
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT-4.5/icon' alt='GPT-4.5.icon' height="19.5"/>
g0v is working to provide government information in a more transparent and accessible manner by creating a mirror site that replaces the government website ".gov.tw" with ".g0v.tw".
> Symbolizing the community's efforts to "rethink the role of government from zero," and borrowing the parlance of binary from the digital world of 1s and 0s, the O in "gov" is replaced with a 0 to make "g0v"; for many government agencies in Taiwan which have URLs ending .gov.tw, replacing .gov with .g0v redirects the user to the so-called shadow government, a "forked" version of that agency with contributions by civic hackers.
