title: "Velocity measurements for presentation preparation"

- [[velocity]] Measured data
- Japanese Presentation
    - 70 pages
    - I spoke in 40 minutes.
    - 10 hours of preparation
    - If you want to speak for an hour, you need 135 pages and 15 hours of preparation.
- Presentation with slides that translate it into English
    - 18 pages in 15 minutes
        - 2/3 the speed of Japanese
    - If you want to talk for an hour, you need 72 pages.
    - The process of machine translating the Japanese slides and then revising them took 1.5 hours to get to page 38.
    - So 72 pages would be 3 hours.
    - 10 hours to prepare 72 pages of slides
    - If you speak for one hour, 10 hours to prepare Japanese slides + 3 hours to translate and revise
    - Surprisingly, English is less expensive by speaking less?
    - The problem is that in English you can only speak 2/3 of what you want to talk about.
    - When preparing both English and Japanese content for the same time frame:
        - 15 hours to prepare Japanese slides + 4.5 hours to translate and revise + cost to discard 2/3 of speaking in English version
        - Hmmm...
- Pointing out that we just need to practice so much that people don't think we are prepared even if we have a manuscript ready to go.
    - The cost of preparing the English version of the slides will increase as a result of fluency, and the practice time cost will be added to the cost.
    - If we're going to do that, I'd like to take the video and use it around as content.
    - Proposal to first take a video of the Japanese presentation and add subtitles to it.
