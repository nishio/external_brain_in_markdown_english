title: "Cross-sense the individual sense and make it public sense."
---

> [shiology](https://x.com/shiology/status/1792724865050628479) #Scrapbox has been renamed #Cosense.
>  Exquisite naming that makes "individual sense" into "intersection sense" and "public sense". It's wonderful.

>  The prefix "co-" has the connotations of "co-", "mutual", and "union". The prefix "co-" means "co-", "mutual", or "union". The official kana is "co-sense", not "ko-sense". Cosense" is a smart name that accurately expresses the essence of "Cosense" as a place where each person's tacit knowledge, "individual sense," is shared together to create a "sense of communion" and eventually become formal knowledge, "public sense. I will continue to use "Cosense" more and more actively, and I am very grateful to Helpfeel.
