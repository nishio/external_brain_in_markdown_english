> I have accounts on Misskey, Fedibird, and Bluesky, and now that I know about Truth through Twitter, I'm thinking of creating those as well.

> It hurts my heart to see Murakami-san's pocketbook hurt by directing a lot of people to Misskey .io, but it doesn't hurt my heart at all to see Trump's pocketbook hurt by directing a lot of people to TRUTH Social, and it's a good thing we all ignore the conspiracy theorists and go build TLs.

> I'm laughing at the number of "I don't like Misskey" refugees pouring into Misskey now that Twitter is dead, and from Misskey's point of view, they were just enjoying themselves as individuals and suddenly a bunch of refugees are coming in and messing with their culture. This is how the refugee problem in the world happens, isn't it?


After all, trust is "the assumption that what we see now will remain the same in the future," and the way to cultivate trust is to accumulate unchanging behavior over time.
- I've been consistently putting effort into "improving the intellectual productivity of mankind" for a long time, even though my specific projects change from time to time, and I guess I can be trusted by people who know that, at least for that part of my work.

- Those whose accumulation is only on a single service, such as Twitter, are being held hostage to trust.
    - Well, it's better to diversify.
