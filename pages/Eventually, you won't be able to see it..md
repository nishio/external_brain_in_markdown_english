.

In my previous research note [[Diary 2023-09-01]], I described the current state of AI trial and error being publicly available as "the dawn of time" and stated that this is signaling and is valuable for the formation of early adopter groups. However, we predicted that eventually trial and error will become less visible.

In this connection, Nishio's research note [[Diary 2023-03-19]] noted the connection between "the future already exists in speck" and the "formation of early adopter groups," which over time crystallizes into "a speck future that will not expand." There was also a suggestion to have ChatGPT write an information product that will survive the AI era.

In Diary 2023-05-01, he also presents the perspective that "if you can't do what AI can't do, you are considered less valuable than AI," and states that this applies to everyone, not just college students.
- Cut out: [[If you can't do what an AI can't do, you are considered less valuable than an AI.]]

From these notes, we feel that we need to think deeply about the link between the evolution of AI and human adaptability. We also believe it is important to recognize the need for new values and skills to cope with this, as well as to predict a future in which the trials and errors of AI will be less visible.
