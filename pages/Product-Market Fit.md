[How to measure and find PMF: Somewhat practicalï½œKenichiro Hara | Kenichiro Hara | note](https://note.com/kenichiro_hara/n/nec3b6d791039)
- [[Sean Ellis test]]
    - Would you be upset if this product disappeared tomorrow?
    1. very disappointed
    2. fairly disappointing
    3. not too bad (not very convenient)
    4. no longer using this product
    - The "very disappointing" response must exceed 40%.
    - Analyze the difference between 1 and 2
        - I don't care about 3 or 4.
        - What is the function X that one thinks is good?
        - Of the 2, how many consider that function X to be the most important?
        - What is the function Y that they consider "necessary" to make it better?

- [[First, you have to be thorough and meet your own needs.]]
- Narrowing down customer segments to only one person.
- The first approach is to become "I would be very disappointed if this product were to disappear tomorrow.
- [[Product/User Fit]]
    - [Let's focus on Product/User Fit, which comes before Product/Market Fit](https://review.foundx.jp/entry/product-user-fit-comes-before-product-market-fit)
    - A more accurate paraphrase of "there was a Product/Market Fit in a small number of very early power user segments" would be "there was a Product/User Fit."
