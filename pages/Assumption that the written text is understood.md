title: "Assumption that the written text is understood"
---

We usually write Japanese sentences and assume that the Japanese people around us understand them, but is that true?

It is not possible to directly observe whether others understand.

A computer can do it partially.
- If I can understand both English and Japanese, I can verify that the machine translation results are correct.
