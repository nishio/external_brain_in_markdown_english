title: "Zeros and ones and hundreds."

The abstraction of the title is not appropriate for the content.
    - I thought it might be in [[A series of pictures of two people saying different things]], but it wasn't there.

- 1 is greater than 0, but less than 100.
    - From the perspective of 100, it's silly to compare 0 and 1 and argue that they are bigger or smaller.

Original post.
- There are strategies A, B, and C with expected returns of 0, 1, and 100
- What people taking Strategy C feel.
    - B is futile, should take C
- What people who stay in A feel
    - Not realizing B or C returns.
    - Investments to get B and C returns appear large relative to returns.
    - So I choose A.
- What it feels like to stay in B
    - Not realizing the return of C
    - Affirms the current strategy by feeling that "the return on B is greater than on A."
- What people who have experienced "A to B to C" feel
    - B is better than A.
    - You can't go to C in one step, so you should do B first ([[Excessive generalization of one's experience]]).
