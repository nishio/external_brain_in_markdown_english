> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1819750843920666625) If the same result can be achieved by both cosmetic and cosmetic methods, then do it the cosmetic way. However, most of the actions in the world have unknown costumers beforehand, so if you only do what you know the costumers can do, you will live in a small world. (In some cases, the activities with unknown cost performance are more cost-effective as a result because there is less competition.

- If the same result can be achieved by both the cosmetic and cosmetic methods, then do it the cosmetic way.
    - Result = Performance
- However, most of the world's actions are unknown to the costumers in advance.
    - The "result" is not determined before you do it.
    - You can see the "results" after you do it.
- So if you're only doing what you know the costumers in advance, you're [[living in a small world]].
    - Only those actions whose results are easily predictable.
    - That doesn't include "new things."
    - It takes the form of copying what someone else has already done.
- Unknown cosmetic acts are sometimes more cosmetic as a result because there is less competition.
    - When the cost of an "action whose cost is known in advance" is good, it attracts people who want to do it.
    - When limited resources are involved, there is a struggle for them and costs go up.
    - So if there's no barrier to entry, it's down to not very tasty cosmetics.
