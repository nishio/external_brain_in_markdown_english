title: "Shuhari"
---

Shuhari (守破離) is a concept in Japanese arts such as tea ceremony and martial arts, and it shows the process of mastery of skills. It is originally in "Rikyu Doga," a collection of a tea mastery Sen no Rikyu's lessons.

The process is expressed in three stages: Shu, Ha, and Ri.

守破離
- 守(Shu): defend; protect; guard; conserve; watch
- 破(Ha): break; cut
- 離(Ri): leave; depart; go away; separate; away from

Shu is the stage of faithfully following the [[kata]] (form) taught by the master and making sure to acquire them.

Ha is the stage of considering the techniques of other masters and schools, adopting the good ones, and developing the own techniques. The person who has mastered the kata is able to "break" the existing kata. By learning the kata of other schools and comparing them with his own to find kata that is better suited to him.

Ri is the the stage of leaving existing forms and to create new forms.
The person who has familiar with both the kata taught by the master and the kata that he has discovered for himself has a good understanding of himself, and is therefore not bound by the existing kata. In this way, a new kata is born.

[[Eugene T. Gendlin]] mentions [[Martin Heidegger]]'s concept of [[dwell-think]] in his work [[Phenomenology as non-logical steps]].
> We do not need to surrender what is already formed. When we precisely understand its formed intricacy, that is just when we exceed its forms. When we don't understand a book, we can only quote it. To understand it is to dwell-think in its forms, and that is more precise than the forms.
I feel it is related to Shuhari.
- This is, in the words of the Shuhari, "when we 'Shu' exactly the complex structure described in a book, that is the 'Ha' moment."

To [[break the frame]], you have to see it clearly first.

Interesting slide, Shu clarifies the boundaries of "[[kata]]"

A [[kata]] is ambiguous at first.
It becomes clearer as you continue to 'Shu' it.
Once it becomes clear, it can be intentionally broken (Ha).

Shuhari

Shuhari is a concept in Japanese arts such as tea ceremony and budo that describes the process of mastering a technique.
The process is expressed in three stages. It is expressed in three stages: "Shu," "Break," and "Release.
It is originally found in "Rikyu Doju," a collection of lessons by Sen no Rikyu.

Mamoru is the stage of faithfully following the kata (form) taught by the master and making sure to master it.

Breaking is the stage in which one examines the techniques of other masters and schools, adopts what is good, and refines one's own techniques. Those who have mastered kata are able to "break" existing kata. By studying the kata of other schools and comparing them with one's own kata, one can find a kata more suited to oneself.

The "weaning" stage is the stage of leaving an existing mold and creating a new one.
A person who is familiar with both the kata taught by his master and the kata he has discovered on his own understands himself well and is not bound by the existing kata. In this way, new kata are born.

- > We do not need to surrender what is already formed. When we precisely understand its formed intricacy, that is just when we exceed its forms. When we don't understand a book, we can only quote it. To understand it is to dwell-think in its forms, and that is more precise than the forms.

When we understand a complex structure accurately, that is the moment to go beyond that structure. When we read a book and do not understand it, we can only quote it. To understand a book is to dwell-think within its structure, which is a more accurate understanding than the written structure.
    - This is, in the words of the defensive breakaway, "when we 'defend' exactly the complex structure described in a book, that is the 'breakaway' moment."

Interesting slide, the boundary of "[[type (e.g. of machine, goods, etc.)]]" is clarified by the guard

The type is initially ambiguous
Continuing to defend makes that clear.
Clarity will help you break it intentionally.
