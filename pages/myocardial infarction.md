title: "myocardial infarction"
---

> The day before yesterday, I was feeling mysterious [[back muscle pain]] and [[stomach pain]]. I was horrified when I saw a story about a myocardial infarction that was linked to the symptoms. I haven't been out for a few days, and I've been falling asleep on a hot carpet on the highest setting, so it didn't look good for my blood flow.
> >@mtzktkkk Myocardial infarction is said to be common in sedentary jobs as well as cartoonists. Symptoms may manifest themselves in different ways, but when I had a close call, it started with my stomach, which was upset stomach -> strange pain in my left back, and at the same time, pain in my lower left tooth -> chest pain. At this time, I was lying on my side with no strength in my body and could manage to verbally complain about the symptoms.
