Human corrections to AI output accelerate verbalization. This takes the form of corrections to the AI's output, not questions.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The fragment "Thinking about AI Question Box UI" is related to the note. The note describes the acceleration of verbalization through human corrections to AI output, while the fragment presents the perspective of AI facilitating verbalization through more questions. These share a common theme of accelerating verbalization through AI-human interaction.

### deep thinking
AI-human interaction has the potential to promote verbalization and accelerate the distribution of knowledge. However, the shape and method of the interaction will largely determine its effectiveness: whether the AI encourages verbalization by asking questions or whether the human encourages verbalization by correcting the AI's output is important.

### summary of thoughts and title
