I want to take the product of N numbers minus one
- see  [[Cumulative product from left to right]]
    - The product in this case is not limited to multiplication.
        - gcd: [[ABC125C]]
        - [[commutative law]] , [[associative law]] holds.
        - [[inverse element]] is missing
        - In the case of additions with inverse yuan, etc., it is even easier because you can take the sum of the whole and add the inverse yuan of the one you want to remove
