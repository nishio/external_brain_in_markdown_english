This is so true. This is so true, and I think that the sense of people who can spit out rude words to people they have never met by quoting and retweeting is really buggy.
- [[distance bug]]

> [kouta_hikichi](https://twitter.com/kouta_hikichi/status/1704322408956805469) For some reason, only people who bug those people are quoted retweets, not replies. Or an obvious air rip.
>  The type of person who has no courtesy, does not dare to have a direct dialogue, and spits out words. If he were a normal member of society, he would be a dangerous person.
>  So it's no wonder that many of the young people of Generation Z feel the distance bug.

> [kouta_hikichi](https://twitter.com/kouta_hikichi/status/1704329992782639227) If you calmly imagine it in real life, you can see that people who throw rude words in quotes and retweets are saying bad things without looking the person in the eye. It's like saying bad words without looking the person in the eye. And in front of many people.
>  That's a pretty bad person, and I personally don't think it's wrong to say he has the distance bug.

> [kouta_hikichi](https://twitter.com/kouta_hikichi/status/1704398767406100984) I'm not denying the quote retweeting itself, but the point of contention is the "people with a buggy sense of distance". I understand that retweeting quotes is a way of transmitting information, but I think the problem is that it is easy for those with a "buggy sense of distance" to be exposed.
>  I guess it's a matter of designing an architecture that is prone to "public safety".

> [hijiki](https://twitter.com/hijiki/status/1704411807765725649) Since you're here, I'll just rip it up.

> [kouta_hikichi](https://twitter.com/kouta_hikichi/status/1704412896778989835) Thank you. I hope so. But that shrinking is clearly bugging some people. I think this is only a clear division in the shrinking. I don't know if you don't understand communication very well or if it's just a stress reliever, but it's not productive.

> [Musokitigo](https://twitter.com/Musokitigo/status/1704413466986270723) I'm Gen Z, but I think that's rather the best thing about Twitter. I can talk about things that I can't say in real life because the distance is buggy, and there is no other place where I can talk to people who are two or three times older than me in a casual manner. I guess things depend on how you look at them.

> [kouta_hikichi](https://twitter.com/kouta_hikichi/status/1704414700635877447) Thank you. If "buggy" in terms of distance is just "close enough to talk about various things" and someone can express his/her opinion interactively like this rip by TANA, I think that's great too. But "buggy" in the article in this thread clearly doesn't mean that in such a positive way, just rude and... View more


> [joker1007](https://twitter.com/joker1007/status/1704396949963850181) I know this could also be taken as rude to someone I've never met, but as someone who has been using Twitter since 2006 or so I've been using Twitter since about 2006, and I think it's wrong that RT quotes are notified to the person who is quoting them. I have no intention of telling that person what I am saying. (This tweet is also communicated in the same way).


> [piro_or](https://twitter.com/piro_or/status/1704412954756849733) Twitter (already X) "uncle with a distance bug who says rude things in quotes" vs "naive person who talks on a public street where you don't know who's there and thinks you'll only get a well behaved response. I'm talking on a public street where you don't know who's there and think you'll only get a well-mannered response."
>  I wonder which is "worse".
>  I believe both have their own "badness".
> [piro_or](https://twitter.com/piro_or/status/1704415691980628057) I try to refrain from overt abuse like "this guy is an idiot," but I've given up because I can't take into account people who are "uncomfortable with being quoted by someone they don't know/quoted in a context they don't know. I am not comfortable with being quoted by people I don't know, or being quoted in contexts I don't know.
>  Instead, I try not to lose my temper when it's done to me. I think that's "speech".

> [somichi](https://x.com/somichi/status/1965443958051570082) Since the system of [[quote comment]] [[quote comment]] was established, obviously [[distance bug]] bad people have increased or become visible or Twitter has become less secure. Because it is based on the premise of "being seen by those around you" instead of one-on-one replies, it doesn't stop people from making [[front man]] objections and counter-arguments [[big joke]] [[uke-aim]] to other people's posts.
    - [[use as a pretext]]
- [[citation retweeted]]
- [[Distance]].
        - [[Discussion on Twitter distance]]
> [somichi](https://x.com/somichi/status/1965457138014371942) Quoted comments have a high rate of treating the originator as content rather than a person in a messy way.
- [[Treat the source as content, not a person]].
- [[Treat as content]]
- The interesting part of this
    - When you see a "Twitter post," this person is focusing on a "person," a "sender."
        - So there is a negative nuance riding on "treat as content".
    - Some consider "Twitter posts" to be "content."
        - Those people naturally treat content as content and don't feel there's anything wrong with it.

    - [[Existing social networking sites focus on the individual, but Polis focuses on the group, not the individual.]]
