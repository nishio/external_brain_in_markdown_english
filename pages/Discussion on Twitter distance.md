title: "Discussion on Twitter distance"

> [kouta_hikichi](https://twitter.com/kouta_hikichi/status/1704319635569705433/history) X (Twitter) seems to be a place full of "human distance bug" uncles, according to Generation Z. This is so true. This is so true, and I think that the sense of people who can spit out rude words to people they have never met by quoting and retweeting is really buggy.

> [kouta_hikichi](https://twitter.com/kouta_hikichi/status/1704322408956805469) For some reason, only people who bug those people are quoted retweets, not replies. Or an obvious air rip.
>  The type of person who has no courtesy, does not dare to have a direct dialogue, and spits out words. If he were a normal member of society, he would be a dangerous person.
>  So it's no wonder that many of the young people of Generation Z feel the distance bug.

> [kouta_hikichi](https://twitter.com/kouta_hikichi/status/1704329992782639227) If you calmly imagine it in real life, you can see that people who throw rude words in quotes and retweets are saying bad things without looking the person in the eye. It's like saying bad words without looking the person in the eye. And in front of many people.
>  That's a pretty bad person, and I personally don't think it's wrong to say he has the distance bug.

> [kouta_hikichi](https://twitter.com/kouta_hikichi/status/1704398767406100984) I'm not denying the quote retweeting itself, but the point of contention is the "people with a buggy sense of distance". I understand that retweeting quotes is a way of transmitting information, but I think the problem is that it is easy for those with a "buggy sense of distance" to be exposed.
>  I guess it's a matter of designing an architecture that is prone to "public safety".

> [kouta_hikichi](https://twitter.com/kouta_hikichi/status/1704412896778989835) Thank you. I hope so. But that shrinking is clearly bugging some people. I think this is only a clear division in the shrinking. I don't know if you don't understand communication very well or if it's just a stress reliever, but it's not productive.

> [Musokitigo](https://twitter.com/Musokitigo/status/1704413466986270723) I'm Gen Z, but I think that's rather the best thing about Twitter. I can talk about things that I can't say in real life because the distance is buggy, and there is no other place where I can talk to people who are two or three times older than me in a casual manner. I guess things depend on how you look at them.

> [kouta_hikichi](https://twitter.com/kouta_hikichi/status/1704414700635877447) Thank you. If "buggy" in terms of distance is just "close enough to talk about various things" and someone can express his/her opinion interactively like this rip by TANA, I think that's great too. But "buggy" in the article in this thread clearly doesn't mean that in such a positive way, just rude and... View more

I have no intention of telling that person what I am saying. (This tweet is also communicated in the same way).


> [piro_or](https://twitter.com/piro_or/status/1704412954756849733) Twitter (already X) "uncle with a distance bug who says rude things in quotes" vs "naive person who talks on a public street where you don't know who's there and thinks you'll only get a well behaved response. I'm talking on a public street where you don't know who's there and think you'll only get a well-mannered response."
>  I wonder which is "worse".
>  I believe both have their own "badness".
> [piro_or](https://twitter.com/piro_or/status/1704415691980628057) I try to refrain from overt abuse like "this guy is an idiot," but I've given up because I can't take into account people who are "uncomfortable with being quoted by someone they don't know/quoted in a context they don't know. I am not comfortable with being quoted by people I don't know, or being quoted in contexts I don't know.
>  Instead, I try not to lose my temper when it's done to me. I think that's "speech".
