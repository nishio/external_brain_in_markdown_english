- What are "[[dialectical traditions]]" and "[[logocentrism]]" that [[derrida]] criticized?
- Critique of the Dialectical Tradition
    - Since ancient Greece, Western philosophy has emphasized "[[dialectics]]-like" thinking (especially evident in [[Hegel]] and others), in which logic is pursued to resolve conflicts and ultimately lead to truth.
    - Derrida doubts the very structure of such a "logical conflict to a higher-order conclusion".
    - Because, he pointed out, dialectics ultimately aims to establish "truth" or "unity," but this "only conclusion" is what suppresses various differences and contradictions.

- Criticism of [[Logocentrism]] ([[Logos-centrism]])
    - Logos" is a Greek word meaning "word," "reason," or "logic.
    - Western philosophy and culture have long held the view that "[[verbal reason]]" is the supreme basis for all cognition and judgment.
    - Derrida criticized the assumption that there is a "certain center" ("absolute truth" or "absolute origin") behind "logos" (reason or language), and argued that in reality there are differences and gaps within the [[text book]] ([[linguistic expression]]), that there is no absolute center, and that it is always supported by gaps and ambiguity.

- Derrida's basic stance
    - Rather than destroying texts and concepts unilaterally from the outside, the project shows how "monolithic logic and truths are actually broken down" by carefully reading the inherent [[deviation]] and [[inconsistency]].
    - Such a method is called "[deconstruction (as in the term coined by Jacques Derrida)" and works to shake the faith in the "clear truth" and "stable center" assumed by traditional philosophy and logic.

In short, Derrida's critique is aimed at questioning the fundamental assumptions of Western philosophy, such as "one truth can be reached" and "the word (logos) rules all," and shedding light on the contradictions and differences that have been suppressed behind such assumptions.
