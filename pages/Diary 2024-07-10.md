>  I voted for him too.
>  The mass media didn't pick up the story for even a second before voting day, but after the election, when they see the results, they suddenly get requests from the mass media to appear on the show.
>  I guess that's the limit of mass media reporting.

> [tsurezure_lab](https://x.com/tsurezure_lab/status/1810663468175167740) Our laboratory also analyzed the YouTube videos of the Tokyo gubernatorial election from the viewpoint of UGC, and it was confirmed that the total number of views of the videos posted by Ishimaru, Koike, and Renho was in the hundreds of millions. The total number of views for the videos related to Mr. Ishimaru, Ms. Koike, and Ms. Renho was in the hundreds of millions, which is the same scale or larger than the number of user-submitted videos for YOASOBI's "Idol," which became a global hit as J-POP in a short time.

> [tsurezure_lab](https://x.com/tsurezure_lab/status/1810670627831091267) The analysis of J-Pop mega-hits conducted by our laboratory confirms the phenomenon of user-submitted videos other than official channels surpassing the number of official views in a short period of time. This is a phenomenon that the number of views of the original videos, which are called "followers," has been surpassing that of the official videos in a short period of time. This may have provided an opportunity to expand the awareness of the song to people "other than" the original fans in the form of followers.

I am afraid that this point is not well stated, but I dropped it from the article because very few people chose TikTok as a medium for collecting "information on politics and society" as a result of the survey. We believe that this is because the number of people who use and watch TikTok is very small.
