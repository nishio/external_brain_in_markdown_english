title: "Connection to 100-day-old diary"

- The gimmick introduced for this Scrapbox [Experiments with automatic diary page generation
- Link to "100 days ago" not just "1 year ago."
- It's starting to occur that I'm getting flickers and suggestions to look back on.
    - It's fresh because I've forgotten much of what happened 100 days ago.
