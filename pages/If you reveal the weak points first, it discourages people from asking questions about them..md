This has been working better than I thought it would, and since there is no way to ask questions about what is written in the Limitations, it basically makes it impossible to ask questions and take [[mountings]] where everyone knows it is [[weakness]].

In principle, it is not possible to make it anonymous for conference presentations, so I thought there was a big difference. I think this is a big difference.
