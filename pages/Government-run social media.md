> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1864525698121257224) I believe that communication is the infrastructure of society, so we need social media operated by the government, logged in with my number as a reliable communication channel. I'd like to have a discussion about it because some people don't seem to agree with me #ShinTokyo2050

> [shunichi_arai](https://x.com/shunichi_arai/status/1864550628514779339) Governments should stop adding proprietary communication channels. We should create open, secure, and mutually compatible messaging with simple and easy-to-understand protocols on a global basis.
- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1864556320340496837) Well, I have no objection to this. Maybe you could set up a Mastodon instance for each local government of a reasonable size.

- >  I want all municipalities to unify their domain names and use lg.jp
- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1864664024769810894) It is not good that the means of verification whether the transmission from the government or local government is genuine is an opaque screening process by a private company called X, so I thought it would be good if it could be the same as lg.jp or go.jp. I thought it might be good if it could be done to

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1864557123449049562) Local governments began using Twitter as an easy way to disseminate information. However, the business model that covers the cost of maintaining SNS with advertising fees is not viable, and Twitter/X has changed to a form that takes money by subscription. Should we continue to pay our taxes to X or should we use that money to operate our own SNS? I think the latter is better #ShinTokyo2050

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1864555458260029541) "Governments should stop adding proprietary communication channels. We should create open, secure and inter-compatible messaging worldwide, with simple and easy-to-understand protocols." Okay, I can't disagree with this. I'd put up a Mastodon instance for each local government of a reasonable size #ShinTokyo2050.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1864561658397642862) We need a system where municipal employees can easily post today's announcement and it will be displayed on digital signage in various locations and on everyone's smartphones, and the current X/ Twitter is not appropriate because of the high API cost. So public information and communication channels need to be developed as infrastructure.

The opinion "I need a social media site run by the government, logged in with my number" does not mean "destroy private social networking services", so of course users can choose a third party other than the government. Of course, users can choose third parties other than the government.
- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1864636148855042559) The government already offers authentication with my number, so it's the private sector's job to meet the demand for a private social network that authenticates my number.

- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1864636446789038543) I'm talking about public information infrastructure, not what functions private services provide, and that's obviously not the scope of metropolitan government, so I think it is off-topic.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1864638247592448230) "Personally, I think agenda-based things like 2ch or Reddit are better suited for that kind of communication than SNS-based."
>  You have a point here, whether a form like Twitter/X is optimal as a public information infrastructure is debatable, and probably not optimal.
- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1864638933193380032) The reason I don't think Twitter/X's UI is the best public information infrastructure is that it is a platform for multiple people to do something for a common purpose Both GitHub and kintone are in the absence of Twitter style. twitter is probably not the best UI for creating cooperation

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1864665100482924771) With Twitter/X, a private company, making modifications to make third-party client apps less viable for its own benefit, it is now impossible for clients to display huge text for the blind elderly or voice-activated for the blind. This makes it impossible to have a client that can be displayed in huge letters for the blind or voice-controlled for the visually impaired. This is not an appropriate infrastructure for disseminating government information.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1864665269161087140) I don't like the state of affairs where the means of communication with the public is in the hands of foreign private companies.
