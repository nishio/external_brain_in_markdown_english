- Note that it is not [binary heap
Compared to the dichotomous heap, [[data structure]] is characterized by faster merging.
Insertion averages O(1) in the bipartite heap, but there is no specific merge support, so the total is O(N).
On the other hand, in the case of a binomial heap, it is O(logN)
I saw a statement that adding one element at a cost takes O(logN) because of merging, but I think this is also an average of O(1), just like [[Binary heap insertion averages constant time]].


Merge, Insert, Find Minimum, Subtract Key Value, Delete O(logN)
Minimum value search can be O(1) with an additional twist
