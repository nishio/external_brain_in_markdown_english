*1267594815* [kaizen (Japanese business philosophy of continuous improvement)] Benefit of putting small documents in clear folders
When I tried to dry the laundry, I broke down a pile of papers and scattered them out the window.

Fortunately, since everything was in a clear folder, it only fell down solely. The only damage was that one clear folder was broken.

I shudder to think what would have happened if the documents had been loaded with fine flimsy pieces of paper.

I tried not to pile things up near the windows.
