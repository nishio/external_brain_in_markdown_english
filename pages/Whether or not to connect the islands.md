title: "Whether or not to connect the islands"
---

The mismatch between "[[It is useful to think about what connects the in-between]]" and "[The whole story doesn't have to be a connected story.

That is, when the goal is to create [[writing to communicate to others]].
- Need to break content into reasonable amounts and establish the order in which content is to be read
- This need to "separate content into reasonable amounts" reduces the need to "connect everything into one".
    - Just insert "I'm going to change the subject a little bit" at the end.


On the other hand, if you are writing for your own understanding
- relevance
        - [[Write for your own understanding.]]
        - [[There are three types of diagrams]]
For example, if you put together sentences that you have spit out in fragments on a single topic and they are divided into two groups
- I have a "feeling of being one thing", but "what has already been written out" is "not one thing", so there must be "something that has not yet been written out, something that connects between the two".
- This [[Noticing the presence of blank spaces encourages verbalization.]] effect.
        - [[Notice the blanks.]] ,  [[become aware of a blind spot]]
