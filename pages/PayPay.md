- I made [[LINE Pay]] before.
- I thought they were interoperating in general because I can pay with LINE Pay at restaurants near my house that accept PayPay.
    - Like Suica and Icoca.
- I'm going to use PayPay to collect my cab fare.
    - This [[person-to-person transfer]] could not be sent using LINE Pay.
        - I can read it in the LINE Pay app, but it tries to pay from the PayPay charge amount.
    - I have PayPay installed but no charge amount.
    - Attempt to recharge -> Bank account is not registered.
    - Trying to register a bank account → Identity verification required

Identification.
- Scanning the [[my number card]] and digitally signing it seems to be OK.
    - Maybe this is the first pattern.
    - With LINE Pay, it was a photo op.
- I know the password for the signature.
- The scan failed twice and succeeded on the third try.
- awaiting verification

- The screening process was rather quick.
- Add a charge method
- Which bank to use, Mizuho Bank or SBI Sumishin Bank, which I recently opened?
    - I mean, you want to gradually reduce the number of things connected to Mizuho, right?
- I didn't even have to enter my account number or anything, I just identified it with my username and password and "start trading" and I was connected quickly and easily.
- The problem is that there's no money in the SBI.
- Make a transfer from Mizuho to SBI
- I wonder if I should change my payroll transfer account...
- I'll have to change my credit card debit too.
- tiresome

- [About the receiving link:](https://paypay.ne.jp/help/c0189/)
- Send -> SNS -> Receive link
    - I don't see the point in creating a link from "send" when I'm the one receiving it.
        - You have to specify the amount to make it.
    - There is no SNS menu under "Billing."
        - → Receive with My Code → QR code will be displayed.
        - Is it OK if I copy the receive link here?
- Does a set expiration date prevent long-term use?
