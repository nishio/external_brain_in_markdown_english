title: "Controller does not respond to operation."
---

I could make [[controller]] appear in Unity, but it does not respond to [[operation]].
- [[[Unity / Oculus Go]] How to display Oculus Go controller and get buttons - Escargot tangled in sources []](http://rikoubou.hatenablog.com/entry/2018/06/04/193607)
    - Put "[[TrackedRemote]]" into "[[LeftHandAnchor]]" and "[[RightHandAnchor]]" in "[[OVRCameraRig]]".
    - I added it to my route and it didn't work.
