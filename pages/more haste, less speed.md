What is this "turn"?

"Mononofu no Yabashi no Yabashi no Boat ga Fukyuu but Hashigaya ha Mawaru Seta no Nagahashi."
When crossing Lake Biwa, there were two ways to cross: by boat or by detouring and crossing by bridge. The story goes that crossing by boat would be delayed or capsized by a gust of wind, so it is better to use a bridge.

Especially in the case of warriors, the damage in the event of a capsize is greater than that of ordinary people because of their heavy luggage. In addition, if a large number of people board multiple boats and wait for the slowest person to arrive, delays, which have a low probability of occurring, will occur more frequently than for individual travelers because "if it happens on any one of the boats, it will affect them.
