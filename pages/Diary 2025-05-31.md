[[Devin]]
I threw Devin a description of the unexpected behavior, and while Devin was thinking about it, I read the code and said, "Isn't the cause X?" but Devin said, "The cause is Y, not X," which saved me the cost of trial and error based on my incorrect hypothesis.
- P: Manual entries added yesterday don't seem to add up, maybe because they are past dates?
- Devin+me: <thinking>.
- Me: Maybe it's because the name of the SHEET was changed after the test.
- Devin: it's not a sheet name change, it's an issue with the amount validation logic
    - 1,000" is not considered a number.
- Me: Ah, I see, sure, the data in spreadsheet has commas in it! I don't need the currency symbol, but commas should be allowed, implement it!
