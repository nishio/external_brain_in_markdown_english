This is an excerpt from [[Meetup with Audrey & Glen]] where Audrey Tang and Glen Weyl refer to "interoperability" and "super-modularity". A brief Japanese explanation is provided after the quotation.

citation excerpt
> (Glen Weyl)
>  “Supermodularity is literally the mathematical concept [[...]] the sum of those is less than when you apply to the whole. It literally is the idea from Aristotle that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.
>  [[...]] It is a generalization of the idea of increasing returns in economics. [[...]] Public goods is a very specific case, where it just has to be available to everyone. Supermodularity is a much more general notion: by combining things together, we can achieve more than by leaving them separately. [[...]]”
>  (Audrey Tang)
>  “In Taiwan we have many, many different kinds of infrastructures. Since 2017 (when I became Digital Minister), we argued that if something does not lock you into future applications—namely it’s interoperable—then it qualifies for infrastructure budget, because it’s supermodular. It’s like a train station or an airport: if the airport only flew one airline, or the train station only served one private company, there would be no industry. [[...]] Interoperability means that if everyone participates, the sum is bigger than the parts—this is what we call supermodularity. So we always compare new digital projects to, say, a highway or an airport. Then we can justify using public “infrastructure” budget, because the more people join, the more benefit is created for everyone.”

Commentary (Japanese)
- [[supermodularity]] ([[supermodularity]])
    - This concept is mathematically defined as the idea that "combining elements produces greater results than adding them together. For example, rather than treating multiple elements independently, combining them produces a value where "1+1 is more than 2" - this is called "[[hyperadditivity]]" or "[[synergy]]".
    - Example: The more airports and train stations are interoperated by multiple airlines and railroads, the more valuable they become, the more users they attract, and the greater the benefits.
- [[Interoperability]] ([[interoperability]])
    - It is not merely "ease of connection," but "the degree to which other systems and services can be linked without hindrance. Interoperability" here refers to a system in which a certain digital infrastructure or infrastructure is not the exclusive property of a single company, and anyone can freely participate and expand it.
    - Example: If an airport is designed so that only certain airlines can use it, the value of its use will be low. Conversely, if an airport is designed to be open to all airlines, the entire industry will develop and social benefits will be greater.
- Digital Participation Infrastructure as Public Infrastructure
    - Audrey explains that "technologies that do not inhibit interoperability should be budgeted as "public infrastructure. This is because such infrastructures embody super-modularity, i.e., the more everyone uses them, the more they increase the benefits to society as a whole.

In short, both sides argue that if we create a system that everyone can use in combination, we can achieve greater results than the sum of the parts. By designing mechanisms (e.g., secondary voting = Quadratic Voting) and legislation to facilitate this, they explain, interoperable public infrastructures can be further developed and the benefits to society as a whole will be greater.

relevance
    - [[Quadratic Voting is useful for finding synergies]]
