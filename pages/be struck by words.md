title: "be struck by words"
---

Some people describe certain words uttered by others as a "beating."
- That the person recognizes that the two are similar.

A physical "beating" (A) is a beating without room for interpretation.
But the beating of words (b) is the interpretation of the receiver.
The person who feels "verbally attacked" (B1) is suffering from his or her own perception.

How could this kind of perception occur?
- Do you see the conversation as a metaphor for conflict?
    - Do you think it's an act to establish a pecking order in the group, like a monkey mounting?
- When you are a child, as part of your education to avoid saying bad words, are you imprinted with perceptions that associate words such as "verbal abuse" with beatings?
    - I think it's useful for speakers to think, "Words can be hurtful to others, so let's use them with consideration."
    - When the recipient perceives that it is normal to be hurt by words, it reduces the happiness of that person's life.
