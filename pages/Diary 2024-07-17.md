> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1813240553385173046) It may appear that I am acting in a hopeful [[altruistic]] way toward Something, but that is because several of my one-hop friends are engaged in hopeful improvement activities. I am personally doing altruism for those friends to help them achieve their ideals, and when they give up, my altruism for Something stops.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1813241341411008759) [[atlas]] is a metaphor for a single person holding up a celestial sphere, if I were Atlas, I would just throw it away and say "huh, what a pain in the ass", but if my friend was holding it up, I would say "oh, my hand is free right now. I'm free, do you need a little help?" But if my friend is supporting me, I'm like, "Oh, I'm free right now, do you need a little help?


I'm amused by the same situation a year ago.
