<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>There are a number of examples in history of large-scale migrations and invasions that occurred because it was deemed "more advantageous to [[move]] than to remain in the original land. The following is a brief summary of some of the most representative examples.

1.### Great Germanic Migration (4th-6th centuries)
.
    - The oppression of the Huns and [[climate change]] threaten their habitat, and they choose to make a massive move into the Roman Empire.
    - Even if they stayed, the lack of resources and conflicts with other ethnic groups were highly disadvantageous, so they moved in search of [[a new place]].

2.### Vikings (8th-11th century)
.
    - Factors include the scarcity of resources on the Scandinavian peninsula, population growth, and the existence of second and lower sons who have difficulty acquiring land through the inheritance system.
    - In search of richer land and economic opportunities, they expanded to England, the French coast, and the Russian river region.

3.### Norman southward migration (11th century)
.
    - Even if they remained in Normandy, they had limited land and wealth, as well as problems with the inheritance system.
    - He was successful as a new feudal lord, conquering England and expanding into southern Italy and Sicily.

4.### Pilgrim Fathers (17th century)
.
    - Religious repression and other factors diminished the advantages of staying in England.
    - He went to North America to try to establish a new social and economic base.

All of these are examples of people who decided that "resources and social status are limited in the original land and [[the risk of remaining]] is high," and as a result, they sought to take advantage of new opportunities through migration.

    - > Limited resources and social status in the original land
        - So the reason why some people change jobs or leave because [[growth opportunity]] is scarce in a certain environment is because [[growth opportunity is a resource]].
