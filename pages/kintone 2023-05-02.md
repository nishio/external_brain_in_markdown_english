English conversation lesson on [[kintone]]
- B: My company is making a similar kind of software called [[kintone]]. It aims to make communication efficient within each company.
- A: So this is kind of like Slack?
- B: Yes, but Slack is just for conversation. When we discuss in chat, the log is gone and it's difficult to find important information from the old logs. Our software is more like a web database with data and conversation space. It allows colleagues to see the same data and discuss on them.
