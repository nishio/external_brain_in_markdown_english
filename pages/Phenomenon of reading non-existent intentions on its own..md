> [yuyarin](https://twitter.com/yuyarin/status/1382189097763053575): The "communal skills" that I imagined were required for job hunting when I was a college student and the "communal skills" that I thought I would need once I became a working adult are two totally different things. I still feel it more strongly when there were drinking parties, but more so when it is a remote premise.

> "The ability to be attuned to the feelings of others" and "the ability to express facts in language and convey them to others" are two completely different things,
> "People who build consensus with the other person's feelings" are often referred to as "communication skills" because these are mixed up together.

It's amazing how people assume that they lack certain abilities and yet have the ability to assume that lack of ability is another ability. I'm complimenting you, here.

It is interesting that even though I fail, I can still be convinced that I am a good communicator.
