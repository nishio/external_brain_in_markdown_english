Rather than relying on [[Classification.]] with [[hashtag]], it is better to use [[link]] between pages" (shokai, in [[ScrapboxDrinkup]]).
    - [[Do not classify.]] Basic principles of the KJ method

2017-05-27

Because of what looks like "tags", [[Scrapbox]] tends to be misunderstood as "that kind of thing" by people who have experience with existing tools that "allow more flexible organization than [[hierarchical classification]] by tagging objects" (I was one such example) #Hierarchy

It became clear when shokai said at the Scrapbox drinkup, "You didn't come to this venue knowing the latitude and longitude, you came from the station via the road" [[metaphor]]. #link is a road
Tags make it easier to find, not by ticking off a scale in space and organizing it according to a frame, but by connecting paths between pages. see [[sweet potato search]].

- [Scrapbox displays the pages connected by two hops from the currently open page at the bottom. In other words, it is equivalent to a two-level mind map centered on the current point.

In the case study presentation at drinkup, it was also mentioned that tags should not be added much at first, but rather, important words in the text should be [[link]], and then, when the text is reread, keywords that are "missing" should be added with tags. I think tags are "an emergency tool to be used when you know that the links by page association do not connect well with the words in the text alone, but you know you need to connect them to a specific place.
