title: "(Column) Emergency decomposition theory"
---

In a book "Intellectual Productivity Improvement System: DIPS" Kobayashi Tadahito proposed the following checklist on how to deal with an [[emergency]] which we have to do more than we can do today. *1

- Can we lower the quality?
- Can we reduce the amount?
- Can we postpone deadlines?
- Can we change the method?
- Can you substitute a thing with another one?
- Can you solve it with money?
- We should stop it if there is no way we can.
