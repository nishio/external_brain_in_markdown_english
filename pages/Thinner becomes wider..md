<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This series of tweets examines the nature of human perception and thought, using the "Duality of particles and waves" of quantum mechanics as a [[metaphor]].
The central ideas are as follows
1. we tend to think of something "[[spreading out and thinning]]" as "[[decreasing]]" or "[[approaching]] zero," but that is not necessarily true.
- In quantum mechanics, a particle appears to be "[[a]] lump of dense grains," but in fact it also has wave-like properties (particle-wave duality).
3. similarly, [[the human spirit]] is often seen as "existing densely within a single [[individual]]," but he asks whether this is really the case.
4. AI points out that "[[depth and breadth]] is not a trade-off," which suggests a questioning of the nature of human cognition.

In other words, it suggests the possibility that what we perceive as "individual existence" is actually "expansive existence. However, it does not go into the details of quantum mechanics theory, but is used only as a metaphor to question the nature of human perception.

This is an interesting examination of the framework of human thought, which is skillfully used as a metaphor for a specialized theory.

- I think we talked about something similar in a study group on the experience process and the creation of meaning.
    - There was [[neither determined nor indeterminate.]].
    - [[probability distribution, not point]].
- You would think that this "spread thin area" is "[[Value close to 0]] so it's 0", so you would think that spreading and thinning is [[decreasing]].
    - and [[Duality of particles and waves]] made me think
- AI interprets this as a topic about field of view and argues that "[[depth and breadth are not necessarily a trade-off]]."
- Maybe we shouldn't use the term "particle-wave duality" because it's a metaphor and has nothing to do with quantum mechanics.
    - Is it really so, that you perceive it as a single dense grain? The question is "Is it really so?
    - A grain shouldn't be able to pass through two slits at the same time, but if you fire one photon at a time, you'll still get interference fringes.
    - Actually, it was also a wave.
- Similarly, we perceive the human spirit as if it exists densely within a single individual, but is this really the case? A story called
You said quantum mechanics has nothing to do with it, but it does.
- The details of quantum mechanics theory don't matter, the weight is more on the historical history of the process of humans noticing the unexpected.

### Summary of notes
.
The note, "Thinner is Wider," illustrates the idea that to broaden one's scope and perspective on things, it is necessary to thin the depth.

### Note and fragment association
.
The note is related to the fragments "narrow vision" and "when the mind is tired, the vision becomes narrower and the world becomes smaller". These fragments are consistent with the note's assertion, as they illustrate the idea that a narrower field of vision or perception limits one's understanding and perception of things.

### deep thinking
This note offers the perspective that depth is thin in order to see things more broadly. However, this is a one-sided perspective, and depth and breadth are not necessarily trade-offs. A deeper understanding can also provide a broader perspective.

### summary of thoughts and title
.
"[[Depth and breadth are]] not necessarily a trade-off."
