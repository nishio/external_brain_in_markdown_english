### Summary of notes
.
All objects will eventually break down, but at different rates depending on the object. This is related to the rate of obsolescence or half-life of knowledge.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The note and the fragment "speed of knowledge obsolescence" share the concept that objects and knowledge deteriorate over time. The fragment "quantity of objects" is also related to the notion in the notes that objects become more difficult to manage as they continue to grow.

### deep thinking
Understanding the rate at which objects and knowledge deteriorate is important to effectively manage them and retain only what is needed. The notion that we need to let go of the old in order to bring in the new is also important in terms of knowledge renewal.

### summary of thoughts and title
.
"the importance of understanding and managing the rate at which objects and knowledge deteriorate."
