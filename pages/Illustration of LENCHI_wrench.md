- [[Intellectual production techniques for engineers who use LLM]], or wrench for short
- I can see a future where they draw a picture of a wrench on the cover and call it a "wrench book.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Book "The Intellectual Production of Engineers Using LLM", LLM Engineer The code name LENCHI was taken from the first letter of Intellectual Production. It reminded me of a wrench of a tool. Being Japanese, I do not pay much attention to the difference between L and R. From these keywords, draw impressive illustrations in the distance for the book.

stylized wrench, blending seamlessly with the theme of artificial intelligence, creativity, Japanese culture and engineering. This close-up highlights the wrench's intricate design, which is both a literal and figurative tool for intellectual productivity in the realm of LLM engineering. The wrench is not just a tool but a symbol of the connection between human ingenuity and technological advancement. The design should reflect a fusion of mechanical precision and digital complexity, with elements that suggest it's part of a larger, AI-driven creative process. The surrounding area includes abstract representations of neural networks and data streams, enhancing the impression that the wrench is a key to unlocking the potential of AI. The colors remain consistent with the original cover: primarily blues, silvers, and whites, with touches of red to add visual interest and depth.

Minor modifications, Nishio's theme color is green, and the Japanese system of thinking (bottom-up instead of top-down, emphasis on familial similarity, etc.) as seen in Jiro Kawakita's KJ method, etc. will be used, so we would like to include Japanese motifs in the pictures

The image has been refined to include Japanese cultural motifs and the green theme color, symbolizing the unique Japanese approaches to thinking and problem-solving. Traditional patterns and symbols have been integrated to represent interconnectedness and the fluidity of ideas, aligning with the overall theme of innovation and creativity.

You don't maintain much of a taste for "just the broad strokes." For those who want to make detailed adjustments, it may be difficult to handle due to the lack of control. For such people, there are more specialized tools for image creation. I am not so particular, so I was "satisfied enough with this" when I saw what came out.
