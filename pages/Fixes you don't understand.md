title: "Fixes you don't understand"

2025-03-07
It's hard to measure whether or not productivity is increasing, and by how much.
At least I'll be able to fix a first-time Android app that I have no idea about.

I was able to get the video gif and audio file from the linklet, but I'll have to record something to see if I can get a proper transcription.
Maybe I'll take a walk tomorrow with this around my neck.

I'm an amateur Android developer, but I've managed to get most everything done by asking o3 everything.
I gave Devin all the app code and the SDK code to fix it because I knew I wouldn't have enough context to read through the SDK and the documentation, just the part where I'd change the code.

Yasuno described it as "[[a]] decoupling of understanding and achievement."
I'm able to modify and execute code for my purposes without understanding Android development at all.
I don't feel like I understand it at all.
I feel uneasy about this, but on the other hand, I can live without understanding how electrons move in semiconductors or how compiler-generated machine language is executed, so maybe there is no rational basis for feeling uneasy.

next:  [[Understanding and Verification]]
