title: "Plural QV"

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1661420313178165248): I was reading the explanation of Plural QV, and I was thinking that, in terms of attribute distribution, attributes that can be easily acquired need to be adjusted so that their weights are smaller. So, in the end, only the attributes that are accumulated in a time-consuming and labor-intensive way will have a large weight, which is a bit like "[[piling up riches in heaven]]"...
