- I want a solution to the problem that when you come up with improvements to a project that has been in development for a while, you can't decide what to do next, so the project is left unprogressed, and it accumulates and becomes uncollectible.
    - Improvement ideas are not yet concrete actions
    - First, we need to generate action by doing [[crunch task]].
        - What exactly is a chewing task?" asked in [[Conversation Log 2020-06-08]].
    - Clarity of project objectives will promote project growth.
    - The goal is to help you choose an action
    - Spontaneous projects stop spinning when [[Cycle Friction]] gets too large
    - Projects that are only in one person are particularly serious
    - A project is less likely to stop if it is placed between several people.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Let's talk.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I want a solution to the problem that when you come up with improvements to a project that has been in development for a while, you can't decide what to do next, so the project is left unprogressed, and it accumulates and becomes uncollectible.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of action is that action?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Actions to improve the project
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that action?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Hmmm... If we don't do it, we won't move forward.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Actions to improve the project
How will you know about this action?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Yes, that's right. Let's see, when I come up with an idea to improve a project, that idea hasn't been chewed down to [[Specific Actions]] yet. So I put it on my TODO list, but it doesn't get executed. You need to do "[[Chewing Tasks]]" first to chew up the idea and get actionable actions.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is the action located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>(I'd like to ask "what is the meaning of that bite" here, but there is a problem that verbs are hard to be extracted as keywords, I found another new area for improvement.)
Action appears after the bite, not yet
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is the action?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>not (verb-negating suffix; may indicate question or invitation with rising intonation)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
> Yes, that's right. Let's see, when I come up with an idea to improve a project, that idea hasn't been chewed down to a concrete action yet. So you put it on your TODO list, but it doesn't get executed. You need to do the "chew task" first to chew up the idea and get actionable actions.
What type of project is this?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Spontaneous projects] where what needs to be done is not given to you from the outside. It is also up to you to decide how to improve.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that project?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Spontaneous projects stop spinning when [[Cycle Friction]] gets too large
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is the project located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>If it's between multiple people, the activity of others may trigger it, but if it's a one-person project, if that one person stops working, that alone will bring the project to a halt. This is especially serious for projects that are only in one person's hands.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>How do you know about the project?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The state of knowing, or rather, coming up with and doing.
Maybe most specific if it's "know the what's of the project." The purpose of the project, the value of doing the project, how the project will develop...
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Hmmm, so you're in a situation where you feel the current project has so-so value, and you think the improvements you've come up with will make it even more valuable, but for some reason, that improvement activity isn't being done.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between the project and the action?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Actions make the project better.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is the action the same as the project? Is it different?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>A series of actions will shape the project.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is the project located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>At first it's only in one person, in the future it's better to have it between several people.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>A series of actions will shape the project.
Where is this project coming from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>A project is created when one person first comes up with an idea, then "bites the bullet" with the motivation to check the idea, creates an action, and then implements the action.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to the project when that action is taken?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>be raised (e.g. child)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to the action when the project?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>When the objectives of a project are clearly articulated, it is easier to choose the right action to take from a variety of possible actions.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the connection between the action and the project?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>There is not a one-way arrow from the action to the project, but a two-way arrow that interacts
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What does that project look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Hmmm, I don't know. [[the North Star]] I guess.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between that North Star and the project?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The North Star helps determine the direction in which to proceed. When the objectives of a project are clearly articulated, it becomes easier to determine the direction in which to proceed.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between the project and its objectives?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Summary so far
Clarity of project objectives will promote project growth.
The goal is to help you choose an action
A project is less likely to stop if it is placed between several people.
Improvement ideas are not actions, we need to create actions by biting the bullet and doing the task first.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is the project the same as the objective? Is it different?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The objective is the North Star, and the project is the marching process that's going on.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to the objectives when that project is done?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Sometimes our objectives change while we're working on a project.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to the project at the time of its objective?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Some of the things we have been doing will no longer be necessary, and conversely, various things we have not been doing will become necessary.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the connection between the project and its objectives?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>This is also a two-way arrow
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is the project the same as the North Star? Are they different?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Wrong.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to the North Star during the project?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>bye-bye
