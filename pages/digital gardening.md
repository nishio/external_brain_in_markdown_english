## [[Digital Gardening]]
- I also find that I like the term "digital gardening" because it is so in tune with the reality of the situation. The process of people using Scrapbox and other digital tools to organize, connect, and expand information feels like tinkering in a garden.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamed-project/neko/icon' alt='/unnamed-project/neko.icon' height="19.5"/>

    - > [@meganii](https://twitter.com/meganii/status/1193845428019585024): doesn't Scrapbox feel like endless [[tinkering in the garden]]? Cutting branches, connecting them, spreading them out. The more you put your hands into it, the more it looks different.
