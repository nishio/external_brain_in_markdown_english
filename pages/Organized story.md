title: "Organized story"
---

When I was describing [[Regroup]] as "software that helps you sort fragmented keywords to create an organized story," I realized that there are two interpretations of "[[liquidation]]" to begin with.

If you interpret organization as creating a state where "things are sorted and lined up on shelves," it is difficult to understand the type of organization where "[[story]] is obtained as a product of the organization.

    - [[Organized classification shelves]] Type organization aims to store everything in the proper classification
    - [[Organized story]] type of organization aims to discard a lot of [[suggestion]] links and make them into a single path

Even if you do your best to organize the former type, you can only create "[[tasteless enumeration of facts]]" and therefore cannot create a story.
- It is not good that [[Associative links]] ([[context]]) has been discarded.
