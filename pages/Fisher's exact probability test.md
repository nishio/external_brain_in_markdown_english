Polis goes halfway through the process of testing for Fisher's exact probability that the probability of a vote v for opinion (comment) c is significantly different between groups g and g, and uses the higher p-value as the degree to which a vote v for opinion c characterizes group g.

- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>The [[p-value]] of a statistical [[inspection]] indicates "whether it could happen by chance" and is originally intended to determine "significant or non-significant" by comparison with a pre-determined [[significance level]]. However, the p-value obtained in the process may reflect to some extent the strength or weakness of the association between voting for comments and the group. Although this diminishes its validity as a test, it may be practically useful to use it as an indicator for relative comparison of "the degree to which a group is characterized".
