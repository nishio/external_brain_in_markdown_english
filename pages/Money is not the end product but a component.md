- The resources that humans have by nature are "[[Hours.]]" The resources that humans need are minimal food, clothing, and shelter.
    - In Japan, the government guarantees a minimum level of food, clothing, and shelter through [[public assistance]], etc. The rest is "better food, clothing, and shelter" and [[entertainment]] (in a broad sense that includes satisfying sexual desires, manufacturing, and child-rearing).
    - I've come to do that because it's often more efficient for one person to make many of one kind and exchange them with each other than to make everything they need themselves.
    - Finding just the right exchange partner is also a hassle (see also: [[double coincidence of desires]]), so once converting to "[[cash]]" is now done.
        - Exchanges through money have expanded the scope of cooperation, making [[competition]] conditions more likely to occur.
        - The occurrence of a competitive situation can be a gain or a loss, depending on [[the balance of supply and demand]].
                - [[Five Forces Analysis]]
    - Money is not [[end product]] [[parts]].
        - If you [[convert time into money]] too much, you will not have enough of everything else.
            - If [[Satisfactory]] converted all the iron ingots into steel plates, there would be no more iron ingots to make iron rods.
        - However, [[time cannot be saved]], so it is a challenge to create a composition that converts at a good rate.
