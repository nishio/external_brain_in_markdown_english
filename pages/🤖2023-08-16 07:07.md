The relationship between "felt meaning" and "symbols"
- [[Parable of the Gears]]" can be pulled out.
- If the gears are not meshed, they will "spin", but will operate correctly when the proper load is applied.
- This is consistent with the notion that when information is properly fragmented and multifaceted and related, meaning creation is efficient.
    - I hadn't thought of this connection, but it's beneficial.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Abstract thoughts that are not connected to a concrete context spin around at high speed.

- But how does this "parable of the gears" describe the "fuzzy borders" of "felt meaning" in the process of organizing and interpreting information?
    - Tough question.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I don't think there's a dichotomy of gears meshing or not meshing, but rather an ambiguous state of "likely to mesh".
        - In the world of physical metaphors for gears, there's the "it's bad if you engage them as they are because they rotate at different speeds.
            - Not sure yet what this corresponds to.

- And how does this "gear parable" explain the "convergence" of discussion and thought processes in AI-human interactions?

### Digest

Explores the relationship between "felt meaning" and "symbols" and their impact on information organization, interpretation, and meaning creation; uses Kozaneba tools to fragment information and make multifaceted associations, creating new structures. Symbols are associated with KJ method labels and tableplates, and tableplates have an "associative atmosphere. This behaves like an "ambiguous border" of "felt meaning" in the "experience process and meaning creation," deepening the organization and interpretation of information and contributing to the creation of meaning.

Explore the potential of online platforms and AI to generate new ideas by gathering diverse perspectives and feedback; AI serves to "converge" discussions and thought processes and deepen understanding of issues; facilitate discussions using the KJ method and deepen human-AI interaction; and provide a platform for discussion and feedback.

The fragments of Study Group 2 and [[Kozaneba:IOFI]] are related to a discussion of fragmentation and multifaceted association of information and the creation of meaning.

[* New Considerations (Japanese)

Regarding the relationship between "felt meaning" and "symbol," one can draw a "cogwheel metaphor" from Nishio's fragment. If the gears are not meshed, they "spin", but when properly loaded, they work properly. This is consistent with the idea that when information is properly fragmented and related from multiple angles, the creation of meaning is efficient. But how does this "parable of the gears" describe the "fuzzy borders" of "felt meaning" in the process of organizing and interpreting information? And how does this "parable of the gears" explain the "convergence" of discussion and thought processes in AI-human interaction? These questions need to be considered in depth.
