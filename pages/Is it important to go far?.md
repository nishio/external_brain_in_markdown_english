title: "Is it important to go far?"
---

- [[If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.]]
- There is an implicit assumption that "going farther is more important than going faster," is that correct?
    - Related was written in "[The gap between "self-directed learners" and "expected learners" cannot be bridged."
