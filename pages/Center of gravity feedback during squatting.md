    - [[squat]] Correct posture at times is difficult.
    - Do not bring your knees forward.
    - Don't put weight on your toes.
    - Center of gravity is on the heel.
    - Keep calves vertical.
- ...and I don't understand it, even if it's said in words.
- Easy-to-understand feedback
    - Place your feet on a thin book or mat and float your toes.
    - If your toes touch the ground, it's a no-no.
- It is common for people who are not used to this to fall backwards because they cannot maintain their balance when they hold the center of gravity.
    - So you need to hold onto something or have a supporter hold your hand.
