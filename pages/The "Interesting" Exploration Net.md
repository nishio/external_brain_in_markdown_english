title: 'The "Interesting" Exploration Net'
---

Work to explore and visualize one's mind on the question "What do I find interesting?

Q: Why the theme "What do you find interesting?
- It is important to understand and verbalize "my values" in building a long-term career without being distracted by immediate tasks
- However, when asked to "put values into words," most people cannot, because the word "values" is highly abstract.
- So, you can start by collecting specific "interesting" and "not-so-interesting" things and find out from there

way
- 'What do I find interesting?' and write in the middle
- From there, associative branches extend in all directions.
    - Write about anything that comes to mind, not just examples you find interesting.
- Ensure that the branches are reticulated.
- Once a large lump of netting is created, surround it with two or three pieces at a time (island-dori) and add a "nameplate" describing the lump.
- Repeat this process to reduce the number to less than 10.
- As you look at it, ask yourself, "What do I find interesting?" and put it in writing.

relevance
    - [[KJ method for "interesting]]
    - I did this in 2019 and found it beneficial to me. I further improved on this "interesting" exploration net
    - [[Try Thinking Fireworks]]
    - Exploration Net = Thinking Fireworks

What others have tried
- I feel like you're stumbling over my lack of explanation, so I need to improve my explanation.
    - This page doesn't tell you how to use Kozaneba at all.
        - Because Kozaneba isn't essential to doing "interesting expeditions online."
            - I plan to use Miro in [[KJ Method Study Session @ Loftwork_Lecture Material v1]], and
    - Need a "how to do an interesting expedition net in Kozaneba" type of explanation.
- People who are online.
