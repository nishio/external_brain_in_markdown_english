    - [[Sanyuttha Nikaya 6.1.1]]
- The story is that an enlightened [[Buddha]] said, "No one will understand this enlightenment when I preach it," to which Brahma replied, "Sure, most people won't understand it, but there are some who will, so preach it!
- There are many interpretations of this episode.
    - Brahman (= Brahman), the most high and mighty God, asked Buddha to preach, Buddha amazing!
    - You foiled it by having him ask Brahma, the supreme deity of the prevailing religion of the time.
    - That Bhutta thought, even for a moment, that there was no need to save sentient beings is a stain.
    - The Brahma-sangha request is a mythologization of "the masses asking the Buddha to preach his teachings."
    - This Brahma is a Namuchi (demon) in disguise, trying to delay Buddha's liberation and create an opportunity for his fall.
