title: "Unexplored Togetter Summary"
---

- I would like to compile the Tweet that got excited every time we had an unexplored results debriefing session (Demo day), etc.
- `#mitoudemoday` tags are used to make it easier to pick up.
- There are a rather large number of things that are referred to as "unexplored" that are not.
    - Filters the "Unexplored Summoning" lanobes and the "Unexplored Za" theater troupe.
- You could also find an "account that is clearly in the venue" and sink it.
- I can use the filter I've been working on to help me put it together on Togetter.
