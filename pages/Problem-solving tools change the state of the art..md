Problem solver changes the state of one range X to the state of another range Y
Hopefully there is someone in this range X who is in pain and the change in condition will eliminate their pain.
That solves the problem.

However, here are two untested hypotheses
- 1: Is there a customer in range X?
- 2: Will customers be satisfied with Range Y?

- [Solve problem Y with means X to make customer Z happy.
- Note that X and Y are prefixed with overlapping variable names.
- There are two types of problems: the ones you just think of in your head, and the ones your specific customer Z is having.
- The specific issue is [the gap between ideal and reality
- Problem solving measure X has range X and range Y
    - If the customer's reality is not in scope X or the ideal is not in scope Y, then means X by itself cannot solve the problem.
    - A combination of other things could solve the problem.
- Focusing on one customer and making what that customer wants anyway is one option, but I don't recommend it.
    - It's a way to move forward anyway when there is no other option.
        - [[Make what you use.]] is a method that proceeds by focusing on one customer, yourself anyway.
    - Better than fluffing around without customers and making something no one wants.
- First, observe the distribution of customer distress, then consider a problem-solving measure that has a range X where there are many people.

    - Why we do it
    - Unlike when the means of problem solving is human labor, software has good features
    - The effort to create one can solve the problems of multiple people.
    - Then you're solving more problems per effort if you're solving problems where there's more than one person in the group.
