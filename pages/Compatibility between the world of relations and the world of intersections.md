> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1819899672682729516) "[[The world is a network of relationships]]." I was wondering if "The world is [[intersecting group]]s." is compatible with "The world is [[intersecting group]]'s." If a group has [[velvety]] boundaries, it seems to me that the only difference is where we think the boundaries are when we [[simplify]] and understand them.
