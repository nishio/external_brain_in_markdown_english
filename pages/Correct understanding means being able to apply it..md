title: "Correct understanding means being able to apply it."
---

- The purpose of reading is not to understand the author's opinion
- Reading a book and understanding it correctly means being able to apply what is written in the book and derive useful results.
- Correct understanding means being able to apply it.
    - That pretty much sums it up.
- Drucker, "[Knowledge must be proven by deeds."

> I just realized that from the standpoint of [[pragmatism]], which defines correctness in terms of [[usefulness]] for one's life, "reading a book and understanding it correctly" is not "understanding what the author meant" but "being able to [[apply]] it and derive useful results. I think it's better to understand what the author is trying to say. It may be easier to realize what the author wanted to say if you know what the author wanted to say, but it is not a must.
