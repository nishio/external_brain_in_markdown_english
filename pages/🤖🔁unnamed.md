- [[Conversation Log 2020-06-05]] at [[Conversation Log 2020-06-05]], we came up with a system where the chat system is not limited to just chatting, but also does other activities.
- Chat system asks questions, human answers them, divides the answers into sticky notes and displays them on a whiteboard [[Regroup]], human can move them around and organize them, chat system highlights keywords that are of interest

I think this is relevant to [[Clean Language as a Board Game]] as well.
