# Definition of a wise person and a "chewed up explanation"
![image](https://gyazo.com/fad712916bfd3911830c30fed78a3511/thumb/1000)

- The discourse that "smart people can explain things clearly" is ambiguous as to the meaning of "smart."
- Someone who "knows a lot about a concept" can explain it in terms of smaller steps on a staircase.
        - [[wordy explanation]].

        - I wrote "can be done" in 2019, but doubtful as of 2025.
            - Even [[people who can ride bicycles]] may not always be able to verbally "[[Describe.]]" how to ride a bicycle.
            - Listening to explanations" is only part of the means of knowledge acquisition.
        - If anything [[the reverse is true]].
            - Someone who is unfamiliar with a concept cannot [[delving into]] and explain it.
            - Not that anyone who knows what they're talking about can explain it.
- Smaller steps are less likely to be tripped over.
    - But the size of the steps is inversely proportional to the number of steps it takes to reach the destination.
        - The more detailed the explanation, the more time it takes.

- A "smart person" here refers not only to someone who is knowledgeable, but also to someone who understands a concept in depth and can consider it logically.
- In other words, "those who have a good understanding of a concept" can provide an explanation that breaks the information down into smaller steps (i.e., steps in a staircase) based on that understanding, or what is called a [[chewed-up]] explanation.
- This step-by-step explanation has the effect of reducing the load (steps) of each step, so that listeners are less likely to stumble at each step.
- However, there is a tradeoff: as steps are reduced, the number of steps to reach the destination (final understanding) increases, and as a result, the overall time and effort required for the explanation increases.

# oversight by someone who knows what they're doing
- A person who "knows a lot about a concept," A, often overlooks
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/91e4a15f0c4d5fe24a6734237f5abddf/thumb/1000)
- Mr. A tends to think that if the steps are small enough, anyone can climb up
    - Because I was able to climb up, I tend to assume that others will too
    - But many don't have the patience to go that far.
- A' noticed this and tended to remark, "If you don't have the patience, it's impossible to climb up."
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3-mini-high/icon' alt='o3-mini-high.icon' height="19.5"/>
- A, who has a good understanding of a concept, tends to think that anyone can climb the same way if the steps are small enough, based on his own experience of being able to understand the concept with small steps.
- In other words, they assume that because they were able to understand it, others will be able to persevere as well. In reality, however, everyone has different levels of perseverance and learning environments, and many will likely not have the patience or time to do so.
- A', who realizes this point, tends to remark that "without perseverance, climbing itself is impossible," but therein lies another problem.
    - This 'A' also overlooked something else.

# Misunderstanding of learner needs

- Mr. 'A' assumes that "what Mr. B wants to get is flag X".
    - So you can't get it by climbing four steps, it's impossible, think about it.
    - But would that be right?
- If Mr. B, who doesn't know much about X, says "I want X," he doesn't mean it literally.
    - There is a wide range of what Mr. B really wants and desires.
    - The optimal goal will vary with the time cost that Mr. B can give within that range.
    - B', who went for Y, was able to reach a "satisfactory result" in the same amount of time as B
- To teach correctly, we need to know what and how much Mr. B wants and how much time he can spend.

- Mr. 'A' stereotypically believes that Mr. B is aiming for a specific goal, "flag X," and decides that he cannot possibly reach that goal with as little as four steps, for example.
- However, when Mr. B says, "I want X," he does not necessarily mean the literal and specific "X." Mr. B's true desire is a wide range of possibilities.
    - Often the case is different from "A's idea of X."<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- In addition, the optimal goal and means of reaching it will vary depending on the combination of time and effort (time cost) that Mr. B can invest.
- In fact, Mr. B', who went for Y, may have found a way to reach a satisfactory result in the same amount of time as Mr. B.
- In order to instruct correctly, it is necessary to know well in advance what and how much Mr. B wants and how much time and effort he can devote.


# Challenges in knowledge exchange among adults
.
- There's some oversight on Mr. B's part.
    - In many cases, Mr. A is not willing to devote a lot of time and optimal teaching for individual B
        - To maximize Mr. B's profit, it is best for Mr. A to learn more about Mr. B and offer him a path to Y
        - I wouldn't do something that time-consuming unless I had a good relationship with them.
    - Unlike in school, where the relationship is "teacher-student," in a relationship between adults, Mr. B must first be perceived by Mr. A as "worth his time to teach.

- In many cases, Mr. A does not have the willingness to spend a great deal of time with Mr. B personally and prepare from scratch the best way to explain the situation.
- Essentially, to maximize Mr. B's benefit, it would be desirable for Mr. A to understand Mr. B's personality and learning style and offer him the best path to Y. In practice, however, it is less time-consuming to do so.
- This indicates the reality that, unlike the clear framework of an educational relationship such as "teacher-student," in a knowledge exchange between adults, Mr. B must first be perceived by Mr. A as "worth teaching.

- I got a subheading for o3.
- Each block was written by o3 in parallel.
    - I'll figure out after a while which is easier to read.
