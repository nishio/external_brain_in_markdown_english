title: "Right to refuse to provide web services"
---

2021-02-04
If humans have the right to decide whether or not to use web services, but web services do not have the right to decide whether or not to provide services to humans, web services must provide services in a [[slave]] manner, no matter how they are treated by any human. This is a [[humanity]] problematic situation, and it is socially unjust to overlook this situation, so services should be given the right to screen users and refuse to provide services.

As a result, some people will not be able to receive services.

- [[AI Rights]]
- [[denial of service]]
