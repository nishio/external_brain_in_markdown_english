2023-05-08
[[Starbucks]] is introducing new products at the cash registers starting Wednesday and [[mobile ordering]] starting today, Monday.
- Is the strategy to create an opportunity to experience mobile ordering?
- New menu is unfamiliar to operations
    - So it is better to place your mobile order early than to come to the cashier and wait for your order to be placed.
    - Don't worry if you make a little mistake or take some time to check with your seniors.
    - Less pressure
- After familiarizing yourself with the operation, start guiding and accepting customers at the cash register.
- Smart maneuver.

On a related note, I heard that Sushiro, which had been systematizing itself a bit at a time, was finally able to complete the process from start to finish without talking to a human.
- I have to go try it out!
