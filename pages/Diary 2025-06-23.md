- [[List of articles you might want to write]]

Criticism based on not being perfect
- Most of them are not perfect and are easy criticisms that can be used at any time.
Criticism with excessive abstraction
- False dichotomy

- [[People who come in and cause problems and ban are not "left behind".]]

- [[Just saying it's a problem is not a solution.]]

If it's zero-sum, changing something means someone else loses money.
- Loss does not equal death.
