> [nyansukestudy](https://x.com/nyansukestudy/status/1965355005051027456) The reason why many people who are valued in a company are "[[psychopath]] types" who lack empathy and guilt is because "depending on the person The reason is that "performance does not blur depending on the other person".

>  Normal people's performance instantly drops when they're around people they're not good at. Psychopaths are valued because they are unfazed by anyone and can always produce a certain output.

> [beConjuror](https://x.com/beConjuror/status/1965400679742406874) In the case of the managerial class, the system is such that the person internally suppresses [[empathy]] and is unaffected, and externally [[created empathy]] is operating in many cases. If empathy does not operate externally, many people cannot run an organization and work as a one-man [[ranger]].

I see
- With ASD, it's hard to be affected because you don't work empathy for the majority in a normal organization, but if you're not creating empathy for the outside world, then you're a ranger.
        - [[loner]]
- He said that good management can be achieved if empathy can be successfully created here.

I was telling this story to a friend, and the phrase "there are [[incoming psychopaths]] and [[outgoing psychopaths]]."
- Incoming psychopaths are defensive psychopaths whose own emotions are less affected by the emotions of others.
- Outgoing psychopaths are aggressive psychopaths who easily influence the emotions of others through their own emotions.
    - If it's a normal level of affect, there must be some additional characteristics because the recipient of the emotion is merely a normal empathic person.
    - For example, "I can influence others by expressing emotions that I don't truly have."
        - A yakuza who pretends to be very angry when he is not really very angry to extract concessions from the other party.
        - They're not really sad, but they play the poor tragic heroine to get people to feel sorry for them and give them money and goods.
        - A company president who encourages employees to devote their lives to a project they don't really think is important as if the fate of the company depends on it.
        - A president who increases employee loyalty by expressing high expectations to employees who don't really think they are important.

relevance
    - [[ASD is not a lack of empathy.]]
