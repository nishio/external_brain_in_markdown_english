title: "Scaling YC"
---

- [[Y Combinator]] ([[YC]]) is talking about increasing the number of adopted companies ([src](https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/scaling-yc)).
- Started 16 years ago with 8 cases
- 20th (twice a year, so 6 years ago, I guess) 100 cases.
- Four years later, the number was 200.
- That's where COVID19 came in and went online.
    - The number of cases increased to 300, but it worked out fine.

Why Scale Up?
- > There are thousands of online applications and hundreds of startups with potential.
    - In other words, I feel we're missing out on something that has potential even in its current state.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - This is the same issue for unexplored junior
- > The value of the network will increase if more companies are accepted.
    - That would be true if the quality didn't go down with the expansion of scale.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - For example, changing an event from a 2-day/1-night camp with 30 people to a 300-person event will not increase the network 10-fold.
        - If it's not done on a scale where everyone's face can be identified, it becomes "[[a place full of]] strangers.
                - [[Where individual recognition is possible.]]

Cautiously expanding
- > Because when I led the development of Yahoo Mail, we increased the number of users too rapidly and failed.

What we did.
- > Maintain physical space to allow for events that bring everyone together
    - I think the all-hands-on-deck event is important too.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- > Split the program into smaller groups.
    - I would like to know more about that!<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Is it about creating close relationships in smaller groups, but putting up a random edge at the overall event?
        - [[Small Communities]]

- > In-house production of software to help with operations by creating a development team
    - > Integrates onboarding, alumni directory, wiki, advising catalog, demo day website, Slack and Zoom
    - > In-house software also plays an important role in the adoption process
        - > so that the adopting team can focus on the important issue of "who to choose from the large pool of applicants".
    - This idea was left out.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - There is a feeling that the unexplored human resources who are volunteers are doing it on the fly, so there is a lack of continuous improvement and maintenance (unexplored junior staff).
        - I don't think the IPA's unexplored is run by engineers, so they can't even make it themselves.
        - It is interesting to increase the scalability of the business through software

- > More GROUP PARTNERS to advise
    - > To do this, we created a visiting group partner program.
        - It's a temporary position, not an ongoing part of the team.
    - > The most recent batch had 5 visiting group partners, and last year we promoted 3 to group partner.
    - This is for my "unexplored junior mentor".[[副担任制]]を導入したらどうか」という案で考えてたことに近いと思う<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - To suddenly become a mentor with full responsibility from zero experience is a high psychological hurdle for both the person becoming the mentor and the person asking for help.
        - So, I think it would be good to have them get involved in a casual, peripheral position first, and then they can think about whether they want to become a mentor or not after they get a feel for the atmosphere.
                - [[Legitimate Peripheral Participation]]

> COVID19 occurred when we were approaching the limits of physical space.
- > Full remote forced to do
- > Surprisingly, the largest ever
- > They ran more smoothly than any other batch.
    - This was done using Scrapbox because it was unexplored junior and needed to be run remotely.[[Unexplored Junior 2021 Boost Conference]] が予想よりいいものになったことを連想するな<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - As a result, the Unexplored IT results debriefing session also became a Scrapbox, and this year in 2022, the Boost Conference also became a Scrapbox!
                - It's been five years since the last update to [[Announcement Parallel Chat]].
            - It's a nice combination of synchronous and asynchronous, so it's no longer appropriate to call it a "chat".
