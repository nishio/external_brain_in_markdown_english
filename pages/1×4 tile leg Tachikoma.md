- Check if it can be made with the parts you have on hand.
    - No smooth 1x4s or blue tubes.
        - [[Block 1x1 round]]
        - [[Tile 1 x 4]]
    - I wonder if the round one is the dome top → [[Block 2 x 2 - Dome Top]].
    - I wonder if [[Hinge plate 1x2 lock]] is [[Hinge block 1 x 2 - vertical locking catch]] for the leg joints?
- Diagonal Eye: [[Hinge Base - Hinge Top]].
- Built [[Building a Tachikoma with LEGO 1]].
