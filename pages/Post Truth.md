title: "Post Truth"
---

- [[Post-Truth]]
I know some people find it negatively nuanced, but the changing times themselves are neutral.
- Positive aspects
    - For subjects that are not easily verifiable as to what is true.
        - There is such a thing as "truth."
        - We can get to that.
    - Free people from these baseless delusions.
        - It doesn't matter if it's [[TRUTH]], it matters if it's [[BENEFICIAL]] for your life.
            - [[pragmatism]]
