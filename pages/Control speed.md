The term "control speed" generally refers to "the range of speeds at which one can reliably operate and manage the aircraft. For example, in the operation of a car or airplane, "sufficient control speed" means that the driver or pilot can operate the aircraft at that speed range with a comfortable margin.

On the other hand, in the context of business and personal growth, the idea is often cited that "if you feel like you're 'in complete control,' then maybe you're not fast enough." This is often quoted as meaning, "When you challenge yourself and reach a speed range that is close to your limit, you will grow for the first time. This is used to imply that "you only grow a lot when you challenge yourself and reach a speed range that is close to your limit. In essence, the message is, "Let's not just stay in the safe zone, let's step into a higher speed (load).

You mentioned "controlled velocity" in your weekly journal entry. I think that is the part there where you were probably talking about "effection" or someone's feeling of being "in control". The perspective that was mentioned was that if you feel that you are in complete control of a situation, then the pace is actually still too slow. The idea is that in order to gain more speed and accelerate your growth, you need to challenge yourself to a slightly riskier extent, get out of a state of complacency, and move into more difficult territory. In short, "setting higher goals with ambition will ultimately yield greater results. Overall, the term "controlled speed" was used in a way that implied exploring a more challenging pace for growth, not just a slower physical speed or limit.

The phrase "[[If]] you feel in control, you're not fast enough."
- As long as I can handle (and afford to handle) myself well, I'm not pushing the envelope yet, am I?
- If we want to learn and achieve more, we need to dare to challenge ourselves at a speed and load that makes us feel uneasy.
This is a straightforward example of the concept.

For example, if you are driving a vehicle, you can safely operate it within the "control speed," but in business and personal growth situations, the implication is that "always being in a state of complete control" is likely to lead to "[[lack of]] challenge. In short, it is easy to understand that the message is that growth cannot be expected only by maintaining the status quo in a safe zone.
