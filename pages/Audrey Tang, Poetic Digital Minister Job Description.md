:

```
If you look at the Internet of Things,
Make it the "Internet of Wisdom".

If you look at Virtual Reality,
Let's make it "Sharing Reality (Reality)".

If you look at Machine Learning,
Let's make it "Collaborative Learning".

If you look at "user experience."
Let's make it "sharing experiences with others."

And every time I hear that singularity is near,
Let's remember that Plurality (collaborative diversity) is here to stay.
```


explanation

If you look at the "Internet of Things,
Let's make it "[[the Internet of Wisdom]].
- 🇹🇼 is the network of [[Wanbao Lianet]], and we will be the network of [[Wisdom Lianet]].

If you look at "[[Virtual Reality]],
Let's make it "Sharing Reality (Reality)".
- [[Shared Reality]] / [[Shared Reality]]
- 🇹🇼 will now be able to "share the real world" with us.
    - I chose "sharing reality" because it is a real situation, not a shared situation.

If you see "[[machine learning]] ([[Machine Learning]]),
Let's make it "Collaborative Learning".
- [[Cooperative learning]]
- Please visit 🇹🇼 to learn about "equipment learning", and we will be "cooperative learning".
    - I judged it to have the same nuance as [[collaborative learning]] in English.

If you look at "User Experience,
Let's make it "[[sharing experiences]] with others."
- 🇹🇼 to experience a person's situation.
        - [[experiencing a person's situation]] = [[experiencing intersubjectivity]].
            - [[intersubjectivity]] explanation opened because it was impossible to subtitle

And every time I hear that [[singularity]] is near,
Let's remember that [[Plurality]] ([[Collaborative Diversity]]) is here to stay.
- 🇹🇼聽說 "[[奇點]]Immediately approaching" -- [[multiverse]], coming soon.
    - Where you have to worry about, "Let's remember that [[Plurality]] ([[multiverse]]) is here."
        - I think "collaborative diversity" is the key to "conveying meaning through subtitles."


- [[cooperative learning]]
