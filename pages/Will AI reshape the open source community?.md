title: "Will AI reshape the open source community?"

AI may reshape the [open source community

prev [[I'm not comfortable with the concept of reviews]].

- Over the past year, AI has changed the costs associated with programming dramatically.
    - Changes in cost structure lead to changes in social structure
    - If so, the structure of the "open source community" that has existed in the world up to now will also change.
    - The payment of overhead by following the traditional structure is a bad practice that cannot be justified in retrospect from the future.

Not sure what to do with the community that already exists
- My personal optimization is to [[folk]] and not pay the cost of [[review]] and not pay the cost of waiting for a review.
- What is the resource?
    - I own the ability to do the core of what I want to do.
        - If you don't own it, I think it's a resource to get it.
    - Branding, Attention, Attention
        - If the problem is that your software is not getting attention or use, you get some resources by contributing to software that is well known or has users.
        - If you have a case (customer or attention) that originates from you personally, you own the resources.
        - The effect is that other people's activities will develop while you are not working.
