- [[unidimensionalization]] of [[two dimensional arrangement]]
- Closest.

- If it's just a few pieces, I feel like I can write them down without thinking about the details and then organize them later.

- User's opinion: "It's good if the close ones are kind of organized, I'll organize them anyway."
    - Then I guess we could compress the horizontal axis and then do hierarchical clustering, with the top right corner first between clusters.
