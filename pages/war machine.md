<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>Yes, Deleuze mentions nomads and guerrilla warfare.

In "A Thousand Plateaus," Deleuze and Guattari presented the concept of the "war machine. This refers to a [[nomadic]] force that opposes the state. They saw the state as a [[sedentary power rooted in the land]], whereas the nomad is a [[free-moving entity unbound by the land]].

Nomads are [[Moving Beyond Boundaries]] of the state and have aspects that do not fit into the power structure. Deleuze called this nomadic nature "[[lysozyme]]" and opposed [[hierarchical]] [[tree structure]] thinking.

Guerrilla warfare is also seen as a form of this war machine. Rather than opposing the state's military head-on, they are portrayed as resisting power through [[ranger]] tactics.

Deleuze focused on the "[[non-state]] nature" of nomads and guerrillas and evaluated them as a potential source of resistance to state power. At the same time, however, he also pointed out the danger of nomads creating new states.

Thus, Deleuze discussed nomads and guerrillas as [[alternatives to the state]] and explored their political significance. His ideas are also suggestive in reading the contemporary political situation.
