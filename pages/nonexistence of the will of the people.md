The [[non-existence]] of [[the will of the people]] has been the subject of relevant reflection by thinkers such as [[Jean-Jacques]] Rousseau and [[Gabriel Tardo]].

Rousseau: Rousseau proposed the concept of "[[the]] general will," which is not the sum of individual wills, but an abstract will representing the interests of the community as a whole. In other words, the simple aggregation of individual opinions does not necessarily constitute "the will of the people," but rather suggests that the will of the people is subject to uncertainty. It can be interpreted that he was suspicious of the fact that the "will of the people" quantified by majority rule or statistics could have a bias other than the actual will of the people.

[[Tarde]]: Emphasizing the concept of "[[public opinion]]," Tarde viewed public opinion as a collective illusion that does not necessarily have substance. According to Tarde, public opinion or public sentiment is formed through media and communication, and is not the independent will of each individual, but is created by social influences. For this reason, public opinion is considered closer to a kind of illusion created within a group rather than a true reflection of the will of the people.

These ideas suggest that the will of the people is not necessarily a substance, but is shaped by influencing factors that are more than the sum of individual intentions or statistics.
