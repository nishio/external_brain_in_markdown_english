>  Japan seems to be the only country in the world where the older people are, the more their assets increase.

>  I am still not convinced that this situation is acceptable in an aging society with a declining birthrate, young people's economic power is weak, and marriage and childbirth are difficult.

>  Assuming most people receive retirement benefits around age 65, the 60s are likely to be lower than the 70s because half of them are in their 60s before receiving retirement benefits.
