- When I was working at Mercari, there was a legendary female designer who led the rapid growth of the company's product design since its founding. She had a keen insight into people and left a lasting impression on everyone. She would often emphasize that:
    - The people working at the company have a biased perspective compared to the general population.
    - Without self-awareness, one might end up creating "cool" designs or "highly conscious" products that are unique but difficult for everyone to use.
    - The goal should be an intuitive UI/UX that everyone can easily understand, even those with different attributes.
    - A slightly uncool design might be just right.
- This philosophy was called the "Shimamura Theory" internally. Shimamura is a well-known clothing chain store with many locations, mainly in suburban areas of Japan. The designer encouraged her colleagues to imagine the mindset of Shimamura's customers when creating products.
- In product development, there is a tendency to keep adding new features in the name of "improvement." Instead, the designer advocated for a bold approach of removing unnecessary elements and focusing on intuitive designs that everyone can understand. This simple and timeless design philosophy was supported by her love for products and deep knowledge of design, which was understood by many employees.
- When developing products, it's essential to adopt a mindset that balances additions and subtractions and strives for designs that are just slightly uncool.

- When I worked at [[Mercury (company name)]], there was a legendary female designer who had led the rapid growth of Mercury's product design since its inception. She had a keen eye for people and left a lasting impression on everyone. She often emphasized that:
    - People working in the company have a biased view compared to the general public.
    - Without self-awareness, we may end up creating "cool" designs or "[[conscious]]" products that are unique but difficult for everyone to use.
    - The goal should be an intuitive UI/UX that is easy for everyone to understand, even for [[people with different attributes]].
    - Maybe a slightly uncool design is just right.
- This philosophy was called "[[Shimamura Theory]]" within the company. Shimamura is a well-known clothing chain with many stores located mainly in the suburbs of Japan. The designer encouraged his colleagues to create products by imagining the psychology of Shimamura's customers.
- In product development, there is a tendency to keep adding new features in the name of "improvement." Therefore, the designer advocated a bold approach: to strip away unnecessary elements and stick to an intuitive design that everyone can understand. This simple and timeless design philosophy was supported by her love for the product and deep knowledge of design, and was understood by many employees.
- In product development, it is essential to adopt a balanced approach to addition and subtraction, and to think in terms of aiming for a design that is just a little bit uncool.
