When you come to A, B, and C in the timeline, there is a pattern where C is not the negation of A or B, but rather "allows the choice between A and B, not just A or B".

    - [[teal organization]] is not a negation of the past organization, but rather an understanding of the past organization in several patterns from which to choose.
    - [[dialectics]] There is also a pattern of "both are optional" from the oppositional composition of A, not A
    - [[choosing the wrong two options]]
    - [[Denial of the past]] not a choice
