title: 'It doesn''t always mean "studying isn''t work."'

The idea that "[[Studying is]] not work." is not universal.
It is just "[[Corporate Culture]]" that varies from company to company.

- For [[Cybozu]]:.
- Participation in events that are useful to the business can be considered business
- Books that are useful to the business can be purchased with expenses, even if they are unrelated to the current business.
- Books that are useful to the business can be read during work hours
