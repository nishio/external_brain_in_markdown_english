Hurriedly trying to enter through the wide gate

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1909466550022930529) I've observed people feeling [[FOMO]]-like [[impatience]] when they see a lot of articles on [[MCP]] on technical blogs. I think it's better to calm down and not be in a hurry, because it's easy to [[enter]].

- [[school (position) hard to enter (get)]]
- > Enter through the narrow gate. For the gate [[to perdition]] is great, and the way is broad. And there are many who go in through it.
- [["Many people go in there"]], and they think they have to go in there too, and they feel impatient and anxious because they haven't gone in there yet.
- But that's [[a wide gate]].
- The [[narrow gate]] may not be visible in the first place, or if it is visible, it may be difficult to enter, or it may close while you are hesitating.
        - [[People who are missing opportunities don't see opportunities.]]
        - [[The difficulty of getting in accumulates value inside.]]
        - [[There is no guarantee that the door that is open now will remain open in the future.]]
