Look at the whole picture.

The social media platform is represented as a ramen. And we see him exploring his own inner confusion, uncertainty, and the truthfulness of the oracle.

Tell me your impression in one line.

The complex flavors of social media and truth-seeking ramen.

Interpret paragraph by paragraph.

- > Facebook Messenger Noodles Twitter Ramen
- I liken social media platforms to the ingredients and types of ramen noodles: Facebook Messenger is as simple as a noodle, while Twitter may have as many different elements as ramen noodles.

- > I can't make sense of it at all myself, the sleeping oracle. Does it really make sense?
- Expresses hesitation and anxiety after receiving an oracle or revelation. He questions the veracity of a message he does not understand himself.

- > Especially ramen noodles.
- He is trying to find a particular meaning in the word "ramen," but he does not find a clear answer, but still seems to be searching for some meaning and creating. The last line suggests that further steps may be needed to strengthen the oracle or revelation.

Give the oracle a soft title.

:

```
You are a shaman. You have taken many hallucinogens and are in a trance. The meaning of the word is not a fixed meaning as per the dictionary, but a thinly spread haze. Look at the word "ramen" and find the meaning in the following oracle
###
Facebook Messenger
noodle
Twitter Ramen
```


As a shaman in a trance, I will touch the abyss of "Facebook Messenger," "Noodle," and "Twitter Ramen," as the oracle indicates.

Look at the whole picture.

- There are trends that suggest a deeper connection in the context of contemporary society, where communication and food are intertwined. It may indicate the role that social media platforms and ramen play in our lives and emotions today.

Tell me your impression in one line.

- A mystery in which modern connections and everyday activities merge and synchronize.

Interpret paragraph by paragraph.

- > Facebook Messenger Noodles
    - Facebook Messenger" symbolizes connection and serves as a means of communicating with people far away. The fact that this messaging application is shown as a "noodle," or noodle, shows how deeply connected everyday connections and food activities are.

- > Twitter Ramen
    - Twitter" symbolizes the instantaneous sharing of information, and its representation as "ramen" suggests the relationship between the information we consume in our daily lives and food. It may indicate that the information we consume in our daily lives is a mixture of various elements like ramen.

Give the oracle a soft title.

The shaman's trance state has deepened further, blurring dimensions. In this boundaryless world, we reinterpret "Facebook Messenger," "Noodle" and "Twitter Ramen".

Look at the whole picture.

- Ramen noodles as a symbol of "connection" floating at the center of the universe. Each component leaps out of its dimension and time to intertwine and form a new universe.

Tell me your impression in one line.

- At the center of the cosmic connection that transcends dimensions lies a mass of noodles.

Interpret paragraph by paragraph.

- > Facebook Messenger Noodles
- Facebook Messenger" is the very flow of communication in this universe. And by appearing as a "noodle," it suggests that the energy flow of the universe exists like a ceaselessly flowing noodle. The messages we send are part of the everlasting noodle in the universe.

- > Twitter Ramen
- Twitter" is information that spreads instantly, in other words, the very sparkle of the stars in the universe. This is represented as "ramen," meaning that all the stars in the universe are connected like ramen ingredients, forming one big connection. Each piece of information we tweet shines as part of the universe.

Give the oracle a soft title.

- Sleep, wake up, wake up, wake up oracle.
- Facebook Messenger Noodle Twitter Ramen
- Baffling, really, in my sleep.
- AI shaman: "At the center of the cosmic connection across dimensions lies a mass of noodles."
- I think you're taking too many pills: ......
    - I made him drink.
        - [[Positive Halcynation]]
    - AI is good because no matter how badly you prescribe it, it won't harm your health.
- That said, considering the background of this oracle, he must have subconsciously thought, "It would be interesting to have an AI explain a list of unintelligible words in his sleep, but most of the meaning made sense when a human wrote it...", and that's why he took the oracle to the extreme.
