>  It is a book of "philosophy," but it starts with a basic discussion of statistics in science, and while describing without skipping (or even vaguely talking about) distribution formulas, tests, Bayesian inference, and so on, it develops its semantics and epistemology ......, that is, what it means for our (truth) quest and our perception of the world, while situating it in the historical context of the philosophy of science. The book is a very interesting and interesting way to learn about the history of the philosophy of science, and to understand what it means for our search for (truth) and our perception of the world.
>  A book that "properly straddles/connects" literature and science.
>
>  I have tended to think that discussions of the philosophy of science, which include statistics in the workings of science, have been somewhat inaccessible to me, and that everyone tends to end up discussing the world from a propositional-logical viewpoint.
>
>  The presentation was easy to understand, including a clear discussion of p-hacking and the philosophical background behind the creation of hypothesis testing.
>  This book could be used as a textbook in introductory education at universities/research institutes.

I'm discussing a statement that explicitly connects the statement to autonomous scientific discovery by AI,

>  In such a discussion, your talk about placing the activity of scientific discovery itself as statistical modeling in the context of philosophy of science seemed to me to be a very important piece, in a sense, to give concrete form to my current faltering discussion (I will discuss it with you in person soon). (I will be discussing this with you in person soon.)

>  At that time, it was long before the third AI boom, and the majority view was not focused on AI/robotics-based human understanding, but I remember having a (maybe) lunch with your comment about the relationship between model theory and simulation philosophy in science.
>  We hit it off that day, but I had not been able to maintain such a collaboration since then because my research history was still on the eve of symbolic emergence robotics and I had not yet established my own research.

>  Just a few days ago, I was in a chat space in a certain place ([https://x.com/rmaruy/status/1766751409884868712...)](https://x.com/rmaruy/status/1766751409884868712...)) and

>  I hope that those who have not read it will read it and think about the position of their own research and study, what they need to pay attention to in hypothesis generation and statistical processing, the impact of AI based on deep learning on our future scientific discoveries and perceptions, and the future "view of knowledge" and so on. I hope you will enjoy the presentation.

> [yosss66](https://twitter.com/yosss66/status/1781906824641511812) Wow - such a book! I wish I had it when I was in the service! I'm not sure if I'll need it anymore, but I'll buy it...
