I was going to write it in my free time before yesterday's dinner, but I couldn't, so I carried it over.
    - [[Seed and prompt relationship for Stable Diffusion]]

    - > It is easier to programmatically create the mask image itself by looking at the differences.
        - > Prepare the original image and the image painted with a semi-transparent marker, and mask the areas where there are differences.
    - This didn't work.
        - I sent the PNG to my iPad, added it back, and it became a JPEG😅.
        - Should I open and edit with a decent drawing tool instead of the standard addendum tool?
        - But if that's the case, why not just use layers in the first place?
