> [@nojiri_h](https://twitter.com/nojiri_h/status/1630087128964288512?s=46&t=UrgHfq4diu6FURvG11s9Jw): The current [[AI boom]] is similar to the excitement of the [[Hatsune Miku]] descent & [[Maker Movement]] in 2007. The [[AI boom]] of today is similar to the [[Hatsune Miku]] descent & [[Maker Movement]] of 2007, but it is also technologically connected to them, with Hatsune Miku being the first to generate images, and the program being open source, shared, and spread. Will "live-able Hatsune Miku" [[AITuber]] lead humanity?

> [@nojiri_h](https://twitter.com/nojiri_h/status/1630095030710079488?s=20): With Hatsune Miku, "The voice can be synthesized. The rest is intelligence and body! And then, a lot of works were created by supplementing them with fantasies. AI action generation has not progressed as much as in other fields so far.
> ...... What, you don't have to act, you can just use an "AI cuddle pillow"?

> [@nojiri_h](https://twitter.com/nojiri_h/status/1630097238050607104?s=20): It's not enough to automate everything, Hatsune Miku became the center of [[circle of people]]. If you want to create a good relationship between AI and people, you should learn from Hatsune Miku and what happened with [[Nico Nico Douga]] 15 years ago.
