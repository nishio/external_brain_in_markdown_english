> What I tried to explain logically but couldn't, but what still moved me was the feeling that was important to me, and [[living a life that values emotions]] means that even after going through many experiences and being able to explain everything, I continue to explore what I can't explain, and I keep my mind young. It is to keep your mind young, to keep exploring the unexplainable, even after you have gone through many experiences and have an explanation for everything.
