I went to @yanrouchuan, a lamb skewer shop that became a non-working skewer shop after reading my book, "You can live even if you stop doing all the things you don't want to do. Then stress becomes entertainment. I understand. It makes me happy when people yell at me.

I think that the two books "You can live even if you quit all the things you don't like" and "Living with shoddy entrepreneurship" by Era Tencho are very good. They are also our store's reference books.
