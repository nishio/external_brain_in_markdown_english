### digest of notes
.
Offering compensation to a specific party

### Relation to Fragment
.
The note discusses the provision of rewards to specific counterparts. This is related to the fragments "[[Prove you can do it first, reward comes later.]]", "[[Payment of compensation]]", and "[[No assumption of retroactivity]]" in Nishio's research notes. These fragments include a discussion of the provision of compensation and its expectations, and are closely tied to the content of the notes.

### deep thinking
Offering a reward is an act of recognition of the value of the other person's behavior and abilities. However, when rewards are expected, those expectations may dictate behavior. The reward may become the goal, and the original purpose and value may be lost. Also, if a reward is offered, the other party may underestimate his or her own abilities. Rewards should be offered with caution, and deep thought should be given to the appropriate method and timing.

### summary of thoughts
Offering rewards is an act of appreciation of the other person's behavior and abilities, and requires deep thought about the appropriate method and timing of the offer.
