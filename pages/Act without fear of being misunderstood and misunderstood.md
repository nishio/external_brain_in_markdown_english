I think there are many people in the world who fear that the meaning of their words will not be conveyed as they think. However, rather than restraining our actions out of fear of [[misunderstanding]], we can act without fear of misunderstanding, and then, after all, we are misunderstood and have to repeat the explanation again and again.

The style is not to fear misunderstandings, but to act with a certain degree of misunderstanding in mind, and to provide polite explanations for misunderstandings that do occur as planned.
