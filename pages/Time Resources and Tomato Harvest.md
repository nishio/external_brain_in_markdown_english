title: "Time Resources and Tomato Harvest"

- When we talked about capital earlier, you mentioned financial capital, [[knowledge capital]] and [[SOC]], but time should not be overlooked as a resource that is limited in quantity.
    - And time, unlike the other three, can't be stored, so if you don't stay motivated, it's going to hang around for nothing.
    - By analogy, time is a perishable vegetable.
    - Oh, and if we pretend it's a tomato, it'll connect with [[pomodoro]].
    - That is, counting by the number of time boxes in a pomodoro-like state of concentration.
    - There is a limit to the number of tomatoes that can be harvested in a day, and they can't be carried over to tomorrow because they rot in a day.
