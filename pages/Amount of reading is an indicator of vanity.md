title: "Amount of reading is an indicator of vanity"
---

- The amount of reading is a [[Vanity Indicators]], although people who boast [[amount of reading]] are often observed.
It is not the amount of books read, but how the knowledge gained from the books is used and what [[value]] is created.

If you see people who are not value-producing and are proud of the amount of reading they do, you can just think "that's lame" and go through with it, but people who are not confident in themselves are influenced and feel impatient. Even if they read fast or read a lot in a hurry, it is meaningless if it does not lead to action.

We have to go at our own pace, step by step.
