title: "Organizing information into known categories can keep new discoveries away."

> We may create a snapshot-like tree for the output we need at the time, but we do not insist on keeping the whole thing neatly organized. As Yukio Noguchi once wrote in "[[The "Super" Organizing Method]]," categorizing and organizing for the sake of searching results in futility, and organizing puts information into known categories, rather than keeping it from new discovery.

>  While the hypothesis that "much of what we call ideas comes from this forced simplification" may indeed be true, I have a feeling that poor organization may ultimately cause us to fall back on known categories. In order to discover something new, categories must consequently be traversed.
