title: "Yes, I am rich. Not in terms of how much I have, but how much I can give."

[[Larry Wall]] (in interview by [[Dan Kogai]])
>  Dan: What kind of work have you been doing since you were fired from O'Reilly?
>  La: I was publicly unemployed for a while (smiles). Fortunately, there was a rise in real estate values, so I was able to make a living through reverse mortgages. Recently I have been employed by Netlogic Microsystems, but most of my time is devoted to Perl 6.
>  Bullets: if you were paid while unemployed................................
>  La: It would have been about $30 million.
>  Dan: That's a bold move to give up 30 million yen.
>  La: [[(I am) rich]]. If the definition of rich is not how much you have, but how much you can give.
