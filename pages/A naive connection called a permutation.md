title: "A naive connection called a permutation"
---

- [a [[naive conjunction (refers to a conjunction where what follows is the result of the preceding)]].
    - [[Stories are worth an array of fragments.]]

Highly abstracted graph theory and
Scrapbox has repeatedly surpassed the practicality test.

Page isn't a vertex in the graph theory sense.

Row instances are connected in a naive connection called "permutation".
- They have an edge called "inclusion relationship" with the page instance
- Row has multiple links
    - The link may be to a page or a line.

The page title is [[Creation of Symbols]].
