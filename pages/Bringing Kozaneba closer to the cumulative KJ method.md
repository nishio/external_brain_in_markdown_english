title: "Bringing Kozaneba closer to the cumulative KJ method"
---

2024/3/7
Re-read from [[let the chaos speak for itself]] p.365 according to the sense that it should be brought closer
    - [[Learn this when you learn it]]
        - [[Learning from learning and learning at the same time, is not an easy thing to do]]

one round
- There is always "coverage" in the foreground.
- Even if it's just a recollection, it's "brain coverage."
        - [[Five Principles of Exploration]]

It's not a rule where to carve out a round.
- May be modified to suit the situation.

R1:  [[Issue Rounds]]
- introspection
- This is an inner exploration
R2: [[Situational round]].
- data collection
    - For fieldwork, split up here and use the Fireworks Daily Report and Expedition Net.
    - Data bank is Scrapbox-like
    - Each label has a data card ID in the corner, which is referenced during the writing process
        - This is what Kozaneba calls Scrapbox.
            - Cards that keep links to more detailed information
            - Kozaneba has this somewhat "Scrapbox card look" now, but it may not be desirable.
                - Text should be freely editable.
R3: [[Essence seeking round]].
- Stick out the R2 illustration for a long time and look at it or try to make a written version.
    - R2 is the "long term map."
- R2 stimulation draws out what might be relevant from the "vast store of past experience" in the brain.
- Dialogue with R2
    - Good to be drawn not only from humans but also from LLMs.
    - LLM allows for "[[talking KJ diagram]]"
        - Related to [[Talk to the City]] in terms of [conversation with the cluster
- R3 is added as a label for the notice that came out of R2.
        - [[Replanting Notebook]], which reminds me of
    - but no.
    - The interesting thing about replanting notes is to read over X and [[transplant]] the interesting ones to Y, and to do this over and over again over time.
            - [[Test of Time]]
        - This transplant says "transcribe," so I'm guessing you're imagining a form that duplicates it as is.
            - Of course, I'm sure you'll add what you think at the time.
    - On the other hand, the cumulative KJ method doesn't say "**replicate** an interesting sticky note."
        - p.399
            - > Weave every problem or idea inspired by the data in the process of writing into the text with parentheses in the scene... and label only these parentheses all over again...
            - > In a discussion, only when you come up with an issue that seems weighty enough to make you want to slap your knees, do you label it!
        - Rather, they don't duplicate anything at all, they just use what's newly available.
Make a decision based on this.
- After that, it's the execution phase, which is another story.

Data Bank p. 434
- Classification from below
- Put up a proper nameplate.
- Repetition of this

Compared to Scrapbox
- I explicitly connected the two pages by saying, "This is relevant.
    - This is a bottom-up, bottom-up classification, good
- I bracketed the keywords and a few of them were connected by a two-hop link.
    - This is good as well
- No "compress with proper nameplate" is done.
    - The KJ method is designed to reduce cognitive burden
    - It is important that 125 cards become 25 cards become 5 cards.
    - Scrapbox doesn't have that feature, so it doesn't get compressed.
    - This is a difference in operation due to the difference in "originally envisioned use".
        - The KJ method is structured data collected through fieldwork for a specific purpose.
            - I'd spend months researching, collecting data, and six months organizing it.
            - I want to use all of the data collected at cost as much as possible.
        - Scrapbox, on the other hand, has been used as a wiki in the lab
            - They are used continuously for years, and then the people who wrote them graduate and disappear in droves.
            - Many of the cards made are no longer needed.
            - There are probably a lot of things that don't make sense anymore because the people who wrote them are gone.
            - It doesn't make much sense to create a map that integrates all Scrapbox cards.
                - It's possible if you abstract one level and push some of the unfamiliar ones into the "other" category.
                    - No, I'm starting to think Scrapbox should have one.
                    - The problem of visitors not knowing what to look for after the number of pages has increased, and the theory that this is due to the lack of maps being created.

In the case of Kozaneba now
- Duplicating cards was a hassle with the paper KJ method.
- Kozaneba was created to solve this problem.
- Duplication of stickies themselves and duplication of placed illustrations can now be done with a few clicks.
- But it wasn't a duplicate that was needed to do the cumulative KJ method.
    - Duplicate only stickies added later?

Six-round cumulative KJ method takes six months to a year.
- Maybe you could do two rounds and then post the finished diagram in the bathroom and watch it.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Claude/icon' alt='Claude.icon' height="19.5"/> In order to bring Kozaneba closer to the cumulative KJ method, it is important to devise how to proceed with the rounds and how to collect and manage data, and to focus on the use of dialogue and awareness in the essence-pursuit rounds. It would also be desirable to incorporate the advantages of the cumulative KJ method, such as the ability to compress diagrams, while taking advantage of Kozaneba's features.

How Kozaneba is currently being used
- [[Kozaneba Reading]] is R2: I feel like we're starting with the data collection for the situational awareness round.
- If that's the case, then when you put it in writing, it's like cumulative KJ method if you label the next round with the words you've added, not quoted.
Task Management
- I use Kozaneba to organize when there are complex interrelationships between multiple projects.
    - This is the R1: "What if we did something like this?" is the R1: Issue Round.
        - R2: Situational understanding round, e.g., "I actually tried it and had this problem.
    - Now they're putting both in one illustration.
        - So it's getting messier and messier.
        - I guess I should make a new illustration of this!
