Reconciliation with tkgshn's criticism of Ken Suzuki

> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1646121168296894464/photo/1) "What have you done since you did it with IPA [[unexplored]]? Why isn't [[Ken Suzuki]] in the [[Ethereum]] ecosystem if we have to use the current paradigm?" I did [[Plurality Tokyo]] as a criticism.
- >  We have to implement the vision of our predecessors [[of a smooth society]], and if we don't move our hands any further [[we have to]] let them cross over.
- > [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1646135898378207232) "If the seniors don't move their hands any further, they will become [[authority]], but we, as young people, have to dare [[intergenerational struggle]] with the pride of youth. We have to be young people with pride in our youth, and we are all aiming at the same thing. We can share the same time and be moved by it."
- > [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1646136767551258627) Ken Suzuki is doing social implementation after [[PICSY]]? Is he busy with [[SmartNews]]? I can only find the old site [[unexplored]], but is he done with the implementation?
- > [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1646136834848882689) Why isn't Ken Suzuki in [[Plurality]]?
- > [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1646188020511694848) We made up! Thank you, I'll be sure to check it out!
