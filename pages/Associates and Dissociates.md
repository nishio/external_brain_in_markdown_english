title: "Associates and Dissociates"
---

    - The terms [[associate]] (assosiate) and [[associate]] (dissociate) are synonyms.
    - You may think it's "disassociate," but "dissociate" has been in use since the 1600s.
- Searching for assosiate vs. dissociate as of 2018 is a good way to find articles related to [[neurolinguistic programming]] (NLP)
    - The idea of pairing the two was probably spread by NLP.
- The word "dissociation" is translated in psychology as [dissociation
    - but the concept of dissociation and its usage in NLP does not seem to have much to do with
- if you want to put it in Japanese
        - [[subjective]] ・ [[objective]].
        - [[first-person perspective]] ・ [[third-person perspective]]
- and other similar concepts.
- Associate and associate are automatic.
    - > How to associate:
        - > Ask:
            - > How do I feel (in this situation)?
            - > How does this move me?
            - > What is my passion?
    - > How to dissociate:
        - > Ask:
            - > What is the relationship between me and X?
            - > What is this really about?
            - > What is the “big picture” here?
            - > How would this appear from an objective point of view?

In Japan as of 2018, the usage is "[[Anger occurs]]"
- (A Twitter search yields 28 observations in the last 24 hours." A Google search for "anger outbreak" yields 7600 hits.)
- This is a good sample for associates/dissociates to consider.
    - Associated status
        - I'm pissed.
        - Painful and scary
    - Associated state
        - Anger is occurring.
        - The uncle is red-faced and actively asserting his opinion.
