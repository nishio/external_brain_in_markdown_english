title: "The Heart of a Creative Person"
---

- [[KJ method Let the chaos speak for itself]]  p.449 「 [[fog of avidity]] 」
> The author himself, who has acquired the pleasure of "appreciation," will not "personalize" the work he has created, even if it is his own creation. He recognizes the independent character of his work, thinks, "Let a cute child go on a journey," and has no regrets about throwing it out into the stormy seas of the world. That is the heart of a [[creator]].
