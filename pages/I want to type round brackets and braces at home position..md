title: "I want to type round brackets and braces at home position."
---

When writing programs in TypeScript, round brackets and braces are used twice as often as numbers.
And yet they're placed in remote areas.
If you can use two different shifts in English mode, like [[thumb shift]], then there's room for three columns and all the number symbols.

I think I can do it by tweaking this area of Lacaille

Done: [[Use two different shifts even in English mode.]]
