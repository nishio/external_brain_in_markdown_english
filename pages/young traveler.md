    - In [[After the world is torn apart]] I wrote
    - What will "[[People on the move]]" do when they visit the old world left torn apart?
            - Take [Talented young people
            - The villagers may interpret it as [[abduction]] or [[cheater]] seducing them.
            - The traveler's side interprets it as rescuing [[a young man with a future]] from [[a dying village]].
            - The young man interprets this as choosing the side he finds [[interesting]].
- This description does not [[ignore the age]].
    - Instead of "the traveler takes the best young man," "A takes B.
        - It is an unfounded assumption that B is younger than A.
    - In the metaphor of traveler A and villager B, A is between 3 and 40 years old, and the villagers are 20, 40, and 60 years old, and when the 20-year-old tries to leave the village, the 40-year-old gets very angry and tries to stop him.
        - Implicitly, there is an attribute "A's age is greater than B's".
            - Wasn't this an attribute that should have been discarded?
    - In the vaguely imagined "old rural villages" the cost of travel was so high that it was difficult for a 20 year old to become a traveler on his own.
        - That's not true in the modern world.

- "Middle-aged B who thinks 'I'm A and I'm the one who takes the good young man B'" is a bad idea.
    - You think you're "[[People on the move]]" just because you're moving through a small town.
