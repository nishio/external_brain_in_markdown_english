I woke up in the morning and decided to switch my weekly journal.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1832101638141796584) I have a video conference tomorrow at 10am, but I'm afraid I'll forget, so I'm going to bed with this post open. w
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1832215155842928898) In case anyone is worried, I just wanted to note that I got up at 8:00 and am doing 3 pomodoro, meeting after the 4th pomodoro.

I was replying to Slack, Mattermost and Cosense and it's been 3 pomodoros.

- [[Complaints about bad education]]

- [[What games have influenced your life?]]

I wrote a summary of the meetup.
- If I get an OK to publish, I'll put it on Cosense.
