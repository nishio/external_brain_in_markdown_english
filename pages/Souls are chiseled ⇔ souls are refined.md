>  [[Community]] activities are healing and refine the soul.
>  This is what I found out after spending time every week for two years talking with technology-loving students.

Note that the contrast between "[[be reduced]]" and "[[be polished]]" was interesting.
- As a physical phenomenon, it's pretty close.
