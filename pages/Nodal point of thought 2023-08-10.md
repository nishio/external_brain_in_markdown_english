People want to ORGANIZE
structure
structuring

You get attached to something you've made halfway through and can't let go.
It is easier to have "[[tentative structure]]" when writing out or generate "[[miscellaneous structure]]".

We need to destroy this.
Is that "[[neri neri]]"?

When trying to organize time-series information in Kozaneba, I find it difficult to organize it without leaving time-series information

Kozaneba the table of contents of the book

- [[temporal scheme]]

Destroy.

Fear of losing
You can find out where the fragments come from by searching
Don't worry about the timeline of the fragments, I can look it up if I need to.

Destroying structure, mixing and matching
Doing it mechanically is just shuffling.
Is that right? No, it isn't.
- [[They put it in a jar and mix it up.]]
I'd put it all in one big jar and mix it up.

Chemical reactions occur in the mixing.
The fragments join together.
- [[Bottom-up grouping]]
Newly created "temporary structures" promote new awareness.
Why is it that when people do the KJ method or Thinking Fireworks and are shown the end product, others say, "Hmmm?" when they are shown the final product.
- And yet why do some people do it so enthusiastically?
- The value being produced is "[[awareness]]," which is not outward because it is "a change in the actor's inner state."
- In building [[scaffolding is not the building itself]].

[[Spaced Repetition]]
Concentrations are not random.
Anything that is written but not updated is more likely to be uninformative.
