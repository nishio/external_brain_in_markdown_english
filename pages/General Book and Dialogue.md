Isn't [[general book]] B written in a way that you don't need prerequisite knowledge to understand it, so it's easier to interact with it, unlike [[specialized book]] C?

v.s.

General books have a longer character length so that the general public can understand them, so it would be difficult to capture the core of a vector search separated by a fixed chunk.
- Wouldn't it first need to be [[summarized to a level that is difficult for the average person to understand]] on its own?
