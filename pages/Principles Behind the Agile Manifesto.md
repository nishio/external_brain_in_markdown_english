title: "Principles Behind the Agile Manifesto"

We adhere to the following principles
- Customer satisfaction is our top priority, and we deliver value-added software quickly and continuously.
- We welcome changes in requirements, even if they are late in the development process. By making change our ally, we boost our customers' competitiveness.
- Release working software in as short a time interval as possible, from 2-3 weeks to 2-3 months.
- The business side and the developer must work together on a daily basis throughout the project.
- We bring together motivated people to form a project. We give them the environment and support they need, and we trust them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective way to convey information is to talk face to face.
- Moving software is the most important measure of progress.
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. It must be able to maintain a constant pace on an ongoing basis.
- Constant attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
- Simplicity (maximizing the amount of food that can be made without waste) is the essence.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs come from [[self-organized teams]].
- They regularly reflect on what the team could do to be more efficient and optimally adjust their methods accordingly.

- I highly doubt this.
- At the very least, if they claim to be "most efficient," they should provide evidence.
