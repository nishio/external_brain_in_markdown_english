    - About [[intellectual production]] in [programmer
- Derived from the debate about whether programmers' activities are [intellectual production or knowledge production?
- There are three phases between the programmer's activities to create value
- 1: First, the programmer outputs the program.
    - You can call this knowledge production if you want, since humans are producing information.
- 2: A phase in which the output program is combined with the computer to create a tool ([[tool]]).
    - This is "[[production of tools]]" and "[[manufacturing]]", so it is "production" but not production of information or knowledge.
        - In [[Engelbert's Four Classifications]], this is the creation of "[[artifact]]".
- 3: Phase in which tools increase customer productivity
    - The "process by which a person produces something" exists beforehand, and the tools created in Phase 2 improve the productivity of that process.
