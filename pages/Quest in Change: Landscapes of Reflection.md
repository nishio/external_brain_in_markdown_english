1st paragraph
- This part of the book is about the obstacles and difficulties faced and the onslaught to overcome them." The expression "[[flood of tsunamis]]" gives a sense of urgency and danger. However, the importance of broadening one's perspective, "[[widening]] the scope of observation," is emphasized as a way to deal with this.

2nd paragraph
- A discussion of reflection and the handling of information. The importance of exploring one's own language and meaning beyond the general exchange of information and words is emphasized. It also mentions the process of hypothesis testing, suggesting that [[action and observation are more important]] than excessive prior consideration.

Third paragraph.
- A discussion of the various forms of communication. In-depth discussion of who is speaking to whom, as well as the content of what is said and its effects. Flexibility and adaptability to change are emphasized.

[[exploration in change]]: [[landscape of reflection]].
