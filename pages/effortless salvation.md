title: "effortless salvation"
---

I saw the phrase "[[effort]]-done [[relief]]" on Twitter. The idea of connecting these two is interesting.

- effort
    - Acting for a purpose.
- relief
    - To save and help (e.g., someone stuck in a disadvantageous situation that cannot be overcome through effort).
