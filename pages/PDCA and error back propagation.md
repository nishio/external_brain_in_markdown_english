title: "PDCA and error back propagation"
---

By doing what is planned and executed, it is materialized and output, and the results can be observed. By comparing the results with expectations, "[[Gap between expectations and reality]]" ([[measurement error]]) is revealed. This error is adjusted by [[reverse propagation]]. [Knowledge at a higher level of abstraction is less likely to be modified.

- The [[gap]] ([[measurement error]]) with the [[reality]] discovered by [[Check]] is [[embodiment]] and [[output (e.g. of dynamo)]] by [[Do]] of [[application]], and [[gap]] ([[measurement error]]) with [[reality]] is [[reverse propagation]].
