The majority of "[[I'm not motivated.]]" [[Lost]].

>  Q. I am not making progress in my personal development. I am not motivated.
>  A. Add one button. Create one documentation page. It doesn't matter what it is, do one thing a day, even if it's a very small thing, and it will get done eventually. The worst thing you can do is "Let's do it all at once when we get time.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1784096355176386750) If the ultimate goal is "to promote individual development," then you're right, but if not, then "if the main developer doesn't have any [[willingness (e.g. to do something)]], then you can't just [[micromanage]] a project and force it to [[progress]]. If not, then you should first consider, "If the main developer has no [[willingness (e.g., to do something)]], forcing [[progress]] through [[micromanagement]] will not result in a good product, will it? That's the first thing to think about, isn't it?
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1784097130933862715) [[spontaneous]] The reason why I'm not motivated to do this project, even though I'm supposed to be doing it [[spontaneous]], is that the developer himself is the one who said "[[it]] doesn't make sense to make something like this in the first place. I don't see the point in making something like this. And it is usually a sign of [[self-fulfillment of prophecy]], and people start saying "Poison", which means "I did my best but the world doesn't appreciate it".
    - [[I worked hard and it wasn't appreciated.]]

> [vorotamoroz](https://twitter.com/vorotamoroz/status/1784107487891013719) I think this is exactly what I'm talking about, and in fact, I think personal development will eventually go the way of the drawing board.
>  [[90% of "unmotivated" are lost]].
>  I draw big maps, like a game of life or a game of slog.

> [ebichan19850512](https://twitter.com/ebichan19850512/status/1784144651680891091) I feel that if I can [[visualize]] what I am doing now, [[Work Resolution]] will increase and [[Task Priority]] I feel like I'm less likely to make mistakes.

> [vorotamoroz](https://twitter.com/vorotamoroz/status/1784149111056523712) Yes, I think this "what am I doing?" unexpectedly leads to various mistakes and misfortunes.
>  The way tasks are cut off is abnormally large, and every time it ends with a single word "not achieved".

> [ebichan19850512](https://twitter.com/ebichan19850512/status/1784155638278602899) I am someone who is not quite there yet, but I tell my juniors, "If you are worried even for a moment, stop and ask someone.
>  Human thinking can be fatal, especially when it comes down to work, and by involving others in the decision-making process, mistakes can be stopped before they happen, or if they do happen, the damage can be minimized.
