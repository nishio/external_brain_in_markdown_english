title: "Toilet Cleaning and Luck"

> [philomyu](https://x.com/philomyu/status/1829409093309939719) When I was younger, I used to snicker at such myths as "cleaning toilets properly raises your [[fortune]]," but I've gotten into the habit of cleaning them properly myself. I've started to do it myself, and it's definitely helped my career a little bit.

By having [[say no]] skills for a job that would be better done cleaning toilets, you have [[Refusal options]] and [[Value of Choice]] starts to occur, and that's called "luck", or something like that.

relevance
    - [[Attraction of bad luck]] is a story about how personal choices ultimately cause seemingly unfortunate events.
- This story is about a career turnaround by "not doing certain things".
    - Well, I think it's more of a contribution to [[doing the muddy stuff right]] and stuff like that.
