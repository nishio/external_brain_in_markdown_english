### Digest of Research Notes
.

My research explores the concept of "[[raison d'être]]" from a Japanese cultural perspective. From Nishio's research notes, we can learn that "[[To send students to war]]," "[[Live as if you will die tomorrow, learn as if you will live forever...]]," "[[Live by yourself ⇔ live by yourself with self-sacrifice]]," "[[way of life]]", "[[Working Styles]]", "[[To live is to create.]]", "[[Social Security and PoliTech in the 100-year life era]]" and other fragments may be relevant.

These fragments provide insights into the concept of "purpose in life" and the significance and value of actions such as [[be in effect]], [[learn]], [[work]], and [[create]]. In particular, the "To live is to create" fragment offers an important perspective on finding purpose in life. In particular, the fragment "To live is to create" offers an important perspective for finding purpose in life: "To live is to combine disparate elements in a meaningful way to create order," or in other words, to create.

The fragment "Social Security and PoliTech in the Age of 100 Years of Life" also provides an important perspective on [[the search for fulfillment of life and its social support in a society with increasing longevity]].

Through these fragments, it is suggested that the concept of purpose in life is deeply related not only to individual actions and choices, but also to the social context and historical background. Integrating these perspectives will provide a deeper understanding of the concept of joie de vivre.

Q: How is "purpose in life" related not only to individual actions and choices, but also to the social context and historical background? And how do these factors influence the search for "purpose in life"?
