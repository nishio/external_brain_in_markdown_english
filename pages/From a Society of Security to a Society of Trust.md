    - From [[peace of mind]] society to [[trust]] society: the future of the Japanese system ([[Chuko Shinsho (fifth of the six classical Japanese history texts)]]) New book - 1999/ 6/1/1999
    - [[Toshio Yamagishi]] (Author)
- [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2L78Yst)

- The word "trust" is used in a variety of ways.
- If we take out the common part, we get "the expectation of the existence of a natural and moral social order" (Bernard Barber), but this definition is difficult to use
- Separate expectations for competence from expectations for intent
    - There are two types of trust that "spouses don't cheat": "they're not capable of cheating" and "they're capable but they don't do it."
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>On the other hand, it might be simpler to say "ability to overcome temptation" and "intention to overcome temptation" after assuming that we are creatures who are vulnerable to default temptation
- The author's idea is to further divide this "expectation of intent"
    - The idea that others will take this option if it maximizes their self-interest, given the mechanisms in place to influence their intentions.
    - Example
        - If you disobey a mafia boss's order, you will be killed immediately, so follow the order.
        - Disobey the village head's decision and you will be cut off from the village, so follow his orders.
    - We call this "[[peace of mind]]."
    - Reassurance [[Social Uncertainty]] does not exist
    - It is necessary in the absence of this security being established [[trust]].

Japan is a trusting society" is an untrue perception.
- Can you trust most people? 47% of Americans and 26% of Japanese answered "Yes" to this question.
- Similar results when not only asking about self-perceptions, but actually conducting a social dilemma experiment. p.30
    - experimental conditions
        - In this four-person experiment, participants do not face each other and do not see each other afterward.
        - Each participant is given 100 yen, and each participant donates a portion of that amount.
        - Twice the amount donated will be given to the remaining participants.
        - This is repeated 12 times.
        - The amount earned is paid as it actually is as compensation.
    - In other words, if everyone does not donate, your income per donation is 100 yen; if everyone donates the full amount, your income is 200 yen; if everyone but you donates the full amount and you do not donate, your income is 300 yen.
    - Japanese donate an average of 44%, while Americans donate an average of 56%.
    - p.46 With a provision to add a fine to the person with the lowest donation
        - Donations increase in both Japan and the U.S.
        - Japan 44% to 75%, U.S. 56% to 76%.

- p.35 Lone Wolf Experiment
    - Japanese choose individual behavior irrationally compared to Americans.
    - [[The fallacy of seeking causes in the mind]]

- Deterrence through social systems can reduce social uncertainty and create a "safe" society
- But a secure society does not develop the skills to create "trust" in a situation where there is a lot of social uncertainty.
- This prevents us from getting out of a "secure society".
