- >  2) It's hard to win if you don't follow the same strategies as those around you.
- >  The life skills are more transferable than in Dominion's past cards, and there are many ways to live without having to adapt to others.

        - > [Yu Ukai(@ukkaripon)](https://twitter.com/ukkaripon/status/1510933424038559751) @nishio Ah, yes. You can't win if you collect 50 cards, lol.

- There are two types of victory points in the world: "victory points that are limited in number and can be taken away," as in Dominion, and "victory points that are countless and can be taken in any number and increase when you give them to others," which Dominion does not have.
    - Life is richer when you get the latter victory points and hand them out.
    - However, victory points from the former are needed to buy victory points from the latter.
    - PS: Resources such as money and tangible objects versus [[easy-to-replicate resources]] such as knowledge, information and digital content.

- With Dominion, treasure cards don't get depleted very often, cards that don't get robbed.
    - The victory point is a card that is fought for in limited numbers.
    - There are only a limited number of treasure cards in life.
    - Victory point cards are rather plentiful and special victory points are abundant, so [[Means of earning victory points]] are diverse.

- When 10 different kingdom cards are laid out in front of you, it is easy to wonder what to buy from them.
    - But not placed there, the familiar, novelty-free card, the "silver coin," is often the correct choice
            - [[the question of silver coinage]]
    - So is life.

- Action cards are powerful and fun to use.
    - However, only one [[right to take action]] to use is given per turn.
        - [[If you want lots of action, you must first increase your action rights.]]

- The treasures and victory points we had from the beginning [[Discard makes us stronger.]].
    - If you keep it because it is a waste, the average power you can exert in one turn will decrease, and as a result, you will waste precious turns.

- It is fun to be creative with the many card combinations, but in some situations [[Strike with the power of money]] is the best choice!
    - The [[strike with gold]] strategy is the baseline, and any strategy that does not [[outperform]] it is a "[[playing strategy]]" or a "[[bad idea]] is like taking a break" 2025-02-13
