title: "A clear line of reasoning exists, but the madamis in favor of the culprit."

OLD TITLE: [[madamis design that hinders reasoning]].

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1966166368631529762) As for the madamis with a clear line of reasoning, if there are people with sufficiently high logical thinking ability on the detective's side, and if the atmosphere is in favor of information disclosure, the criminal who is inconvenienced by information disclosure will be at a great disadvantage because he/she will be suspected even if he/she resists the information disclosure. If the killer who is not comfortable with the disclosure of information is suspected even if he or she resists the disclosure, the killer is essentially at a great disadvantage, so the only way to achieve balance is to prevent the sharing of information through rules and flavors.

>  Too much so that even if there were people with sufficiently high logical thinking skills on the detective side, they couldn't identify the culprit.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1966169820183019595) Still, he was even identified as being at the crime scene at the time of the crime, so if he hadn't been able to draw and clutch his own information card that led directly to the murder weapon, he'd have been more suspicious. I think.


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1966194376348152279) I wonder if we can create a madamis in another way, "the deduction leads clearly exist but in favor of the culprit", or if we wallop it with GPT5, it would be something that is not madamis. First of all, my statement can contradict my handout, because the handout is undisclosed, so no one can point out the contradiction.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1966197045867458881) You can contradict someone else's handout. Because the other party also cannot prove the correctness of the handout because it is undisclosed information. But if you fight with bees, people around you will think, "Which of the two is the culprit?" and the world will converge. Since this problem is the same for the other party, you should point out the possibility that the other party may suspect the culprit and make them aware of it, and then get them to agree to the interpretation that "this difference is not important information.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1966197500274176097) The most damaging thing is to contradict your own past statements. But you can use the principle that "human cognition is imperfect" to say, "Eh, wait a minute, I remember that," and then peruse the handout and say, "I was mistaken.
- The three posts here are about "giving advice on behavior that hinders reasoning on the part of the culprit".

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1966199178222285298) GPT coined the term "Bayesian Jamming"? I've been doing it, but you can expand or narrow the possible interpretations of the world and reduce the likelihood that you are the culprit in that new possible world. So if someone else comes up with an idea to expand the world, you can show interest and dig in.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1966200394339725578) The disgusting action GPT has come up with, "I'm not a criminal, but I have a reason to lie," this argument makes lying less of a clue to the culprit, and if the risk of lying is reduced, people who are not criminals but have a purpose If the risk of lying is reduced, people who are not the culprit but have a purpose will also be able to lie without problems, which reduces the credibility of information that has not been proven. So the card release is too powerful when you think about it.
- Card publication will increase verifiable evidence.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1966200745402970244) But well, playing "I can't tell you that" is similar, because the secret doesn't prove he's guilty.

- [[not with the sole purpose of concealing the culprit]].
