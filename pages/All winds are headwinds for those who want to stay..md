title: "All winds are headwinds for those who want to stay."
---

All winds are tailwinds for those who haven't decided which direction to go... anyway, just move around with the current wind and decide which direction to go based on what you see and hear.

On the other hand, for those who want to stay, the wind is an annoyance that prevents them from staying, no matter which direction it blows.
