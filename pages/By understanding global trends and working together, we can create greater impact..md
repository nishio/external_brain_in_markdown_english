The development of the Internet has changed the traditional concept of [[friend and foe]]. New decision-making algorithms are needed to combine the will of individuals and groups to produce better outcomes, rather than decisions based on money or majority rule.

>  >HiroTHamadaJP: I am doing something similar in each field in Japan, but I often feel that it would be better to work together and create a way to make an impact as a big project.

>  2 is objective observation of self
>  3 is a benchmark
>  4-5 is metacognitive

The naive mental model of what is nearby as a friend and what is outside of it as an enemy became mismatched with reality with the creation of geographically non-localized communities through the Internet.

This situation is described in the Plurality book by the term Supermodularity. The situation where social consumption is combined with this is mismatched with capitalism.

Therefore, a better decision-making algorithm is needed.
