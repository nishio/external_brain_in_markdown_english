title: "Building a Tachikoma with LEGO 13"

There is still a lot of room for improvement, but if we keep talking like that, we will never reach completion, so I would like to fold up the wrapping paper and call it done here.
The original that I referred to, what I made, the materials needed, and how to make it, so that anyone who wants to make a Tachikoma can refer to it and customize it...

The bottom is closed at one point to complete the project! but it's pretty messy!
