Critics who predict the future
Mr. Yasuno and Mr. Azuma, I have a feeling that there is a difference between the pattern of action of "actually [[doing and showing]] what is [[feasible]] with current technology but [[people are not yet aware]]" and the pattern of action of "anticipating situations that may occur in the future and [[criticizing]] in advance for situations that are not good.
- That's what they call "[[critic]]", I see.
    - "Critics who make [[future]] predictions."
    - So I foresaw "[[broad listening]]" 10 years ago.
- The [[entrepreneur]] fills the [[issue]] (=gap between ideal and reality) that exists in the present with current technology.
- It is [[engineering researchers]] who create technologies that are necessary for future ideals but do not yet exist in the present.
    - Filling a gap of the type "the technology that should exist does not yet exist."
- Is it the "critic who predicts the future" who creates opportunities to change course in the present by critiquing issues in "the future as an extension of the present"?
    - I think I can flesh it out a bit more.

In addition, compared to [[critics who do not predict the future]] who only point out current issues, entrepreneurs who point them out and also solve them are considered to be better.
- This area leads to "[Ideas without implementation are no longer needed.
    - [[Get rid of critics who don't take positions.]]
    - [[Negative criticism is easy]]
