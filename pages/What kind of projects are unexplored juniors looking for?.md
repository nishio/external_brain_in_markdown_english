> Q: What kind of projects are unexplored juniors looking for?
> A: It's not quite the same as "seeking". It is "supporting" what you all want to do. So I'm asking what you all want to do and deciding if I can/want to support you.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1522829291373068288): It is often said that "each mentor has his/her own criteria for adoption", but the reason for this is that "whether you want to support" is ultimately subjective to the mentor. The reason why this is so is because "what makes a mentor want to support you" is ultimately subjective and varies from mentor to mentor.
