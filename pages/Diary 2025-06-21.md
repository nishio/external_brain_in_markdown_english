I wrote two articles today!
    - [Technology behind donation visualization - Political transparency enabled by GitHub Actions #GitHubActions - Qiita](https://qiita.com/nishio/items/ec3098f60ca3e71c8f9c)
    - [Technology behind supporter geographic distribution visualization - Looker Studio bad battle #PostgreSQL - Qiita](https://qiita.com/nishio/items/e3085be27ae97f5b82b9)
- I was going to write again tomorrow, but decided to join the festival on short notice.
