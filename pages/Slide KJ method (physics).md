- Should print the frame (I don't know where to cut it).
    - In addition, it would be good to be able to append what the source is, make_pdf/25up.py
- Cut with scissors, not cutters
- About 5 pieces can be cut on top of each other. If you stack too many sheets, it will be difficult to cut and distorted.
- You can clip the ends with clips or clothespins to prevent shifting
