title: "Better off investing in a new S-curve."
---

2018-06-17
- For subjects where the investment-return relationship is [[S-curve]].
- Early on, investing in it looks like a loss.
    - However, as you continue to invest, the return on investment will increase, making your investment more profitable.

- The problem is that after this
- Slowly diminishing return on investment will eventually make the investment a loss again.
- But at that point, compared to the other yet-to-be-invested S-curves, it still looks more profitable to invest in this curve.
- This is how they keep investing in the old S-curve.
- But in the long run, it is actually more profitable to invest in a new S-curve

- Refined version of [[Better off investing in new curves.]] from 4 years ago
- Still not sure about whether investment in knowledge follows an S-curve
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>used to naively think that it was exponential, but it is more consistent with many things to think of it as an S-curve
        - [[Principle that the learning curve is an S-curve]]
        - [[S-shaped utility of knowledge in a winner-take-all environment]]
        - [[Serial Specialist]] concept

    - Look back after 6 years and comment
        - [[The rise of the S-curve appears to be exponential.]]
        - Will exponential growth continue indefinitely or will it hit some obstacle and slow down?
            - In the real world, you can't be infinitely fast like in a mathematical model, so you're almost always going to run into some obstacle.
            - But the timing of the collision is not clear until it happens.
                - The total amount of knowledge in a given field is difficult to comprehend at the beginning stages of learning that field.

Addendum 2024.
- relevance
        - [[comfort zone]]
        - [[Trade-offs between use and exploration]]
