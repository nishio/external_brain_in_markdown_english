Lyrics to [Lively Motion

There is a feeling of [[impatience]] when something goes wrong in our daily lives, but in reality something is changing a little bit every day.
- "[[Do one thing you want to do every day]]" is relevant in terms of daily change and personal growth.
- The note that something changes a little each day is consistent with the idea of fragmentation, which is to do one thing each day that you want to do.
- [Every day something changes a little bit.
