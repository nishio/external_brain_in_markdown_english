> In May 2018, a media outlet reported that Daikin was giving 100 new graduates a "free lunch" for two years. In December of the previous year, Daikin launched the Daikin Information Technology University (DICT), an in-house university for developing digital talent.At DICT, about 100 employees each year spend two years intensively learning AI and IoT skills. During that time, participants do not do any practical work, but they are paid a salary. The company's bold strategy for human resource development came as a surprise at the time.

> In the early days of the university's start-up, these lectures were given primarily by outside instructors. However, over the past six years, we have worked to bring them in-house.
