- [[Technology Selection]] and [[motivation]]
> [@MotoyasuYamada](https://twitter.com/MotoyasuYamada/status/1687403000049156097?s=20): If you are a normal company developing a system, please proceed with PHP or Ruby on Rails, CRUD without SPA based, AWS (EC2&RDS). Any other technology selection will be hard mode. Please note that engineers who make hard-mode proposals to non-engineer CEOs are mines!

> [@takahash_k](https://twitter.com/takahash_k/status/1687639228329734144?s=20): if he's a non-engineer president, it would be more productive to let him select technologies that engineers can develop with high motivation.
> Of course, they need to be given a gut-wrenching explanation of their future prospects, learning and recruitment costs, etc.

> [@xhackjp1](https://twitter.com/xhackjp1/status/1687644686843015168?s=20): engineering presidents have a hard time bringing in small fry engineers whose motivation goes up and down with technology selection when they are serious.
> We don't pay engineers to work for us to make them feel good.
> If you want to try out your favorite technique, do it on your hobby time.

> [kur](https://twitter.com/kur/status/1687872125191999488) What, normal engineers don't get motivated up and down by technology selection!

> [kur](https://twitter.com/kur/status/1687875818163523584) Suppose you want to make some kind of prototype and you can make it with PIC, AVR, or Arduino.

>  It's possible that different people are motivated by different things, but is it possible that motivation doesn't change depending on the technical selection?

> [kur](https://twitter.com/kur/status/1687877393837670400) In the web front-end world, you can use raw JS for implementation, jQuery mainly, or some React-based framework. I think most engineers would lose all motivation if they were forced to write in raw JS without using any libraries.

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1687882266478022656?s=20): @kur It's impossible to not be motivated up or down by technology selection, and the employees of this CEO's company are motivated by this post. I'm sure the employees of this CEO's company saw this post and lost motivation.

> [igz0](https://twitter.com/igz0/status/1687776324688269313) [[Paul Graham]] said, "A programmer hired to work on a Java project is not as smart as a programmer you can hire for a project that uses Python. I don't think they'll be as smart as the programmers you can hire for a project using Python." I think what's often overlooked in technology selection is that the quality of engineers you can hire changes with the language.

> [igz0](https://twitter.com/igz0/status/1687777022620446721) And this is also from Paul Graham: "A great programmer may be 10 to 100 times more productive than an ordinary programmer, but he will be lucky to get paid three times as much as an ordinary programmer. So the technology selection that is cost effective from a managerial point of view is ultimately the language used by the best engineers.
