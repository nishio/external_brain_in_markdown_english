When a new mechanism is developed, it is first adopted in areas where the existing mechanism is not well suited, then it gradually spreads, and finally there are areas where the existing mechanism is very well suited.

[[DAOs]] and [[corporations]] also have some similarities in their objectives
    - Formation of [teamwork
    - Formation and maintenance of [organization
- [[coordination]] and [[collaboration]].
    - [[Designs that elicit contributions]]
In fulfilling this objective, the introduction of joint-stock companies will probably spread out from areas where they were not well suited to do so.
