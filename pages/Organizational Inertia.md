<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The term "organizational [[inertia]]" refers to the nature of an organization's difficulty in changing its structures, processes, strategies, etc. once established. This concept is used to describe the internal forces that prevent an organization from adapting quickly to [[changes in the external environment]]. Organizational inertia can cause an organization to cling to past successes and existing routines, slowing its ability to seize new opportunities and respond to change.

This concept is particularly important in the fields of organizational theory and organizational behavior, and has been discussed by many researchers. However, the concept of "organizational inertia" was most widely popularized by Michael T. Hannan ([[Michael T. Hannan]]) and John Freeman ([[John Freeman]]), who are known for their work from an [[Organizational Ecology]] perspective. They are. In their 1977 paper, "[[The Population Ecology of Organizations]]," they argued that organizational inertia is an important factor in explaining patterns of organizational survival and failure.

According to Hannan and Freeman, organizational inertia enhances organizational legitimacy and credibility, and as a result, organizations function well in stable environments. However, when the environment changes rapidly, organizational inertia can hinder adaptation and can be a risk to the organization's survival. Their research has contributed significantly to our understanding of how organizations respond to and evolve in changing environments.
