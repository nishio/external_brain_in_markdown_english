Using the AI function in Scrapbox, extract information from linked sites using [[LLM]] and summarize it in [[Table format]].
- Here's a lot of scrubs from the case study: [/villagepump/infobox](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/infobox).
- LLMs can create tables after the fact without the need for humans to create tables with pre-determined field items.
- It's still a freshly created UX, but it's working just fine.

[[Preliminary design no longer required]].
