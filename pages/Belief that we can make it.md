title: "Belief that we can make it"

> [manabuueno](https://x.com/manabuueno/status/1792742253406118304) I thought that after 100 rounds the world would be divided into [[those who can make it]] and [[those who can't]]. It is not a difference in skill, but a difference in which side you identified yourself as in the process of becoming an adult. To make it, above all, I need [[Belief that we can make it]], and those who can make it have it spread out without limiting their domain. It is this belief that Polanyi called tacit knowledge.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Michael Polanyi proposed the concept of [[tacit knowledge (knowledge management terminology)]] ([[tacit knowledge]]). Tacit knowledge refers to knowledge that is difficult to articulate in language or writing. For example, it is knowledge based on experience or intuition, such as how to ride a bicycle or play a musical instrument.

According to Polanyi, when we know something, some of it can be explained in words, but much of it is understood and practiced tacitly. This tacit knowledge is difficult to convey completely in words because it is only utilized in actual actions and situations.

His famous phrase "[[We know more than we can tell]]" (we know more than we can say) expresses the essence of tacit knowledge.

- GPT's explanation is also cursory.
- [The ability to sense when you're [[looking for an answer]], "I think I have the answer here."]
    - In that sense, if you rephrase it as "[[the belief that]] there may be an answer if we proceed this way," it connects with the opening statement.
- I feel that the explanation of GPT is a thin explanation often given by people who don't know much about the world, using a granddrawing method.
