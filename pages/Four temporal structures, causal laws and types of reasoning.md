For those who are interested in the various ways of time, this is a good explanation.

A comparison of the four cultural history education systems shows that there are significant differences in the way "time" and "causation" are viewed. The point of this discussion is that the different views of causality and time structure that each assumes are reflected in the type of reasoning of the learner and in the definition of "valuable acts". The following is a brief summary.

- United States (Economic Principles)
    - Reverse causality: The concept of assuming the objective first and working backward from there to find the cause.
    - Characteristics: Short, clear causal relationships are emphasized, and efficient "means selection" is considered a rational act.

- France (political principles)
    - Dialectical development: The idea that history proceeds through a series of conflicts and integration of old and new values.
    - Characteristics: "Shared values" guide the future, which is full of uncertainty. Actions are meaningful in that they aim to realize collective ideals.

- Iran (Principles of Law and Technology)
    - Analogy by the law of invariant causality: take the recurring patterns of history as major laws and apply the same principles to other cases.
    - Characteristics: Time is set straight in an objective way (divine plan or dynastic rise and fall), and acts that follow the principles of law and religion are considered "meaningful acts.

- Japan (Social Principles)
    - Changing circumstances: Events are viewed as "becoming" through the interaction of diverse factors, and time is understood as a continuous change in circumstances.
    - Characteristics: The future is uncertain and complex and not something individuals can control. An "attitude based on good will" in response to a situation is considered a "valuable act".

Thus, the different views of causality and time assumed in history education will lead to differences in how learners "think about the future" and what actions they deem valuable. Understanding that diverse ways of perceiving time exist will help us better understand the basis of education and norms of conduct in each society.
