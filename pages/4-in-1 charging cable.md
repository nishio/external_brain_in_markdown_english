- Problem to be solved
    - The problem that the battery is not charged because it is not connected to the root of the battery, even though it is supposed to be charged.
        - I forget to put the cable back in when I'm switching cables depending on what I'm charging.
    - The problem of bringing a mobile battery but not having the proper cables
        - It's easy to get careless with a variety of cables.
- solution
    - Buy two of these and keep one in your bag at all times.
    - The other is always plugged into the charger (USB-A) by the desk.
