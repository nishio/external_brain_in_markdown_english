[Quitting Node.js (going to Rust?) - Issue #11078 - misskey-dev/misskey - GitHub](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/issues/11078)
> [sora_h](https://twitter.com/sora_h/status/1675919113380843520) I think an issue is a funny thing, but to observe it from the outside and make a one-sided negative comment is a bit different, isn't it? It's not right to make one-sided negative comments from an outsider's point of view.
- > [sora_h](https://twitter.com/sora_h/status/1675923857474228225) I think anything is fine as long as the people involved, both users and developers, can continue to enjoy it. You're not yet in a position where governance is required for software.

> [sadnessOjisan](https://twitter.com/sadnessOjisan/status/1676043600097054720) It's up to the individual to use an issue they are not a party to as a toy, but for people to go so far as to attack personalities, I'd like to say that the person who built it is more competent and accomplished than you.

- > [sora_h](https://twitter.com/sora_h/status/1675898659618320384) I also feel like it's a clear generational divide...I see......... It's a pain in the ass....
I didn't understand the relationship between [[Bluesky]] and [[ActivityPub]], so I see what you mean!
