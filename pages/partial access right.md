title: "partial access right"
---

In the days when information was handled in paper documents, there were two choices: "show the whole paper" or "don't show the whole paper.

When information is handled digitally, it is possible to set partial [[access right]]. For example, only the name and address part of a document with the name and address written on it can be hidden, and the rest can be shared.

Hiding only the "don't show," and sharing the rest will facilitate [[Information Distribution]].
