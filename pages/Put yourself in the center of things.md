Put yourself in the center of things

Put yourself in the center of things.

So you feel the pulse of things. Many people lose their way amidst a thicket of useless arguments and tiresome eloquence, never understanding the essence of the issue at hand. They repeat one point over and over, exhausting themselves and others, but never getting to the heart of the crucial issue. This comes from a confused mind from which there is no way out. They waste time and patience on matters that should be left alone, and cannot devote time later for matters that they have left alone.
