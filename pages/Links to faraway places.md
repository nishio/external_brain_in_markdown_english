title: "Links to faraway places"
---

    - [[Links to faraway places]] is good
    - Define "far."
        - On Scrapbox, the link is already displayed as a link up to 2 hops away on the existing link.
        - It is preferable to link to a page 3 hops or more ahead that is not included there

After writing this and re-reading it an hour later, I realized that "[[Link to a different project]]" is exactly "far away".
