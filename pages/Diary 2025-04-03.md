    - This is the most important window

[Resolving an issue where dark cluster extraction doesn't look the same when tried with smaller data of 50 cases - Issue #96 - digitaldemocracy2030/kouchou-ai [https://github.com/digitaldemocracy2030/kouchou-](https://github.com/digitaldemocracy2030/kouchou-) ai/issues/96]
- [open a result for client development - Issue #223 - digitaldemocracy2030/kouchou-ai](https://github.com/digitaldemocracy2030/kouchou-ai/issues/223)
- Bring sample50 and sample400?
    - Where is it?
        - cybozu-kouchou-ai？
            - No, there was aipubcom and bikeshed-attak, bikeshed-nonattack
                - I'm not sure if this aipubcom is the old one or the recently reworked one (maybe the recent one).
                    - It was a little over 3,000, maybe not.
        - kouchou-ai-dev？
            - This one doesn't have a name on the artifact.
                - docker-compose up
                - Sample 400 was there.
                - Sample50 was also just a confusing name.
                - I changed the name to something easier to understand and threw out the error stuff.
    - It's easy to make a 96 fix messy, but there are a lot of things to worry about.
        - Devin opened.
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/e81ed42f041fadc9168354ea720d41f4/thumb/1000)
        - Ask Devin if he wants to do something like this, and he'll tell you where to tweak the code there.
        - They added debugging output.
        - Doesn't show up, does it?
        - Oh, you're ISRing it when you stand it up with docker-compose up.
        - `$ make client-dev`
        - This sets up a dummy server.
            - client-dev-server client-admin-dev-server dummy-server
            - What is a dummy server?
                - in /util/dummy-server
                - I couldn't figure out how to put the data down.
        - `$ docker compose up -d api`
:

```
 ⨯ [TypeError: fetch failed] {
  digest: '691811448',
  [cause]: [Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND api] {
    errno: -3008,
    code: 'ENOTFOUND',
    syscall: 'getaddrinfo',
    hostname: 'api'
  }
}
```

/.env

```
# Path to access the python API from the server side of next.js. No need to change
API_BASEPATH=http://api:8000
```

        - Uh-oh.
        - I changed it to localhost, but no luck.
            - Ah, well, that's what happens when you change environment variables.
                - `$ docker compose up -d api --build`
                - It does not seem to be the case that
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I couldn't figure out how to put any data I wanted on the dummy server, so I'm docker compose up -d api and make client-dev-server.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/devin/icon' alt='devin.icon' height="19.5"/>I see, in that case the API_BASEPATH and NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASEPATH in the .env file should be set to [http://api:8000.](http://api:8000.) The Docker service name is api, so use api instead of localhost.
        - Okay.

client/.env

```
#NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASEPATH="http://localhost:8000"
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASEPATH=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUBLIC_API_KEY=public
```

.env

```
# Path to access the python API from the client side of next.js. No need to change
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASEPATH=http://localhost:8000
# Path to access the python API from the server side of next.js. No need to change
API_BASEPATH=http://api:8000
```

`$ docker compose up -d api --build`
`$ make client-dev-server`

This worked fine.
- I think I tried that Bataan too...
- `#NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASEPATH="http://localhost:8000"`
- Were these quotation marks superfluous?

It's done.
I don't know how to format the source code...
