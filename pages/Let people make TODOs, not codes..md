title: "Let people make TODOs, not codes."
---

I think many people do this without clearly verbalizing it (me too).
- Some people can't conceive that it should be possible.
- Some people think, "Of course I can do it," and then they try it, and then they do it.
    - [[The power that should be able to do it.]]

> [OKtamajun](https://x.com/OKtamajun/status/1898763075559502028) When you get to this phase, have [[Cursor Composer]] have [[o3-mini]] scrutinize the entire code (Ctrl+Enter) to find a structural level I would then ask him to write a TODO for the coder without writing any code, and then have [[Claude 3.7 Sonnet]] code it after he spits it out. You can make it even bigger by switching to a style of

For example, giving the URL of the library's GitHub, making a turn to write down the code design in md, or relying on [[Claude 3.7 thinking]]. It becomes more and more like team management, and the main human task is to make sure that the team has the right information, and that they have optimized and synchronized documentation in place frequently.

Well, I think Cline and Cursor are too close to each other in their choices.
