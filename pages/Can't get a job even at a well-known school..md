[Even Harvard M.B.A.s Are Struggling to Land Jobs - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/harvard-mba-employment-rate-job-hunt-difficulty-addfc3ec)

The WSJ article reports that even MBA graduates from elite schools are struggling to find jobs. For example, at Harvard [[MBA]], 23% of students who graduated last spring were still unable to find jobs three months after graduation, a figure that is reportedly up from 20% the year before and 10% in 2022. This is attributed to a cooling labor market and [[hiring restraints]] by major companies (Amazon, Google, Microsoft, etc.).

Thus, the difficult employment situation for MBA graduates is based on actual data, and it seems that simply having the name of a prestigious school is not enough; the skills required and the measures taken are becoming more important.

I'd like to know what happened to someone with a software or chemistry or physics specialty, not an MBA.
