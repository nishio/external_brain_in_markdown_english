title: "We see the same things, but from different perspectives."
---

- [[A series of pictures of two people saying different things]]
- It's interesting because we're usually [[looking at the same thing]] but saying different things.
- [[We see the same thing, but we don't see the same thing]].
    - In other words [[different perspectives]].
    - A simple concrete example
            - [[A cylinder looks like a circle or a square, but it is neither a circle nor a square]]
            - [[6 and 9]]
