> The thinking space of a professional is a mixture of [[Segmented information groups]] and [[Implicit information groups]]. This state is called the "Knowledge Nebula," and professionals are required to "reconstruct" this information group to fit the context in which they are located and to use it when necessary, based on their experience. Knowledge liquefaction" is the process of extracting this segmented information and other data that exists externally and storing it in the Knowledge Nebula Crystallizer in a form that is as closely aligned with actual business operations as possible. The Knowledge Nebula Crystallizer is a system that reconstructs and presents the accumulated information fragments from a certain perspective ([[Contextual Keyword]]). The process of "Crystallization of knowledge" is the creation of "[[New knowledge adapted to the current context]]" in the thinking space of professionals through the interaction with the presented information and the information. This process is called "Crystallization of knowledge".
