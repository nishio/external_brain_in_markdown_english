title: "already dry well"

[[Well]]
- [Metaphor for "outpouring

Just because a resource gush point has gushed in the past does not guarantee that it will continue to do so in the future.
- Some wells have stopped gushing.
    - That's [[the dry well]].


[[Early adopter enrichment effect]]
- Concentrated [[early adopter group]] is a gushing point, but it doesn't keep gushing all the time
- After about 10-20 years, those people change [[phase of life]] or lose [[vitality]] due to [[aging]] and start [[settling]] without "[[next move]]".
- Then it becomes "[[a]] majority that used to be early adopters."
- This is not a gushing point.

A community cannot remain profitable for very long
