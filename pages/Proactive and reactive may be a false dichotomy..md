- [[Proactive and Reactive]]
    - [[False dichotomy]] Maybe.
- Observe the situation, find [[bottleneck]] and eliminate it
    - It can also be interpreted as [[reactive]] action in response to the input "bottleneck found".
        - It can also be interpreted as "[[identify and eliminate bottlenecks]]" in [[proactive]].
    - Of the many "[[Better to do it.]]" tasks, those that are [[eliminate bottlenecks]] are given the highest priority for resolution.
        - This is [[proactively determining priorities]].
