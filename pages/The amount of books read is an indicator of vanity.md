title: "The amount of books read is an indicator of vanity"
---

Reprint of what I wrote on Twitter on 2018-11-15
- The purpose of reading a book is not to read it, but to apply the knowledge contained in it to one's life for beneficial results.
- Boasting about the number of books you read is an indicator of vanity.
- A person who boasts about the number of books he has read or how fast he reads sometimes acts as if he does not understand what he supposedly read. Only those who have read and understood the book properly realize its falsehood.

The amount of books read [[Vanity Indicators]].
