title: "Maximization with bisection search."

- $\max_x f(x)] bivariate search for X by making [$ f(x) > X$ a solution existence decision problem satisfying
- Size where x is permutation, subset, etc. not fully searchable
- When a greedy algorithm to find max f(x) cannot be thought of, it is easier to use the existence of solutions that satisfy f(x)>X, since it is not limited to the largest solution.



[Let's use a "beat to the answer" type of bifurcation search - ARMERIA](https://betrue12.hateblo.jp/entry/2019/05/11/013403)
- [[maximization]] is [[dichotomous search]].
