> In the startup world, it is justified in the name of [[MVP]] and [[PMF]] to release a first launch written by non-technical or junior people and rearchitect it for long-term operation by senior people. Let's [[properly]] do it from the beginning.

> What if we launch software without customers, but there are no customers, so the company goes out of business? Isn't it natural to increase resources only after making sure there are customers?

> I have a feeling it's mixed up with commissioned projects. If you're talking about "the startup community (that does outsourced work)," then the argument makes sense. But I still think it would be better to [[fast start]].

> You can't spend a lot of money on something that you may have to discard after you pivot. You can create a system for long-term operation only after you see a real need for long-term operation. I think it is the role of software engineering to flexibly grow the system in that way.

- So, if you think there is "[[Possibility of discarding]]", you start small, and if you think there isn't, you start "right from the beginning".
