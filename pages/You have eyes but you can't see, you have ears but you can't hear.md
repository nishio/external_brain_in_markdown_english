title: "You have eyes but you can't see, you have ears but you can't hear"
---

> [[Psalm 115:4-8]] New Common Translation
> The idols of the nations are but gold and silver, made by human hands. They have mouths, but they cannot speak; eyes, but they cannot see; ears, but they cannot hear; noses, but they cannot smell. They have ears, but they cannot hear; they have noses, but they cannot smell; they have hands, but they cannot grasp; they have throats, but they cannot speak. Even though they have hands, they cannot grasp; even though they have feet, they cannot walk; even though they have throats, they cannot speak. Everyone who makes an idol and relies on it becomes like an idol.
