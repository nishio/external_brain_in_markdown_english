title: "Similarity -> What is the difference?"

- Patterns of thought that are beneficial for increasing [Cognitive Resolution

When you feel "[[Similar.]]" for two concepts, the fact that you did not feel "this is exactly the same thing" indicates that you feel "[[difference]]" there.
- The "difference" is not [[verbalizing]] at this time.
- To [[class with]] two concepts is to [Ignore the differences
- What is the difference?" and then you can [[observe things in more detail]].
    - Instead of equating and stopping to think.
