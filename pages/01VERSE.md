> [ForGamesJapan](https://twitter.com/ForGamesJapan/status/1636303952965943296?s=20)Zero One Berth, Koriyama is designing the game. We have been gingerly boiling down the fun of Pasta Logic. We developed the game in order to create a universal fun that can be enjoyed by both those who liked the original and those who are new to the game. Please play and enjoy the unexpectedness of the development created by the six cards.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1636283898639577090?s=20) I thought it was great that Koriyama was able to clean up the overly difficult parts of the original Pasta Logic game and make it "not too easy" for Tokoroten and I to enjoy playing against each other. I thought Koriyama-san was great. I am also looking forward to the single player mode by Mr. Pawn. The world view and flavors are also hot. Highly recommended!

- > [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1636324650715336710?s=20) When I heard that Mr. Pawn was making a single mode, I said, "Seriously! It's that Mr. Pawn! The snowy road!!! [[sheffi]] of ！！！！" The response was.

>  This is a 2-player game where it feels like each player creates their own programming process and fights! I think you will enjoy quite a brain battle in this game based on Pasta Logic. We are looking forward to your cooperation!
> [TANSANFABRIK](https://twitter.com/TANSANFABRIK/status/1638507235314913285) The game design is a very strong triangle of Mr. Koriyama, Mr. Pohn and Mr. Nishio!
>  There is also a challenging single player mode.
>  By all means!

> [hiyou_](https://twitter.com/hiyou_/status/1730533816467640692) I know it's a steampunk, but Zero Oneverse is fun and you should play it. It's easy to play because the choices are narrowed down, even though all the information is out there, and yet, what? It's easy to play because all the information is out there, but the choices are narrowed down. It's a surprising and interesting game, and each game takes about 5 minutes.
>  The 20 stages for solo made by Pawn are also good quality and interesting puzzles.
