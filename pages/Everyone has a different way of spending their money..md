    - > As for partners and the like, [[ignore those who haven't cut themselves a break]].
    - > People have different [[ways of spending money]] (VCs, etc., cannot spend money in the same way as entrepreneurs), so it is important to understand that.

Different people have different resources and different levels of difficulty in providing them.
- That's why [[trade]] makes sense.


- [[use one's own money]]
