- Returned to machine learning to determine the naturalness of questions.
    - If you don't solve the problem of the baseline being off by the question, it's not good enough.
        - [[Observed distribution of keyword scores]]

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I have temporarily turned off [[naturalness determination of questions]] by machine learning and would like to test it now that I have it back on.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of judgment is that judgment?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Binary classification as natural or not natural for the immediately preceding document/question pair, ignoring context
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of context is that context?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I haven't looked at the relationship between the multiple series of questions or anything like that. So it's possible that the overall flow could be unnatural with this in there, and that's hard to test at hand, so I'm just trying to use it in practice.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of question is that?

- Is there anything else you can tell us about this question?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Like, if you don't ask this first, it's not natural to ask this out of the blue.

- What type of linkage is this linkage?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>For example, "Is there anything else?" would be funny if it came out of nowhere.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  I've turned back on machine learning to determine the naturalness of questions, which I had temporarily turned off, and I'd like to test that.
- Is there anything else about this decision?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Nothing in particular.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  Binary classification as natural or not natural for the immediately preceding document/question pair, ignoring context
- Is there anything else about this context?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>This time there were many test cases for the flow behavior, so I was able to notice once the flow was broken, and I was able to fix it and confirm that it was back to normal.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of behavior is this behavior?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Now "Is there anything else?" is asked first.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of destination is the destination?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of X is that X?" before asking.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about beyond that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>If you just cut out the question and ask if it's natural, the question is, "What kind of X?" is more unnatural than "What other kind of X?" is more unnatural than "Is there anything else?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the type of type?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>NGKW Type
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>How do you know that question?

- Where is this context?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Flow of questions repeated

- >  Since there were many test cases for flow behavior this time, I was able to notice once the flow was broken and was able to fix it and confirm that it was back to normal.
- Is there anything else you can tell us about this behavior?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>In the end, I decided not to make a naturalness judgment on the two basic questions because I could not reconcile the comfortable order of the two questions with the fact that their naturalness as individual questions did not match the order of the two questions.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>How will you know the decision?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The user doesn't know how it's determined internally.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of user is this user?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Users of this chat
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that user?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I want to be asked a good question.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It would be good if the naturalness of questions could be judged to reduce the number of cases where clearly unnatural questions are asked to users, which impairs their comfort.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is that user located?

- What is the relationship between this question and the user?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Information is drawn from the user by being asked questions.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is the user the same as the question? Is it different?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>No, it is not.

- What happens to the user when this question is asked?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>A good question leads the user to a flow state by providing a series of moderately sized tasks. Asking bad questions confuses the user and interrupts the flow.

- What is the relationship between this decision and the question?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>If the judgment is well done, the quality of the questions will improve. If it's not done well, it's worse.

- >  If the judgment is well done, the quality of questions will improve. If it's not done well, it will get worse.
- What happens to the question when this judgment is made?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>If the baseline for judging is off, you're going to lose the diversity of questions by selecting only those questions that tend to be natural as a base.
