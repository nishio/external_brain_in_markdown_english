[[AI]] will unlock [[class with]] the [[unconscious]].

If you read a text and have a preconceived notion that "A is like B," you will unconsciously read the subsequent description of A as being tied to B, so there is little opportunity to correct that assumption.
- It's good to question the relationship to ChatGPT and they will say "this is different".

    - > <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT/icon' alt='GPT.icon' height="19.5"/>... [[land rent tax]]... is a tax based on the value of the land. This is similar, in part, to the Japanese property tax... However, there are important differences between these two taxes. The Georgist land rent tax advocates taxation based solely on the "undeveloped" value of the land, i.e., the value of the land itself, without regard to buildings or improvements.

- Whether or not this difference described by ChatGPT is correct, the latter is richer in the state of perception that "A is B" and the state of perception that "A and B differ in terms of C"
    - Ask someone who might be familiar with Georgism, "Is it true that the Georgist land tax doesn't apply to superstitious property?" and ask.
