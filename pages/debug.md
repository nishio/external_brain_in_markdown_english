    - Different behavior from [[expectation]].
    - [[interpretation]] and [[fact]] have [gap
- I don't believe all interpretations of "this is how it is."
        - [[methodic doubt]]
- We need to verify which interpretation matches the facts.
    - I can confirm "no match" but not "match."
        - [[Absence of bugs]]
