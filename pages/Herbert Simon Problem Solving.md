- [[The problem is the gap between ideal and reality]]

- This is the earliest description known today, which considers [[question (e.g. on a test)]] as [[difference]] between [[target]] and [[status quo]], and defines the process of finding and applying tools and methods to reduce it as "[[problem-solving]]". The original was first published in 1960, and was completely revised in 1977 and translated in 1979.

        - [[Target]] ,  [[ideal]]
        - [[status quo]] ,  [[reality]]

- >  [[problem-solving]] proceeds in the form of determining the [[Target]], discovering the [[difference]] ([[gap]]) between the [[status quo]] and the target ([[ideal]]), and applying a tool or process, either in memory or by search, appropriate to reduce those specific differences. The process takes the form of

- It actually said.
    - > Problem solving takes the form of setting goals, discovering differences between the current situation and the goals, discovering tools or processes, either in memory or through search, that are appropriate for reducing those specific differences, and applying those tools or processes.
        - Problems are being broken down to create sub-problems.
        - If we can break it down to problems we can solve, then the overall goal is achieved.
- I didn't say all problems would be solved this way.
    - The following p. 101 contains an explanation of "[[malinvestment problem]]"
    - Given an unfamiliar problem, one must first identify what the problem is
    - We have to find a proper way to [[problem indication]] before we start solving the problem.
