- If the gears aren't meshing, it's a lot [[racing (of an engine)]].
    - Rather faster than when it's running properly because it's not properly loaded.
    - But they don't mesh, so of course there is no output at all.
- what to do about it
    - Impossible to engage while spinning at high speed.
    - First, slow down and engage.
    - Re-acceleration after engagement is difficult because the speed does not increase as much as when idling because of the load, but we think, "This is the right state of affairs.
- Daily thoughts
    - Consider that "'Fast turnover is a good thing' is a false assumption."
