Summary of "[[Pragmatism and Truth]]": (by Claude-instant-100k)
- Pragmatism is a view in which the "truth" of a thought or idea is judged in terms of whether it is useful or useless in real life.
- Pragmatism believes that truth is formed and developed in experience. Truth is the ideas that guide experience and solve problems.
    - [[Truth is formed in experience.]]
    - [[Truth is an idea that solves a problem]].
- We believe that "truth" as a definition is too abstract to be meaningful, and we insist that truth is something that can be verified with concrete examples.
    - Related: [[Knowledge must be proven by deeds.]]
- It takes [[positivism]] in opposition to the idealistic position and defines truth as an idea that conforms to the facts.
- Pragmatism acknowledges the possibility of [[relative truth]] rather than absolute truth.
    - We regard truth as something that changes as experience develops.
    - [[Truth changes.]]
        - Related: [[Bayesian update]].
- We argue that both philosophy and science pursue ideas that are useful for human life.
The above is a summary of pragmatism ([[ü§ñPRAGMATISM]]) by William James. The pragmatic approach holds that [[truth is a dynamic concept that is formed and developed in experience]].

It is a question that forces us to make a fundamental choice about the real world: unity or diversity. (by Claude-instant-100k)
- From the standpoint of [[existentialism]], the world is made up of a variety of individual entities, and it is difficult to find coherence in the whole (pluralism).
- On the other hand, the [[idealistic]] position takes the view (monism) that there is an intrinsic coherence to the world and that diverse phenomena are derived from a single principle.
- James makes the following points in response to this issue
    - The monism that asserts that the world is a single entity with perfect coherence is not true.
    - The pluralist position that the world contains diversity and the potential for self-growth is also valid.
    - I believe there is partial consistency in the world, but there is no absolute single principle.
    - The world is considered to be incomplete and is formed and completed by human activity.
    - We argue that monism and pluralism are not mutually exclusive positions and can be compatible.
- In other words, pragmatism holds that while there is [[partial coherence]] and [[interdependence]] in the world, there is no perfect single principle. It can be said that pragmatism adopts a flexible attitude that recognizes both monism and pluralism.

Why is it possible to have both pluralism and monism?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
James cites the following reasons for the compatibility of pluralism and monism. (by Claude-instant-100k)
- Although partial coherence and interdependence are recognized in the world, there is no absolute single principle.
- The world is incomplete and in the process of continuing to be formed and perfected by human activity.
- We believe that truth is not a "match" with facts, but an idea that works within experience.
- As experience expands evolutionarily, past truths are modified.

Specifically, the following points are considered to be reasons for compatibility
- While there are various individual entities in the world (pluralism), there are also interdependent relationships (monistic elements).
- No absolute single principle, but partial consistency is allowed.
- Truth is a concept that functions in experience, not agreement, so truth also changes evolutionarily
- In an incomplete worldview, past views of truth are also modified by new discoveries.

In short, the rationale for compatibility is that [[the world and truth are in the process of evolving]], and therefore flexible perceptions are possible rather than fixed ideas.
