Project to create a (temporary) MAGI system
It is confusing with the original [[MAGI System]], so if we come up with a better name, we will rename it.

Basic Concept
- It's not fun when two groups are at odds with each other in Polis.
- So we cluster at K=3.
- Each cluster will be representative of people's opinions in three different ways [[persona]].
    - It's like the MAGI system.
- LLMs can play this persona and explain the reasons for their decision or participate in another vote
- Can do [[three-person conference method]] in a personality setting based on real human reactions.
        - [[SF Prototyping]]

It may be appropriate to make it a subproject of [[pPersonalPolis]].
