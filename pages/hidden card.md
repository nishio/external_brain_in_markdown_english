Certain games have the concept of face-down cards.
- I'll lay it all out in advance.
- When the condition is met, turn it face up and activate its effect.

No one but the parties involved know what is being withheld.
- For the parties concerned, "down" is a definite past when they are down.
- Unknown future for all but the parties involved
    - there are things we can learn from what we see
    - It's a known past to the party who lies down, so their behavior changes based on it.
        - 'For some reason, you've suddenly started investing in the English language.'

    - [[future that has already happened]]

- [[secret]] Degree to which
- It's a game face-down card, and it's generally a complete secret.
    - Only the person who got down knows.
    - Other players don't know until it's opened.
- Not so with the get-down cards of the real world.
    - That's what I was wondering about when I wrote "the parties" instead of "the person."
    - When a face-down card is set, "face-down card is set" becomes [[confirmed past]].
    - This confirmed past can be used for actions
    - concrete example
        - Manuscript not available for publication until 8/15 [[2023-08-15 ChatGPT]].
        - Not placed in public Scrapbox, but shared with 5 community locations at this time.
        - In two of them, useful reactions were triggered.
        - As for this one, it will be triggered once the triggering condition of 8/15 is met, and then after the fact, "that's it?
