- Interesting> [[root (of a tooth, hair, etc.)]]
    - What you see when you look at a large tree is only the [[above-ground]] part, but it actually has more roots underground than that.
    - If you grow only the visible part of the plant with [[poor roots]], it will fall [[unsupported]] during a [[typhoon]].
        - Image about [trying to make oneself look bigger
    - [[sucks nourishment from roots]]
            - Image of [information gathering
- Also think about [[leaf]].
    - (if not evergreen)[[leaves fall off every year]].
    - But it's not "let's stop putting leaves on it because it's pointless because it's going to disperse."
        - Even if it disperses, in the meantime, [[photosynthesis]] will provide [[nourishment]] to extend the branches.
                - The [[sustenance]] of [[growth]].
        - This is a leaf is an individual and the trunk is a civilized feeling
                - [[The body is a cache.]]
- Is it the fruit that matters, the trunk, or the roots?
    - I think what's important from a big tree perspective is the root.
    - I guess the fruit is important from the perspective of the surrounding different species of creatures that enjoy eating the fruit.
        - When a branch is broken or needs strength to recover, it does not bear fruit.
        - If by not bearing fruit, an animal that was expecting fruit dies, it is not a matter of choice
                - [[self-responsibility]]
                    - [[Atlas, who happens to be able to afford it, is propping up the celestial sphere.]]
            - They don't bear fruit for the animals to eat.
                - Not [[self-sacrificing altruism]].
                    - [[sharing with others what has been given to you]]
                    - [[share the overflow]]
                        - [[Doujinshi is sharing]]
            - Here [[I'm emotionally attached to trees.]]
    - [[Tourists]] see a big trunk and say wow, but it's just [[a pipe that sucks water from the roots and carries it to the leaves]].
