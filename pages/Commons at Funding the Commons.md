from [[Governing the Commons]]
[[Funding the Commons]] came up in the discussion about [Commons
- > We build bridges between builders, researchers & funders  transforming funding models & mechanisms  for [[public goods]].
- Web and SNS transmission does not strictly distinguish between [[Common Goods]] and [[Public Goods]].

> Common is a concept of common goods, traditionally referred to as "commons," as opposed to private or public goods. Similar to Public Goods, but while Public Goods are widely open to the public, such as roads and parks, Common Goods are limited in membership, such as villages and membership organizations. In addition to the community commons called "irinrinrin," which were once seen in Japanese villages, rivers and coastal waters where fishing rights were established are typical examples of commons.

- I feel that it is wrong to mix Public Goods and Common Goods together.
