title: "The future already exists in speck."

> I'm from the future.  [Hiromi Okuda's lecture begins with these words. Of course, I did not come in a time machine from the year 2050 or something. The future exists "speckled" in the real world, and some [[visionary leaders]] can already see "the future they want. Not only can they see it, they are already living it.

> The future is already "[[speckled]]" in the real world... I can already see "the future that I want to be" for me, and I am practicing some of the ways of working in that future through childcare and caregiving. I always say "I'm from the future" in the sense that this will become the norm in a few years.
>  However...only a few "people who can act selfishly are blessed" and "the reality is..." kind of "[[common knowledge]]". However, the reality beyond that point is spreading rapidly, and the reality is being destroyed rapidly. In that destroyed place, there are "speckled" people of the future living. I am one of such "speckled" [[man of the future]].
