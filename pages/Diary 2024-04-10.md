Yesterday and today I was working on the Plurality index.
- Jobs that let AI do the work

Do you have anything to share?" I had a conversation about how tasks that can be easily directed and handed off can be easily prompted to LLMs to get results "without the unpredictable wait times that occur with humans", and can be "psychologically safe" in the sense that you don't have to worry about social risk if the results don't meet expectations, and can be ruined or discarded as many times as you want. You can make them start over and discard the results without explanation.

I was reminded that as LLM develops, the shape of work will probably change.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1777741439457431736) Well, there's no benefit other than getting it in the paper, so you can go through with it if it's too much trouble.
