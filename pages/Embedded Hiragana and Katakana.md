This is what I got when I embedded the correspondence between hiragana and katakana (6 dimensions: hiragana/katakana, line, dan, voiced, half voiced, lower case) in 2 dimensions using [[t-SNE]].

The strange bending is simply due to the t-SNE, which seems obvious when linearly reduced in dimensionality by [[PCA]].

The next day, 2018-12-01, it became 10 dimensional due to [[rotational encoding]] of lines and columns and the addition of the long vowel symbol.
