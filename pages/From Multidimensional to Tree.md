- [[multidimensional]] ・ [[(Christmas) tree]] ・ [[one dimensional]]
Converting a multidimensional object into a tree can be done with [[hierarchical clustering]].

Conversion to one dimension can be done with a one-dimensional [[self-organizing map]], and hierarchical clustering can also be done with a little ingenuity.

pseudo code
- Merging close data points
    - At this time, points with a rank of 2 are removed from the annexation target.

Changing the rank limit from 2 to N results in a tree with at most N-1 children.

- If [[graph]] is given, [[minimum area tree]] will result in a tree
