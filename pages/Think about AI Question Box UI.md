Think about AI Question Box UI
- [[AI Teaching Assistant]]
    - More questions could be asked by having an impersonal presence to listen to questions.
    - There are hurdles to asking questions of humans.
        - The value of facilitating distribution by eliminating it.
- Benefit of people doing and answering question boxes on social networking sites.
        - [[Questions encourage verbalization.]]
        - [[Instead of speaking to many, speak to one and let the many hear you.]]
The AI Teaching Assistant case study has the context of a classroom.
- I want to be able to do it myself.
- I'm reading the text.
Some questions on social networking sites aren't even questions.
    - [[How to ask a good question]]
    - [[Cognitive distortion that internal politics are to blame]]
In terms of encouraging verbalization through questions, can't humans beat an AI that can read what we want it to read and ask questions?

If questions are generated with no information, similar questions may be generated many times
- If we had a list of questions already posed, we could take the least similar ones first.

- I read it as a question box UI, but maybe we should separate out whether it accepts human questions in the first place?
- You can't control people, so don't expect them to behave as you expect them to.
- Given some content A, you can have an AI read it and make a question text out of it.
    - Good question or not.
- When you have a question text, you can let the AI answer it.
    - Good answer or not.
- It can be determined mechanically whether the question text is similar or not.
    - Not if you don't identify with it or not.

qualia_san is an accumulation of Twitter posts
- I'm on the verge of a disconnect because I was so focused on showing you the images I put up.
