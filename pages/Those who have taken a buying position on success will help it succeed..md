title: "Those who have taken a buying position on success will help it succeed."

In the [[prediction market]] of whether a project will succeed or not, those who take a buy position have an incentive to help it succeed.
- Those who take a sell position will have an incentive to get out of the way.
- Both forecast markets accelerate
        - [[aggravate division]] may
- I feel like the mere prediction of the unknown is different from the prediction of what can be involved.
