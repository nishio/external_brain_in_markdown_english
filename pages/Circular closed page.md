- A circular page is a page where the end and the beginning are connected.
- Off topic, the beginning and the end don't connect.
        - [[Slowly devolving stories are hard to divide.]]
- Create a single topic on a single page as a circle.
- This is a matter of decision.
- Many people prefer one-dimensional writing.
- Some people like the tree-like representation, others dislike it.
- A matter of familiarity, not yet used to circular sentences.
        - [[Different people prefer different output formats, but it's a matter of familiarity]]
- Try to circle the page, and when you can't, realize that the topic is plural
- More constraints for opportunities for awareness
- The end of the page must be connected to the beginning
