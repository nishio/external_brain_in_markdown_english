I think it's a really difficult question at this time of the year.

> [komitsubo](https://twitter.com/komitsubo/status/1661882343051915265) When you look over the evaluations of various teams within an organization, there are many people who are obviously not very good at what they do, but who are rated highly as a result because there is no one around them who exceeds that person. On the other hand, there are also many people who would probably receive high evaluations if they were not on this team. But in the same company, the results are cruel, and the former are better than the latter in terms of compensation.

In the case of the former and the latter, the former are given more opportunities even though the latter are clearly more capable. It is difficult to expect a cross-border response because the system is internal to the company.

On the other hand, the latter can easily move or change jobs when they are young, but when they reach a certain age, they often find that opportunities are not available to them due to age filters.

> [komitsubo](https://twitter.com/komitsubo/status/1661884935232458752) If you are a fly-by-night person in this kind of situation, but for those who are not, you have to choose the former or the latter at some stage of your career. In this kind of situation, it is necessary to consider whether to choose the former or the latter at a certain stage of your career. The internet often says "if you have the ability, you should change jobs regardless of your age", but not many people have that kind of ability. I'm talking about a handful of people.

> [komitsubo](https://twitter.com/komitsubo/status/1661886155372240896) When I'm on the hiring side, I think to myself, "Why such a gem of a talent?" for someone who is old enough to be a good employee, but has no achievements and the rewards are subtle. " It doesn't happen that often. And if you are a good age, you will be compared to the good age, good looking people in that company. As a result, if you are compared to those people, the latter will have no choice but to be hired in the same way at the next place.

> [komitsubo](https://twitter.com/komitsubo/status/1661889137727926272) On the other hand, if you ask if the former type never grows at all, they are given various opportunities, and as a result, they are rubbed in a good way and reach a certain level of ability. I think it's not a bad feeling because at least you will have more successes in your career.

> [komitsubo](https://twitter.com/komitsubo/status/1661891379172380674) You should consider whether you yourself are the former or the latter when you are about to become a mid-level employee in a company career. Personally, I used to prefer the latter when I was younger, but recently I've come to think that I'd be happier in the former. After all, it is hard to keep getting low evaluations, and I think it is even harder to be in a situation where people who are not as capable as you are are being evaluated.

> [komitsubo](https://twitter.com/komitsubo/status/1661892491115913217) What makes people happy depends on their values, but I think it is hard to be continuously underrated unless you have a strong mentality, and it is better to have success to grow. And in this day and age, there are plenty of talented people out there, and it is easy to make contacts, so there is no need to seek them out in organizations. I have seen such contrasting examples recently, and I am deeply impressed by them.
