But if they are good at it, they are just "pretending" to be interested in others. But just forcing a smile can make people feel better and less depressed. It's very important to "fake interest.

So they don't even make an effort to be interested in the other person.

I think. Especially these days, people who "don't care about others" are increasing and I think they are the majority, so it doesn't bother me that much.
