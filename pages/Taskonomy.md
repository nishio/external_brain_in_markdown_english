This page is auto-translated from [/nishio/Taskonomy](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/Taskonomy) using DeepL. If you looks something interesting but the auto-translated English is not good enough to understand it, feel free to let me know at [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en). I'm very happy to spread my thought to non-Japanese readers.
