title: "Open and hardened expressions"

- Replacement: Substitution
- Amount of information: Amount of information
- Word Distributed Representation: Word Distributed Representation

Even when [[bracketing]] in Scrapbox, sometimes the string I try to do is expressed as something like "amount of information" and I think "'amount of information' seems more appropriate as a link title.
However, when I rewrite it, the text becomes more and more formal. I think that is not right.
No harm done as [[ambiguous search]] is performed when completing tags.
I wish the page-to-page links that appear at the bottom of the page were also ambiguously searched, but I don't know if they are.

- [[open expression]], [[fixed expression]]
