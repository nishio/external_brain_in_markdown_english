title: "Useful Knowledge"
---

"What have you learned that was beneficial to you?" This question may be a sterile one, since it is necessarily highly abstract and the questioner may not be able to accept it even if he or she answers it. In my opinion, the useful things were around "[[Relativization of correctness]]", "the concept of prior [[after the fact]]", "the concept of [[Unexpected X]]" ([[Unexpected Success]]), and "the [[meaning]] of a word relative to its [[meaning]]".

Thinking back a bit, [[Dimensional Extension]], [[Body Enlargement]] and [[random variable]] were also useful knowledge. When I was writing about body enlargement, I thought that "[[relativization]]" would be useful, since this is also "[[relativization]] of the concept of number". And this use of the word "[[relativization]]" is itself a [[personal metaphor]] (relativization of the meaning of the word).
