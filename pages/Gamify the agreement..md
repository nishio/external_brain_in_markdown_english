Gamify the agreement.

As a result of the Taiwanese government's introduction of Polis into policy dialogue, a hidden point of agreement was discovered in the Uber regulatory issue that had generated intense conflict: "Both users and drivers value safety," and adjustments were made based on this. In this way, AI can analyze a large number of opinions and extract "[[latent consensus]]," thereby revealing common ground that was previously invisible. In a sense, Polis is designed to "[[gamify consensus]]," to focus people's attention on points of agreement rather than only on points of conflict. This case shows that technology can work not only to create illusory consensus, but also to uncover real (but buried) consensus.
