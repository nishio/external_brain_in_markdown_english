On the case of attacking something unfamiliar without looking at it properly
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/7b823a75cb3cda646afb440365c94641/thumb/1000)
- This is A's [[Observation coverage issues]].
    - The range of observation is too small to see much about the subject.

- The view from a person with a wide range of observation

    - Mr. A attacked "something I don't understand".
        - That's "not clear" is subjective to Mr. A.
        - [[Most things in the world involve humans]], so most attacks hit humans.
        - From Mr. B, it appears that he was attacked.
        - Mr. C, who was watching from the sidelines, thinks, "Mr. A is attacking Mr. B. This is not good.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/32f3fedebc27f84c1e1e9ca2999ca6de/thumb/1000)
        - Mr. C builds a wall to protect Mr. B.
        - The metaphor of "[[building]] a wall."
            - Do not create [[opportunities for contact]].
        - For example, let's say that Mr. D, who is unaware of this exchange, thinks that it might be a good idea to invite Mr. A to a certain community.
            - Let's say Mr. B belongs to this community, and Mr. C advises him, "No, Mr. A shouldn't do this because this is what happened.
            - Then Mr. D would say, "Oh, well, I'll stop then!" and "Oh, well, I'm not going to do that!
            - Weak reasons like "it would be interesting to see" are easily dismissed when there are specific problems like this.
            - Mr. D doesn't want to stand on Mr. A's side of this tangle, either.
        - In this diagram, Mr. B is drawn as if he were a single person for ease of depiction.
            - In reality, Mr. A's attacks often involve a large number of people, like [[shotgun]].
            - Mr. C.: "Hey, hey, you just attacked about 20 million people, do you understand?"
            - Many [[doors of possibility]] are locked at once.
                - [[The world closes in on the naysayers.]]



relevance
    - [[shotgun]]
        - [[Vague words are shotguns.]]
        - [[They retaliate with a shotgun attack.]]

This consideration is still insufficient

People who bite those around them at random.
    - [[mad dog]]
- I'm not going anywhere near you.
- [["Don't let him get close to danger.]]


Why does behavior like Mr. A's happen?
    - [[Conflict only occurs between those on the same level.]]
- In a community of like-minded individuals, as soon as you attack, there's blowback.
- Mistaking the lack of counterattacks coming for strength.

Smallness of the world
- Because eliminating people is expensive.
[[less than a second per person]].
There are a lot of humans out there.
Exclude aggressive people.
[[Attacks reduce productivity]].
    - [[Ranting lowers productivity.]]
