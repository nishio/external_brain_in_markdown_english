> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1758053996441542668/quick_promote_web/intro) I'm reading more of "[[Bazaar and Clubs]]". Finally got to the bazaar and clubs. The transition from [[geertz]]'s idea to [[roti]]'s idea is interesting. I mean, from the point of view of someone who belongs to a club, it's obvious that the club exists and that he/she benefits from it, but observability varies from person to person.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1758054568444018738) Some people can look at a club analogy and think of three different clubs with different properties, such as this, that, and that. Huh?" There are those who think, "There is no such thing in this day and age. Even if they belong to the same community, whether they see it as a club or a bazaar is different. It's like [[psychological safety]]. [[shared belief]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1758055099522551922) If, in the end, whether a place is a club or a bazaar is attributed to an individual's subjective feeling, then the metaphor of describing it as an attribute of the "place" is mis It may be leading.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1758890849621135552/quick_promote_web/intro) My head says I should go to bed, but I'm hotter than I thought I'd be when I wrote the sentences I thought I should write. I can't sleep because of writing, so I'm going to read "The Bazaar and the Club". Previously: the first time I tried to read only the parts that appeared in the translated paper and couldn't understand it, the second time I read from the commentary and was able to read the paper. Next time: pick up the key words.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1758892640568041703) [[use of diversity]], gears, [[ethnocentrism]], [["I'd rather die than fall into ethnocentrism" thinking is ethnocentrism ]], [[bourgeois liberals]], [[inert liberals]], [[consequences of anti-ethnocentrism]], [[collapse of self-esteem]], [[hopeless tolerance of UNESCO cosmopolitanism]], [[anti - anti-ethnocentrism]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1758893744408170500) [[Community]] , the almost windowless semantic monadic existence (monad), bourgeois liberal culture, the culture of increasing windows, and anti-anti-ethnocentrism are not blocking windows, "there is no philosophical basis for increasing windows". Drunkenness - artificial kidney problem, people on dialysis but not abstaining from alcohol, [[procedural justice]].
- [[almost windowless monad]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1758895215900057776) [[procedural justice]] is a term derived from [[Rawls.]] "[[justification]]" in Vitalik's organization of legitimacy. I think it's acquisition by process. [[procedural justice-centered society]], which takes place in the dark and has nothing to do with love? Check the original text, avoid the dilemma by not looking at it in detail, preferable to society, justice and love, justice alone is enough.
- [[The Most Important Scarce Resource is Legitimacy]]
    - [[legitimacy by process]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1758896220649751031) diversity experts create accessibility to procedural justice, love and justice are different bearers, [[Engels]], [[dialectic of nature]], [[labor in England state of class]], expansion of the "we", marginalized people entering the "we", [[Engels]], [[Dialectic of Nature]], [Labour in Britain

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1758896284453540315) I read up to one block and got really sleepy, so I'm going to bed.


> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1759216878600569159/quick_promote_web/intro) Read 2~ of Bazaar and Club on the train home. Bourgeois liberals] who have not yet moved to [[postmodern]] = still [[illuminism]] era, [[human nature]], [[various rights]], [[basic structure]], [[superstructure]], [[cultural]], also [[particular cultural bias]], [[paradox of self-reference]], [[assumption of a boundary between "rational" and "cultural" ]], [[equality is a Western quirk]], [[equality is a Western quirk]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1759218334636376106) Rationality is never the standard across cultures, [[Dewey.]], [[Limits of liberal tolerance]], [[PBL]], [[Coincidence of what has been considered inevitable ]], [[Quine]], [[Wittgenstein]], [[derrida]]. [[words that distinguish between one's center and one's periphery]]. [[identity]], [[Where it came from.]], [[accidental temporal-spatial affiliation]]. This place is "[[velvety]]" kind of place.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1759220103139426368) Enlightenment rhetoric, [[rationalist theory of rationality]], [[Bernard Williams]], [[procedural justice]], [[human equality]], [local culture only, bazaar, procedural justice, [[clubs may be different]], [[you don't have to be a member of the other club]], [[pragmatic liberal institutions]], [[just list the advantages]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1759222178070065575) [[diversity is simply to be ignored]], [[bazaar surrounded by clubs]], [[community]], [[gemeinschaft]], a bit more I got to the station to finish reading in. [[one can belong to a civil society driven by procedural justice without belonging to a community with shared values]]. If we agree that those procedures are useful...

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1759222666790379893) I don't think this logic guarantees a single bazaar. Could there be a division that could occur such that there is a procedural justice that cannot agree to be mutually useful? Or is "[[procedural justice]]" a logic where that does not occur? I'll have to check Rolls on this one.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1759224561449775429) I tried to explain "[[liberal cramp]]" in my own words, but I couldn't, so you don't understand me. When you combine the Enlightenment idea that all men have reason with the idea that the idea that all men are equal or have human rights is founded on reason, you get a contradiction.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1759225467704574186) That is, when there is a "person who does not believe that all people are equal", then "that person is an inferior person who cannot reason" and contradicts "all people are equal"? Because it contradicts "all people are equal"?

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1759228593832616436) I'm back home. Shall we put the resolution of the question on hold and finish the rest? [[the club shares the conception of the good]]. In other words, people can come to the bazaar who don't share it. From my point of view, they are evil, but [[procedural justice, which has nothing to do with good or evil, prevails]]. [[the exclusivity of the club]], [[world order]], [[inert liberals]], [[unpleasant feelings (e.g. hatred, disgust, revulsion, fear)]], [[moral narcissism]], [[betrayal of the Enlightenment]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1759229845538828456) [[exclusivity is a necessary condition of private self-consciousness]], [[maintaining the bazaar]], procedural justice, [[even self-cultural centrism can cooperate]], [[Rolls-style commitment to procedural justice commitment is a requirement of citizenship]], [[commitment can be expedient, not moral]], [[public pragmatism]].
