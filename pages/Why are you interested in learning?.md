I was asked but could not answer immediately, so I researched historical facts.

- 2010-08 Presentation on "[Language Design Decisions](https://www.slideshare.net/nishio/ss-5019563)" at Security & Programming Camp
- I was publishing the material and was asked to write a feature article for a magazine.
    - 2010-12 Gijutsu Hyoronsha WEB+DB PRESS Vol.60 Special issue 1: "[Fundamentals of Language Design](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20101207/1291734422)"
- The book was so well received that we decided to write a book.
- 「 [[Technology Supporting Coding]] 」
    - I wrote, "It's important to learn languages by comparing them."
    - I started thinking about "why it's important" and wrote a chapter about it, but it was cut by an editorial decision.
            - [[Knowledge, Capitalism and the Technologist Condition]]
    - Break it down into columns and pack them in the end-of-chapter margins.
    - At the time of publication, it was reprocessed and put together in the form of promotional slides.
        - 2013-04-09 [What do we learn and how do we learn it?](https://www.slideshare.net/nishio/ss-18540949) [[What do we learn and how do we learn it?"]]
        - [What do we learn? 2: Three major input methods](https://www.slideshare.net/nishio/ss-19956967)

- When I get feedback that the column was helpful, I'm convinced that I should dig into this after all.

        - After studying Drucker's "Seven Opportunities for Innovation," I learned that it is important not to miss out on [[Unexpected Success]].
        - Recognize the phenomenon as an "unexpected success" and run [reproduction on an enlarged or expanded scale

    - What was the trigger, I wonder?
    - After picking it up and reading it, I realized that the guidelines I was looking for "before the [[PDCA cycle]] starts to turn" were right here.
    - Explanation of the matter
        - [W-type problem-solving model of the KJ method and U-theory, each with its own problem consciousness](https://www.slideshare.net/nishio/jeita)

- 2015-02 Encounter with [[clean language]] [About Clean Language - NISHIO Hirokazu's Hatena Diary](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20150220/1424415386)
- Encounter with [TAE
- These are the methods that help us to verbalize."
- "The current [[groupware]] is something that is linguified and then shared electronically, and it's weak on how to verbalize what isn't verbalized."
- Technology to Support Linguistics] needs to be studied."

- 2015-07 Linguistic Support Methods
    - Changed the theme of the call for Labo Youth to "Linguistic Technology".
    - I was about to do a [public lecture](https://github.com/nishio/cylaby), but it was cancelled due to office relocation and other hiccups.

- Then he went on to write "[[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]].
        - [[Intellectual Production of Engineers Before and After]]

- Background Information
    - 2004 "It's important to learn by comparing languages" should have been considered useful by the time I was teaching programming to juniors during my doctoral program, because I was teaching Java and Python by comparing them.
    - 2007 [PythonDevelopersCamp2007 Winter: You don't need classes!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=legkcj5vQN8&feature=youtu.be), "I thought you really thought of a way to share an easy-to-understand way of understanding how it works."

    - 2008 The first technical book I wrote [Jython Programming](http://blog.livedoor.jp/dankogai/archives/51040648.html) is unexpectedly rated as "a very well written programming beginner book".  [[Unexpected Success]].
