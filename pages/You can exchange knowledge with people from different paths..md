- Mr. A and Mr. B, who have taken different paths, can exchange the different knowledge they have gained from each other and gain from each other.
- Mr. C, who is staying, does not have new knowledge that can be used for exchange material, so there is no equal exchange.
    - What patterns do you see?
        - Make money a consideration
        - Offer [[attention]] to "[[the person who wants attention]]" for consideration.
            - Often the information is distorted by the incentive to "[[say radical things]] to get more attention."
        - Wait for it to come from the type of person who will release information for free for the public good.

- [[Knowledge Exchange Requirements]]
