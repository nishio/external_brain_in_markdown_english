In KJ methods, we shouldn't focus on [[abstract concept]]s

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> I want to explain about [[how to find the relationship between pieces]].

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Oral Keichobot/icon' alt='Oral Keichobot.icon' height="19.5"/> Sure, I'd like to hear more about how you find relationships between the pieces. What's your process for identifying these connections? How do you determine which pieces are related?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> I saw a research about the difference between Asian and European. In the research, there is a question, which are closer in monkey, tiger, and bananas?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Oral Keichobot/icon' alt='Oral Keichobot.icon' height="19.5"/> That's an interesting question from the research. Looking at monkey, tiger, and bananas, one might think differently based on their perspective. I'm curious, how would you answer this question? Which do you think are closer, and why?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> In the research, Asian people tend to choose bananas and monkeys are closer, but on the other hand, European people tend to choose monkeys and tigers because they are both animals.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Oral Keichobot/icon' alt='Oral Keichobot.icon' height="19.5"/> That's a fascinating observation from the research. It highlights how cultural perspectives can influence how we categorize or relate things. The Asian perspective focusing on the relationship between monkeys and bananas, and the European perspective grouping monkeys and tigers as animals. How does this understanding of different perspectives influence your approach to finding relationships between ideas?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> European people are using abstract concepts to organizing items. In the other hand, the Asian people used a more concrete relationship between two things to organize.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Oral Keichobot/icon' alt='Oral Keichobot.icon' height="19.5"/> That's an insightful distinction. Europeans might use abstract concepts for organization, while Asians might focus on concrete relationships. How does this difference in approach affect the way you think about organizing and connecting ideas? Do you lean more towards one approach in your methods?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Yes, in KJ methods, we shouldn't focus on abstract concepts. Opposite, we should focus more on concrete relationships.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Oral Keichobot/icon' alt='Oral Keichobot.icon' height="19.5"/> Got it. In the KJ method, the emphasis is on concrete and specific relationships rather than abstract concepts.
