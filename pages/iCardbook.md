    - Interesting as [[A New Form of Publishing]]. #Publishing
- Might work well with [[Scrapbox]]?
- It would be possible to put a QR code on each card, so that if you take a picture of it with your smartphone camera, it will jump to Scrapbox.

- I was wondering, do you sell a paper version?

- Is it [[disruptive innovation]] for books?
    - (in the original sense of "innovation by something with poor performance")
