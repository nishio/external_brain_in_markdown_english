title: "Parable of the New Combination and the Surface of the Water"

- Schumpeter, who coined the term [[innovation]], also called innovation a new combination.
However, many people do not have a physical image of what kind of [[new combination]] is not useful, so I compare it to [[water's surface]]. #physical analogy

- The basic premise [[Schumpeter.]] believed that "if new combinations do not occur, the economy will move toward [[balance]]."
    - This corresponds to a flattening of the water surface.
- He also believed that "[[w]]hen the economy is in equilibrium, profit disappears and recession sets in."
    - This corresponds to the loss of flow when the water surface is flattened.
- The new union is a hole in the wall, connecting two previously unconnected areas.
    - With the new union, the water that was in equilibrium begins to flow again.
    - Then a new equilibrium is reached

- Effective new bonds are under pressure at both ends.
    - So when they join, water begins to flow through it.
    - The water flow itself can widen the hole and further increase the flow.
- On the other hand, water will not flow if you do new combinations that are not effective.
    - No flowing water, no difference in pressure, trying to flow against gravity, these new bonds are not valid.
