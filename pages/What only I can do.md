title: "What only I can do"

> "Do what only you can do," and whether or not "only you can do it" is difficult to verify, so of course "[[subjective]] to" OR "within your observation range" is a prerequisite, but I think the type of person who is not confident in themselves may think "I can't verify it, so I'm no good" or something like that, and I'm worried about that.

- The [[Observation range]] has expanded, making it more difficult for "only I can do it".
In the days of narrow observation, the best drawer in the class could go on with the self-perception that he or she was good at drawing.

Maybe something like "if you're the best at it within a 5 meter perimeter" would be better.
