title: "Controlling speed"
---

When speed is too slow, "Just go faster! But at a certain point, "the downside of going too fast" begins to emerge.

It is necessary to control the speed.

Before a sharp curve, the speed must be slowed down.

When there is fog
- Must we slow down when there is a lot of uncertainty ahead?
- I see multiple specific concepts to which the metaphor of "slowing down" corresponds.
- In the car metaphor, if you are going too fast, do you need to slow down because you can't change course in time to notice an obstacle ahead (like a deer) and then crash?
- Speed" also corresponds to "[[change of policy]] speed
        - [[Consistency is not expected.]]
        - [[a wise man changes his mind]]
    - As for this kind of "speed," it needs to be faster when uncertainty is high.

Busyness, agitation, are a type of mental state abnormality
- Controlling it is a skill required of each individual.
- Just as there is "anger management" to control the abnormal state of "anger."
