title: "Effects of changing the environment"
---

A situation where you have multiple tasks and can't decide which one to do.
I can't decide on this one because there's not much difference in what you get by doing the task.
If we change the environment and the cost of one task increases due to, for example, difficult Internet access, then we have no choice but to do the other one.
If you don't want to do a task too much, maybe you should find a low-cost place to do that task.

I thought this as I left my AC adapter at work and my PC lost power.
