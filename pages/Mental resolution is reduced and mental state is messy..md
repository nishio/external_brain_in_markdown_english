title: "Mental resolution is reduced and mental state is messy."

> Kasuga: Yes. I think the resolution (e.g., display, dpi) of the mind is very low, or the pixels are coarse, so the [[mental state is messy]]. When you become [[miscellany (classification of Japanese poetry)]], you become [[negligent]], stuffy, self-loathing, invincible, and anxious.
> So, the question is how to raise the resolution of the mind, and in that case, I dare to do my immediate work, housework, and organizing, etc., carefully, slowly, and wholeheartedly. This will bring back a small sense of accomplishment or satisfaction, or a forgotten feeling, and bring back a detailed and fulfilling daily life, which will turn on the [[motivator]]. In a sense, it is a matter of course to do what is in front of you with care.
> I think that "I don't feel like doing it right now," is usually a sign of a messy situation, so I would say, "Be polite and start with what is close at hand," including cleaning up the room.
