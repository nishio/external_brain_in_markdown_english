- I don't feel it works that well.
- The value gained "I see! is usually out of the chat phase.
    - It's summarized in a state of text after the chat.
    - There's no new value added by chopping them up and arranging them on a sticky note.
- In this experiment, I'm making it a sticky after the chat is over.
    - If they were simultaneous, there could be a synergistic effect.
    - Was there no room for new developments since the "awareness of blind spots" caused by arranging stickies was already done by the chat?
    - If the chat logs were in a state of "I think I see something interesting here, but I don't know what it is", I could have discovered it by chopping it up and arranging it
        - This time, it had already been unearthed.
- Technical
    - Many of the stickies are still a little too long at this point.
    - Am I glad I didn't do the merging of contiguous chunks?
        - →I stopped merging chunks and it was indeed too fine.
            - I wonder if there is a character limit of 20 or something...
- If you use it from your phone, the current chat UI is better than the Regroup which requires a bigger screen.
    - If used from a PC, it would be better to add a "look at the current map and have the bot ask questions" feature to Regroup
    - Longer typed or spoken responses to questions should be inscribed and added as stickies
