title: "Smooth Society and Its Enemies + Tadahiro Taniguchi"
---

- [[Ken Suzuki]] +[[Tadahiro Taniguchi]]
- You're thinking about something that's very relevant, but they've never met each other before.
- It's hot that these two thoughts begin to affect each other.

>  Late.

>  I had a chance to meet him in connection with this year's JSAI Artificial Life-related session, and I said to myself, "Gosh, I should have read it first! I read it.
>
>  > > I just wanted to say again, "If I had read the book, we could have had such and such a > discussion.
>
>  This ambitious book, written in 2013, proposes a new economic and political system against the backdrop of the development of Internet technology. I am convinced that it has many supporters simply because of its excellence as a storyteller. A book of this scale is hard to find from a Japanese writer.
>  It's my fault for reading it so late, but it was already written more than 10 years ago, so it also feels dated. SNS]" plays a major role in telling the story of this decade, and I wondered how this book would or would not change if it were written today in light of its impact and exposed form.
>  From Taniguchi's point of view, what he published at the same time was "[[Symbolic Emergence Robotics: An Introduction to the Mechanisms of Intelligence]]". You and Mr. Suzuki are roughly the same generation. I feel sympathy for that era.
>
> I also share some aspects of personal academic foundational discussions such as [[autopoiesis]] and [[high efficiency]] discussions.
>  Next time we meet, I would like to have a discussion with you, exploring the junction points with symbolic emergent systems theory and mechanism design of communication places. (I am sure we will have another opportunity! I felt such a connection with you!)

> [kensuzuki](https://x.com/kensuzuki/status/1804025215778746483) Thanks for your time in Hamamatsu. The paperback edition has a supplemental essay looking back on the past 10 years starting on p. 383, so we will definitely talk about that and other topics again!

> [tanichu](https://x.com/tanichu/status/1804025554829553851) I also looked over the addendum!　Let's talk about it!
