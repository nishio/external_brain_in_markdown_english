from  [[The Nostradamus Phenomenon in Japan]]
singularity doomsday theory
I think that the type of [[eschatology]] that "by [[singularity]] [[extinction event]]" will definitely spread.
- [[existential risk]], too, causes a composition of people who are thinking straight, people who make a lot of noise without thinking, and people who are annoyed by those who make a lot of noise.


People will say radical things.
- People who understand technology go through the motions and say, "You're talking nonsense.
- But the masses who don't understand the technology believe in it, and it's a big force to be reckoned with.

Misuse of Quantum Mechanics and the New Age Movement
- In the second half of the 20th century, there are examples of esoteric concepts of quantum mechanics being used in the context of spirituality and self-help without any scientific basis, and spread as an appealing theory among the masses. Although experts pointed out its misuse, the general public was attracted to its "mystique" and it became a major movement.

Nuclear War Fear and the Cold War Era Information
- During the Cold War, there were occasions when the existence of nuclear weapons and the possibility of war were spread to the masses as extreme claims and scaremongering. Although calm assessments were made in technical and scientific discussions, there were instances in which many anxious people were influenced by exaggerated information, creating great social unrest and political trends.

These are examples of a phenomenon in which information is received differently by those with expertise and those without, resulting in radical theories becoming a force for the masses.

- A similar phenomenon was observed in the case of [[Hitler]]. While the intelligentsia pointed out the irrationality and danger of his arguments, the masses, suffering from the economic insecurity and social discontent of the time, resonated with his simplistic and radical message, resulting in the expansion of Hitler's support base.
