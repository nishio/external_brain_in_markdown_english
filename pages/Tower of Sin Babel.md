Machine translation services will stop after machine translation becomes widespread and the know-how to learn foreign languages is lost #SF setting

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1628186124756873217?s=20): past "God bent the whirlwind and there's bad weather, so no fishing today."
> Future "No work today because Master AI has bent the whirlwind and is out of service."

> [@tomoyaman](https://twitter.com/tomoyaman/status/1628189953221087232?s=20): @nishio I guess we will continue to need fortune tellers and prayer warriors as always.

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1628190327344623617?s=20): @tomoyaman Maybe the giant language model is the oracle-giving temple and the chat interface is the priestess
> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1628191011301359617?s=20): @tomoyaman Ah, so there are clergy who are in the good graces of Master AI? That's the question, isn't it? Of course a clergyman would be the highest level of [[caste]]().

> [@tomoyaman](https://twitter.com/tomoyaman/status/1628192309291663360?s=20): @nishio [[Brahman (priest of Hinduism, member of the highest caste)]].
> Then, I suppose, some unreachable person will emerge from among humans and try to analyze God. Even though the suppression of the act continues, God will still continue to be analyzed, and when people begin to understand God in a cursory manner, it will be called science, and those who run science = scientists will arise, and scientists will use science to create AI....

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1628196461090582529?s=20): @tomoyaman I'm going to be able to babe a machine translation service to prevent analysis
> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1628197751334006786?s=20): @tomoyaman If we destroy machine translation at the same time that high-performance [[machine translation]] becomes widespread and no one wants to read foreign languages on their own, and the teaching of foreign languages is lost, it will be roughly the same as the collapse of [[Tower of Babel]]. If machine translation is destroyed at the same time that foreign language teaching methods are lost, it will be roughly the same as the collapse of the [[Tower of Babel]].
