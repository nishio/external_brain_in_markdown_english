title: "waste of time"
---

I had not been able to come up with a word to describe some of the things that were described as "[[the old]], [[old person]], [[problems caused by the elderly (esp. gerontocracy, and elderly people's control over the young)]], [[aging population]], and [[combined with the elderly]]. combined with the elderly]," some of which are not really age-related, and I hadn't come up with a word to describe them until now.
Talk about how "[[(of one's business) slow]], [[woman of leisure]], [[waste of time]], [[becoming unused or unimportant]]" might be better.

I read that as "sunstroke."
- I don't understand what you mean by "the other side."
- To begin with, the word "Busyman" is not "Kajin" but "Hijin" (a person of leisure).

The log of the beginning ----.

> [xCherrycaRAMELx](https://twitter.com/xCherrycaRAMELx/status/1460526383763845121): I know the Barmuda phone is getting a lot of bad press, but when it was announced, it was so disparaged by gadget enthusiasts on Twitter. I don't know, I've often heard people say that no one would buy a Barmuda phone, but when it goes on sale, people around me usually buy it, so I don't know.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1460598556432109573): DISing a product you won't buy if it improves doesn't make the world a better place...
> When I see people who feel good about doing that, they look like people who feel good about smoking [[opium]] in an opium den (I've never seen that).
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1460600031333924870): oops, DISing homo sapiens who won't buy it if it improves doesn't make the world a better place, shut up and mute it!

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1460620511440879618): I have been thinking about how to avoid [[aging population combined with the elderly]]. I've been thinking about "how to avoid [[aging population combined with the elderly]]", and I thought "[[the old]]" might not be appropriate, but I haven't found anything to replace it. Today I realized that "[[(of one's business) slow]]" could be it.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1460621421722300418): [People who are passionate about building something up are busy. In reality, however, there are many people who are not passionate about such activities, and those people are "harmed".

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1460621733384179713): still a little rough around the edges, but this is the first good bud I've seen in a while!

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1460623512431779841): as the phrase "[[agony of childbirth]]" goes, [[suffering]] accompanies the creation of things, and many people want to avoid suffering. Many people want to avoid it. The result of avoidance is "leisure time. The fact that suffering increases with physical weakness also encourages this tendency, creating a correlation between "old age" and "leisure time.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1460623968021274624): whether the label "bored" is appropriate for this concept is open to consideration. I'm not sure that "someone who is forced to do so many things they don't want to do that they use up all the time and energy in their life and can't do projects that they have [[enthusiasm]] for" is clearly a type of "spare time."
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1460627126931976195): I put "[[manufacturing]]" in opposition to "spare time" because I enjoy making things, but I think that not only that, for example, sports and music are also in opposition to "spare time". I think that sports and music, for example, are also opposites of "spare time".
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1460627896049934336): maybe they are pleasures combined with suffering, and those who avoid suffering will not get the pleasures either, so they will be tainted with easy opiates

> [UFO84](https://twitter.com/UFO84/status/1460722525302714370): I feel that describing this as "[[suffering]]" could be misleading to some people. I think "[[bitterness]]" might be more appropriate for some people, twitter.com/nishio/status/... twitter.com/nishio/status/...

> [nittakeshi](https://twitter.com/nittakeshi/status/1460771536739045377): The "Mere Old Man" sometimes gave useful advice, but the characteristic of the "Mere Old Man" who does harm is that he is jealous of the "Mere Old Man" who cannot be enthusiastic and gives up to protect himself. The order of the "Mere Old Man" is that he is jealous of the "Mere Old Man".

Postscript 2023-10-11
> [kensuu](https://twitter.com/kensuu/status/1709341499916513475) In my work, I've seen many people who have been defamed on the Internet and had disclosure requests filed against them, to put it simply.
>  ・People with a great deal of time
>  I have the impression that it can be summed up in the following way,
>  It is easy to think that "people with bad character are slandering you" or "people who don't like you are slandering you," but in reality, it may be "people who have time on their hands. If you can just see it as "it's not my fault, I was just chosen as a target to kill time," you may feel a little lighter.

> [ryuka121212](https://twitter.com/ryuka121212/status/1709617099134677128) On the other hand, if you are busy, you are less likely to be that kind of person!
