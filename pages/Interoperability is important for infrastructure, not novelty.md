title: "Interoperability is important for infrastructure, not novelty"
---

- [[Plurality Books]]
> The interests and boundaries as a discipline that largely constrain academic research are completely unimportant to a widely available civic infrastructure. Academic careers depend on references, credits, and novelty, but this is by no means the best orientation for infrastructure. Infrastructure is often invisible and should interoperate as easily as possible with other infrastructure. Academic research tends to emphasize a level of rigor and persuasiveness and a style that is inherently different from the ideal infrastructure user experience as a discipline.
What is important for infrastructure is [[interoperability]], not [novelty (patentability)
