Project success is influenced by the balance between member motivation and market value. The combination of exploratory net and KJ method is useful for problem solving; the method of speaking from conclusions is effective in certain situations; the similarities between GTD and KJ method are applicable to other productivity methods; and the relationship between tacit knowledge and discomfort is important in certain situations.
- The problem with unexplored junior projects is that there is a lack of rationale for members to stay involved in the project. What methods could be used to solve this?
    - Unexplored Junior targets students in the first place and believes that "academics come first".<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - In other words, "the project is not a top priority."
        - But then again, maybe the idea that "the project comes first" is an old idea that works.
        - Anyone can become ill and "regaining one's health can become a top priority".
        - Family members may become ill, there may be pregnancies and births
        - Can't force "members to stay involved in the project."
        - Maybe it's a good idea to eliminate the reasons why they can't get involved.
        - In the case of Cybozu, female employees who gave birth said they did not want to quit the company, so we set up a system of parental leave and shorter working hours for up to six years.
- In unexplored junior projects, there is little reason for member involvement. The clear division of roles entails the risk of absence of the person in charge. The team leader needs to be willing to fill in on his/her own if a member is missing.
    - In the end, a project is only as good as the "one person who is enthusiastic about moving forward with it.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - One person can do it all.
        - If you have someone to help you, just ask.
- What are some of the situations in which the "speak from the conclusion" method is effective in a particular situation?
    - That's when you need to get the word out in a short amount of time.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- We find it difficult to apply the similarities between GTD and the KJ method to other productivity methods. This is because the relationship between tacit knowledge and discomfort is important in certain situations. What methods would be effective in solving this problem?
    - Tough question, this question needs to be broken down more.

It is important to emphasize perspectives from AI and other life forms as well as humans, and since AI can provide a broad perspective, exploring diverse perspectives is an important means of broadening horizons. The idea of profiting from uncertainty is a new approach. There is long-term value in a system with a set of limited downside risks and unlimited upside risks; it is important to use information organization techniques such as the KJ method to convert information from a broad perspective into a form that is processable by humans. It is important to collaborate to share tacit knowledge between humans and AI.
- What methods would be effective to achieve this in concrete terms?
- Non-verbal communication of information is important.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - For example, AI picks up on things written by humans that are of interest to them.
        - This means that humans do not have a verbal output, but they communicate their interest by choice
    - Arrange the pickups in a way that is comfortable for humans.
        - This also expresses by placement what it finds relevant.

It is important to collaborate to share tacit knowledge between humans and AI.

## Next research note
The success of a project is heavily influenced by the balance between member motivation and market value. This is especially true for unexplored junior projects, where members have little incentive to stay involved in the project. To solve this problem, it is important for the team leader to be willing to fill in on his or her own when members are missing.

The combination of exploratory nets and the KJ method is also useful for modern problem solving, and the "speak from the conclusion" method is particularly effective in certain situations. However, it is difficult to apply the similarities between GTD and the KJ method to other productivity methods, and the relationship between tacit knowledge and discomfort can be important in certain situations.

In addition, it is important to emphasize perspectives from AI and other life forms as well as humans, as AI can provide a broader perspective, and the exploration of diverse perspectives is an important means of broadening one's horizons. The idea of profiting from uncertainty is a new approach, and there is long-term value in a system that offers a set of limited downside risk and unlimited upside risk.

It is important to use information organization techniques such as the KJ method to convert information from a broad perspective into a form that can be processed by humans. It is also important to collaborate to share tacit knowledge between humans and AI. These key points may serve as important guidelines for developing new directions and strategies to improve knowledge productivity.

## Comments and Questions
We believe that a balance between member motivation and market value is critical to the success of a project. However, the problem with unexplored junior projects is that there is little incentive for members to stay involved in the project. What methods would be effective in resolving this?

We also believe that the combination of exploratory nets and the KJ method is useful for problem solving today. But what are some of the situations in which the "speak from the conclusion" method is effective in a particular situation?

Furthermore, we find it difficult to apply the similarities between GTD and the KJ method to other productivity methods. This is because the relationship between tacit knowledge and discomfort is important in certain situations. What methods would be effective in solving this problem?

Finally, we believe it is important to emphasize perspectives from AI and other life forms as well as humans, as AI can provide a broader perspective, and the exploration of diverse perspectives is an important means of broadening horizons. However, the idea of profiting from uncertainty is a new approach, and there is long-term value in a system with a set of limited downside risks and unlimited upside risks. These key points may serve as important guidelines for developing new directions and strategies to improve knowledge productivity. But what methods can be used to realize these key points in a concrete way?
