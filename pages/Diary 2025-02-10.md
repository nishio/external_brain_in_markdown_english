A brief overview of what I did today
- How to experiment with clustering in Devin
    - [[broadlistening-research]]
    - Several instances of Devin are making drastic changes to the documentation, kind of like a lab wiki.
- Deep Research mechanism for data not available on the Internet
    - [[local-deep-research]]
    - I'm working on a local book data search right now, but I like the idea of connecting it to Slack's search.
    - Slack and GitHub are a well-designed combination - both have good automation methods.
- Try Computer-use, find out how to use it from a script
        - [[Computer Use in Claude]]

- [[I don't know what I did today.]]

- [[Painful problem when Devin tasks are parallel.]]
- [[AI Agents and De-turned Communication]]
