title: "Situated in Suchman"
---

The author says that the "plan" model of human-machine interaction assumed by artificial intelligence research is doomed to failure at some point, because it does not take into account that human social actions are "embedded in [[situations]]. This is why this book is called "The Artificial Intelligence Study. This book clarifies this through a detailed "[[Conversation Analysis]]" of the process in which a "smart" copy machine incorporating artificial intelligence functions fails in "[[communication]]" with its novice users, leading to failure. The book provides a thorough analysis of human-machine communication in a high-tech society, based on [[ethnomethodological]] research on everyday conversation, revealing its possibilities and limitations."
