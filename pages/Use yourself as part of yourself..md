### Summary of notes
.
It explores the idea of using the same or similar things as part of itself. This is part of nesting and TRIZ and is expressed in software as recursive calls. Also related is the prohibition of caching revisits, dynamic programming, and DAG.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The fragment "What I thought when I drew TRIZ again" is related to the note. The note discusses the concept of nesting as part of TRIZ, and the fragment mentions TRIZ abstraction. They share a common theme of exploring the idea of using the same or similar things as part of itself.

### deep thinking
Concepts such as nesting and recursive calls play an important role in problem solving and creative thinking. They allow for an approach in which a complex problem is broken down into smaller parts, each of which is solved individually to find a solution to the whole. This way of thinking is useful in many fields, not just software development.
