> The Sad Tropics (French: Tristes tropiques) is a book by anthropologist Claude [[Lévi-Strauss]], published in France in 1955, a travelogue documenting a trip to a minority group in [[Brazil]] in the 1930s, The ideas in the book, especially its excellent analysis of underdeveloped societies and its criticism of Eurocentrism, later earned the book sensational acclaim and made it one of the bibles of cultural anthropology and structuralism.
