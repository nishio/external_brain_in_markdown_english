title: "Recommended question method"
---

- [[unexplored junior]] How to ask the questions I recommend for the projects I mentor at [[unexplored junior]].
We want to lower the psychological hurdle to asking questions by clarifying the process.
---

The recommended [[question]] method is
- First, do 15 minutes of research on your own.
- If the problem is not resolved after 15 minutes, write to [[Mattermost]] about what kind of problem you are having.
- I don't always respond right away, so don't wait for me to respond, continue your research or do something else.
It is.
By writing in chat instead of email, someone other than me might be able to answer.
