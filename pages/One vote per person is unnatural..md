Rather, the current [[one vote per person]] without weighting is non-intuitive and "unnatural. And the artifact of institutions is not good because it is natural or bad because it is unnatural.

In many cases, the practical wisdom is to stop messing around with the weights because it would start a hell of a discussion (and reality). It's very easy to start a discriminatory discussion.

Everyone has 100 credits equally, and they cast x credits (and get √x votes) on the theme that they are interested in. I guess the key to the design is how to maintain the "[[Equality for all]]" setting while allowing people to exert a strong influence on themes that are closely related to them.

[[Degressive Proportionality]], which means that even if a country's population doubles, the number of members that can be sent to the EU Parliament does not increase until it doubles. It is a mechanism to reduce the relative influence of large countries like France and Germany. Of course, they do that on purpose.
