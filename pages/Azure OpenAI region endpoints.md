- What is called a "region endpoint" in Azure OpenAI
    - There is confusion in the community, but openai has been addressed
    - I have not found any official announcement from MS about this change.
- On Azure's part, it provides a way to create a traditional endpoint.
- There is a problem that it doesn't work with region endpoints when using Entra authentication (but I don't use it, so it doesn't matter).
