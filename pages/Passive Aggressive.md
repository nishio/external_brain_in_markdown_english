<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/> "Passive-aggressive" refers to behaviors and attitudes that express resistance or hostility in indirect or passive ways in order to avoid direct confrontation or conflict. Such behavior is seen by people who are angry or frustrated but unable or unwilling to express it directly. Passive-aggressive behavior often causes communication and interpersonal problems and can be difficult to understand.

Examples of passive aggressive behavior include

- Delay: Express frustration by deliberately delaying things.
- Forgetting: Resistance is shown by "forgetting" a promise or obligation.
- Uncooperative attitude: intentionally not giving help or not making sufficient effort when asked for cooperation.
- Indirect criticism: Criticizing others through sarcasm or jokes.
- Passive resistance: an attitude of unambiguous opposition to a direct command or request but unwillingness to carry it out.

Such behavior can create misunderstandings and tension in relationships and often diminishes the quality of those relationships. To improve passive-aggressive behavior, it is important to improve communication skills and learn how to express one's feelings and needs more directly and constructively.
