from  [[The World and Japan 100 years from now How will the Internet change the world?]]

- Mr. Miyamoto stated that the lack of information is a drawback when choosing a politician.
- Azuma notes that it is difficult for the masses to elect [[good politicians]], and as a reason, the democratic system itself was not designed on the premise that the masses would elect them. Historically, [[parliamentary democracy]] began as "a mechanism for club members to decide for themselves [[the ruling class]]" and was created as an alternative to [[monarchy]]. Later, [[the right to vote]] was extended to all citizens under the influence of [[social contract theory (e.g., Rousseau's)]], but it was originally a system led by a few elites and was never intended for the situation we have today, where all the masses elect politicians.
- Azuma also emphasizes that democracy is not a "system designed to achieve an optimal solution," but a "[[legacy]] system" that has been improved in a patchwork manner in response to changing times. Therefore, he said, it is difficult for elected officials to be properly elected under the original democratic framework in today's mass society, where people are inundated with information via the Internet and other means.
