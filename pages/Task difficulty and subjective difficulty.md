Everyone mistakenly believes that their subjective difficulty is the difficulty of the task, but it is subjective, so there are discrepancies from person to person.
When one person X looks like another person Y is C (when they seem to be struggling with a simple task).
From Y, X looks like B.
(They appear to have no clue about difficult tasks).

- [[(a metaphor for) pushing through a wasteland]]
- Person X, who limits the search range narrowly, reaches the answer faster than person Y, who does not limit the search range, if the answer is within the limit.
- On the other hand, if there is no answer within the limit, Y can be reached, but X cannot.
