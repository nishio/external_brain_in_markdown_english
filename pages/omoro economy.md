title: "omoro economy"
---

> [0xikkun](https://x.com/0xikkun/status/1826130734635221276) I've been talking to some senior entrepreneurs who have recently exited, and I'm writing this down because I have a better resolution of the trends in the world.
>
>  Conclusion,
>  The world seems to be starting to shift from a monetary economy to an omoro economy.
>
>  *Assumption is that humans imitate the desires of others, so knowing what rich people want to spend their money on is important for identifying trends in the world.
>
>  Making money and being happy seem to correlate up to a point, but it seems that even if you sell your company and become financially independent, it's not as if you will be ridiculously happy.
>
>  They are looking for new entertainment.
>
>  Particularly with the push of generative AI, the value of human labor is becoming smaller and the essential utility of goods and services is beginning to be reconsidered.
>
>  The paradigm of mass production and mass consumption of the former high-growth period has passed, and people seek something interesting anyway.
>
>  The Great Omoro Era has arrived.
>
>  In these times, I am focusing on the entertainment area.
>
>  Live Streaming
>  TikTok Live is really gaining momentum. People who are known as "throwers" are throwing money around.
>  VTubers have become a social phenomenon, especially when combined with music. Recently, I felt that Vividaba by Suisei Hoshimachi has reached a new realm.
>  GREE's avatar distribution app REALITY is also growing super fast globally.
>
>  Short Drama
>  Short drama platforms in the U.S. and China are now available in Japan.
>  In Japan, GOKKO raised funds and became a hot topic.
>
>  ARG (Alternative Reality Game)
>  [[Murder Mysteries]] and games that are closer to everyday life are coming. In games, we tend to demand higher spec hardware, but what players are looking for is an interesting game, and "horizontal thinking of dead technology" is important.
>
>  I'm also paying attention to manga, anime, idols, IP, LED, AI, and many more, but it's a pain in the ass, so I'll write when I feel like it.

>  I think the Sphere that was built in Las Vegas is very interesting as an experience facility. It seems to offer a more realistic experience compared to the movies, and I feel that in the end people want to get together in a realistic setting.
>
>  I think that stereoscopic illusions, such as the giant cat ads in Shinjuku and curved LED displays, will also create new experiences.
>  In comparison, the XR series requires a heavy device to be attached to the head, so I thought I wouldn't use it on a daily basis without some breakthrough to make it lighter... Mr. AppleVisionPro has an external battery and it's that heavy...
>  Although not LED, the projection technology used in Hatsune Miku's live performances is also very interesting. They are not bound by physicality, so it's not a dream to perform live simultaneously all over the world.
>  If AI agents develop, we will need devices to display them.

>  5️⃣Bottom-up IP
>  In Japan, the power of IP generated from the bottom up is unparalleled. Characters such as Chii-Ka, Obanchu-Sagi, and Koupen-chan rapidly gained recognition from their SNS origins, and have been very successful in wide-ranging development such as animations and MDs.
>  In addition, Hatsune Miku, Touhou Project, and Zundamon are IPs that emerged with the support of the Internet community.
>  What these all have in common is that the ability to create UGC with "voice" seems to have been the catalyst for the wave of video media.
>  In today's society, who you are promoting has become an integral part of who you are as a person, and the market for characters as the voice of personality will continue to expand greatly in the future.
>  It is important to note that the trend is also fast. There is a lot of craftsmanship about top-down IP. Sanrio is still crazy amazing.
>  (As a side note, I have been pushing for Hangyodong for 5 years now and vote for him in the character election every year. Now I'm rooting for Baekle)
