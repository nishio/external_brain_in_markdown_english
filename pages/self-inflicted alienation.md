title: "self-inflicted alienation"

Cause others to [[keep away]] from you by your actions

concrete example
- A: I'd like to have a board game night or something.
- B: Yeah, I've been doing it recently in the Where There community (come if you're interested?)
- A: What kind of things are you doing?
- B: (recently released for Steam and new expansions) Dominion, for example.
- A: Huh? You're doing something old like Dominion?
- B: (Oh, I don't want to invite these people because it will ruin the atmosphere of the place when they come)
