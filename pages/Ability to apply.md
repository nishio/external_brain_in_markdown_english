I got an interesting reply from LLM, but I didn't have time to dig into it much, just to record it for the moment.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nihia/icon' alt='nihia.icon' height="19.5"/>The following is a summary of the description of the "ability to apply" in "The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production."
Ability to apply

Verification and application of knowledge
- Understanding and Application:.
    - To determine if you understand a concept, it is important that you can explain the concept in your own words, give specific examples based on your experience, and use that knowledge to accomplish your own goals. For example, rather than simply memorizing public key cryptography in its entirety, being able to explain why it is like a padlock and turn it into another example and apply it to solving your own problem shows true understanding.

Knowledge Creation and Application
- Generating new knowledge:.
    - It is important not only to memorize existing knowledge from textbooks, but also to have the ability to create new knowledge that fits the situation in the field. This new knowledge is not yet in circulation and therefore has high value when applied. Instead of memorizing programming textbooks, the ability to create new programs according to the situation is required.

Extended reproduction of knowledge
- Strategies for knowledge expansion and reproduction:.
    - The strategy is to use knowledge to gain time and money and then invest those resources in further knowledge acquisition. This strategy involves using knowledge to improve work efficiency and investing the resulting spare time in new learning. By using knowledge to gain a position, the opportunity to acquire more knowledge can be increased.

summary
- The ability to apply is not simply about having knowledge, but about applying that knowledge to situations and creating new value. It is only when knowledge is tested and applied in practice that its value is realized. In addition, knowledge can be expanded and reproduced to enable sustainable growth and development.

    - Application to problem solving and idea generation
        - Ability to apply knowledge to solve real problems:.
            - The ability to not only accumulate knowledge, but also to apply it to solve real problems and generate new ideas is required. This allows knowledge to have value and produce tangible results.
    - Extended reproduction of knowledge
        - Ability to create value through cross-fertilization of disciplines:.
            - The ability to combine knowledge from different disciplines to create new value is important. You must be proficient in more than one field and be able to combine them to create unique ideas.
- summary
- Scrapbox emphasizes the importance of effectively structuring knowledge and applying it to solve problems and generate new ideas as an ability to apply.
