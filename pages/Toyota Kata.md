- Toyota's Kata: The Routines of Thought and Action that Underpin Amazing Performance
- [Amazon](http://amzn.to/2wSe6Jm)
- The originator of the so-called "[[kanban]]".
- Remove [[redundancy]] from preventing failures, and identify areas for improvement by letting them fail more often

- In "kanban work methods," the concept of "visualization of tasks" is easy to grasp, but in "Toyota Kata," the nuance is much different.
    - Kanban ([[pull system]])"
    - The goal of kanban is to eliminate kanban."
    - "It is undesirable to establish buffers or flexibilities for the purpose of achieving a target production number, which does not solve the problem or improve the process."

- A means to be able to discover problems that need to be improved #Problem Discovery
    - cycle time
        - [[one piece of sink]]
    - leveling
        - [[kanban]] ( [[pull system]] )
- To put it crudely, we are cutting down more and more on margins, inventory [[buffer]], freedom of equipment selection, etc.
- Set up a masochistic setting that is so close to the edge that if something goes wrong, the line stops immediately.
- Improvements observed daily in that state.
    - As programmers say, [[fail-first]].
    - Be able to notice strange things right away.

- p.150
    - > If the objective is "to achieve the target production volume," a system that avoids problems may seem preferable, but if the objective is "[[Continue to improve and survive]]," a system with a high [[degree of freedom]] is not acceptable because it makes it difficult to know the cause of problems. A system with a high degree of freedom does not inherently improve the problem.

- I doubt that it can be applied to software development backlogs, since no two backlogs are the same, although cars can be made in any number of the same shape.
- The "kanban work method" commonly practiced today is not a pull system or leveling, but "work visualization.
    - Better to be visible than invisible.
    - It's a common "phenomenon where only the easy part of a difficult concept gets popularized."
            - It's like saying [[pomodoro technique]] is like "work 25 minutes and rest 5 minutes".
