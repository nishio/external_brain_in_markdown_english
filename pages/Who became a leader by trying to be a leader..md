title: "Who became a leader by trying to be a leader."
---

No one becomes a leader by trying to be a leader."
- I think I'm going to be there.
- Especially when you're a student, everyone is about the same age and ability in a less diverse organization, so I think "people who try to be leaders [[and]] act like leaders" are going to be leaders rather easily.
    - Everyone [[lacks confidence]], so [[people who act confident]] look stronger.
- When you become a member of society and the age range of people you interact with expands, you see "people who act confident but lack substance" lose out to "people who look like normal old men," and you realize that [[confidence has nothing to do with substance]].

- [[confidence (in oneself)]]
- [[leader]]
