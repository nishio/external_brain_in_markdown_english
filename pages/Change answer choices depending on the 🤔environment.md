title: "Change answer choices depending on the 🤔environment"
---

Now the button for the UPKW command is displayed based on the keywords in the previous statement, etc., and the keywords used in the previous question are displayed on the NGKW button.

I have long thought that it would be good to be able to create "questions that can only be answered with yes or no".

- I was thinking about creating [[Tutorial for making 🤔 sentences]] and thought it would be nice to be able to show a button that says "next question" during certain states.

To sum up.
- With or without free response
- Choice answer options
- Command-like processing of input
All of these should be server-side and controllable by the environment.

Now.
- Free answer: always yes
- Optional answer: Created on the client side
- Command-like processing of inputs: hard-coded and fixed

- [[✅ Free response on/off]]
- [[Create ✅ answer choices on the server side]]
- [[Allows for additional ✅ command processing]]

Both of these change "depending on the environment" and should be determined by a function that takes the environment as an argument.
