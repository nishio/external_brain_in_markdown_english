title: "affine space"
---

Addition over a set of numbers or vector addition over [[vector space]] is closed, but "add 2 and 3 o'clock" over a set of times is wrong. If you want to say "3 hours after 2:00 is 5:00," there are two different sets of values for "time" and "hour.

An affine space is a pair of a set A (in this case the set of "times") and a [[vector space]] V (in this case the set of "times").
