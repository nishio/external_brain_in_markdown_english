>  A note on how to use awareness when capturing information. At first, you see a clear, definite outline. By being in a daze, you start to see abstractly, like a cloud. If you keep that state, you will see the essential [[image]] like [[mirage]].
>
>  When creating, increasing the resolution of observation does not necessarily mean making the outline of what you see even clearer, but I think there is a filter that loosens the focus a little and generates something like a fog or a cloud.
>
>  Too busy and the mirage will not occur. Too often it is too correct and not deep enough. I'm not sure if this is a technique, a hunch, or an error, but a note that I have that feeling.
