title: "Too bad about quantitative thinking, all or nothing thinking."

I'm too bad at [[quantitative thinking]] [[all-or-none thinking]].
> [philomyu](https://twitter.com/philomyu/status/1694922605839654935) I have been wondering if there are a few people who are not good at quantitative thinking and can only perceive things in terms of either total or extreme resolution, I've been wondering if there are a few people who are so bad at quantitative thinking that they can only perceive things in terms of all or nothing, or in terms of extreme resolution, and that's why discussions often don't go anywhere.

> [philomyu](https://twitter.com/philomyu/status/1694922609190990316) When communicating with "all-or-nothing" people, references to anything other than "all-or-nothing" are treated as "I don't know" and have no information content. I think there are many situations in which people who say things in a vague way are popular with the media, and experts who do not want to say things in a cautious way are forced to say things in a vague way.

> [philomyu](https://twitter.com/philomyu/status/1694925158795079884) In fact, when I talk to such people, I always wonder if the variables related to the state are implemented in the [[boolean]] type in their brains, or if they get an error if they assign a value including a decimal fraction, or if they use three-valued logic to store "I don't know" in addition to all/nothing. I'm also wondering if this is implemented in three-valued logic if it stores "I don't know" in addition to "all/nothing".

[[who can only see things as all or nothing]].
