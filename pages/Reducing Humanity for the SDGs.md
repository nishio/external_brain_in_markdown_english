> Education on the [[SDGs]] is also active in school education, with one parent of a third-grade elementary school student saying, "My child says, '[[I don't need people.]]' 'The earth is dying because of humans, so [[I'd rather die a little]],'" and he is troubled by the fact that his child is not a member of the SDGs.

Good, good, good, [[the education is]] working!
We're moving away from the biological [[instinct]]-derived [[assumption]] that "the population of our species should increase."
I feel like humanity is moving on to the next stage!
