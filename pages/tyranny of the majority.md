<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>[[Alexis de Tocqueville]] was a 19th century French political thinker who elaborated on the concept of the "tyranny of the majority" in his celebrated work, [[Democracy in America]]. This concept contains a warning that the power held by [[the majority]] in a democratic system may threaten the rights and liberties of the minority.... Tyranny of the majority refers to the danger that matters decided by majority rule in a democratic system are not always just or fair, and that the majority may use its power to suppress the opinions and rights of the minority. Tocqueville warned that the majority can undermine the freedom of society as a whole by excluding from society those whose opinions differ from its own and violating their rights.
