- Human Resource Machine

- It's also common to use physics to make things unpredictable (e.g. Angry Birds).
    - Using random numbers to make it unpredictable is not interesting, the edge phenomenon of chaos caused by physical operations makes it interesting.
    - Predictability, making you think that if you increase X more, you can increase the objective variable more, but if you increase it to some extent, it will not increase due to unexpected interactions.
        - It will be a game of improvement through the PDCA cycle of experimentation, observation, and correction.


- Cannot put a 3x3 module and a 4x4 module in a 6x6 box
        - [[Modules and Integral]]
    - Modularization increases the reusability of the modules themselves, but is counterproductive to global optimization
- If you can acquire the skill, through investment, of "ignoring block overlaps down to one square," you can create a product with a 3x3 module and a 4x4 module in a 6x6 box, something your competitors can't do.
    - Easy to implement but may be too versatile > skills.
    - If a 4x4 module has a skill that reduces the number of corners by one, the skill itself becomes obsolete when the 4x4 module [[obsolescence]] occurs.
