title: "Even if X contains Y, there is no need to call Y X."

A "Hey, human!"
B "What a creature."

You're sorting things out and you think, "Hey, doesn't this list Y all go on list X?" Sometimes I think, "Hey, doesn't this list Y all go on list X?
- Talking about whether to move the contents A,B,C of list Y to X at this time.
- For a moment you think that is a good thing, but then you take it to the extreme and it becomes "Mr. Tanaka is an organism, and Yakult bacteria are also organisms", futile!
- A "set that encompasses many things" is also "a low-resolution way of cognition." see [[Cognitive Resolution]].
    - Not too happy with book tags on all books.
    - Related [[Close phase]].
- [[choosing the wrong two options]] for "put A in X or Y."
        - [[Container metaphor and road metaphor]] captured in
    - Physical objects only fit in one box, so you have to think, "Which box should I put it in?"
    - But electronic information can be put in both.
    - The key question is, "Are all the elements of Y elements of X?"
        - If that's really the case, then there's no need for a human to do the work of putting in both X and Y.
        - When you're in Y, you're supposed to be in X.
        - If you want to get to A when you see X, all you need is a path (link) from X to Y
