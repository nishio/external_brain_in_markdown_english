title: "Indifference to others' rule violations"

> [fladdict](https://x.com/fladdict/status/1817374439748813306) I wonder why in Japan there is such a strong aversion to illegal hobbies like parkour and graffiti, but in the rest of the world they are accepted even though they are criticized. I wonder if there is a difference in the sense of value for the law.

>  In Japan, it is said, "If you break the law, you are out as a human being. If you break the law, you are out as a human being.
>  Overseas, it's "break the law -> you won't get state protection from here on out, and I don't know what will happen to you.
>  I sometimes feel a nuance like that, or something like [[indifferent]] [[self-responsibility]] toward other people's [[rule violations]].

[[interchange format B]] in [[obedience and protection]] for "breaking the rules will not get you asylum."
