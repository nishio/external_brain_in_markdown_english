title: 'I just want to be "the new thing maker."'

If you want to be a creator of new things
- Start a new project, but if it seems difficult to complete, start something else new.
    - The goal is not "completion of the project," but "completion of some project that I started.
- Do not participate in projects started by others
    - Because they only care about the results of the "project they started," not the results of other people's projects.

Still a little rough around the edges
