Dialogue with the harmony of your past
- Dialogue with Human Beings
    - [[After all, you can only go one step further]].
            - [[I can only accept knowledge that is one step ahead of what I have now.]]
                - [[Propagation of new concepts]]
        - I think you painted the picture with your conversation with Mr. Tachikawa.
            - Pending because I can't find it right away.

                - What's funny when two people are interacting.
                    - X is not interesting because we know each other.
                        - (Well, some types of people enjoy that kind of conversation. Check [[endogroup]])
                    - Y is interesting for A because it is a step forward in the development of thinking
                    - Z is too far from understanding for A to understand well or be interesting.
- Thinking Alone
    - Dialogue with yourself now
    - Think and verbalize one step outside the boundaries of "what is already verbalized".
    - This "what is already verbalized" is "what I can recall now," so there is a limitation due to the capacity of one person's short-term memory.

    - By interacting with a stockpile of your past thoughts, you can speedily reach the boundaries of what you have thought about.
