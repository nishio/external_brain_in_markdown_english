title: "Commonalities between freemium and ponzi schemes"
---

- Similarities between [[freemium]] and [sponge scheme
- While new [[paying users]] are being created, profits can be used to [[pay dividends]] to [[free users]].
- Free users gain from the dividends, so they recommend to others that "this is a good deal".
- Some of the recommended people will not stay as free users, but will become [[paying]] users, and the cycle will continue.

When the number of paying users stops increasing, free users become an obstacle, so they use aggressive methods to solicit them to become paying users, and gloat when they see free users leave because they don't want to do so.


- [I noticed that there are common characteristics between freemium with positive nuance and ponzi scheme with negative nuance.
