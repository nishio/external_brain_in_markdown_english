Communication Initiation Protocol

To take out as words what is in the human mind that has not yet been put into words.
- Necessary until non-verbal communication channels are thickened.

You can't listen to a hundred people.

Humans discover new knowledge and

Moving on.
Can the appropriate destination be known before the move begins?
I can't.
[[Moving around will broaden your horizons]].
Staying put without moving and making decisions based on narrowly focused observations is detrimental

Don't stick to your "area of expertise",
It is beneficial to use one's footwork to look around various areas.

There was only one body, so there were two choices: stay or move. Attention can be divided.

Choosing "business as usual" is also a betting option.
Extreme betting.
You can't escape the stakes.

I'm starting to feel like I should get DeSci's story involved.
[[DeSci]]
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1660530388488581123) I was asked to write an article about ChatGPT, and I was thinking about what to write. I was thinking about what I should write about ChatGPT, but I thought that even if the language model is smart, there will be no end to the demand for "obtaining unspoken knowledge and putting it into words" and that it would be inefficient if the words are not quickly learned by AI, so the natural conclusion is that research results should be open access quickly, and non-open access contributions should be subject to negative incentives for not getting mentions via AI. I was thinking about this, and I felt it necessary to mention DeSci....

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1660531721853607936) After all, if AI improves productivity, people will have an incentive to use AI even if they have to pay for it, and the greater the improvement in productivity, the more money will be paid for AI. The greater the increase in productivity, the more people are willing to pay for AI, so AI will grant grants to publish research in a highly AI-readable format as a public service to strengthen itself.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1660532349136941056) Who is going to pay for DeSci? If the decision-making mechanism for resource distribution becomes de-centralized, it would be better to make the mechanism itself without human intervention than to have a human as a pipe to connect to bring in the money.

I was asked to write an article about ChatGPT, and I was thinking about what to write, but I realized that even if the language model is smart, the demand for "knowledge that mankind does not yet know = unspoken knowledge and putting it into words" will not disappear, and that it is inefficient if what is put into words is not promptly learned by AI So, as a natural consequence, the results of research should be open access promptly, and non-open access contributions will be negatively incentivized by not getting mentioned via AI... and I was thinking about this, and then I mentioned DeSci... I feel like I need to mention DeSci.
In the end, if AI increases productivity, people will have an incentive to use AI even if they have to pay for it, and the greater the increase in productivity, the more money will be paid for AI. AI will be paid for as the productivity gains become greater.
The question of who is going to pay for DeSci, it is not necessarily a human being who pays for it, rather, if the decision-making mechanism for resource distribution becomes decentralized, it would be better to make itself a mechanism without human intervention than to have a human being as a pipe to connect to bring in funds.
