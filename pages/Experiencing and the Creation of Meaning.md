- Experiencing and the Creation of Meaning: A Philosophical and Psychological Approach to the Subjective
- [[Eugene T. Gendlin]]
- [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3oqUsAU)

- I bought the book to check the original text of [[Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning]], but I didn't realize until I bought it that the subtitle was "Approach to the Subjective".
- So this is the technology to do this [[Properly subjective]].
