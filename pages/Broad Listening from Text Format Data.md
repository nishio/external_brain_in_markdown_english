title: "Broad Listening from Text Format Data"

- Now that the public opinion map is done, think about broad listening from text format data.
    - Recently I've been working on 2D visualization and clustering from opinion vectors.
- The Value of Broad Listening
    - Is it a scatter plot? Feeling that it's not.
    - Most people don't know how to read a scatterplot if you just give them a scatterplot.
        - There is value in having an AI write the commentary.
    - How about just having AI provide commentary?
        - Someone will say, "I don't know if this explanation is correct."
            - I think that [[visualization (data, results, etc.)]] is just a stage direction to increase the [[persuasive power]] of [[AI Summary]].
    - What value would an AI provide in explaining this?
        - To be able to understand what you didn't understand?


- As an aside, the expression "[[broad listening for the masses]]" is misleading, there are various forms of users, such as "people who use it for analysis" and "people who look at the results"
    - In the case of Nittele, the customer is the TV station, not the viewer, because it is the TV station that makes the decision to introduce the product and pays for it.
    - This is a complicated composition.
        - Customers paying TV stations are also advertisers, not viewers
        - The composition of the investment is such that if the topic and popularity of the new trial increases, the value of the medium will increase.
    - There is no such thing as broad listening where the direct mass is the customer (i.e., where the mass will pay for it).
