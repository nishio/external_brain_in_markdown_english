title: "Is it functioning properly?"
---

- "Am I functioning normally?" You can't tell if you're functioning normally and yes, or if you're not functioning normally and therefore yes, even though you're not really functioning normally.
- When a person believes that he or she is functioning normally, he or she cannot know if he or she is really functioning normally. On the other hand, when it seems that "I am not functioning normally," this is really not functioning normally. When you are not functioning normally, you might as well take a break because it will get worse even if you try your best to do something about it.
- When others appear to be dysfunctional, is it really the other person who is [[dysfunctional]], or am I misidentifying them because I am dysfunctional, or are they both dysfunctional? How can this be identified?
- I wondered why I suddenly thought that... and then I thought back and realized that this tweet was about "dysfunctional strangers". I thought, "Behaviors that were considered good in the past," such as "listening to others," implicitly assume that others are functioning normally.
    - > Rather than "I don't mind [[slander]] by others," I have come to realize that I am simply making the rather critical judgment that "the words and deeds of people who are in a state of mind where they have to slander others are not very accurate to begin with, and many of their recommendations are not worth referring to in any case. I've come to realize that I'm just making a rather critical judgment. The drunken old man's talk-and-don't-listen theory.
- Before the development of SNS, the cost of "communicating opinions to others" was high, so it was difficult to convey the opinions of dysfunctional people. In fact, the more radical the opinion, the more likely it is to be conveyed.
