A passage from the lyrics of "[[The only flower in the world]]"

> [@ogino_otaku](https://twitter.com/ogino_otaku/status/1580898796237508609?s=46&t=BJwQLrqRxThT57UV3xQwpQ): Good boys and girls! You say, "You don't have to be number one," but don't forget that the flowers you see in the flower stores are all the elite that have survived the shipping and sorting process on the farms!
> The lesson is that in the end, flowers that don't bloom will decay and wither without being seen by anyone.
