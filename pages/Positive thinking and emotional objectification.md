    - I saw two candidates listed under [[The inner life of a person who is evaluated as positive]] and thought of a third.
        - [[Intellectual Production and Vipassana]]
        - On this page
            - Anger management can help you recognize anger and
                - In [[Vipassana meditation]], I notice, "Oh, I'm doing [[attachment]] now.
            - I notice in intellectual production, "Oh, I'm stuck in [[unproductive swamp]] right now," and I'm like, "Oh, I'm stuck in [[unproductive swamp]].
        - He used the example of
        - I wonder if there is a similar structure to "[[positive thinking]]."
                - When [[Negative Emotions]] occur, you realize, "Oh, I'm experiencing negative emotions right now.
                    - [[self-monitoring]] 的な<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/issac/icon' alt='/villagepump/issac.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - What's better when you realize
            - Before you know it, when you're "caught up in your emotions," your emotions and yourself are one and the same.
            - You find yourself divided into two parts: the self that is at one with the emotion and the detached self that is observing it.
            - Then, if you don't like the "at one with your emotions" state, then put the emphasis on your side, away from them.
    - [[Vipassana meditation]] とは [[original Buddhism]] 由来の概念であって「自分の中に感情が芽生えた時にそれに気づく訓練」を指す(<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>interpretation.)
    - What is often associated with the word "meditation" is "calming the mind" [[Samatha Meditation]].
    - When you calm your mind and observe carefully the "calming state of mind", you will then be able to identify the "buzzing state of mind"
    - Pay attention to what is happening at the start of this "buzzing" state
    - This will help us to understand "what makes our hearts beat".
        - Do they provide insight into the causes that triggered the emotions?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/issac/icon' alt='/villagepump/issac.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Increased resolution to "disturbing causes."
    - Would that make it easier to notice the "buzzing state"? (Seems like a bit of a leap)
    - In intellectual production
        - I think it's more productive to work on it early and quietly than to fret over the feeling of "Oh no, I might not make the deadline, I have to get it into shape anyway!" I think it is more productive to work early and quietly than to be rattled by feelings of impatience.
        - I'm afraid I'll be laughed at or offended if I write something like this" is another emotion that reduces productivity.
                - [90% of concerns never arise.
    - [[having a bird's-eye view]] という感じかな？<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - So you're saying we need to have two levels of awareness and being able to look down there.
        - Beginners also feel in the process of improving<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/issac/icon' alt='/villagepump/issac.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - When you realize you're not good at something, that's when the training begins.
            - A very big advantage of mentoring is that it gives you a bird's eye view.
        - The part I notice could use some help from technology.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/yosider/icon' alt='/villagepump/yosider.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - Monitoring the brain and other parts of the body to let you know when strong emotions appear.
            - Can you also distinguish between "stuck in emotions" and "looking down on things"?
            - And then provide feedback on the "degree of overhead" and visualize how moving your thinking will change that?
                    - [[neurofeedback]]
- This kind of thing is also a kind of[[automatic thinking]] なのだろうか？<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I see many examples of negative automatic thinking, though,
    - You could say it's neutral automatic thinking.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/issac/icon' alt='/villagepump/issac.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - It's like detaching from feelings and thinking from facts.
        - I'm sure it's "relatively" because of the inclusion of bias.
    - I think I learned that when I was growing up, I learned to think things like, "He's in a bad mood, maybe he's hungry? I think I learned that when I was growing up.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
