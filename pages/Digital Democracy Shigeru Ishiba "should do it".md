Nana Takamatsu, who specializes in youth political participation, briefed Prime Minister Ishiba on Taiwan's JOIN and asked if the LDP intends to promote digital democracy. Figures in parentheses were supplemented by Nishio.

Nana Takamatsu: (Taiwanese high school students) thought it was a waste that so many tapioca straws were thrown away. A teacher at school said to me, "Why don't you write something on JOIN (Taiwan's digital democracy system)? I posted it and got more than 5,000 likes. If you get more than 5,000 likes (on JOIN, Taiwan's digital democracy system), the government has to deliberate on the matter. It was regulated by what that high school student wrote. Is this the kind of thing the LDP would do? If it were now, there might be a severe pursuit of the back taxes issue or something like that, but do you intend to promote digital democracy, something like Taiwan?
Prime Minister Ishiba: You should do that. It is wrong to say that we should only go to the polls when we vote. Society actually changes through participation. What young people are thinking now is, "The world is not going to change anyway. There are many people who have given up on the world. Even if the LDP is at a disadvantage, we will make them realize that they can make a difference by participating.

TAKAMATSU Nana, who specializes in youth political participation, explained Taiwan’s JOIN platform to Prime Minister ISHIBA and asked whether the Liberal Democratic Party intends to promote digital democracy.

TAKAMATSU: A high school student in Taiwan thought that the amount of discarded plastic straws from bubble tea was wasteful. A teacher casually suggested to the student, "Why not write something on JOIN (Taiwan’s digital democracy system)?" So the student posted about it, and it received over 5,000 likes. If a post on JOIN gets over 5,000 likes, the government is required to review it. As a result of what the high school student wrote, there was a regulation put in place. Will the Liberal Democratic Party do something like this? Right now, there may be strict scrutiny over issues like slush funds, but do you intend to promote digital democracy like Taiwan?

Prime Minister ISHIBA: We should do that. Just showing up to vote is not enough. By participating, society can truly change. Right now, many young people think, "The world won't change anyway." There are a lot of people who have that kind of resignation, right? Even if it becomes a disadvantage to the Liberal Democratic Party, we want to create a sense of participation that actually brings change.
