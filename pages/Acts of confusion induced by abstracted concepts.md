title: "Acts of confusion induced by abstracted concepts"
---

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1646195927861071872) There is a concept C, a group of experts X uses C. Someone outside X, Y, comes along and abstracts C in a messy way and applies it to a strange domain D (description from X's perspective).
>  X gets angry at Y and thinks people who appreciate Y's statements are idiots.
>
>  By the way, whether C', which is an abstraction of C, is beneficial for application in D is irrelevant to C.
> So if it's useful, that's a good use for it.
>
>  The problem is that Y confuses C', which is an abstraction of C, by calling it C, and [[steals credit]] even though "it is irrelevant that C is useful in the original domain that X was using and that C' is useful in D".

- [[act of confusion]]


I'll paint a picture of this case later.
