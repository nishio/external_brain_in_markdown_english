title: "Understanding is a hypothesis, so it can be wrong."

Understanding is a hypothesis", so it must be "[[Validated by Action]]".
Conversely, "[[understanding]]" before it is verified is "something that could be wrong," so it can be wrong
Even if you read a good textbook that says the right thing, the reader may not understand it and may misinterpret it.

This [[understanding acquisition process]] is a "[[error-tolerant process]]" and thus can use "[[error-prone algorithms]]" such as [[LLM]].
In this respect, the criticism that "LLMs sometimes give incorrect answers" is misplaced.
- As in [[Industrial Applications of Machine Learning]], even if the probability of a correct answer is not 100%, it is [[useful]] if the expected value obtained exceeds that of the conventional method.
