title: "Regarding self-praise"
---

from [[Hatena2009-01-12]]
> I don't know if it is "[[Japanese people]] are" or "[[East Asians]] are" or "people under the influence of [[Confucianism]] culture", but there is a strong tendency to dislike [[self-praise]] and [[act of promoting oneself]]. I wonder if that is the cause of the "[[the nail that sticks out gets hammered in]]" trend.
- Act of promoting oneself
        - [[self-branding]]
    - [[self-recommendation]]
