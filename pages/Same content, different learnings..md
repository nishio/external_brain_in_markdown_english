title: "Same content, different learnings."

- [[Transcript CUMOT2018]] I transcribed the text in [[Transcript CUMOT2018]], but I don't really feel like reading it.
Why?
- [[One Night Werewolf Transcription 1-1]] and others I was willing to read. What is the difference?
If the "already verbalized content" is content that has been aired, like TV, then there's no need to read the transcript because what's in the transcript is already verbalized content.

I thought that it would be necessary to edit and devise some way for human beings to read, understand, look back on, and utilize it in a form that they can use later. That's what we thought.
Would I be inclined to read it over if there was editing or some other device, or would I not be inclined to read it over because the lecture materials and such would suffice? Maybe it's the latter.

Organize and record "my notes" immediately after the lecture and read them back.
- I feel there is too much information even in the lecture material.
- I think the most you can learn in a two-hour lecture is about three bullet points at most.
    - On the other hand, "which three are my learnings" varies from person to person, maybe.
        - Yes, so I put a lot of emphasis on [[exchanging opinions with others]] after lectures.
