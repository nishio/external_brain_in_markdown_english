title: "Talk to someone who's never done it before about what you want to do and they'll tell you why you can't do it."

> All the adults who taught these things (reasons why you can't) were "people who have never done it before" who had never built an airplane or a rocket, and they were just saying the right things. If you talk to "[[People who have never done it before]]" about [[want to do]], they will just tell you "[[Reasons why you can't]]", so this is just the wrong person to talk to.
