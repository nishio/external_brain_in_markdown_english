> If a metaphor is heavily developed within a metaphor space (lots of [[Networks between concepts]]), it can have the effect of providing a warp portal to other spaces, facilitating the joining of distant ones
- [[Network of Concepts]]
- [[Conceptual Network]]

- [[knowledge network]], I sense a difference in nuance.
- There is a nuance of "objective" implicit in "[[knowledge]]".
- What is being discussed here is [[subjective]] [[Weltanschauung (philosophy)]], [[world view]], [[world description]].
    - [[Uexküll's Ringworld Theory]]
    - [[Associative Networks]] is closer.
    - What [[suggestion]] is [[the situation is connected]] by "[[recollection]]" and "[[virtual viewing]]" of the [[world]].
    - For example, right now the reader here has "drop and break" connected to "glass cup".
        - But in the future, people living in zero-gravity or low-gravity colonies will not connect this association because they can retrieve it before it cracks.
        - Even in a world where unbreakable plastic cups dominate history and "glass cups" are only found in museums, the associations don't connect.
    - Related: [[Understanding as the ability to predict the future]].
