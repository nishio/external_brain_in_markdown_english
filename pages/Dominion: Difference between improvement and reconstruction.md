title: "Dominion: Difference between improvement and reconstruction"
---

Improvements discarded at [[cantrip]], just +1 cost card gain
Renovation is discarded by [[terminal action]], max +2 cost card gain

The renovation is +2, so the gold can be made into a genus state or a curse into a 2-cost action.
Improvements cannot be made because you get "just +1" card.
Renovation can [[discarding something without using it]] acquire the same card as the one discarded, for example to wither a pile.

The improvement is a cantrip, so it is easy to include multiple copies, but without a convenient conversion target, it is subtle.
