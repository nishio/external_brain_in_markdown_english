- A "given constraint" is a condition or limit that is "given" in a given problem or situation.
- This implies conditions and limitations that must be considered in order to solve the problem.
- In mathematics problems, a specific situation or constraint is given and the solution must be derived from it.
- Also, in the context of theorems and proofs, "given" refers to known facts and assumptions. These are the underlying information from which new results are derived.
