- Many people try to establish an identity by pursuing a "path," but this is a trap. Those with a fixed mold become a red ocean where many people rush in, resulting in an overcrowded market. On the other hand, those who have reached the stage of "breaking away" from the mold are fighting in a different blue ocean.
- If you just follow "the path," you will end up associating with similar people and becoming nothing. This is the "structure in which effort is not rewarded" in modern society.
- In other words, simply pursuing a "path" is jumping into the red ocean, and it is difficult to establish a true identity and succeed. To be innovative, one needs to think and act outside the conventional mold.

>  However, the "breakaway" people in [[Shuhari]] have broken out of the mold and are starting to fight in other blue waters!

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1773742582948053419) If you are not aware of this structure, and you think that you might be able to walk the "path" and someday reach "breakaway", there are an infinite number of people who are similar to you So, you will "try to become something" [[associate with similar people]], and you will "become nothing."

>  I guess this is the structure of the modern world [[where efforts are not rewarded]].

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1773742584357351768) I was suddenly reminded of these cruel stories in an article that came across my timeline in the last few days

- [[People who want to be something they are not.]]
[[I can't be anything...]]

    - [[Can you spot innovative talent in advance?]]
