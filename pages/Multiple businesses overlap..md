I'm not sure which is Cybozu and which is Danksoft.... But I feel that it doesn't make much sense to separate them, and that we should look not only at the Cybozu part, but rather at Ryuta's activities as a whole, and say "I like that" or "I want it to be more like this".

> With Ryuta doing other work, we are finding new places to apply Cybozu's cloud. Things like IoT in agriculture being done well via Danksoft and other things that Cybozu has not been able to do in the past are having the effect of branches being extended all at once by people doing multiple jobs. The economist Schumpeter defines innovation as "[[new combination]]. Double-duty is precisely what creates that new combination, isn't it? [Pulling and combining from the outside world what is not in the company" is innovation. I wish that everyone would do double jobs in a world I don't know and accelerate innovation ([Aono](http://mydeskteam.com/casefile/1887/)).
