- Those who understand [[piling up]] from the basic concepts can answer in depth when asked about [[Abstract Concepts]]☆, "What does that mean?" can answer in depth when asked "What does it mean?
    - Related: [[People who memorize the whole thing can't dig in.]]
    - For example, many people feel repulsed by the katakana words that consultants often use #consulting language
        - I know a competent consultant who, when I ask him, "What does that word mean?" and he answers immediately.
            - He corresponds to the left side of the figure.
        - On the other hand, there are probably some consultants who just hear and use the terminology used by other consultants in the company.
            - These types of people can't answer questions.
            - This corresponds to the right side of the figure
    - This composition is true not only in consulting, but in all fields that deal with knowledge.

- On the other hand, "[Smart people can explain things clearly.

    - Figure A can explain the concept ☆ in one step in depth.
        - Mr. B can hear that in-depth explanation and understand the concept.
        - Mr. C doesn't understand the concept used to explain it because he doesn't understand the concept itself.
    - True until "smart people can dig in and explain."
        - Whether or not the in-depth explanation is "understandable" is an attribute of the recipient.
        - In other words, "whether an explanation is [[easy to understand]]" is not an attribute of the explanation alone, but an attribute that depends on the relationship with the recipient's intelligence.
    - Even if Mr. A can explain the concept of complex numbers, it is a different story if he can make an elementary school student, who is not even proficient in addition, understand it.
        - If you spend enough time and Mr. A digs deeper and deeper to explain it, and Mr. C masters it, you will eventually earn the concept*.
        - In many cases, Mr. A or Mr. C does not have the enthusiasm to spend that much time

#Pyramid of Knowledge

I just ended up writing "digging" in Japanese, and the English translation would be delve into or something like that.

Maybe it would be better to say

- [[Accumulated and Rootless Knowledge]]
