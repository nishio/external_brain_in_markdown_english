I would like to work on "raising the resolution" and building momentum for Open academia.
>  >RShibato: . Thanks to @rmaruy's support, I was able to publish this article. We are going to improve the resolution of the decentralized institute as we run and implement it in the society. We will start with "1,000 True Fans". x.com/academist_cf/s...
