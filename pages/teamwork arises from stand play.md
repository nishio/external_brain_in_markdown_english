If there is any, it's only [[teamwork]] that arises from [[stand play]]."

This quote suggests that in the world of Ghost in the Shell, there's no place for justifying poor performance with the concept of "team play," a term often used to diffuse responsibility across a group rather than on individual members. Instead, Aramaki believes in the importance of "teamwork" that comes from "stand play" - a term used in baseball to mean an outstanding individual play that contributes to the team's overall success. In other words, each member should excel in their roles to bring about collective success, not hide behind the collective to mask their shortcomings.
