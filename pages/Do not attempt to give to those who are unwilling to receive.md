title: "Do not attempt to give to those who are unwilling to receive"
---


> Do not give holy things to dogs. And do not cast pearls before swine. The dogs and pigs will trample them under their feet, turn around and chew you to pieces!
- from New Testament, [[Gospel of Matthew (book of the Bible)]] 7:6, New Revised Bible Center (translation), The New Revised Translation of the Bible 2017.
- [[Pearls to swine]]

> I'm trying to teach a starving person how to fish, not give him a fish... The problem is that starving people don't understand the value of learning to fish and ask you to give them fish, or they resent you for not giving them fish.
>  "Your axe is very rusty, shouldn't you sharpen it?" > "I'm so busy chopping wood I don't have time to sharpen my axe!" Like that.
- from  [[Asking and searching people.]]

> We don't move on our own unless you tell us... They will not move on their own unless you say... We need to see how much [[real sword (as opposed to unsharpened or wooden practice weapon) (practice)]] they are, because we know we will hurt them...
- from  [[The top tier won't tell you unless you ask them to tell you.]]

There were stories of people who reached out to poor households out of the goodness of their hearts, and instead of gratitude being returned, hatred and violence was returned.
- But there's a slightly different cut-and-dry interpretation of this.
        - [[Gratitude trumps money.]]

- [[crime of advising a defendant]]
