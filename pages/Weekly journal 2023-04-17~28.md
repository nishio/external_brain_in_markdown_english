- That's two weeks!
- for some reason
    - The [[ChatGPT Plugins]] came on Friday and the [[2023-04-10 LLM Meetup]] on Monday, which blew off the weekend's weekly journal switch.
    - If nothing else, I think I would have made the switch to the weekly journal once the LLM Meetup wrap-up was done on Tuesday.
    - But on Monday, I was invited by [[tkgshn]] to [[Plurality Tokyo]], and the preview of the event was held on Wednesday, so I blew off the switch of weekly diary again.
