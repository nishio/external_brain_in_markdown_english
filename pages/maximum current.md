title: "maximum current"
---

The majority of the problems that are ultimately attributed to the maximum flow and solved.
- First, it comes down to the minimum cut problem.
- Eliminate negative edges and make it a maximum flow problem.
- Solve with the maximum flow library
And since it's confusing to think about flow when you're trying to get to the smallest cut problem, I moved it to [Comes down to the smallest cut.

Write here if there is a problem, like using the maximum flow instead of the minimum cut.
