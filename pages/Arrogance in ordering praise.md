title: "Arrogance in ordering praise"
---

One person, A, was positively commented by another person, B, about his deeds. However, A did not like the word choice of some of B's statements and complained about it on social networking sites.

From the standpoint of not knowing much about either A or B, this behavior of A looks like an infant saying, "I don't like it if you don't compliment me with expressions that make me feel good.

I wrote this here because I did not feel the urge to change my behavior by telling Mr. A on the spot, "Your statement, it's disgusting.

- [[arrogance]]
- [[Evaluation by others]]
- It doesn't feel like [[aging population combined with the elderly]], it doesn't make you feel "old".
