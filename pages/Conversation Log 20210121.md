title: "Conversation Log 20210121"
---

What to talk about in the internal study group and the demo. Since there are two topics at the beginning, one of them was delved into.
I had imagined a one-way connection from the chat system to Regroup, but when asked how Regroup would affect the chat system, I realized I had made a one-way assumption.
In the past, I had imagined integrating the chat system and Regroup and using them at the same time, but thought it would be inconvenient. This time, having verbalized the image of using the chat system with a smartphone, I noticed a new implementation pattern: "I call the chat system from Regroup, take it with me, go for a walk, and when I return, the conversation is added to the map. This one seems useful.

This log is the longest one on record. It might have been better to change the topic in the middle and start it separately. I added "New Talk" to the menu, which was not there at that time. You can start a new conversation in a separate tab.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I'm hoping to get organized for what I'm going to talk about at tomorrow's in-house study session. Also, I'm talking on my phone while taking this walk, so it's also a demonstration of how to use it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of demo is that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's hard for someone who is not familiar with it to understand how to use it just by reading the manual, unless I, the person most familiar with it, show them how to use it beneficially.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of usage is that usage?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's not enough to just explain how to operate the system; it's also important to know when you're using it, for what purpose, and in what situation.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of situation is the situation?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Now, I'd say, "Take a walk."
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  I'm hoping to get organized on what I'm going to talk about at tomorrow's internal study session. Also, I'm talking on my phone while taking this walk, so it's also a demonstration of how to use it.
- Is there anything else you would like to share about this demonstration?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>This is not a demonstration of the chat system only. Well, the chat system could not be shown because it has existed as a closed chat bot until now. The important part this time is the connection between chat and Regroup.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is that demonstration?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Chat with them, export it, put it in Regroup, and organize it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of Regroup is that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>A tool to promote mental organization by arranging pieces of information in two dimensions
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of fragments are those?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>In this case, the chat is a bit too granular to organize after the fact, so it's better to chop it up into smaller pieces and then organize them.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that fragment?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Not too small, too small for common keyword extraction, and what we're going to talk about in this study session includes support for division into those stickies.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>So far, I have felt that the chat system by itself is effective and effective for Regroup, but I think that combining these two systems will create a better effect.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that Regroup?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It was not effective until a certain number of fragments were collected. It was difficult for people who were not used to creating such fragments. So, we decided to support the collection of fragments by having the sentences spit out in the form of chat and automatically dividing them into stickies.

- Where is this Regroup located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It has existed independently until now, but the new direction is positioned as "use the chat system first, and then the Regroup".
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is that Regroup located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>NG

- >  It existed independently until now, but the new direction is positioned as "use the chat system first, and then Regroup".
- What does this Regroup look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Consultants who first elicit enough information from the other party and then organize it on a whiteboard.

- >  It existed independently until now, but the new direction is positioned as "use the chat system first, and then Regroup".
- Where does this Regroup come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>From where...I can use my phone to chat while walking or whatever, but I need a big screen to organize, and that's hard to do while walking. It's like chatting while walking and venting, and then when I get home, I can calm down and start organizing.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of chat is that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Moving the human perspective by asking questions
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  It existed independently until now, but the new direction is positioned as "use the chat system first, and then Regroup".
- How do you know this Regroup?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Well, that's because I am the author. If I want many people to know about it, it still needs to be easy to understand how to use.

- >  It existed independently until now, but the new direction is positioned as "use the chat system first, and then Regroup".
- What should happen with this Regroup?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I hope people who use it find it useful.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to the Regroup for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Is it necessary to communicate the flow of usage in such a way that it is useful?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Can Regroup do that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It was quite difficult for Regroup by itself, so we connected it to the chat this time.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that chat?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>That's right, in the process of making the web version, I had to turn off various functions, and there were things that I wanted to improve but left out because the code was too complicated.

- >  It existed independently until now, but the new direction is positioned as "use the chat system first, and then Regroup".
- What is the relationship between this Regroup and the chat?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's a heavy tool to start, so I feel like I'm getting traction with a tool that's easy to start: chat.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is that chat?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I'm assuming it's primarily a smartphone.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  It existed independently until now, but the new direction is positioned as "use the chat system first, and then Regroup".
- Is this Regroup the same as chat? Is it different?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>No, sir.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  It existed independently until now, but the new direction is positioned as "use the chat system first, and then Regroup".
- What happens in the chat when this Regroup?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Ah, what kind of changes to the chat would there be due to factors on Regroup's part? I hadn't thought about that. At least the logs I'm outputting now were hard to use with Regroup as is, so I'll tweak them a bit; Regroup is a heavy tool, so I don't want to make it mandatory to use Regroup, chat has to be able to provide value with chat alone.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to the Regroup during that chat?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Oh, yes, there was some talk about wanting to organize the results of multiple chats together, or having Regroup next to you in real time when you are chatting. It would be nice to call up a chat from the Regroup, talk while walking around, and when you return, a sticky of the conversation will be added to the map. Integration not real-time.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is between that Regroup and the chat?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>There is a sticky note division support algorithm. That is one of the key points of this project. Chat messages often contain useless words if they are resized appropriately as stickies. Therefore, it is necessary to chop them into appropriate sizes and remove useless words. This is what we did this time.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is that chat located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I'd like to see more in-depth discussion of the sticky split support algorithm. Maybe we can chat separately...
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is that chat like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>In short, this chat system tries to delve into a single topic, so when a user finishes talking about one topic and tries to delve into another, he/she does not understand it and sticks to the previous topic. Well, there may be unexpected connections between what the user thinks are different topics. Chat is like a person who listens and is like a hook that catches what is in the water.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where does that chat come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>If you mean how users will discover this chat, a few people have expressed interest on Facebook now, so I think I should introduce it as a beta test. If the number of users increases too rapidly, my capacity will be overflowed.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>How do you know its a chat?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Oh, you're talking about how we came to know this one. Where it comes from is that originally it was a method called symbolic modeling, which was done by humans and was expensive, so they reduced the functionality and made it electronic.

- What do you hope will happen in this chat?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's not ready now, but after the learning data collection mechanism is in place, it will learn and become smarter as users use it a lot.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to the chat for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>One of the features I'm temporarily turning off right now is the storage of training data, which needs to be restarted.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Can chat do that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Well, I'll do it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between me and Regroup?

- What is the relationship between this Regroup and the sticky note?

- What happens to the stickies during this Regroup?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Regroup I used to do this with paper stickies, but it was inconvenient, so I went electronic. One good thing about going electronic is that I can make a big sticky with 2 clicks, and I can duplicate and back it up.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of sticky notes are those?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Electronic, square area with short text

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Larger stickies are good to make it clear at a glance that it is important

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I would like to talk about an algorithm to create these stickies from chat statements.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between that chat and the sticky note?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>When you reply to a chat like this, the text is inscribed and becomes a sticky note.

- Is this chat the same as a sticky note? Is it different?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Chat is too long a sentence, so chop it up.

- What happens in the chat when this sticky?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The stickies are currently only seen by the user after the chat is over, so there is no influence from the stickies to the chat. Of course, there is the idea of displaying them beside the chat, but this chat system is effective by focusing the user's attention by asking questions, so displaying them in a distracting manner would be ineffective.

- What do these stickies look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I answered that they are the same, but the individual chats and the system for them are different? Even though the stickies may appear after the individual chat is over, the chat system can still capture the contents of the stickies and utilize them for the next individual chat.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where do those stickies come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>So, what those stickies look like are fragmented memories of past dialogues. They come from past dialogues. If there is a statement in the current dialogue that matches the past sticky, the chat system can make associations by following the "proximity relationship" created by moving the sticky on the Regroup. The current chat system can display a quotation and ask a question like, "You said this in the previous dialogue, is this ~ and this ~ the same thing?" You can ask questions like.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>How do you know its sticky note?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Yes, this is important. Stickies from the past are often forgotten, but the chat system reminds us.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What should happen to that sticky?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I hope it's the start of an unexpected inspiration.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to the stickies for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's important to see it again in time.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Can stickies do that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>We can't do paper stickies, we can't do current Regroups, we can present past stickies here if interacting with this chat system is a daily interface with humans. There may be times when this is beneficial to the user and times when it is not. No one has experienced it yet, so I can't judge if it's good or bad.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is that chat system the same as chat? Is it different?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Yes, this is actually something different, which is an important realization this time around. Individual chats are for individual purposes, and in the version before this port, each new start lost past memories. It was still beneficial, but with this modification, especially to make the logs persistent in case they were to be shown to others, it is now possible to have persistent memories. So, now that each user has a persistent memory, they'll gradually figure out my vocabulary and stuff and pull up what I've said in the past.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>You're right, this is something else.
