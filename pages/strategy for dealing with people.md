title: "strategy for dealing with people"

A story about a change in strategy in Othello where AI has become stronger than humans "by not being the best move, which is well-researched by humans, but by not being the best move, which is not well-researched and takes a path that is easy for the opponent to make a mistake".

nishio: If we extend the analogy to other than [[Othello]], you're saying that it's a good idea to consult with the AI and take the seemingly disadvantageous path that takes you a little further ahead than other humans.
