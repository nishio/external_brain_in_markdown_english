    - [[concrete]] and [[abstract]] -The mechanism of intelligence that makes the world look different.
    - [[Isao Hosoya]]
- [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2P04jxF)


    - Note that it was mentioned in connection with the chapter on abstraction in [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]].
    - I struggled with how to convey the concept of [[abstraction]], and this book probably struggled with how to teach abstraction, too!
