- (for nishio-en readers, you are seeing Japanese to English translation by machine of the English to Japanese translation by me )

- Good local time everyone, I am Audrey Tang, Taiwan's digital minister.
    - Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I am [[Audrey Tan]], Minister of Digital Affairs of Taiwan.
- It is an honor to address you all today at Plurality Tokyo.
    - I am honored to be speaking to you all today at [[Plurality Tokyo]].
- Before I dealt into my speech, allow me to share a poem that encapsulates our mission.
    - Before I begin my speech, allow me to share with you a poem that condenses our mission.

- When we see "Internet of Things”, Let's make it an Internet of Beings.
    - If you see "[[Internet of Things]] ([[IoT]])", make it "[[Internet of Being]]".
- When we see "virtual reality”, Let's make it a shared reality.
    - Once you see "[[Virtual Reality]]([[VR]])", make it "[[Shared Reality]]".
- When we see "machine learning”, Let's make it collaborative learning.
    - If you see "[[machine learning]] (ML)," set it to "[[cooperative learning]].
- When we see "user experience”, Let's make it about human experience.
    - If you see "User Experience, [[UX]]," go to "Human Experience.
- And whenever we hear that a singularity is near, let's always remember the plurality is here.
    - And whenever you hear that [[singularity]] is near, always remember that [[plurality]] is here.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Plurality" and "plural" are opposed to "singular" in "singularity.

- In recent months, the rapid development of language models has heightened concerns about existential risks, raising questions about the looming singularity.
    - In recent months, the rapid development of [[language models]] has raised concerns about [[existential risk]] and raised the question of imminent [[singularity]].
- However, I am a firm believer that assistive intelligence has the potential to liberate our time for more meaningful pursuits.
    - However, I am convinced that "[[assistant artificial intelligence]]" (assistive intelligence) will free up our time to pursue more meaningful goals.
- The crafting of this very speech was indeed aided by language models, demonstrating the the power of transformative technology, which will indelibly reshape human society, much like the Internet has done.
    - The creation of this speech was also aided by the language model. This is the power of transformative technology. And this power will have an irreversible impact on human society. Just as the Internet did.

- With three-quarters of a century remaining in the 21st century, the first quarter centuries’ joint efforts have laid the groundwork for the digital world's fundamental structure.
    - The foundations of the digital world were laid in the first quarter of the century through the collaborative efforts made in the first quarter of the century for the remaining three quarters of the 21st century.
- We cannot overlook humanity's adaptability, as our present lives were also once beyond the imagination of those in the beginning of the 21st century.
    - We should not underestimate the adaptability of humankind. For even our lives today are unimaginable to people at the beginning of the 21st century.

- As transformative technologies emerge, diverse communities generate unique usage patterns to fulfill distinct objectives.
    - As transformative technologies emerge, diverse communities create their own patterns of use to achieve their goals.
- While autocracies exploit technology as a means of control, we strive to democratize technology in pursuit of plurality or collaborative diversity.
    - Whereas [[dictatorships]] use technology as a means of control, we democratize technology and strive for plurality or [[cooperative diversity]] ([[collaborative diversity]]).
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The "plurality" (plurality, plurality) is opposed to the "unitary" nature of the "dictatorship.
- Guided by the spirit of plurality, democracies must go beyond devising protective measures, where envisioning a trajectory embraced in the triad of participation, progress and safety.
    - Guided by the spirit of plurality, democracies must not only devise protective measures, but also conceive of a three-pronged trajectory of participation, progress, and security.
- In a plural world, everyone can establish their digital spaces while collaboratively crafting interaction modes that accommodate all.
    - In a prurient world, everyone can establish their own digital space, working with all to build an interaction mode that embraces each person.
- All those communities may differ in norms and cultures. We can reveal shared values for shared reflection and [[deliberation]], thus fostering an interoperable co-presence.
    - These communities may have different norms and cultures, but by identifying common values ([[shared values]]), [[pondering and deliberating together]] (shared reflection and deliberation) and fostering interoperable co-presence.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Copresence is a nuanced word meaning "to be with."


- This aspiration necessitates a robust digital infrastructure.
    - A robust digital infrastructure is needed to make these aspirations a reality.
- The growth of Taiwan's internet and democracy has proceeded in tandem.
    - The Internet and democracy in Taiwan have developed shoulder to shoulder.
- Today, the Taiwanese people literally utilize the internet as a public forum for discourse, and the Taiwanese government staunchly upholds broadband as a human right, ensuring every citizen has sufficient bandwidth for live streaming, even atop Taiwan's highest peak, Mount Jade, thereby facilitating continuous dialogue and value exchange.
    - Today, Taiwanese people literally use the Internet as a "[[forum]]" ([[public square]], a place for discourse), and the Taiwanese government has made broadband an integral part of human rights, ensuring that all citizens have sufficient bandwidth for live streaming, even on Taiwan's highest peak, Yushan, It encourages ongoing dialogue and value exchange.
- In normative mechanisms, such as quadratic voting in presidential hackathons, have enabled numerous co-creation initiatives, including the Water Refill Map app, which merges public water dispensers with eco-conscious tea shops to combat plastic waste.
    - Many co-creation initiatives have been realized through [[normative mechanisms]] such as [[Quadratic Voting]] in hackathons organized by the President of Taiwan. For example, the "Water Refill Map" application that merges public water fountains with environmentally conscious tea stores to combat plastic waste.

- While Web3 implementations often emphasize novel technological capabilities, our experience from five years of presidential hackathons revealed that the crux of success lies in prioritizing people and utilizing appropriate technology to foster seamless communication, consensus-building, and problem-solving.
    - While Web3 implementations often emphasize novel technical capabilities, five years of presidential hackathons have shown that the key to success lies in putting people first and utilizing appropriate technology to facilitate smooth communication, consensus building, and problem solving.

- So today, it is heartening to witness the numerous Web3 events unfolding in Tokyo, such as Plurality Tokyo, ETH Global Tokyo, and DAO Tokyo.
    - So it is with great excitement that I see today a number of Web3 events unfolding in Tokyo, such as "Plurality Tokyo," "ETH Global Tokyo," and "DAO Tokyo.
- Developers worldwide are collaborating now on decentralized technology, exemplifying plurality through distributed ledgers that empower everyone to co-create content within a shared commons.
    - Developers around the world are now collaborating on distributed technology. Through distributed ledgers, plurality is embodied. Distributed ledgers allow everyone to co-create content in shared public spaces (shared commons).

- And to build upon these achievements and broaden the vision of plurality, we established the Ministry of Digital Affairs last August.
    - To build on these accomplishments and expand on our vision of plurality, we created the Digital Ministry last August.
- Serving as the "MODA" or "motor" for Taiwan's digital transformation, we bridge civics and technologies, we strengthen industry and security in unison.

        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The word "motor" as a driving device and "MODA" as an abbreviation for Ministry of Digital Affairs (MODA) are pronounced the same in Taiwan!
- Indeed, our ministry has a dedicated section in charge of Web3 infrastructure, with our initial focus on decentralized identities. By learning from DAO communities, we strive to construct bridges between traditional institutions and those that are emerging.
    - In fact, the Ministry has a dedicated department in charge of the Web3 infrastructure, focusing first on decentralized ID, and by learning from the DAO community, we are working to bridge the gap between traditional and new organizations and institutions.

- Earlier this year, we joined forces with a worldwide web consortium to develop [[verifiable credentials]] and [[decentralized identifiers]]. Through such frameworks, we can play a crucial role in confirming the authenticity of natural persons, legal entities, and novel organizational structures such as DAOs.
    - Earlier this year, we started working with the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] ([[W3C]]) to develop [[verifiable credentials]] (verifiable credentials, VC) and [[distributed IDs]] (decentralized identifiers, DID). Through such a framework, we can play an important role in verifying the authenticity of natural persons, legal entities, and new organizational structures such as DAOs.

Translation Discussion
- Our pilots, those people of public-private partnerships, are well positioned to be disseminated across Japan and all democrats see as digital public goods.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I don't understand what you mean here, is the original correct?
        - Our pilot public-private partnership people can spread it throughout the country, and the DPJ sees it as a digital public good.
        - Our pilot is in an optimal position for public/private partnership in promoting it as a digital public good in Japan and other democracies.
        - > [@haradakiro](https://twitter.com/haradakiro/status/1648868486335336450?s=20): @nishio @hal_sk @0xtkgshn "Our pilots, the public-private partnership people, We are in a good position to spread (those funds) because they are scattered all over Japan.
        - > "It will be a digital public good for Democrats." I think it's about the same. I think the D in the original is actually lower case.
        - > [@LearningengAki](https://twitter.com/LearningengAki/status/1648706459017048066?s=20): @nishio moda The same video has subtitles created by moda. PPPP is frequently discussed in recent videos.
        - > We will check Nishio's Scrapbox tomorrow and contact you again if necessary.
        - > If it was resolved in another tweet 🙇.
        - [["public-private-people partnership (P4)"]] I see, you have the original word.
            - No. Is that relevant here?
    - → Our pilots, i.e., public/private partnerships, you are in a position to deploy these (QFs, etc.) throughout Japan. And we all consider this a digital public good.
        - We determined that the omission of the object because of its length was confusing.
        - Our pilots are well positioned to be disseminated QF across Japan and all democrats see QF as digital public goods.

> [@hal_sk](https://twitter.com/hal_sk/status/1648950775643766784?s=20): @nishio @0xtkgshn Thank you! May I reflect the current Scrapbox translation in the Youtube subtitles?
- > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1648961275312103424?s=20): @hal_sk @0xtkgshn You can use it as it is now, but I'm on the road and have received a suggestion to modify it in Google Docs. I'm on the road and can't reflect the changes yet, so I'd better reflect the changes before I tell you. I will declare the license of the translated text as CC0 later.
- Declare CC0!

- > (1) For the poem translation, I received permission from Yayoko Kondo, who has co-authored a book with Audrey, so I can use the following, which was published in the book "Let's talk about the 'future' no one has seen yet.
    - Since you have already provided feedback to the management, I will leave it to the management to decide which one to use when reflecting the subtitle.
- > (2) Interoperable coexistence → Interoperable copresence (mediator of joint thinking)
- >  # Copresence is a technical term in the field of cultural anthropology or informatics, so I would like to use it as it is.
    - Adopted, the contents of the parentheses are not easy to understand, so there is room for improvement.
    - Once we adopted the brackets, we decided not to use them because they were too confusing.
- > (3) Everyone's reflection and deliberation → Everyone's contemplation and deliberation
- >  # In the context of [[deliberation democracy]], the translation of deliberation is "deliberation"
    - Adopted.
- > (4) The Taiwanese government upholds broadband as a human right and
- >  → The Taiwanese government has upheld broadband as an inalienable part of human rights
- >  # Comment from star, the Japanese word "human rights" is a translation of the plural HUMAN RIGHTS.
- >  International human rights law defines human rights as an indivisible combination of several rights.
- >  So it is more accurate to translate the singular human right as "an indivisible part of human rights.
- >  Otherwise, there could be a misinterpretation that broadband = human rights.
- >  In fact, broadband is a human right.
    - Agreed with the assertion. I would phrase it as "making broadband an inalienable component of human rights."
- > (5) Verifiable Credentials and Distributed ID → VC (Verifiable Credentials) and DID (Distributed ID)
- >  # Since it is a technical term, it is rather easier to understand if you put VC, DID.
    - [[verifiable credentials]] (verifiable credentials, VC) and [[distributed identifiers]] (decentralized identifiers, DID)".
- > (6) Worldwide Web Consortium → World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
- >  # Because it's a technical term & proper noun.
    - I also thought, "Maybe that's what he meant." I thought it might mean that way, but I had not been able to back-trace it, so I left it alone. I'll adopt it.
    - If anyone knows of any specific collaborative press or other information, please let me know.
- > (7) Plurality -> Plurality (plurality)
- >  # In political science and cultural anthropology, Plurality = plurality, Pluralism = pluralism is the canonical translation, so I thought I should use it.
    - It's in the translation order, so I'll leave it up to management to decide what to do with the subtitles.
- > (8)
- >  and last, a collaborative river-based management platform.→ and LASS, a collaborative river-based management platform.
- >  Joint river management platform >> Joint river management platform LASS
- >  This is a correction after looking at the official MODA subtitle [https://youtu.be/fpbEbcHyxPg.](https://youtu.be/fpbEbcHyxPg.)
- >  "LASS" is a proper name for a public-private partnership platform for river basin management. The documentation is scarce, but the name appears in the following document by moda, p.22.

        - [[River Management Platform LASS]] I wrote a little more about it.
- > (9) as "MODA" or "motor", -> as "moda" or "mada (motor)",
- >  # It is easier to understand if you put Kanji characters here.
    - disagree

- > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1649041587308220418?s=20): correction: social impact bonds -> [[social impact bond]]

Initially, it was published on the Code for Japan channel [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyAJrRFRCiA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyAJrRFRCiA), but as the number of videos by Plurality Tokyo increased, we created the Pluraity Tokyo channel and moved it there. Pluraity Tokyo channel was created and moved there.
