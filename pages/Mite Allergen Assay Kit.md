My wife is trying to do something about ticks, but I don't know if it's worth doing unless I have a way to observe whether it's effective or not... I looked into it and found a way to measure the effectiveness by myself, so I decided to give it a try.

- The reason there are so many Roombas is that the dust collected by the Roomba from a large area was put into the inspection kit, so there would be a lot of dust. I did it to see what would happen if there were too much.
- Before I took the measurements, I thought, "Is the bed tick-proofing not enough?" "Is the cat tower the cause?" But when I looked at the measurement results, it was clear that the sofa was the problem.
- Reason for measuring the foot and head sides of the bed separately.
    - Dust mite sheets are placed on the foot side of the bed, but the effect may not extend to the head side, and [[dust mites]] feed on bits of epidermis, so they may breed in the open head and face area rather than the underclothed body.
    - → Rather more on the foot side as a result of the measurement.
        - Perhaps the overwhelming effect of "the futon does not cover you when you are not sleeping, so it is easier to dry".
        - Why are there so many sofas...
