OLD TITLE A person who is a total stranger
> [@rootport](https://twitter.com/rootport/status/1642584750098632704?s=20): Every time I see a tweet that says "I wish AI was regulated..." I say "Noooooooooooo! !" I'm not the only one who feels "I'm going to push for regulation. I'm going to force them to regulate it. Isn't it [[somebody else's problem]] all the way through?
> It's funny to see people play the good guy when they don't really want to regulate.

> [@rootport](https://twitter.com/rootport/status/1642694753820241922?s=20): you don't like it because it's "dirty" even if the learning is not legal? Then you can build a clean model. Don't have the knowledge or skills to build it? You can learn. Can't even learn? Then you can help those who are already trying to create such a clean model.
> There is a lot that can be done.

I used to recognize this kind of phenomenon as "lack of [[awareness of the parties concerned]]," but after reading [[Atlas shrugs]], I am more aware.
- They think they are [Beneficiaries of problem solving
    - In other words, there is a "sense of party".
- But not [[Actions to solve problems]] at all
    - Because I don't think I'm [[a problem-solving provider]].
- They assume that if they claim to have a problem, someone will do [[problem-solving services]] for them.
    - For toddlers, if they cry out about a problem, their parents will serve them.

    - [[Don't say, "Why isn't anyone doing it?" You're one of them.]]
