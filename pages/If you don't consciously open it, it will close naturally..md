title: "If you don't consciously open it, it will close naturally."

>  I feel that the way we fight in our 30s and 40s is distinctly different, and that if we don't actively try new things, contribute to others, and consciously open ourselves up in our 40s, we will naturally close down and become in a state of "reduced equilibrium".
>  It might be similar to the way your body deteriorates if you don't consciously do [[muscle training]] after 40.
