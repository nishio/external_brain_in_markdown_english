Duplicating knowledge from a book in your brain does not lead to value.
- Books and digital storage media are better at retaining information than the human brain
- Humans used to be better at retrieving information depending on the situation, but since the advent of search engines, computers have become better at this, and with the advent of LLM, it has become even more widespread.
- Verification is needed to determine if it can be applied to real-world situations and deliver value.
        - [[Proof that you can create value in a new world]]
    - What was once useful knowledge is not necessarily still useful knowledge today
        - [[Knowledge must be proven by deeds.]]
