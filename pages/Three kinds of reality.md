Pragmatism believes that truth is formed by experience and human contribution. The fragments "Pragmatism" and "What Pragmatism Means" describe the formation of new truths and the expansion of the scope of the search for God. Plain Streams of Pragmatism" defines truth as "that which can be well explained," and "Some Metaphysical Problems Pragmatically Considered" poses ways in which pragmatism can reconcile the conflict between rationalism and empiricism.

Nishio's fragment "The Present Dilemma in Philosophy" states that pragmatism defines truth in relation to experience, that it has an antinomian tendency, and that the arguments of materialism and theism become meaningless if nothing can be derived from future experience or action. These are consistent with the pragmatist perspective.

Pragmatism and Religion also states that pragmatism cannot deny the hypothesis that useful results arise from experience, and that religious history as a whole proves the value of the use of absolute existence. This is also consistent with the pragmatist perspective.

In light of the above, pragmatism forms truth through experience and human contribution, and considers that truth to be useful for ideas and life that function within experience. Pragmatism also expands the scope of the search for God and allows for the formation of new truths.

In "Pragmatism and Truth," "Pragmatism," and "The Experience Process and the Creation of Meaning" Study Group 4, the perspective is presented that truth is useful to ideas and life functioning within experience, and that "correctness is usefulness."

Pragmatism sees truth as formed by experience and human contribution. But does this not deny the universality of truth? And does the notion that truth grows mean that truth changes over time? These questions are important for a better understanding of pragmatism.

The fragment "PRAGMATISM" points out three types of reality that the new truth must take into account. In addition, in "What Pragmatism Means," he states that pragmatism broadens the search 囩 for God. These perspectives are important for a better understanding of pragmatism.

The "Plain Stream of Pragmatism" also states that truth is "that which can be well explained." This is consistent with the viewpoint that pragmatism holds that truth is shaped by experience and human contribution.

In "Some Metaphysical Problems Pragmatically Considered," questions are raised about how pragmatism reconciles the conflict between rationalism and empiricism, how the debate between materialism and theism should be resolved, how the conflict between free will and determinism questions are raised: how should the debate between materialism and theism be resolved, and how should the conflict between free will and determinism be resolved?

In "Pragmatism and Truth," truth is considered to be an idea operating within experience, not a "congruence" with facts. This is consistent with the pragmatist perspective that truth is formed by experience and human contribution.

Pragmatism states that truth is that which is useful to life. This is consistent with pragmatism's viewpoint that truth is shaped by experience and human contribution.

The "Experience Process and the Creation of Meaning" Study Group 4 presents the pragmatist perspective that "correctness is usefulness." This is consistent with the pragmatist perspective that truth is shaped by experience and human contribution.

In PRAGMATISM, there are three types of reality that the new truth must take into account. Completely independent realities are hard to find. Human contributions are everywhere and make up what is given.

### Relation to Fragment
.

Nishio's fragment "Pluralistic Pragmatism" is directly related to my research. It emphasizes the pragmatist perspective that truth is nurtured within all finite experience. This relates to the human contribution and formation of truth that my research emphasizes.

### Opinions, deep thoughts, questions

From a pragmatist perspective, truth is formed by experience and human contribution. But does this not deny the universality of truth? And does the notion that truth grows mean that truth changes over time? These questions are important for a better understanding of pragmatism.
