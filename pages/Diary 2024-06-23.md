> [rrr_kgknk](https://x.com/rrr_kgknk/status/1804486172368093525) The source code published on Mr. Anno's github is just as usable in any automated ticket management operation, and the quality has been proven in the "production operation" of elections. It is proven in the "real work" of elections, and I was amused. Even if Mr. Anno is not elected, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government should use this asset to promote DX. It's too good.

> [rrr_kgknk](https://x.com/rrr_kgknk/status/1804488299245154682) Anno, even if he is not elected, "Elections can be made so sophisticated. All the assets are still in github. The effectiveness has been proven by running for office", and this example will drive many actions in the future. The campaign itself is already generating assets, and the future is already in the making. It is truly wonderful.
> [J_kaliy](https://x.com/J_kaliy/status/1804520905625731572) If the governor has an eye for talent, I think it is possible that he could appoint Mr. Anno to join the TMG, but it may be one test to see if he is the right person to do so.
> [rrr_kgknk](https://x.com/rrr_kgknk/status/1804521254424388084) To be honest, I think that local government will make great progress just by having two technologist lieutenant governors, Mr. Miyasaka and Mr. Anno. I think such a future is possible.
> [J_kaliy](https://x.com/J_kaliy/status/1804524100225806848) TV is still the head of the Showa election, but times are changing.


> [regista13](https://x.com/regista13/status/1804158479407681857) I think you're right to point out that Ms. Anno's manifesto is for highly educated intellectuals, but the fact that there is now a candidate that that demographic is willing to vote for in a sane manner is in itself But the fact that there is a candidate that these people are willing to vote for is very significant. In the end, people can only do what they have experienced firsthand, and if you try to broaden the scope, it will be counterproductive and false.
>  Even if it is impossible to get the people of Tokyo broadly involved this time, if we get a good number of votes along these lines, something a little different should happen in the next election. After all, this kind of thing has to be a basic long-term battle...


I have some time in Ginza today, so I was going to take the rest of the posters and see how they look and decide whether to put them up there or around my house, but Ginza is already perfectly put up, so I'll put them up around my house.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1804697070583836679) When I was putting up a poster for Mr. Anno, an old lady I didn't know called out to me in support, and I was so relieved to hear that analog is good too. That said, there are some things that can be made better with digital assistance, such as passing on posters and sharing the location and status of signs, and it's expensive for new candidates to make them from scratch, so I guess OSS is the way to go.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1804702623653941662) I was physically convinced that the posters are put up by humans, something that is obvious when put into words.




> [amachang](https://x.com/amachang/status/1804563198408061039) I saw nishio's post and thought that [[BERTopic]] looks interesting. I think BERTopic has more Y than XY problem, so it would be great if it could be embedded in a multi-modal space with X.

> [techtalkjp](https://x.com/techtalkjp/status/1804695227778683281) I think it's super hard to name the [[Talk to the City]] cluster, how do you do it?
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1804699119446897121) GPT4o is working on it.
> [techtalkjp](https://x.com/techtalkjp/status/1804704150363820196) Oh, I just saw the prompt. I see.
>  I did the same elsewhere to make the topic more detailed, but it doesn't become MECE if you > make it more than about 30 clusters.
>  Like the "Education and Human Resource Development" and the "Education Subsidies" topic in this Metropolitan Council one. Huh? I'd be like.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1804704897277071406) label, not only does it not become a MECE, but there can be multiple clusters with the same name!
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1804706046411415760) When clusters with the same name are created, I manually throw them to GPT and tell it to name each one differently, etc. For cases where I want to make it MECE, I'd have TTTC create a bottom-up I think I'll have to visualize the clusters, make a MECE classification by human observation, and then have LLM reassign the clusters to the MECE classification...

1:00 p.m.
- sleepy
- I wake up at seven o'clock.
- That's what happened yesterday.
- Should go to bed before the date changes to ensure a good night's sleep.


> [annotakahiro24](https://x.com/annotakahiro24/status/1804797095087624686) I am currently making a street speech at the east exit of Ikebukuro station and this is the largest crowd I have ever had!
>  I feel that the attention to Takahiro Yasuno is increasing day by day.
>  More and more people are posting photos and videos on social networking sites!

What to do next week
Gathering information from Google Spreadsheet
Export from Polis

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1804882824656503082) I keep waking up 2-3 hours earlier than usual and my bedtime hasn't changed, so I'm sleep deprived, I'm going to bed early today.
