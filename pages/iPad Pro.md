    - I saw this and decided to buy it because I'll be using paper documents more often in the future, and I'm scheduled to redact to PDF for proofreading for [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]].
- 12.9-inch iPad Pro
    - I tried iPads in the past and ended up buying the biggest one because the biggest reason I'm using paper notebooks now is "lack of size".
    - Less than 1000 book cutting scans are 80GB, so we decided 256GB was enough.
- I didn't buy the keyboard.

    - This article said to try it without for now.
- Where [[Apple Pencil]] is stored
    - At first, I put it in my notebook with a ballpoint pen, but it's weird to take out my notebook every time I use my iPad, so I ordered a case that can hold my iPad and Apple Pencil together.

        - [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2mM0VWK)
        - I've been using it for almost 4 months since I received it and it's great, I don't lose my pens and I can pull it out when I need it.
        - Maybe not for someone who cares about weight or size.
- Apple pencil charging
    - A 15-second charge lasts for 30 minutes, so after one pomodoro work, you can take a break while charging.
    - To check remaining charge level, [add widget](http://sumaoji.com/apple-pencil-battery-zanryou-10984)
- Compared to paper notepads
    - I used to take only black notes on the road because I didn't want to bring pens of many colors with me, but now I can express information using colors on the road.
    - Able to copy and paste drawn diagrams
        - It is now easier to draw time changes; you can write one, copy and paste it, and rewrite the parts that change.
    - Unlike a ballpoint pen, it can undo
- Suddenly the pen became grainy.
    - I've tried recharging, unpairing and starting over, but it doesn't work.
    - The nib part was screwed on, and that had come loose in the course of use.
- I use [[Notability]] as my note-taking app.
        - I saw [[Jun Kuikei]] using it at work and imitated him.

- Three years later, I'm now using a fifth-generation iPad Pro 12.9-inch
- I continue to use Notability.
