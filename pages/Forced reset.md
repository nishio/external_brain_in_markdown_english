    - Forced resetting of [[everyday]] lifestyle habits
- What comes to mind then is the essential [[values]] that are not suppressed by everyday stimuli.
    - [[travel]] or [[immersing oneself]] in a game.
    - [[digital detox]]
    - Religious customs such as [[Ramadan (9th month of the Muslim calendar)]] may also be such.
