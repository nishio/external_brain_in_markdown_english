> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1569637349243625472?s=21&t=dDnBm_U2ClhBaRvyhytVyg): Some people seem to think it's "[[sincere]]" to do something you think is "dull" or "unwilling" but you "sincerely want to do it" [[pretend]], but I think it's "[[untruthfulness]]". I think it is "[[untruthfulness]]" that some people seem to think that "pretending" is "[[sincere]]".
