- Collective Knowledge Mechanisms and Markets for Public Goods
    - Griff's goal: to create a market for public goods through collective knowledge mechanisms.
    - existing mechanism
        - [[Tithing]]: simple, but no feedback mechanism or enforcement
            - [[tax]] (Taxes): funds public goods, but top-down resource allocation
            - [[voting]] (Voting): means of signal aggregation, but needs UX improvement
            - [[(the) market (as a concept)]] (Markets): suitable for capital allocation for private goods, but not for financing public goods
    - Web-Based Mechanisms
        - Secondary Funding ([[Quadratic Funding]]): more funding for democratically supported projects
        - Conviction Voting: A minority opinion can be proposed, and with time, it can be passed.
        - Retroactive Public Goods Funding: Rewards projects that have provided value in the past

- New mechanisms and funding sources (Web-Based Category)
    - [[NFT]]: a major source of funding for public goods
        - NFT Art creates scarcity and enables artists to fund the creation of public goods
        - [[network resources]] ([[Network Goods]]): The more they are consumed, the more valuable they become.
        - Open source software, for example, falls into this category.
        - [[effective altruism]] ([[Effective Altruism]]): rank the influence of causes and donate to the most influential causes
        - However, it has the drawback that its influence is difficult to quantify
    - [[HyperCerts]]: NFTing influence
        - Create a three-party market consisting of influence evaluators, influence issuers, and hypercert purchasers.

- Other mechanisms
    - Augmented Bonding Curve: The curve is a curve that is used for bonding the bonding of the bonded material.
        - Enables single-sided markets and volatility financing for public goods
    - Dominance Assurance Contracts ([[Dominance Assurance Contracts]]):.
        - Incentives for proposers to organize and benefit from funding
    - Donation Mining ([[Donation Mining]]):.
        - Reward donors to encourage giving
    - Budget Box ([[Budget Box]]):.
        - Evaluate proposals [[pairwise]] and determine budget allocation
    - Futurism ([[Futurarchy]]):.
        - Vote and be rewarded based on the impact of your proposal
    - Stigmergy ([[Stigmergy]]):.
        - Indirect coordination mechanism. Can be applied to quadratic financing, etc.
    - Praise: Allocate tokens based on praise from peers
    - [[Demurrage]]: A mechanism by which the value of a currency decreases over time. Used to facilitate the circulation of currencies.
    - Proposal Inverter/Milestones: a mechanism to fund proposals. Multiple DAOs or individuals can fund the same proposal. Funds are released based on milestones.
    - Prop.house: a funding mechanism for Nounish DAOs. The community makes a proposal and the token holders vote.
    - [[Quadratic Voting]]: A voting method in which a voter receives the number of votes obtained by squaring the number of voting credits he or she has. Minority opinions are also taken into account.
    - [[Joke Race]]: a mechanism whereby the community proposes jokes and the redundancies voted on are funded.


- Decentralized Identity and Web3Social
    - Opportunities: Discussed opportunities for [[mechanism design]] in [[Web3 space]].
    - Holographic Consensus: a mechanism proposed by the DAO stack. Token holders place bets based on the likelihood that their proposal will be approved by the DAO.
    - Skeuomorphism: mimicking the design of old media in new media. Discusses the importance of non-skeuomorphic mechanisms.
    - [[Sortition]]: A mechanism to randomly select political representatives from a pool of candidates.
    - Aqueduct: a system for distributing funds among different public goods crowdfunding mechanisms.
    - Ranked Choice Voting: A method of voting in which candidates are ranked. The lowest-ranked candidate is eliminated and the votes are redistributed.
    - [[Staking]]/[[Slashing]]: A mechanism to confiscate (slash) staked tokens to ensure compliance with protocol rules.
    - [Proof of Work: A mechanism that performs computational work to prove a contribution to the network.
    - [[Sybil Resistance]]/Identity: A decentralized identity system to prevent Sybil attacks (attacks where one person creates multiple identities).
        - Decentralized Identity: Enabling One Human One Boat, Avoiding Plutocracy
            - Building a circle of trust by accumulating a positive reputation
    - [[Web3 Social]] & [[The Regen Space]]: on the potential of the Web3 social platform and the creation of a regenerative economic zone.
        - Web3Social: Shifting attention to Web3Social enables innovation in mechanisms
            - Give individuals ownership of the social graph and increase interface forkability

- Possibility of better collective knowledge and regen web 3
    - Better collective knowledge leads to better commons resource allocation
        - Can be achieved by improving current mechanisms and introducing new mechanisms
    - RegenWeb 3 could be a huge $25 trillion market
        - More effective use of funds that are being spent inefficiently by government and non-profit organizations
        - Renewable projects are likely to win in the long run
