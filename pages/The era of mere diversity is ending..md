>  From [[diversity]] to [heterogeneity
>  Suzuki ... For example, I am personally interested in initiatives such as [[RadicalxChange]], which is being promoted by [[Glenn Weil]], the author of "[[radical market]]" and others,
- [[Radical Markets]], [[E. Glen Weyl]]
>  The concept of "[[Plurality]]" that he and [[Audrey Tan]] are advocating is beginning to attract attention in Japan, and the recent "[[Plurality Tokyo]]" was filled with great enthusiasm. What do you think about this movement?

>  Takeup: The era of mere diversity is ending. When we talk about diversity, we tend to talk about [[inclusion]], but if you look at Germany and other countries, the concept of heterogeneity, which considers [[coexistence with beings with differences]] that can no longer be easily [[included]], is attracting more attention. How do we build relationships with people who have clear differences? Germany's acceptance of a lot of [[immigration]] may be an investment in heterogeneity, in a way.

>  Suzuki Germany used to thoroughly educate its immigrant population in the German language and strive for inclusion, didn't it?

>  Takeup I think we have come to the conclusion that it is not possible by itself. How do we relate to the unresolvable heterogeneity that is never compatible with each other? That is why the design and know-how to maintain the community become so important.

>  Suzuki ... I think it is connected to the question "How is it possible to live in a complex world in a complex way? It might be connected to the kind of world envisioned by Plurality, although the terminology is different.
