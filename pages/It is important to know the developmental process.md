- It is important to know the [[developmental process]] of the concept
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I wonder what I saw the line "I don't know...
- for some reason
        - [[Taking the top of the pyramid is not what I expected.]]
    - If you only input completed concepts, they will float in the air and not become knowledge that can be applied.
            - [[Knowledge of Rootless Grass]]
- On the other hand, looking at things in chronological order in that order doesn't tell you where you'll end up.
    - Anxious to walk without knowing the goal
- What should we do?
- With books and such, the man-hours are spent on devising the sequence.
    - But it's [[Killing Chaos]] at some point, and then it's chopped up and laid out.
    - New growth sprouts even as you are writing, but because you have decided on the structure ahead of time, it grows crippled.
- The reason why the approach of doing a book in Scrapbox is not very fruitful when Scrapbox is useful as a means of expressing knowledge is that [[Scrapbox is a living chaos]] and a book is dead chaos, so the process of making it book-like kills the goodness of Scrapbox. Scrapbox is a living chaos, and books are dead chaos.
    - Instead of creating books, we must create "features that are beneficial to readers that books have and Scrapbox does not" while taking advantage of Scrapbox's strengths.
        - What exactly is that?
                - [[unidimensionalization]] Right, readers say, "I don't know where to start reading."

for now
