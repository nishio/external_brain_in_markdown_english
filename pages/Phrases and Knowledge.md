title: "Phrases and Knowledge"

In some cases, the current GPT-4s may be able to speak Japanese as a superficial phrase, but do not have the knowledge that Japanese people normally have.
So we need to test whether we are acquiring [[knowledge]] instead of [[expression]].
For [[Japanese-language-based LLM]] to be beneficial to the Japanese, it is necessary to acquire knowledge that is beneficial to the Japanese.

With the current GPT-4, it would look like this
- > Model: GPT-4
- > What is a manor?
- > A "manor" is a local economic unit that was the center of a large agricultural economic system in medieval Europe. It developed mainly in Western Europe during the Feudalism (feudalism) era, and was ruled by the lord of the manor (often a nobleman or a church) and worked by peasants and slaves....
Although the superficial phrases are fluently spoken in Japanese, the meaning of the word "manor" is not connected to "Japanese manor". The word "manor" is a word that has a similar meaning to "manor".
