> [supremeeigo](https://x.com/supremeeigo/status/1811916499222954306) Many people say, "Well, how do other countries do it?" But in the first place (in U.S.-based companies), all "initiating" and "deciding" are the work of upper management, The field staff "just do what they are ordered to do".

>  In Japan, the field staff is responsible for coming up with ideas, so the field staff is excellent and the higher up you go, the less time you have, but in the U.S., the upper management is responsible for coming up with ideas, so the higher up you go, the harder the work is.

> [SteveStove](https://x.com/SteveStove/status/1811751100006940965) I can understand the nuance of cultural anthropological, but it seems a bit off. This collection of papers seems to be in the field of management, and the content of the papers reads as suggesting a managerial rationale.

> [supremeeigo](https://x.com/supremeeigo/status/1811751948946932164) I see your point about this paper.

>  On the other hand, ringi has been the subject of many more cultural anthropological studies and books
>
>  The Culture Map, a bestseller around the world, also has a small section on Japan, and it is about ringi!
