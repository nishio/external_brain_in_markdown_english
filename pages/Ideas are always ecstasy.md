Ideas are always ecstasy


ChatGPT
- When [[Heidegger]] uses the concept of "[[ecstasy]] (Ekstasis)," it is an important term that expresses the core of his philosophy on the nature of being and temporality. Ekstasis" means the Greek word** "to stand outside," and Heidegger connects it primarily to the temporality** of the human being ([[immanence]], [[Dasein]]) and the way of being.

The following is a brief description.

1. ectasis and temporality
In Heidegger's Being and Time, time is viewed not merely as a linear flow, but as an interrelationship between past, present, and future. This temporality he calls "[[ecstatic temporality]]".

Past (Gewesenheit): facing one's existence as "past". The past is not fixed, but is continually reinterpreted from the future.
Present (Gegenwart): The present is not merely "now," but a place that is open to the future through actions and choices.
Future (Zukunft): the projection of the present being toward the possibility of the self, welcoming "that which has not yet arrived.
→ These three temporal dimensions do not exist independently of each other, but rather influence each other and appear simultaneously.

For Heidegger, this structure of time is the very nature of ecstasy, in which the present being always "stands outside of itself" and acts in the present, taking on the past while facing the future.

2. ekstasis of existence
Heidegger believed that man (present existence) can always be viewed as **"being beyond self "**. In other words, man is not a self-contained being, but exists as he explores his possibilities for the future and is influenced by the past.
Ekstasis" indicates that existence is always open to the outside, without confining itself. This openness is important in Heidegger's ontology.
3. ekstasis in the existential sense
In Heidegger's philosophy, the present existence is always projected toward the possibility of the self (the future), but at the same time it must also face the extreme possibility of death.
In this way, the present being relates to the "world" beyond the self and discovers the significance of the self within it.
Ecstasis is not just a structure of time, but is also tied to existential questions about how humans understand their own existence and relate to others and the world.
Conclusion.
In Heidegger, "ecstasis" is a concept that describes a way of being in which the present being always exceeds itself and takes on its own past and present while facing the world and the future. It is used especially in the structure of temporality to describe the dynamic process by which the past, present, and future interact with each other to make up the present existence. In this way, Heidegger understands the essence of human existence not as something fixed, but as something open and dynamic.
