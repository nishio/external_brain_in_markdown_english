> "If you want to go fast, go alone; but if you want to go far, go together."
- It is considered an African proverb.
- Whether it is really an African proverb was debated [src: NPR [https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/07/30/487925796/it-takes-a-village-to-determine-](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/07/30/487925796/it-takes-a-village-to-determine-) the-origins-of-an-african-proverb]
    - Conclusion: well-known African phrase, but not tied to a specific speaker
    - Cory Booker's 2016 statement made famous
    - Already mentioned in Hillary Clinton's 1996 book It Takes a Village
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The Japanese equivalent would be "the nail that sticks out gets hammered in," an oft-used but unauthored phrase.

- African (Luo) proverb
        - [[Young people can run faster if they are alone. Older people are slower, but can go farther.]]
        - Meaning that old people can't run as fast as young people, but they have the knowledge to help them go farther.
        - Taking a young man with no knowledge and slow legs is not beneficial to "go far".
        - The phrase, "If you want to go far, you must all go together," leaves that ambiguous.

It could be interpreted that if you're looking for short-term efficiency, you should do it alone.
- > Down to Gehenna, or up to the Throne, He travels the fastest who travels alone. --- [[Rudyard Kipling]]
    - Whether you go down to [[Gehenna]] or up to the throne, [[he who travels alone travels the fastest]].
    - [[Originality first before co-creation]]
    - [[The first person to move is the one who moves alone.]]
        - [[first penguin]]
    - [[flood of tsunamis]]

Note that "If you want to go far, go together" when interpreted literally does not say "If you go together, you will go far."

Nor did I say that "everyone" would get far if we all went together.
- If one person sets out with the maximum amount of food he can carry and kills half of the food when it is half consumed, he can get farther than if he goes with all of them (black).
    - What is the most efficient way to kill?
    - It is preferable to kill labor that is no longer needed as soon as possible.
    - If you start with N people with N food, you should kill one at the time you consume 1 in total.
    - [[Mathematical consideration of what conditions will "go far if we all go together" when they are met.]]
