The idea of [[0→1]] suggests that the transition from nothing to something is not a uniform process. The "1" in this context represents a new idea or creation, and it can differ significantly depending on the individual. Each person's perception and interpretation of what constitutes a "1" can vary, leading to diverse outcomes and innovations.

This concept is further explored in the series [[二人が違うことを言う絵のシリーズ]], which illustrates how two people can express different viewpoints or ideas, emphasizing the subjective nature of creation and understanding.
