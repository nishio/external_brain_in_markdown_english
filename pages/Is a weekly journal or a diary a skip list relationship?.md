title: "Is a weekly journal or a diary a skip list relationship?"
---

- Are [[weekly journal]] and [[diary]] related to [[skip list]]?
- The diary creates the value of "a pinned page that always exists 'where you can write anything you want without having to decide on a title'".
    - If it's too busy to flow empty, it creates a sense of guilt.
        - It's an incentive to write something, even if it's just one line while you remember.
            - Even if you're busy, you could at least find the time to write a line of argument.
            - What is lacking is not time, but mental space.
        - Ultimately, even if you leave a blank space, you can consider it as a record that "I was so busy that I didn't have time to write a diary on this day.
- Weekly journal is written in retrospect.
    - Do you look back and write in a way that makes it easier for your future self to look back?
    - Keywords become links to connect the daily fine pages?
        - They may not be that diligent in maintenance.
    - The date is written in the title, so if you need it, you can read the diary for that date.
        - Structured enough to be traced when needed.
