[[DeSci Tokyo]] is a volunteer organization dedicated to pushing the boundaries of human knowledge as an incubator of [[DeSci]] ([[distributed science]]) in Japan. 2023 hosted three social meetups and authored several articles, including a scholarly paper, and is currently working on a new project, [[DeSci Tokyo]], which will be launched in 2023.

In 2024, we plan to focus on both incubation and DeSci practices. In collaboration with [[Funding the Commons]], we plan to hold a large DeSci conference in Tokyo and conduct funding experiments in Japan. We have built a QF funding system for public goods, including open science projects.

DeSci Tokyo's main goal is to experiment with a funding system based on different financial resources than industry or charitable organizations. We are currently focusing on building a funding system using QF and expect to have a demo in July and deploy by the end of 2024.

Funds will be used to develop a QF-based funding system in Japan and for related costs, and will be used to encourage DeSci stakeholders and philanthropists to use this funding system to raise endowment funds.
