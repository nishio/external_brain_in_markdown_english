(DeepL) We present [[TrustDavis]], an [[online reputation system]] that provides insurance against fraudulent transactions by exploiting existing relationships between players, such as those that exist in social networks. TrustDavis and simple strategies allow players to set limits on losses caused by collusion between malicious players. Furthermore, TrustDavis encourages participants to accurately assess each other, resists participant [[pseudonym changes]], and is decentralized in nature.
