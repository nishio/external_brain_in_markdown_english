I finally got to do one [[full squat]] a while ago without touching anything.
- A full squat here means
    - Spread your feet shoulder-width apart.
    - Knees no further than the toes
    - Arms folded in front of you
    - Keep your heels on the ground.
    - Lower your hips to the bottom.
- Contrary to my initial image, it was not leg strength that caused my inability to squat.
    - Range of motion of the hip joint
    - Ankle range of motion
