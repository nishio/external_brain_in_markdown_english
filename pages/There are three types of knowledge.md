title: "There are three types of knowledge"

from [[Isn't membership-based employment necessary to accumulate knowledge and social relationships? #65cdc20daff09e00003a361b]]
- There are three types of "[[knowledge]]"
    - A: Unlanguageable
    - B: Can be verbalized but not yet verbalized due to lack of ability or time
    - C: Linguisticized
- C can be stored in the company, detached from humans.
    - A, on the contrary, cannot be accumulated in isolation from humans.
        - (At least until craftsmanship-mimicking AI is put to practical use.)
    - So the only thing we can control is B
        - B changes to C with sufficient capacity and time, but individual inventory increases depending on workload and other factors.
        - Language is encouraged by asking questions to those who are carrying B inventory.
            - Conversations are conducted through an online text communication tool that automatically saves the exchange as a C
            - This is one of the customer values that groupware offers
