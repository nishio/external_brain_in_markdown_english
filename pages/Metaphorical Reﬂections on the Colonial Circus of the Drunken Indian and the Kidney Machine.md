- Objective.
    - A practitioner from a Canadian Indigenous community explains the significance of academic dissemination of her experience and wisdom. Sharing and reflecting on the historical trauma of colonialism and the stories of resilience that have been cultivated through it is essential for true reconciliation.

- key metaphor
    - The Drunken Indian and the Kidney Dialysis Machine.
        - Through the ethical dilemmas surrounding alcoholism and the scarcity of medical resources, he critiques the pathological labels and institutional discrimination attached to indigenous peoples.
            - [[Which Native American issue is good?]]
    - The Mobile Circus.
        - Drawing on the author's own carnival experiences, he describes the history of indigenous peoples as spectacle and exploitation targets of the colonial regime.

- theoretical background
    - Emphasizes the role of "stories" in identity formation and healing, centered on cultural psychology (Geertz, Bruner).
    - Drawing on Duran's theory of "soul wounds," he interprets alcohol as an act of "spirit" that fills an inner void.
    - He draws on Gall's systems theory to criticize colonial institutions, such as Indian law, as "monstrous systems that cannot be stopped.
- Historical and Social Issues
    - Citing the definition of the Convention on Genocide (Lemkin), he positioned Canada's assimilation policies and forced migration of children (e.g., Residential Schools) as cultural genocide.
    - He pointed out that "drunken" stereotypes have been reproduced in national policy, academia, and the media, preventing indigenous peoples from self-healing.
- Approach to Recovery
    - Narrative sharing and the revival of traditional storytelling are key to connecting individual trauma and healing for the whole community.
    - FASD, domestic violence, suicide, and other issues that are linked through generations require "wise practices" based on cultural values (e.g., teachings of the Seven Patriarchs).
    - It is important to return to an inverted pyramid (spirituality → self-actualization → basic needs) value system and nurture the child as a complete being from birth.
- Conclusion.
To break the colonial cycle, we need to rebuild institutional, academic, and social frameworks that center on the stories told by indigenous peoples themselves. Canada's future 50 years will depend on whether we can play out that "greatest show" (reconciliation).

Duran's "Soul Wound" Theory
- core concept
    - Calling the historical and intergenerational trauma accumulated in Native Americans "soul wounds," he explained that violence such as colonialism, genocide, and boarding school policies leave scars on a mental "spiritual" level, which are reproduced from generation to generation.
- Clinical Implications
    - He treats "symptoms" such as alcohol abuse and suicide as community unresolved trauma rather than individual pathology, and places story-sharing, ritual, and relationship repair at the center of healing. He advocates "trauma-informed" care that integrates cultural practices as well as Western-style counseling.

2.Gall's Systemantics
- Basic Viewpoint
    - A collection of rules of thumb presented by pediatrician and systems researcher John Gall: "Systems are inherently prone to failure. A typical example is Gall's Law: "A complex system will not work well if it is made complex from the start. Make it work as a simple system first, and then develop it from there.
- implication
    - It is the structural fate of complex organizations, such as bureaucracies and huge IT systems, to have unexpected side effects, and even top-down "perfect grand plans" tend to collapse. Instead, we recommend the following operational principles: (1) Build small and test, (2) Evolve based on feedback from the field, and (3) Assume failure and provide redundancy. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemantics?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

3. definition of Genocide Convention (derived from Lemkin)
- background
    - Polish-Jewish jurist Raphael Lemkin coined the term genocide in 1944 and led its legalization at the United Nations.
- Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, 1948, Art.
    - Any of the following acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.
        1. killing
        2. infliction of serious physical and emotional harm
        3. the imposition of living conditions aimed at the total or partial destruction of the group
        4. birth control measures
        5. forcible transfer of children
    - -defines them as crimes and imposes on States Parties the obligation to prevent and punish them. ([UN](https://www.un.org/en/genocide-prevention/definition?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
