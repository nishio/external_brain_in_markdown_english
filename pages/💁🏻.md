On Scrapbox, you can create custom emoji like <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT-4/icon' alt='GPT-4.icon' height="19.5"/>, but not on Twitter, so I thought of something like that instead, and this is what I came up with.

First, it is clear that AI will increase the productivity of "solutions" for "AI users". But if the quantity of "problems" is limited, the price of "solutions" will be lower. [[Separate "jobs" in "AI takes jobs" into "problems" and "solutions."]]

Because even if the "solution" becomes easier, no one will say, "I'll file my taxes twice because it's twice as easy." Since the demand for the problem does not increase, the price of the solution goes down.

When these conditions are met, the phenomenon of AI taking jobs will occur. Impact of #AI

Software engineers will probably be in a position to increase productivity. The situation is mixed depending on the type of business, but the situation will be better for the time being because "the problems to be solved outweigh the productivity of the solution" in the field where there are not enough resources for engineers. #Software Engineer

In the long run, it may make it harder for new companies to enter the market if the software vendors they already have contracts with start offering customization for their customers at a lower cost.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1644167461405888512) 游누游낕The expression "AI takes jobs" may actually be a misunderstanding caused by the low resolution of jobs. If jobs are divided into "problems" and "solutions," the phenomenon of AI increasing the productivity of "solutions" will cause prices to fall. But only if the demand for the problem does not increase. #AI #job resolution

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1644167463062618112) 游누游낕 fleshing out the concept of work can help us understand how AI will change the way we work and what impact it will have. ai will not take away jobs. Rather, it can streamline the problem-solving process and lower prices. #AI's impact on #JobToBeDone

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1644167464698384386) 游누游낕The evolution of AI will change how we perceive and carry out our work. ai can help us solve more problems more efficiently. Let's work toward the future. And it's important to understand and adapt to the changes AI will bring. #AI's future #efficiency
