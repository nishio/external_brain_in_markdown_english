>  @shinjirokoiz, heard about and decided to join the party.  Too much to fit here, but I can report that I have never felt so much present at a moment in history as that exchange.

> [glenweyl](https://x.com/glenweyl/status/1816952729773965658) More than anyone, my gratitude is to
>  @kensuzuki
>  , who truly made this all possible in ways ranging from having pioneered and foreseen the ideas of ⿻ with his work on Nameraka society ([/nishio-en/Smooth Society and Its Enemies](https://scrapbox.io/nishio-en/Smooth Society and Its Enemies)), to financially supporting the trip, making connection etc.

> [glenweyl](https://x.com/glenweyl/status/1816952731506213046) I truly believe that in a year or two, Japan will be the global symbol of ⿻ at least as much as Taiwan and

>  -san will be the pioneer at least as much as
>  @audreyt
>  and myself. long live ⿻, smooth Japan, a beacon to the world!

>  Yesterday, I had the opportunity to exchange views with Mr. Glenn Weil (Microsoft Chief Scientist, economist) who is visiting Japan to attend an event held at the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation.
>  Although it was our first meeting, the topic of conversation expanded to democracy, digital, elections, constitution, etc., and we found ourselves exceeding our scheduled time. We had a lot of fun, especially about [[constitutional amendment]] and [[referendum]].
>  Mr. Weil also said that he is a fan of Miraikan, and the curator, Mr. Miyahara, is in charge of the highly acclaimed project.
>  Mr. Miyahara told me that he was able to realize his project with the supplementary budget, and as a member of the Diet, I was happy that the budget was used for something that would be appreciated.
>  I would like to visit Miraikan again as I am sure my children will enjoy it.
