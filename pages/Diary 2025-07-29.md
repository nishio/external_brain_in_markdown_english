- [[What happened with the "new section on Advancing the Human Rights Situation?"]]
> [mattn_jp](https://x.com/mattn_jp/status/1949869307757809772) I've been pouring over the huge issue on the Team Mirai thing. To be honest, I have the impression that it is just "like a discussion" from the middle of the issue. I felt that it would be better to have a separate discussion forum so that we can properly consider just the main topic. I just want to understand the process of decisions being made, but to be forced to read about "said or not said" is honestly painful.
- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1950031239726936225) The decision-making process is described here, and it's not the supposed use of the PR comments section that's getting so excited!

> [gachacomplete](https://x.com/gachacomplete/status/1949870274402275786) I honestly think that in a place like that, the moderators should delete off-topic remarks with a bang. An issue with 90% off-topic remarks is not something a regular person can read.
- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1950035961666023517) Officially, "Let's discuss in the comments section of GitHub PRs!" I don't think it is possible to have human moderators in case there will be a discussion where there is not supposed to be a discussion.

Comments that Mr. Hoshi asked me to write.

- I only wrote about this one case.


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1950052398853914831) "The comment section of Team Mirai's GitHub PR was open to anyone" is true, but an additional fact is that Team Mirai "did not say, 'Let's discuss here Team Mirai didn't say "Let's discuss here" and "We didn't say we would decide whether to adopt it or not in the discussion here". There is a widespread misunderstanding.
- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1950053565076029506) Also, calling the PR comments section an "internal Team Mirai discussion" is simply misinformation, and I don't know who the user is that has Yasuno's picture as an icon. It is a source of confusion and I hope it will stop.
    - > [mattn_jp](https://x.com/mattn_jp/status/1950061121051701530) I was confused for about 10 minutes too > icons
- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1950055443578950070) As an engineer, I personally think that even if the management didn't tell you to discuss in the comment section of PR, if you were ready to discuss, you are free to do so. I personally think as an engineer. On the other hand, I don't think it is necessary for the management to read and incorporate the content.


Lately (but 2 days), I've been going around the [[Pokemon Go]] Dymax power spots around [[LUUP]] from 8pm to 9pm after dinner (they close at 9pm, it's too hot during the day to want to move around).
- It's a bicycle, so it's not as strenuous as running, but it makes you work up a good sweat.
- If it's too hot outside and you're stuck in a cool house, you'll gain weight from lack of exercise.
- Well, I think it's the [[maple syrup]] that's making me fat...
