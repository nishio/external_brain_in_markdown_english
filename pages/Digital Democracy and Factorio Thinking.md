- [[digital democracy]] and [[Factorio]]-like thinking
Abstract: The huge variety of opinion data handled in digital democracy (e.g., deliberation using Pol.is) is viewed as "resources and production lines" in a Factorio-type game.

Commentary:
- In the Factorio-type game, it is essential to efficiently process, transform, and combine various raw materials (opinions) to create a product (policy or policy).
- Digital democracy tools take a wide variety of citizen voices (= resources) and summarize, branch, and integrate them (= production line) to arrive at more satisfactory policy decisions (= finished product).
- In other words, the abstract process of "political decision making" could be modeled as a Factorio-like production process. We can improve the deliberative process with the metaphor of bottleneck analysis and inventory control, in other words, we can get a "line optimization of democracy" idea.
