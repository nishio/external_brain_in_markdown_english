The paramount rule for all actions and statements is "An ounce of wisdom is worth more than tons of smarts." The higher the position, the more this rule must be followed.
This method may be less applauded, but it is the only sure way. A reputation for wisdom is the final victory in the battle for prestige. [[Satisfying the wise is enough.]] because their judgment is the true touchstone of success.

It means in everything. The first and best rule of all action and speech, and the one we need to follow the higher and higher our posts become, is that "an ounce of wisdom is worth more than tons of smarts." An ounce of wisdom is worth more than tons of smarts. It may not get as much applause, but it is the only sure way. The reputation of wisdom is the final triumph of fame. It is enough to satisfy the wise man, for his judgment is the true touchstone of success.
