The phenomenon of "missing signs when you are busy" is certainly an interesting point. This occurs because of [[cognitive resource limitations]], and in [[busy]] situations, [[attention]] may be dispersed and [[important signs]] may not be caught. One way to address this issue is to [[reduce one's cognitive load]] through appropriate [[time management]], [[stress management]], or [[outside assistance]] (tools or team). Consciously creating a "[[leeway]]" and having the [[leeway to miss signs]] may be important in maintaining [[the ability to recognize opportunities]].
