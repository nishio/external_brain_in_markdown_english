title: "Good to know about where Kozaneba is going next."
---

summary
- question
    - There are three possible next directions for Kozaneba
        - Touch device support
        - Addition of arrow function
        - More samples of user extensions
    - Which direction should we go?
- answer
    - No one yet understands what the ideal Kozaneba of the future will look like.
        - Should I have arrows? "Should I have touch panel support?" are only hypotheticals.
    - The most important task is to use it first to know what is needed, and the most important task is to use it for various purposes
        - In addition, detailed functions can be realized by user extensions, which will increase the number of samples.

- Is there anything else you can tell us about this "Kozaneba"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>There are three directions: touch device support, additional arrow functions, and more samples of user extensions.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is its "direction"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>What's next?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>How do you know its "Kozaneba"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>By creating and using it, we can understand the necessary functions. Well, when you think about it, should we prioritize using it instead of adding functions?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "understanding" is that "understanding"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>There is a difference between "feasible features" and "necessary features." Don't spend too much time creating features you don't need.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What "function" is that "function"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It is easy to get caught up in creating features that may or may not be feasible, but that is not the most important thing.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
