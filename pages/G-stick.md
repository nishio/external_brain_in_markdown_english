    - The low projection alone is pushed very firmly.
    - You can use the low and high ones to pinpoint various positions on the soles of your feet.
    - You can grip it with both hands and jiggle the large area of the sole with the flat side.

    - You can stimulate [[foot pressure points]] even while sitting on a chair.
        - I like to press the front of the bulge under my thumb.
        - I see the reflex diagram says "stomach."
    - Can also press the calf.

I saw this and thought it looked good.
