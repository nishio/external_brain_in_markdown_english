- Maybe [[video]] is better for this kind of thing.


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1890966207899001217) I am experimenting with the idea of experiencing again what I have experienced in the past and seeing the difference. Yesterday I had a kebab in Akihabara. This in itself didn't change much, but there was a new kebab store one block next door that was touting it like crazy.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1890966210793058373) I went to Jangara Ramen today. While waiting in line, they gave me a menu, but they didn't say anything to me, they gave me a menu in Japanese, but they asked the person behind me which language menu I wanted, and they gave me a menu in Chinese. I was a little confused as to what he was looking at to identify them.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1890972280613728592) Because I've been paying first with meal tickets lately, I've been saying, "Customer! Check!" I've been doing the "W" thing for a while now.
