title: "Guest participation in MS Teams"
---

To summarize in three lines.
- Participants' email addresses will be shared.
- Ineffective means of identification of people waiting in the lobby
- Ineffective means of removing bad people from the conference room.

Checking procedure:.

The person initiating the meeting enters the guest's email address to start the meeting

The guest will receive an email with the same content, with everyone's email address listed in the TO.

After clicking this join link, guests may enter any name they wish.

He will participate under the name "Fake Yamada. He will be waiting in the lobby.
- I was told that at this time there is no way to turn on the camera and see the face.
    - I couldn't find a way too.
    - Please let me know if there is a way to verify the identity of the applicant other than the freely entered name.
    - In a situation where the meeting URL is leaked, it is possible that the participants' names are also leaked, so this makes no sense to wait in the lobby.

When "permission to participate" is given, the fake Yamada becomes a "participant." At this time, a camera will be shown.

Suppose you then realize that the fake Yamada is a bad person.
In that case, the participant can be removed from the conference room by "Delete Participant".

Even if a participant is "deleted," the guest side will see a button to rejoin.
Press the button to enter the conference room again as a "participant" (not to enter the lobby and wait).

It seems to me there is virtually no way to kick someone with bad intentions out of a meeting, is there some other way?

(From this point forward, this was tested by one guest, and the behavior is different when there are multiple guests)

The name of this free input will be used to determine whether to "make attendees" or not.
- I was told that at this time there is no way to turn on the camera and see the face.
    - I couldn't find a way too.
    - Please let me know if there is a way to verify the identity of the applicant other than the freely entered name.

- Worried about whether or not I should change it...

Here's what happens when you change it

Suppose you then realize that this guest is a bad person. In that case, you can use "Remove Participant" to kick him out of the conference room.

At this time, the screen on the guest's side shows a screen that allows the guest to join again with a single click.

When I rejoined, I was "in attendance" from the beginning.
