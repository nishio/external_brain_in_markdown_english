I found it interesting when I heard a friend discussing how to develop their [[subordinates]], so I decided to reflect on it.

Assumptions:
- The current abilities of the subordinates are generally inferior to mine, creating a situation where "it's [[faster if I do it myself]]".
- The strengths of the subordinates differ from my own strengths.
- I have some degree of control over what the subordinates learn.

There are three strategies for deciding what to teach:

- A: Help them [[overcome weaknesses]]
- B: Teach them what I [[excel at]]
- C: Enhance their [[strengths]]

- A: Help them overcome weaknesses
    - Focus on improving the weakest areas to raise overall capability.
    - This approach tends to develop generalists. See #Specialists and Generalists.
    - Once their general abilities surpass mine, I can focus on my strengths and delegate other tasks to them.
    - Disadvantages:
        - The time cost to become a useful resource is quite high.
        - Constantly working on weaknesses can make it difficult to maintain motivation.
- B: Teach them what I excel at
    - By teaching what I know best, I can facilitate efficient learning.
        - Although the diagram shows C as higher, B can potentially be higher.
    - Useful when my resources are limited, and I need a clone to act in my stead.
    - Disadvantages:
        - Since it involves my strongest areas, the time cost until the trainee can replace me is high.
- C: Enhance their strengths
    - Focus on enhancing areas where they are already strong.
        - From the perspective of [[comparative advantage]], assigning tasks to their strong areas is justified.
    - If no clear strengths exist, create a situation where they become relatively more knowledgeable in certain tasks by skewing the type of work, thus developing it as a strength.
    - Easier to boost motivation.
    - Can create a situation where they outperform me in their areas of expertise at a low cost.
    - [[Productivity improvement]] through delegation becomes functional.
    - Disadvantages:
        - The area of development is determined by their strengths, which may not align with my preferences.

My friend argued that C, "enhancing strengths," is the correct approach. I summarized the three methods along with their pros and cons for comparison. I also lean towards C > B > A.

On 2018-10-23, I noticed a connection with [[Developing Unique Strengths]].  
On 2021-10-21, I redrew the images.
