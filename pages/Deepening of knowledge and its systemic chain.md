- I> I don't mind reading Wikipedia, but that activity doesn't differentiate me because anyone can do it, and I need some way to get more benefit per unit time than others.
- He> What is it that you value?
- I> To know, to understand.
- he> Where does that knowledge come from?
- I> Information on Wikipedia and other sites is also knowledge, but in this day and age, information that can be easily found by searching has no commercial value. The type of information that you can't find by searching on Wikipedia today, and that is useful to you, is knowledge.
- He> Then what happens?
- I> The system that stores knowledge that cannot be obtained by search brings value by supporting some intellectual activity of human beings.
- he> How do you know about the system?
- I> Knowing itself is a human intellectual activity, and if we can assist it in some small way with software, the probability that the assisted human will come up with software that will assist it better increases. Knowing by repeating this positive feedback.
