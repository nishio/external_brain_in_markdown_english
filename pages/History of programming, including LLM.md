- 1940s.
    - In early computers (e.g., [[ENIAC]]), programming was a physical wiring and switch operation, or "connecting the cables" itself.

- 1950s.
    - With the advent of the [[von Neumann-type computer]], the era of "expressing programs as data" began, with programs stored in storage devices.
    - The theory of regular expressions (the basic theory by Kleene) was established and became the foundation for subsequent text processing.
    - Giving "string" data called "regular expression" to a regular expression engine is an act of expressing a "program" of what kind of automaton is constructed by that data<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

- 1970s
    - With the advent of [[Prolog]] (ca. 1972), a new technique called [[logic programming]] was established.
    - Around the same time, the concept of type inference was developed, and safety and clarity in language design were improved through [[Hindley-Milner type systems]] and other means.
    - These two are "the[[unification]] 」を計算原理に使う、手続型とは異なった計算のパラダイムとみなせる<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

- 1980s-1990s.
    - With the development of [[formal proof]] support tools such as [[Coq]], approaches that allow rigorous verification and proof of programs have matured.

- 2000s.
    - [[Alloy]] (a [[SAT]]-based [[model checking]] tool, published ca. 2002) was introduced and became the focus of attention as a method for system design consistency and constraint resolution.
    - This is another example of "[[SATソルバー]]」という効率的に特定の演算が可能な「計算のパラダイム」だ<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

- 2010s - present.
    - [[LLM]] ([[Large Language Models]]) have emerged as a new component. In particular, with the release of GPT-3 (2020) and GPT-4 (2023), probabilistic and flexible code generation using strings of prompts is bringing new life to previously deterministic methods.
    - This is another "paradigm of computation" that allows certain operations, and moreover, the prompt is passed as a string, just as a regular expression is passed as a string<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Where not operating deterministically requires a change in thinking.

Against the backdrop of these emergent ages, programming has evolved from physical connections to abstract data representation, with each component complementing each other to form the diverse paradigms of today.
