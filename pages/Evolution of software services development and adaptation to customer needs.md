- On the left side, it is noted that the process of transforming abstract concept X into software services through programming to satisfy multiple customer needs and then matching them with concrete customer needs is high cost, which gave rise to Lean Startup and Agile methodologies. On the other hand, on the right side, the cost of the process of outputting software services that solve specific customer needs as input is decreasing, and no-code, low-code APaaS and LLM programming are cited as factors in this. This allows for more efficient adaptation to customer needs.

left
- Trying to meet the needs of multiple customers with a single software service
    - First, create an [[abstract concept]] X that "will surely satisfy the needs of the market," and then convert it into a software service by programming f.
    - Then match it with specific customer needs.
    - There are customers A, B who are covered, C who are slightly out of the picture, and D who are way out of the picture.
- How did these things come to be done?
    - That's because the cost of "[[conversion to programming]]f" was high.
        - There were demanders willing to pay the cost (i.e., [[outsourcing]] their own dedicated services).
    - Spreading the payment over many people makes it cheaper, and cheaper makes more users.
- However, creating abstract concepts is also expensive.
    - The first difficulty is in thinking.
    - There is a risk that what you have thought about and created does not meet the actual needs of your customers.
    - Lean startup] and [[agile]] methodologies have emerged to reduce this risk.
right
- On the other hand, the cost of the process f outputting "software services to solve" with "concrete needs" as input is falling rapidly.
    - No-code, low-code [[APaaS]] is one factor that lowers costs
        - The operational parts required by many customers are bundled together, making it cheaper by [[economies of scale]].
    - Programming by [[LLM]] also lowers costs here.
        - Users consult ChatGPT and others for specific "what they want to do.
        - And then try to implement the solutions that come up.
