In Japan, the proportion of elderly people is increasing and the [[voting rate]] of young people is low, so there is a problem of widening [[intergenerational gap]]. [Voting is compulsory" and "eliminating the disparity in the number of votes" are possible measures.

> A political system that prioritizes policies for the elderly, who make up a high percentage of the total electorate. In Japan, especially in the late 2000s, the baby-boom generation reached retirement age, and the proportion of elderly voters increased. Moreover, the low voter turnout among voters in their 20s and 30s has made politicians more inclined to listen to the voices of the elderly, resulting in the emergence of "politics in which the voices of the elderly are heard more easily. More serious than in the national political arena is the situation in local governments, where the construction of cultural centers for the elderly and support funds for events for the elderly are frequently prioritized over budgets for the expansion of daycare centers and the seismic reinforcement of elementary schools. The problem with silver democracy is that it intentionally neglects the welfare of the younger generation. For example, young people who are unable to find full-time employment and are leading unstable lives as short-term temporary workers are dismissed with the mentality that "they lack motivation" or "their parents' education is the problem," thus avoiding the view that this is a structural problem. Many pundits have pointed out that this has reduced Japan's vitality and led to a prolonged economic slump. To avoid the spread of silver democracy, it is necessary to make voting mandatory for all voters, including young people, and to completely eliminate the disparity in the number of votes so that the voices of young people working in urban areas are more easily reflected in the political process.

> As the aging of society progresses, politicians are forced to formulate policies that emphasize the elderly, and the political situation is becoming one in which the elderly who have retired and are receiving pensions are forced to be favored over the young and middle-aged, who are active workers. This is commonly referred to as "silver democracy. A prominent example is the opposition to the "late-stage medical care system for the elderly," which targets people aged 75 or older, and which contributed to the LDP's defeat in the 45th general election for the House of Representatives and the Democratic Party of Japan's whirlwind victory. However, some argue that the heavy emphasis on the elderly may lead to dissatisfaction among the younger generation, and may even cause intergenerational conflicts.

> Japan is experiencing an aging population rate unparalleled in human history. The percentage of elderly (65+) voters was about 30% in 2012 and is projected to reach 45% by the 2050s. In addition to this, it has been pointed out that the low voter turnout among the younger generation has forced politicians to implement policies that favor the elderly, adding to the generation gap.
