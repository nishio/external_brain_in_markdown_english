title: "Strong and Invincible"
---

At first glance, I thought, "Well, he's invincible, so he must be strong.

The premise is the concept of the "weak and invincible" person.
- > People who can't adapt to society, who have no joy in life, no goals, nothing to protect.
- >  I don't care if I get caught or executed because I have nothing to lose.
- >  I'm powerless, so I have nothing to fear I'm powerless, so I want to show my strength
- >  So you ironically call such people "invincibles".
- 「 [[invincible fortress]] 」
The logic that nothing [[I have nothing to lose.]] is therefore invulnerable, i.e., attacks from others do not cause damage

Strong and invincible" is a derivative concept.
- Actions born of a "no fear of losing" mentality can become "successes" after the fact, depending on the direction in which they are directed.
- In that case, that person becomes a role model for the "invincible person."

- > The "strong" invincible psychopaths who are not bound by the law can easily make a breakthrough in society and become "successful" because they do not feel guilty about stepping on the toes of ordinary people, and as a result, more and more invincible people are attracted to them.

- [[People with nothing to lose.]]
- [[invincible fortress]]
