- Those on the left think they "spread" from A to B.
    - In fact, with respect to concrete example c, it is not included in A, but in B
- The range of observation of the right person is different
    - B is not very widespread in this observation range.
    - Especially with respect to specific example d, it is not included in either A or B.
    - Hearing the left person's claim that "it has spread", he takes the liberty of interpreting it as a claim that "d is included in B", and then argues "No, it has not spread, and d is not included in B".
- For those on the left, "I didn't claim that 'd is included in B'" and "it's a [[straw man argument]] to criticize something you didn't claim."
- A bird's eye view of the whole picture.
    - Claims of "spread" don't usually mean "spread in all directions."
    - The fact that "some parts have not spread" does not negate the claim that they have "spread."
