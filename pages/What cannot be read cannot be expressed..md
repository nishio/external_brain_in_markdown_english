title: "What cannot be read cannot be expressed."
---

Just as you cannot speak a foreign language you cannot hear, you cannot program in a programming language you cannot read.
The same is true of drawing; what cannot be "read" cannot be expressed. However, anyone can "see" and think he or she is able to do so.
from  [[Diary 2022-11-18]]

Ah, I finally realized what I had verbalized in my mind and looked at it outside, this is what "[[(a) look]]" means.
- Gaze" and "[[Cognitive Resolution]]" are close concepts.
    - Written 3 years ago [[Eyes, Literacy, Resolution]].
    - It seems that [[rough sketch]] training trains one to abandon the [[assumption]] that one is seeing things correctly and to [[look at correctly]].
        - [[What I learned only after 12 hours of drawing cylinders]]
    - When you put it that way, it's a concept close to the Buddhist "[[right view]].
