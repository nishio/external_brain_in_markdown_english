Integration of LLM into business systems and its potential
Summary: Although it is difficult to incorporate LLM into existing business systems, the concept of systemizing parts that could not be systemized before with LLM is necessary, and a bottom-up approach to the software development process is also required.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>

> [@kis](https://twitter.com/kis/status/1681137565389426689?s=20): in terms of how to integrate LLM into existing business systems, the conclusion so far is that LLM has no use in existing business systems. I feel like. It could probably be used supportively in places, though.
> Existing business systems are a logical and organized part of the business.
- > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1681138348021420032?s=20): the existing "electronic systems" have no use, and the existing (left over because they can't be electronic) "human systems" are going to be LLM. I think that the existing "electronic system" has no use. So looking at the current system and thinking about where to change it is narrow-minded at that point.
> [@kis](https://twitter.com/kis/status/1681138083327246336?s=20): existing business systems are hard to use LLM because you can do it logistically.
> I think we need to think in terms of "systematizing operations that could not be systematized before through LLM.
> [@kis](https://twitter.com/kis/status/1681143096485236737?s=20): But then, I feel that the existing software development process of "finding routine parts of a business and structuring them to create a system" also needs to be reviewed. I think it is necessary to rethink the existing software development process.
> Maybe it's not a top-down approach, like hearing and structuring, but a bottom-up approach, like taking actual data and converting it to LLM where possible, or something like that.
> [@tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1681144379111768064?s=20): @kis I drew this diagram a while ago
> I am writing an article about the transition of the way business is done based on this diagram, and it will appear in a certain place in the next month or so.

> [@kis](https://twitter.com/kis/status/1681145944249892866?s=20): @tokoroten That's about right. I think that the main goal is to use LLM to format irregular inputs for processes where the input is irregular and the output is regular, like Function Calling.
