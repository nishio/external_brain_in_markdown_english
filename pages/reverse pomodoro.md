title: "reverse pomodoro"
---

> [dondoko_susumu](https://x.com/dondoko_susumu/status/1826101936149639518) [[pomodoro technique]] (work for 25 minutes and take a 5 minute break) didn't work for me at all. I switched to 5 minutes of work and 25 minutes of rest, and it started to work. A change of mindset.

That's hilarious.

I'm sure you're writing this in jest, but, well, when you're in a state of mind where you can't do one pomodoro, I feel it's better to do a reverse pomodoro.
- "[[Let's do 10 minutes now.]]" becomes "Do 5 minutes and you can take 25 minutes off."
