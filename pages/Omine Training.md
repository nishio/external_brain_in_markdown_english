<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>How can I train for hard [[mountain climbing]] like [[Omineyama]] easily in Tokyo?

- Okutama [[Mt. Otake]] - [[Mt. Mitake]] (without using the Mitake cable)
    - Over 1,000 m vertical + familiarity with rocky terrain
    - Accumulated ascent: around 1,000 m, 6-7 h
- [[Mt. Undori]] Kamozawa Piston
    - Vertical 1,400 m class, 10 h action
    - Ascent: approx. 1,500 m, 9-10 h (suitable for able-bodied climbers)
    - [[Mt. Takao (Mt. Takao)]] Mouth-Joyama-Kageshin-Jinma Traverse
    - Easy weekday evening departure
    - Accumulation around 900 m, 4-6 h (load can be adjusted via Mt. Inari)

- Stairs x Zack = fastest training
    - 40 minutes of laps (10 kg Zack) around a fire escape on the 10th-15th floor of your workplace or home

- Tokyo Sky Tree® Steer Climbing (2,552 steps, 450 m)
- Yoyogi Park XC 3 km lap: form correction and cardiopulmonary maintenance on dirt road
- Inokashira Park or Zempukuji River Green: 60 minute brisk walk with 10 kg sack
- Squat, lunge, and hip lift: body weight + rubber band to improve downhill tolerance (15 min/day)

- Phase A (1-4 weeks)
    - 3 times a week: 30-40 minutes on level ground at a slightly faster walk (7,000-8,000 steps)
    - Aim: To improve cardiopulmonary function and walking form and create an exercise habit.
    - Walking speed while conversing
    - Standing training using station platforms
        - Stand on tiptoe 10 times x 3 sets
        - Stand on one leg for 30 seconds x right and left
- Phase B (5-8 weeks)
    - Twice a week: 60 minutes on small hills and fire escapes (80-150 m cumulative elevation gain)
    - Twice a week: 40 minutes of flatland walk
    - Aim: To acclimate the legs to climbing up and down and to increase knee and ankle tolerance.
    - Todoroki Canyon - Tamagawa-dai (50 m elevation gain) 60 min. per lap
    - Mt. Takao (using cable)
        - Lift or cable uphill, walk downhill (knee resistance↑ when practicing 400 m elevation gain on the way down)
    - Fire escape 5 floors x 5 laps
        - Elevator is acceptable on the way down. Stimulate only the cardiopulmonary while reducing the impact on the knees.
- Phase C (9-16 weeks)
    - Once a week: Low mountain hike (altitude difference 300-500 m, duration 2.5-4 h)
    - Twice a week: 30 minutes on stairs/hills (600-900 m/week cumulative elevation gain)
    - Aim: Finish up the muscular endurance and downhill endurance close to the real thing.
    - Ontake (400 m↑ on foot using cable)
        - It takes about 90 minutes uphill and 70 minutes downhill.
    - Takao Yamaguchi→Joyama Piston (accumulated 550 m↑)
        - Stock is recommended due to the long descent.
    - Commute + "load walk" with 3 kg sack
        - Start with a 1 L bottle of water and increase to 2 L → 3 L when you get used to it.

In each phase, adjust the load "within the range that does not leave strong muscle soreness the next day," and if fatigue remains, return to one level and continue.

When I think about it, when I was commuting to work, I was training myself to carry 8 kg on my back for 2 hours round trip and not be able to sit down on the way back.
