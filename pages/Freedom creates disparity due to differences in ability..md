<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Milton Friedman] is often cited as a prominent quote related to the idea that "[[freedom]] creates [[disparity]] due to [[differences in ability]]." He wrote, "[[Societies that prioritize freedom]] will ultimately lead to more equality. A [[society that prioritizes equality]] will get neither." This quote suggests that placing a high priority on freedom results in equality, while placing a high priority on equality may result in the loss of both freedom and equality.
- > The society that puts equality before freedom will end up with neither. The society that puts freedom before equality will end up with a great measure of both. --- From Created Equal, an episode of the PBS Free to Choose television series (1980, vol. 5 transcript).

In his Theory of the Origin of Human Inequality, [[Jean-Jacques]] Rousseau also philosophically discussed the process by which freedom gives rise to inequality. He argued that people are equal in the natural state, but that inequality arises as [[society]] develops.

These quotes and ideas are frequently mentioned in discussions about the balance between freedom and equality.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Although Alexis de Tocqueville does not directly state in specific terms that "liberty begets inequality," in his book "Democracy in America," he discusses the tension between liberty and equality in depth. Tocqueville recognized that a society that pursues freedom inevitably produces inequality, but that inequality also has aspects that promote freedom.
...
There is a desire in the human heart for a noble and just equality." This desire causes the urge to be strong and respected by all. But at the same time, there is a corrupt preference for equality. This is the desire of the weak to bring the strong down to the same level as themselves, making them choose equality in servitude over free inequality."
- > There is in fact a manly and legitimate passion for equality that spurs all men to wish to be strong and esteemed. This passion tends to elevate the lesser to the rank of the greater. But one also finds in the human heart a depraved taste for equality, which impels the weak to want to bring the strong down to their level, and which reduces men to preferring equality in servitude to inequality in freedom. --- "Democracy in America". Book by Alexis de Tocqueville. Chapter III, Part I, 1835.
