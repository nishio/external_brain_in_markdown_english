title: 'What is "Thin-"?'

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Shin-" in "[[Shin Godzilla]]" is a particularly intentional case of polysemous meaning.
- In the movie "Shin Godzilla," according to the director [[Hideaki Anno]], "Shin-" has the following multiple meanings:
    - New
    - True
    - God (deification of Godzilla)

The expression "Shin Godzilla" is thus characterized by the ability to put multiple layers of meaning into a single word, and this is an example of effectively utilizing the potential of the Japanese prefix "shin-".

Prior to "Shin Godzilla," for example, the following usages were used
- Neon Genesis Evangelion (anime title, started airing in 1995)

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I did not know that "Shin" in "[[Shin Godzilla]]" is a superposition of multiple meanings. I think it is recognized as a prefix meaning "new. I think the nuance is similar to the way English-speaking people add "Neo-". There are few cases where "shin" is used as a prefix in katakana, and I think it has been imitated after seeing examples of its use by Hideaki Anno. Examples of the use of the katakana "shin-" are summarized by year
