title: "VIP Strategy"

> [@minowanowa](https://twitter.com/minowanowa/status/1688002872607461376): In PIVOT, Okabe-san said that a [[rich person]] does not [[consumption]] but [[ investment]], but asking someone with money, whether it's for a crafan, champagne, or sponsorship, just because they have money, generally doesn't work. In fact, it will rather disconnect you. You have to be able to explain what kind of [[return on investment]] there is for them. It doesn't matter if it's a financial return, an experiential return, or a networking return. Many people only remember the words "let's take a VIP strategy" and try to get the other party to consume something that is not an investment.


[[Rich people don't consume, they invest.]]
- [[crowdfunding]]
[[Sponsor]]
