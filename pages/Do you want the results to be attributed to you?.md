title: "Do you want the results to be attributed to you?"

from[/villagepump/2025/09/22](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/2025/09/22)
    - Talk about whether you want [[results]] attributed to you or not.
- When there was an idea X.
    - A: "I want X to be in the world" greed and
    - B: There is a desire to be "the person who created X" and
        - [[Make what you want.]] v.s. [[Who wants to be the one who made it]].
- Strong B's are uncomfortable when others make X. Strong A's are fine with others making it.
    - If you're too busy to work on it, I'm more than happy to do it for you.
- But it's rare to get this situation in the first place, and idea X has to be good enough to move others.
    - I'm cracked!" I don't have any cracks, but..." is something I feel like I see a lot on XTwitter.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - If a strong B scatters X, B feels that X'/Y is X
- I had a feeling B wasn't 0/1.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/blu3mo/icon' alt='/villagepump/blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I think the degree of fulfillment of desire gradually changes from "I will be the one who created X" to "My friend will be the one who created X" to "Someone in my immediate neighborhood will be the one who created X" to "A distant complete stranger will be the one who created X."<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/blu3mo/icon' alt='/villagepump/blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I see<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - It's going to make a lot of difference whether I'm busy (OR fulfilled) or not.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - All I had noticed was "busy."[[満たされている]]」は重要かもな<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - When you have created idea X1 and have been praised and [[desire for approval]] is satisfied, and you are busy doing the next idea X2, it would be nice to have someone else do X3, which is a little lower priority for you.
        - Since I am already "the guy who made X1", I don't feel "deprived" if someone else does X3.
        - Related: [[socially unfulfilled people]].

- Excavated.
    - [[What makes it rational to attribute outcomes to oneself?"]]

- On the connection between artifacts and one's personality
    - On a related note, I recently summarized "[[the Buddha did not say "all is empty"]]" in "[[this is not me]]"
    - In early Buddhism, the Buddha did not say that "everything is empty," but that we can reduce attachment to various things by saying, "[[this is not mine]]" or "this is not me.
            - [[Lose your attachments.]]
    - Similarly, the outcomes could be said to be "[[This is not who I am]]."
