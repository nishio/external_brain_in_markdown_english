Hierarchical clustering to split links that are too large
- Perform [[hierarchical clustering]] on pages with links that are too large.
    - You can use words, links, and other information that appears on the page as information for clustering.
        - What is alike is near and what is apart is far
    - If you set an appropriate threshold, that tag will be split into several groups.
