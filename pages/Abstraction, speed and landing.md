    - The higher the [[abstraction]], the faster the thought.
    - A is faster than B
        - Principle of [skip list
- But the cost of thinking abstractly and landing on a real situation is high.
    - C is greater than D
    - Therefore, the criticism of those who only do A and not C as "[[top-heavy]]" and "not working on [[Real Issues]]" was valid.
- This is a [[trade-off]] relationship
- Advances in AI will lower the cost of c
        - [[Technological advances expand the production possibility frontier]]
    - Balance of tradeoffs moves more in favor of A over B
