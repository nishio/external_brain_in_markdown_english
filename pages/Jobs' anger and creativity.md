[https://wired.jp/2011/09/01/](https://wired.jp/2011/09/01/) "The Wrath of Jobs" and Creativity

- [[Steve Jobs.]]
- [[anger]]
- [[creativity]]

- I don't think it's fair to compare it to [[brainstorming]].
- To "criticize" is not to "be offended."
- The reason I don't criticize in brainstorming in the first place is because I want to extract information from "the type of person who is unable to express imaginative ideas because of the feeling that they might be criticized.
    - When Jobs is present, those people [[atrophy]] and shut up.
            - [[psychological safety]]


- [[self-assurance]]
