> To use OVRInput, you must either:
- >  Include an instance of [[OVRManger]] anywhere in your scene; or
- >  Call OVRInput.Update() and OVRInput.FixedUpdate() once per frame at the beginning of any componentâ€™s Update and FixedUpdate methods, respectively.
But when I tried to drag-drop OVRManager onto Scene, it was NG.
Isn't this it?

It seems like it should be added as a component of some object (like [[mother monolith]]), not a scene?
