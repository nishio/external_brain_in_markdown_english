[Re: On community influencing (was Re: PATCH v8 2/2 rust: add dma coherent allocator abstraction.) - Theodore Ts'o](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250208204416.GL1130956@mit.edu/)

> [yuwtnbe](https://x.com/yuwtnbe/status/1890441928807698675) Many years ago (when I was still seeking a job), a Facebooker asked [[Lennart]], "How can we get the features we want into [[systemd ]] in a meeting, and his response was, "Write code, review it, test it, contribute. Look at Watanabe, he's a volunteer." I remember it was.

- Maintainer's role is limited.
    - The maintainer is the "[[bulwark]]" of maintaining code quality, has no authority to force the addition of features, and has only one recourse [[to reject bad code]].
- Contributor's [[continuity issues]]
    - After a feature is added, often the contributor stops being involved and only the maintainer assumes the burden thereafter, so the code must be nearly perfect from the beginning.
- Importance of [[community participation]]
    - He urges that if companies and development teams want to incorporate new features, they should not simply request them, but participate in the same community activities as the maintainers, helping to eliminate technical debt and [[maintenance work]] as well.

This idea, like the past systemd talk ("[[write code, review, test, contribute]]"), illustrates the lesson that actual contributions, not mere requests, are necessary.
