title: "Scrapbox Stream"
---

Scrapbox Stream is a great feature when reading a project, but I didn't realize it until very recently!
- That was mainly because I was using this project of mine alone.
- I only did my "writing" and reading by searching or following links when I had something specific to look up.
    - Only "read with a limited audience."
- What's different with Stream.
    - The top page is ordered by newest, but only the page title and a small portion of the opening line are displayed
    - When you open the page, you can see the whole page.
    - With Stream, you can see "the recently updated part of the recently updated page".
        - When an addition is made to an existing page, only the added portion of the page will be included.
        - This is just the right feeling
