Vocaloid is a type of [[voice synthesizer]] software that allows users to input lyrics and melodies to generate singing by virtual singers or "Vocaloids." These virtual singers are often represented by anime-style characters. The software has become popular worldwide, leading to a vast array of Vocaloid songs across various music genres.

Vocaloid songs, or ボカロ曲, have a unique place in Japanese music culture. They are known for their creative freedom, as anyone with the software can create a song, share it online, and potentially gain a large following. This has led to the emergence of many popular Vocaloid producers and songs, some of which have influenced mainstream music and media in Japan and beyond.

The community around Vocaloid music is vibrant, with fans creating and sharing music videos, artwork, and remixes of their favorite songs. Concerts featuring holograms of Vocaloid characters performing live on stage have also become popular, showcasing the significant impact of Vocaloid music on both digital and live entertainment spheres.

"[[ニコニコ動画]]" ([[Nico Nico Douga]]) is a popular Japanese video-sharing website known for its unique commenting system where user comments fly across the screen while the video is playing.

Hatsune Miku, developed by [[Crypton Future Media]], is represented as a 16-year-old girl with long, turquoise pigtails. She quickly became an icon in the Vocaloid community and beyond, partly due to her distinct voice and character design. Miku's voice is synthesized from the voice of Saki Fujita, a Japanese voice actress, and she has been featured in thousands of songs created by musicians worldwide.
