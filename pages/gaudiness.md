Both words describe behavior that lacks [[depth]] or [[sincerity]], and instead focus on appearance, how to attract [[attention]], and superficiality. However, "characeness" is more commonly used in contemporary colloquial Japanese, especially among the younger generation, and often has more specific connotations related to relationships and lifestyle. On the other hand, "gairenji" is more broadly defined and can be applied to any behavior that is exaggerated and seeks to attract attention.
It should be noted that both words contain negative nuances implying a lack of [[seriousness]] or purity.
