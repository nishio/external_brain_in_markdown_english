- > Military and Nonmilitary: Blurring the Boundaries is the "Shape of War" in the 21st Century
- > Hybrid warfare is a way of being in which all the boundaries that used to lie between the completely different worlds of "war and non-war" and "military and non-military" are broken down. In 2014, after the publication of this book, Russia's new military doctrine was presented with something similar to this content, and countries around the world began to refer to it as "[[hybrid warfare]]. Hybrid warfare" was also used in the "2020 White Paper on Defense of Japan" published in August 2020.

> War will no longer be the exclusive domain of the military.
