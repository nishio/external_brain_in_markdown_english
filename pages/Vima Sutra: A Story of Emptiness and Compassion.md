>  The Yima Sutra is unique among the scriptures of Mahayana Buddhism. The content of the Yima Sutra is to reconsider the "origin" of Buddhism, to affirm both the worldly and the mundane, and to free oneself from attachments and sensitivities in order to live a life of survival.
>  The author's commentary on the "Korema Sutra" as a major turning point in Buddhist thought, in which he sees both "[[hollow]]" and "[[compassion]]" as two wheels of Buddhist thought. The author also says that the "view of Korema," an elderly man of the Buddhist tradition, that "as long as people in difficulty are suffering, there is no happiness for oneself," provides extremely relevant suggestions for today.
>  A special chapter is included that deepens our understanding of the idea of "emptiness," which is the essence of Buddhism, while showing its relationship to the Vimalakaya Sutra.
>
>  Let's let go of our attachments, let's let go of our assumptions, and let's make ourselves easier to live with--
>  The book is a collection of essays by a Buddhist layman, Yima Shonin, who "debunks" famous Buddhist disciples as if he were cutting them off from the Buddha's teachings!
>  Then, the trap of dichotomy is overcome, and one day we arrive at a profound thought.
>  "I never knew there was such an interesting Buddhist scripture! This is an intellectually exciting book that will leave you dumbfounded.
