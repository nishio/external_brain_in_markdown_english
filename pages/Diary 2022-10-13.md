- How Scrapbox merge updates work
    - First, read the existing JSON
    - Get page lines, empty list if there are no pages
    - If you don't have a link to Gyazo, add it.
    - If there is no CAP-tan line, add one.
    - If there is no INS-tan line (which there usually isn't now), add one.
    - Add any other additional information as SCBO-tan lines
- Now I skip it as soon as there's a page.
