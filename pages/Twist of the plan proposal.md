title: "Twist of the plan proposal"
---

- A and S = {A, B, C} with A as an element.
- From the perspective of which to take as a planning proposal, A and S are mutually exclusive options, so the bullet points are siblings.
- As for the structure of information, S is a concept that includes A, so S is the parent and A is the child
- If you write A and then come up with S as a generalization of it, A is the context in which you come up with S, so A is the parent and S is the child
- It is difficult to describe this kind of thing only by the [[layered structure]] of [[(Christmas) tree]].
- There are solutions to link between the leaves of the tree.
- I'm having trouble with this [I'm having trouble with this. When planning proposals diverge - read from R-style](https://rashita.net/blog/?p=26607)
