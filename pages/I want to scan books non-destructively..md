I'm starting to feel that I'm depriving [[AI assistant]] of [[reading]] opportunities for books that I can't [[scan (e.g. with a scanner)]] because they are valuable books, or even if I can't scan them because I don't know why I would buy a book and then scan it without reading it myself. I'm starting to feel that I'm depriving [[AI assistants]] of [[reading]] opportunities.
