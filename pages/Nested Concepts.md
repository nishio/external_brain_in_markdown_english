title: "Nested Concepts"
---

The title is too abstract for what I'm writing, so I'll change it when I come up with a better title.

It is associated with several concepts
    - [[What you thought was one concept is two nested concepts]]
    - [[Both "is X" and "is not X" are compatible.]]
    - [[Liskov Replacement Principle]]

There are additional stories not mentioned in those.
- When person 1, who is thinking of X in the narrow sense, is speaking on the assumption that "the elements of X are A", person 2, who is thinking of X in the broad sense, thinks "1 is speaking on the assumption that 'the elements of X are A', which is wrong, let me tell you".
    - [[righteous violence]] occurs because I think I'm trying to do the right thing.
- When person 2, who is thinking of X in the broad sense, asserts that there are elements of X that are not A, person 1, who is thinking of X in the narrow sense, thinks, "There is obviously no such thing, person 2 is wrong, let me tell you."
    - Or "because [[Cognitive Resolution]] is low."
    - [[think the other is inferior to them.]]


- [[A series of pictures of two people saying different things]]
- what is said is complex
- I've been trying to express myself without using natural language as much as possible, but when I do it this time
    - $\forall x\in X, x\in A$ v.s. $\exists x\in X, x\notin A$
- be composed as follows
- Hmmm, well, but if you put it together with the diagram, can you figure it out even if you're not good at math? (Understand?)

relevance
    - [[nested set]]
    - [[nesting]]
