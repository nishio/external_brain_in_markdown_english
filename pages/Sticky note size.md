title: "Sticky note size"
---

- [[20190205KJ method experiment by Mr. Tachikawa]]
- Mr. Tachikawa used 75mm x 25mm sticky notes.
- When I looked in the stationery section of my office for refills, these were there, so I wonder if they are readily available?
- I think this size is possible. image writing a sentence in about 2 lines.
- I'm not sure what effect being horizontal would have, but it doesn't look like it would be particularly problematic.
    - Might be hard to draw.
    - For me personally, when I print my presentation slides at 25up, it's roughly the same size as a 50mm x 38mm fusen, so I sometimes mix and match.

- I wrote a column titled "[[Fusen size]]" in [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]] p.152.  [[(Column) Size of the label]].
- Stationery is best when everyone uses what they like.
- I prefer to use 50mm x 38mm fusible labels.

- With four or five people, sticky notes can be "all [[look around]] together" on a desk.
- If you do it on a desk, you don't have to worry about it peeling off, etc.
    - [[I'll do it at my desk.]] Then 75mm x 75mm is too big.
- If you're going to put it on the wall, you might as well use [[broad pen]].
- If you have a tendency to [[I write too much.]] on sticky notes, you should also let them use a thicker pen.
- If you need to clean up your desk quickly, you can pull out [[imitation Japanese vellum]] and use it to clean up the whole imitation paper.

- [[Size]] of [[tag]]
