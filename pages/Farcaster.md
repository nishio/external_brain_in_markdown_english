It is a kind of [[decentralized social network]] in the [[Web3]] era, a community of users mainly interested in [[crypto]] and [[blockchain]], where users can post (cast) and follow like on Twitter, but with more freedom to manage their data and accounts. The feature is that users can post (cast) and follow like on Twitter, but they can also manage their own data and accounts more freely.
