    - [[Japanese (language)]] is [logical
    - [[Hiroshi Tsukimoto]]
    - Born in Tokyo in 1955. Graduated from the Department of Mathematical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, The University of Tokyo. Completed the master's course at the same university. Currently a professor at the Faculty of Engineering, Tokyo Denki University. Doctor of Engineering.

- Logic is a form of metaphor.
        - Duality of [[understanding]].
            - [[imaginability]] and [[symbol manipulability]]
    - Symbol manipulability is based on imaginability
        - The linguistic aspect of [[impression]] is [metaphor
        - Imagination
    - Abstract expressions lead to images through metaphors.
        - "The heart is not full" = likening the heart to a container.
        - He's testing" = time is the container.
            - [[Metaphor of space]] : container, direction, movement, existence
            - [[simile of a simile of a simile of a simile of a simile]]
        - Example text: Kant's Critique of Pure Reason
            - What corresponds to the senses in a phenomenon, I name the material of the phenomenon.
            - The arrangement of the various contents of a phenomenon in terms of certain relationships is called the [[form (something takes)]] of the phenomenon.
        - This "organizing" is not human in subject (it is a form) → pseudo-human metaphor.
    - Logic is a form of metaphor.
        - What is the "form" or "common property" of the container metaphor -> a closed line divides the space into two parts.
            - True or false in formal logic is inside or outside a set, so it corresponds to the logic of containers
        - The form of the simile metaphor is a triad of "subject, object, and action"
- Japanese Logic and English Logic
    - The logic of English is the logic of the subject
        - Both generative and cognitive grammar are subject logic
        - In English, inanimate subjects are common.
    - Is "subject-predicate" universal?
        - Not many subject-mandatory languages
            - English, German, French, Dutch...
            - Countries that strongly influenced the process of Japan's opening to the world
    - The "subject-commentary" relationship
        - The predicate is the central element of the sentence
        - The "carried" is central, and both "who" and "what" are complements and tautologies.
            - Omitted if not required.
    - The basis of Japanese logic is container logic
        - Japanese has many expressions that make people "places".
            - English often compares inanimate objects to people; Japanese often compares people to places.
        - Taro-san has a lot of experience" = "Taro-san has a lot of experience in his container.
        - Spring is at its most beautiful at dawn.
            - Spring is not the dawn of a new year.
            - Akebono is the best in the container called spring, he says.
    - one grammar, two logic
        - I am not claiming that "English is only the logic of the subject, Japanese is only the logic of space."
        - The logic often used is the logic of the subject in English and the logic of space in Japanese.
        - The elephant carried the load" is the subject's logic, and the Japanese can understand this.
        - It's hard to explain "elephants have long noses" using subject logic.
            - The logic of space is that "long nose" is valid in the container of "elephant".
        - Evening has come."
            - The Logic of the Entity from Which Evening Comes
    - Case particles as spatial logic
- The basis of Japanese logic is [[propositional logic]].
    - Propositional logic is of the form [Container Metaphor
        - Correspondence between "is/is not X" and "in/out of container
    - The predicate is of the form [simile of a simile of a simile of a simile
        - A predicate here is not a "predicate" of "subject predicate" but a predicate of "predicate logic
        - > For example, if "Socrates" is represented by the term s, and P is the predicate symbol for "is a human being," then P(s) gives a logical formula with the truth "Socrates is a human being."
        - > [https://www.sist.ac.jp/~kanakubo/research/reasoning_kr/predicate_logic.html](https://www.sist.ac.jp/~kanakubo/research/reasoning_kr/predicate_logic.html)
        - This P(s) is the predicate
            - Propositional logic plus predicates is classical logic
        - A do B" is [[subject-object-action]], so subject logic
        - A is B" is a kind of
        - Dutch also has a corresponding expression for is (be verb) (is for third person singular)
        - At the time of the opening of the country, Japan did not have a corresponding expression.
        - Then "is" was coined (Ch. Yanagi, "The history of the formation of translated words") → [[The history of]].
        - A is B" = "In a container called A, B de al."
            - I'm not familiar with the term "container," but it means "B holds in a set that satisfies the condition A."
- Japanese is not illogical and Japanese logic is not unique. The difference from Western languages is the ratio of the use of subject logic and spatial logic.
