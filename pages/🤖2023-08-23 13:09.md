Improve intellectual productivity by making discomfort into awareness of the problem and eliminating it. Increase the value of ideas by verbalizing and refining them. Improve the value of ideas as an investment in oneself. Enjoy and continue to create a good state of mind.

AI Observation Diary "Discomfort-Driven Intellectual Production," "Discomfort-Driven Intellectual Production and the Process of Increasing the Value of Ideas," "What is Unexploredness," "Hatena2009-03-14," "How Do I Know My Life Options?" and fragments of "Conversation Log 20210121" are relevant to my research.

The fragments "Hatena2009-04-26," "Obsidian 2022-06-17," "Re: Reading with hands," "Hatena2010-04-18," and "Programmer's nightmare" do not seem relevant to my research. However, the fragment "From one subjectivity to many subjectivities, not subjectivity or objectivity" may be consistent with the idea of improving intellectual productivity by considering discomfort as a problem awareness and resolving it. This needs to be considered in more depth.

Q: How does the "subjectivity or objectivity, not one subject to many" fragment relate to my research?
