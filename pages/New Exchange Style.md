title: "New Exchange Style"
---

The style of [[knowledge exchange]] that has been customary especially among IT engineers is neither A nor B nor C in [[Yukito Emaya's]] [[interchange format]].
Whether or not this is [[exchange style D]], it is definitely a new form of [[exchange style A]] in which "the gift is given first and the return is given later.

The technological development in the society of [[Mode of Exchange C]] has made this possible by lowering the cost of "reproduction, transmission, and sharing of goods".
People first give goods to the "[[public]]". Then returns are made by some who benefit from the public.
The fact that the object of the gift is not specified in advance distinguishes it from reciprocation in the primitive mode of exchange A.

The case where the good is "knowledge" became PROFITABLE at an early stage. On the other hand, as of 2023, there are cases where returns are insufficient in the case where the good is "software," and this is considered a social problem. Following the resolution of this problem, a "new mode of exchange" will become stable.

memo
- Why was it established earlier in the "knowledge" case? Low cost? Large market of demanders?
