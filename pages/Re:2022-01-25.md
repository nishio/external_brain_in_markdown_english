- [[Long title engraving page]]

    - [[Just as "appetite is not evil," "desire for approval is not evil."]]
    - I noticed that logically, "appetite is also evil" also holds true.
- The "[[If it's a continuation, the date is later.]]" principle was easy to understand, so I thought I'd align with it.
    - I fixed the date position and the Stream became a mass of nonsense.
    - It's hard to know how to handle these "unimportant updates".
        - Even if there was a "do not put on the update list" flag, as if it were PukiWiki, it would be a pain to click on it every time.
        - Put them in "don't record updates mode" and people forget to get out.
        - Do you do it and then say, "Oh, these corrections are trivial, so forget about it"?
        - I don't care, it will sink in after a while.
        - It's okay because it's an individual project, but if it's a multi-person project, [[discretion]] is going to happen.
- As an aside, when I wrote "refrain" or something like that, I started thinking "what's the English word for this?"
