title: "Phase and Proximity"
---

When considering "[[distance]]" as a concept to express "[[proximity]]", it is implicitly assumed that the distance between two points corresponds to a [[real number]] value. The fact that it is a real number implicitly assumes [[universal sequential]].
However, there are use cases where the whole order is not necessarily necessary for the proximity argument.
- In [[topology]], "closer" is [[semi-sequential (e.g. equations)]] since "there is an [[open set]] in [[implication]], which is an element of the inner open set".

Definition of phase
Let X be a set and $\mathcal{O}$ be a subset of the power set $\mathfrak{P}(X)$.
When $\mathcal{O}}$ satisfies the following property, the pair $(X,{\mathcal {O}})$ is called a topological space with X as the platform set and $\mathcal{O}}$ as the open set system, and the source of $\mathcal{O}$ is called an open set in X.
1. $\emptyset ,X\in {\mathcal {O}}$
2. $\forall O_{1},O_{2}\in {\mathcal {O}}~~:~~O_{1}\cap O_{2}\in {\mathcal {O}}$
3. $\forall \{O_{\lambda }\}_{\lambda \in \Lambda }\subset {\mathcal {O}}~~:~~\bigcup _{\lambda \in \Lambda }O_{\lambda }\in {\mathcal {O}}$
