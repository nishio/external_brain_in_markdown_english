title: "Strategy Room Excavation LOG"
---

- Once made a map titled "Strategy Room" with plastic sheets and sticky notes (date unknown).
- I was probably trying to get rid of that thing on the wall when I moved out of the office.
    - Described in Moleskine on 2016-02-07.
    - He had once tucked a bundle of sticky notes into his notebook, but they were bulging and in the way, so he moved them somewhere else.
    - I've lost track of where I moved to.
    - There is a partial copy.
    - You didn't take any pictures? You didn't take any pictures (why...)
- I did a cross search of Scrapbox and got a hit on the home organization memo.
:

```
 24
  Sticky 20180408 Scb transcribed
  	What was [the strategic map]?
  	Did you bundle up on the move?
```

    - Search in 20180408
            - [[20180408Note on task abstraction sticky note]] This one?
:

```
Not completed, so more to come #TODO
And an explanation of "task abstraction" itself #TODO
```

    - Boxes 2-4

        - There were!
            - ![image](https://gyazo.com/ba95b4d41d08f3a9b2afa96cc5164f94/thumb/1000)
- Conclusion.
    - Sticky note was at home folded and partially transcribed to Scrapbox, but the link to it was not clear
    - Every two to three years, the need to refer to it comes up.

Why "Room"?
- Mind Palace Metaphor
- There is a room where things related to long-term strategy are placed.
    - You don't have to be there all the time.
        - ?
        - Before the physical office move, it was on the wall.
    - I go into that room every few years.
        - This time I had trouble finding the key to get in.
    - [[Room Parable]]
- The process of generating a "strategy room."
        - [[Clean Space Experience]] 　p.34〜
        - In the process of researching the idea that "Sokutsugi is not good for Atari," I found that [[Clean Space Experience]] describes the process by which this idea was generated.
