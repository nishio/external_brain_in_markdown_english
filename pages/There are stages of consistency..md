- 1: [[INTEGRITY]] in what Mr. X wrote.
- 2: Consistency between what Mr. X wrote and what Mr. X did.
- 3: Consistency between the usage of the word in what Mr. X wrote and the usage of the word in the world (within the profession).
There are three

1 integrity is the highest priority.

If you compare it to a program, the first is at the stage of whether or not it will pass compilation.
3 is "Isn't it misleading that the function that does this process has this name?" Stage 3

There's no point in cleaning up the code of a program that doesn't work or doesn't create value.
