title: "ARC114"

In A, I used the greedy method to choose prime numbers in order of multiplicity, but that's a lie, I chose 2 for 3,5,7,6,10,14, but it's correct not to choose 2. When I saw the explanation that the simple concatenated components are fine, I see.
I guess it's hard to create a test case that would drop it, since it's a wasteful process but only a high constant times different than the optimal algorithm.

I thought I see what you mean the other day about putting the state in the Scrapbox page title, so now the title looks like ABC777C, but I'll add AC and WA as well. I need to decide on a string that expresses "I've seen the problem statement but don't know how to solve it" or "I've considered it but haven't implemented it." The former is ðŸ¤”
