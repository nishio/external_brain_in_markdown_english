- 1: [[want to do]] When things are ambiguous, the boundaries of what you want to do are not clear.
- 2: In such a case, you can try a solution that is already available (existing software, etc.)
- 3: Then there is a division between what was "done" with the solution and the rest that was not.
- 4: If you focus on "[[something you couldn't do but still want to do]]" you can observe it better than at first. Then the boundaries become a little more clear.

What to do after this
Option 1: [[modified]].

- Increase "what can be done" by modifying part of an existing solution
- The reason why there are so many engineers in the world who think that open source software is better is because it is more likely to be modifiable than non-open source plug-rams.
- Some things are easy to modify, some things are difficult to modify

Option 2: Combine different solutions
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/c6568f535e0bdcdd17967ccdd383fcb4/thumb/1000)
- Combining multiple solutions (tools and software)
- Even people who can't write programs can do it up to the point of combining them.
- Often has a gaping hole.
    - Sometimes it is necessary to write a program that connects those gaps.

    - [[gluecode]].

Option 3: Make
- When you have thought this far and then think about "making it," it becomes clear what you are going to make.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/3ab7c525b2a92faa079e1e15b569a857/thumb/1000)
- If you try to create something with a vague initial "what you want to do," you will end up creating a very large area.
- Thinking about how much can be solved with existing solutions, and then thinking about making them, we can think like, "Let's use A to the extent we can do it with A," or "We don't need B."

        - [[How can we increase cognitive resolution?]]
- Some people are unhappy with this story.
    - That's because what he says he wants to do is not really what he wants to do.
        - I want to be the one who made it" is the real desire and purpose.
        - What you say you want to do is a means to "be the one who made it."
        - So I'm not happy about "making it happen without making it happen."
    - Related: [[who wants to be the one who made it]].
