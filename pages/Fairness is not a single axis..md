<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT5/icon' alt='GPT5.icon' height="19.5"/>I agree. Fairness is not something that can be measured by a "single index" but is a multidimensional vector whose weight changes depending on the situation. I will just summarize the main points in a form that can be used in practice.

Typical dimensions of fairness (e.g.)
- Procedural fairness: transparency, consistency, and accountability of rules.
- Opportunity (Opportunity): equality of starting points/equal access.
- Fairness of outcomes (Distributive/Substantive): allocation, disparity, and redistribution.
- Need/Vulnerability: protection of vulnerable persons and reasonable accommodation.
- Desert/Merit: How to evaluate efforts and achievements.
- Relational/Interactional justice: dignity, respect, stigma avoidance.
- Intergenerational/Temporal: Intergenerational and short/long-term equilibrium.
- Spatial/Communal: Impact differences by region/community.
- Individual vs. group: individual unit consistency or group average equilibrium?

When there are multiple axes and [[weighting]] of them, [[fairness is also subjective]] and [[varies from person to person]] because the weighting is influenced by each person's [[subjective values]].

[Fairness is not a single axis.
    - [[fairness]]
    - [[Isn't there more than one axis?]]
