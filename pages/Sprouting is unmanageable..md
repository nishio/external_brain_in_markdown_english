title: "Sprouting is unmanageable."

- [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]]  p.186  [[(6.1.2.4) Sprouting is unmanageable.]]
> Bud growth is unmanageable.
> After learning about the thinking methods of our predecessors, I realized that the task of coming up with ideas is composed of many detailed tasks. I organized these detailed tasks into three phases: "cultivate," "sprout," and "nurture.
> The Tilling Phase and the Growing Phase can be task managed. However, the Budding Phase cannot be managed. You cannot make an idea sprout through effort, nor can you guarantee that it will sprout if you wait. Whether or not an idea will sprout is a matter of luck.
> ... Spend a good amount of time cultivating to increase the probability of good ideas sprouting as much as possible... Manage what you can and don't manage what you can't, this is the maximum effort to generate good ideas.
