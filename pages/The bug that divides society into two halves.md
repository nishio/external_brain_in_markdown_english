title: "The bug that divides society into two halves"
---

When we are talking about human behavior X and Y, some people [[bifurcation of society]] interpret it as talking about a set of humans.

For example, when we are talking about "sit-ups X and backbends Y are two different muscle-building exercises," some people will say, "Some people do both X and Y."

A straw man argument analogy] that does not claim "there are people who only do X," but refutes a claim that does not exist [[A straw man argument analogy]].

- Would it be more appropriate to say [Bugs that confuse behavior and people.
