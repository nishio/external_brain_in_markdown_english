AI Planning and Scheduling
Ghallab, Nau, & Traverso "Automated Planning: Theory & Practice" (2004) organizes AI techniques that reduce abstract goals into concrete action plans. These frameworks and algorithms are helpful in creating mechanisms to transform abstract tasks into actionable steps.

Ghallab, Nau, Traverso「Automated Planning: Theory & Practice」(2004)：
- This is a foundational classic in the field of automatic planning, introducing a methodology for generating a plan (PLAN) from a target state (desired state), an initial state, and the action rules and operators that connect them.
- Concretization of abstract tasks:
    - It provides a framework for reducing abstract "goals" (e.g., "think of a sales strategy") into concrete action steps ("read three market research documents," "summarize a competitive analysis report," "brainstorm a list of three ideas," etc.). The methods accumulated in this research area (e.g., state-space search, heuristic planning, decomposition planning, etc.) provide the theoretical foundation for AI to subdivide users' ambiguous instructions and vague objectives into actionable task sequences.
    - In addition, optimal sequencing that takes into account the dependencies among tasks and resource constraints (time, location, tools, etc.) provides a way of thinking to produce an efficient task execution plan.
