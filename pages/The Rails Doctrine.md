- [Optimize for programmer happiness: Emphasizes that the emotions and happiness of the programmer are paramount; Ruby and Rails aim to maximize the joy of the programmer.
- [Convention over Configuration: It is recommended that programmers follow a predefined set of conventions rather than setting them at will. This allows developers to focus on important decisions.
- [The menu is omakase: Rails provides a set of best tools and practices and leaves the programmer free to choose from them. This is similar to choosing an omakase menu for the chef at a restaurant.
- [[No one paradigm]]: Rails is not restricted to one programming paradigm, but uses a combination of many different paradigms.
- [Exalt beautiful code: Encourage the writing of beautiful, well-organized code. This helps increase code readability and maintainability and reduce errors.
- [Provide sharp knives: Rails provides programmers with powerful tools. This is a metaphor for "[[Provide sharp knives]]", and while these tools can be dangerous, they can be very useful if used correctly.
- [Value integrated systems: Rails provides a set of tightly integrated systems. This encourages developers to understand the whole system and how they work together.
- [Progress over stability: Rails is constantly evolving and introducing new features and improvements. This means that progress is more important than stability.
- [[Push up a big tent]] ([[Pitch a big tent.]]): Rails welcomes programmers of all skill levels, backgrounds, and interests. This is a "big tent" expression, meaning that we value [[diversity]] and [[inclusiveness]].
These principles represent the [[philosophy]] behind the design and evolution of [[Ruby on Rails]].
