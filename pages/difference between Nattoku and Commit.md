Chat
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> You are a linguist, knowledgeable in Japanese, English, and Mandarin. I am trying to convey the concept of '[[納得]]' overseas. It is used in a phrase "Democratic process is a process that generates as much 納得(Nattoku) feelings as possible among a wide range of people." A friend from Taiwan asked if '納得' means 'commit.' I think it's different, but I want to explain it clearly. Please help me.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/> The concept of "納得" (nattoku) in Japanese carries a nuanced meaning that doesn't directly translate into a single word in English or Mandarin. It's important to understand the cultural and linguistic context to convey its essence accurately.

- Meaning in Japanese: In Japanese, "納得" refers to a state of [[understanding]] or [[acceptance]], especially after thorough consideration or explanation. It's a feeling of [[satisfaction]] or [[agreement]], often used when someone understands the reasoning behind a decision or situation and accepts it, even if they might not completely agree with it.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> It's good explanation. someone understands the reasoning behind a decision and accepts it, even if they might not completely agree with it

- Comparison with "Commit": The term "[[commit]]" in English, or its Mandarin equivalent (承诺 [[chengnuo]] or 承担 [[chengdan]]), implies a promise, undertaking, or obligation. This is different from "納得," which is more about reaching a state of acceptance or understanding rather than making a commitment.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Yes. Nattoku is not relevant to making a promise.

- Conveying in English: To convey "納得" in English, especially in the context of the democratic process, you could use phrases like "generating a sense of understanding or acceptance among people" or "reaching a state of general agreement or satisfaction." It's about the process leading to a [[collective understanding]] or acceptance, not just making a decision.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Nice phrase collective understanding

- Conveying in Mandarin: In Mandarin, a close equivalent might be 理解 (lijie), which means "to understand," or 接受 (jieshou), meaning "to accept." However, these words might not fully capture the depth of "納得." You could use a phrase like 达到一个普遍的理解和接受状态 (dadao yige pubian de lijie he jieshou zhuangtai), which translates to "reaching a widespread state of understanding and acceptance."
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Nice phrases, Japanese can understand it 普遍的理解
        - 接受状态 may be 受容された状態 in Japanese.

- Cultural Context: It's also worth noting that "納得" reflects a cultural emphasis on harmony and consensus in Japanese society. In the context of a democratic process, it implies striving for a decision that is not only logically sound but also emotionally acceptable to the majority.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Yes, It looks me an important profile of the concept of Nattoku emotionally acceptable to the majority

In summary, "納得" is about reaching a state of understanding or acceptance, rather than committing to something. It's a nuanced concept that involves both intellectual agreement and emotional satisfaction, particularly relevant in collective decision-making processes like in a democracy.
