- Related: [[Incorrect KPI setting]].
- > If we focus too much on [[quantification]], we tend to chase easily measurable indicators, and we risk diverging from the objectives we wanted to achieve in the first place. In addition, the goals may not always evoke [[empathy]] and [[willingness (e.g., to do something)]] in the members. In a [[diversity]] organization, clear goals are important but must be considered of limited effectiveness. [[Drucker.]] said, "[Truly meaningful social phenomena do not lend themselves to quantification.

Express ideals qualitatively
- to whom
- What do you want me to say?
- [[target]] and [[value]] in marketing
- Easy to use." "Easy for whom?"
- > Abstract language is prone to differences in interpretation. If we do not use more concrete, more sympathetic ideal language, we increase the risk of failure to achieve common understanding in a diverse organization.
