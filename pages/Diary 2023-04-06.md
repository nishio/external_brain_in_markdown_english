On a proposal to delay the development of AI by six months
- I'm not sure why you think you can delay it, or why you think you can delay it, just because you got the "delay it six months" petition.
- Even if they actually decide to "delay" the project by six months, I'm not sure what is expected to be resolved in that six months. They might say, "Let's give them another six months.
- I'm not sure I understand the rationale for thinking that a human without AI would be more effective than using AI to solve problems that you think may be caused by AI before they occur, rather than after they actually occur.

I can see why Elon Musk suggested this, he seems to like to stand out (...)
