title: "MAGI System with GPT"

from [/villagepump/2023/12/21](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/2023/12/21)
- I really want to make a [[MAGI System]] with GPT.
    - If the API key is put in by the user, there is no cost to me.
    - It would be good to create a mechanism for users who can't afford to pay to run it by others, creating an incentive to spread the word on social networking sites.

- [[Create three virtual personalities with 21st century ideologies and have them discuss them.]]
