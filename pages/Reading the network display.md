There was a discussion about wanting to know what a non-creator would read when they see the Interactive Graph displayed on a page that [/villagepump/Quartz publishes Obsidian Vault](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/Quartz publishes Obsidian Vault).

- Two things caught my attention after seeing this
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/68a8e980bb3805f530d7b67b76b97ad6/thumb/1000)
- I thought it was interesting to compare each page and see the differences.
    - A is a raw writing that has been written in a flow state for an interesting thought topic
    - B is a sentence that has been cut out and polished clean
    - I got the impression that
- I felt that B was an abstraction created ([[abstraction product]])
- Is B easy to understand?
    - This depends on the state of knowledge of the recipient.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/5eb0426fe50b1b9a28ea1f5c529f2575/thumb/1000)
        - from  [[How to give knowledge to those who lack knowledge]]
    - Understanding X, a product of abstraction, requires knowledge to support it
        - You can't understand it if you're given just X with no knowledge of it.
            - [[Taking the top of the pyramid is not what I expected.]]
            - ![image](https://gyazo.com/205d5931f8c6ddd3c6d17588dd4587b7/thumb/1000)

- So if you read B in this case and don't understand it, maybe you should read A and then read it again.

        - X now has [[road to (figurative) enlightenment]] graphically visualized so it's easier to find.
    - Ideally, you'd read all the pages surrounding B and then re-read B to better understand it.

        - But this is high cost

Expressions in a different order
- Suppose we want to understand some abstract concept X
    - Ideally, you'd read all the surrounding pages before reading it to better understand it.
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/10b1ca180b13217e275c010ac514d38d/thumb/1000)
        - But this is high cost
    - So read [[road to (figurative) enlightenment]] on X
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/38d92720559b34891bd390ad48934cce/thumb/1000)
        - Graphical visualization made it easier to find.



- Tend to think of pages that are linked from many concepts as "important pages" in the PageRank metaphor
    - However, it is often "[[highly abstract page]].
    - Because [[Highly abstract concepts have a wide range of applications.]] from, coupled with more
    - Increased abstraction does not equal good.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/川喜田二郎/icon' alt='川喜田二郎.icon' height="19.5"/> [[You're abstracting too much.]]
        - The process of abstraction to the minimum necessary is important.
            - This sentence is about "in the writer's thinking process"
            - I'm not talking about "for informational purposes."
            - Abstract concepts are easily communicated or misunderstood, but they have no choice [[Books are already a product of abstraction]], because readers are not used to having the process shared.
