- > Buddhism, especially the Chukan sect (of Shin Buddhism), however, thoroughly rejects the dichotomous view of subject and object as a fallacy. By extension, [[Zen (Buddhism)]] of the Tang dynasty in China practiced this view, and their goal was to search for the consciousness of "subject and object" before the arising of the consciousness (thought).
