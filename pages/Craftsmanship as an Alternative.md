[[Craftsman]] as [[alternative]].
> [zerobase](https://x.com/zerobase/status/1808359502431113550) The IT industry is like a non-Japanese society, and people change jobs all the time. To put a finer point on it, it is most noticeable in the web-based IT industry. I wonder if there is any research on this. If we understand this, we can understand from the opposite side of the question why Japanese society keeps dreaming of a "post-Japanese employment system" (and why it ends up as a dream without being realized).

> [zerobase](https://x.com/zerobase/status/1808359505048359356) I have a reasonable interpretation of this issue from [[Hacker Culture]] and [[Amino Historiography]], but since there seems to be no such research, I am thinking of writing about it in a journal. I am thinking of writing about it in the journal.

Instead, I would like to talk about "[[labor mobility]]" in a positive sense, in the sense of "[[highly skilled professional human resources]]. The web industry is an excellent research subject.

[This means correcting the common self-image of "peasants" = "farmers" and "Japanese society" = "mura society. Reevaluating the ideological form of "artisan" as an alternative.

> [zerobase](https://x.com/zerobase/status/1808363835956551695) We need to correct the common Japanese self-understanding errors such as "90% of the people in the Edo period were peasants" and "Peasants were poor people suffering from severe tribute. It means to correct the identity in order to get rid of the "long Edo period" ("[[China-izing]] Japan"), which is based on a false self-image. Simply put, peasants are not serfs, and the Western (Marxian) view of history does not apply at all.

> [zerobase](https://x.com/zerobase/status/1808365259864039743) Questioning the vague belief of most (non "venerable") Japanese that their ancestors were peasants = farmers. In reality, there were far fewer peasants, "peasants" were not necessarily "farmers," and there were many "artisans" in the broad sense throughout Japan. The way artisans were and live was different from that of peasants, who became "[[yeh]]" after a certain period of time.

> [zerobase](https://x.com/zerobase/status/1808366490334421189) The issue of "[[self-employed]]" work styles and economic incentives in the so-called "[[diligent revolution]]" is a A major hint. It is necessary to dig up and re-evaluate the traditions up to the early modern period, which Japan has discarded in the process of its rapid modernization.
