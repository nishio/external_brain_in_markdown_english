*1268370342* [kaizen (Japanese business philosophy of continuous improvement)] Preparation of tax returns
I used to categorize them as book receipts, transportation receipts, medical receipts, Yodobashi and other receipts, Tokyu Hands receipts, and so on, but this is completely useless. I guess I should separate them by activity. Receipts for books used for Project A, travel expenses...and so on. Not only receipts but also records should be kept. Should I put them all together in the same place?

I have about 10 or so paper trash clumps in what I call the "paperwork bin," including some withholding tax slips that are about 5 years old. I'm supposed to throw those away, right? I can throw away the receipts for last year's medical expenses that didn't total over 100,000, right?
