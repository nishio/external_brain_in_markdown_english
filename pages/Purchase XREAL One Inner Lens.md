title: "Purchase XREAL One Inner Lens"

[[XREAL One]]
- I tried to get by without glasses, or with glasses and a stack of glasses, but I give up.
- It is more wasteful to reduce the frequency of utilization of the device bought due to the mental friction caused by the lack of visibility.

I have to go to Ginza on 3/4, so let's do it at that time.

I can make a reservation online, so I'll go anyway.

I did some tests that I don't usually do very often.
I was allowed to take pictures of it because it was interesting, but the middle and right sides would be medical procedures, so I didn't give any commentary.

After this, I did a further examination, different from what I usually do at the ophthalmologist's office, and found that the center of the right eye and the left eye in the neutral state were off-center.
They say about 80% of IT people are in this state.
Maybe it's the smart phone. w
Is that why the letters get separated and hard to see when I get tired?
I've only found nearsightedness in my regular eye exams.
I'll prescribe you a prescription for weak nearsightedness in your right eye and weak astigmatism in your left eye. I'll prescribe for weak myopia in your right eye and weak astigmatism in your left eye."
You were like.

This time, I'm here to buy an inner lens for XREAL.
And I'm just saying that if you add prism correction to it, when you remove the XREAL, you lose the correction and it's confusing, that's true.
The budget for a new pair of glasses is an order of magnitude more than the budget for a new pair of glasses.
In the meantime, maybe I should stop using my phone with one hand and rehab it...
