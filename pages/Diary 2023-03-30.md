>  That while it is true that there are risks in the use of AI, a ban on development is not feasible and should not inhibit the application of new technologies or competition, and that it would be more practical to develop regulations on transparency and auditing instead.

I am reminded of the story that Mr. Kaneko, a developer, lamented that he was not allowed to take countermeasures against the spread of damage caused by exploitation of vulnerabilities.
