`laboratory in cyberspace, in ghost in the shell style, cinematic atomosphere`

I really wanted it to be in cyberspace, but AI didn't seem to have any imagination when they said it was a lab in cyberspace.
- Maybe I should have been more specific and said something like "translucent holographic 3D display"?

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1574675453990019072): I had a videoconference today with someone who asked me, "What's that background?" I told him that I made it with StableDiffusion, but since I started [[C3: Computer Created Cats]] after I made this background, I got an idea to make another cat-covered background.

Draw a cat at random.

I was trying out Google Meet because I'm supposed to use it, and it already has the standard ability to create virtual backgrounds.
I made a new one with ChatGPT GPT-4 (Dall-E) because I didn't get what I expected at all.
I just said, "Make a virtual background for Google Meet," and they did the scaling right.
