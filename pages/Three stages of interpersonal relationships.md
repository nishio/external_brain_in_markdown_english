- 1:   [[dependence]]
    - Every human being goes through a child state.
    - Growing up with help from adults around you
    - Often becomes a compulsion due to differences in body size.
- 2:  [[independence]]
    - As they grow older, they reject help.
    - Can do it alone, hide weaknesses.
    - Repulsion is also strong, especially when raised in a coercive environment.
- 3:  [[interdependence]]
    - A [[win-win]] deal between equal adults
    - A relationship in which you fill in the other person's weaknesses, and in return, the other person fills in your weaknesses.
        - [Share the vulnerability.


    - [[Dependence → Independence → Interdependence]] was also discussed in [Seven Habits
- The story of children being affected by their size difference from adults was also discussed in [Adlerian psychology
    - I thought the case of [[Pride makes us throw away our options.]] was caused by stopping at step 2.
