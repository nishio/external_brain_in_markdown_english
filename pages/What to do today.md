title: "What to do today"

- > A daily task list is a "list of things I plan to do today". But that would be "a list of things to do today" in common parlance.
- > In fact, the general "list of things to do today" is also "a list of things I think should be done today," and has little or nothing to do with the "should" that the world demands in principle.

- [[Distinction between fact and interpretation]] "What you should do today" is an interpretation, not a fact. [[Distinction between fact and interpretation]].
        - [[Should→why?]]
        - [[Should→What will happen if we don't?]]
