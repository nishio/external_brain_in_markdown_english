I'm afraid that the title "Design Decisions for Programming Languages" doesn't quite sum it up. I was going to publish it after correcting some missing figures and diagrams, but I realized that it has been a week (I was going to publish it on the same day!). So, I'm going to publish it as soon as possible.
