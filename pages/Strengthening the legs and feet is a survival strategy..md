title: "Strengthening the legs and feet is a survival strategy."

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1759399178101493856/quick_promote_web/intro) I just realized that in the age when AI has developed and AI is better at desk work, the value of human existence is the interface between AI and the physical world. If I think that the value of human existence is the interface between AI and the physical world, I think that my survival strategy is to train my legs and back by mountain climbing because I am not good at driving a normal car without a heavy machinery license and I have to follow the instructions of AI to walk on mountain paths where cars cannot enter.
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1759399715307995624) Where else do we need humans to drive heavy machinery and other equipment to manipulate large masses, drive cars to travel at high speed on paved roads, ride bicycles on roads that are difficult to pass by car, or walk on foot where vehicles cannot enter? What else do we need humans for?

>  At least unlike the current license, wouldn't the main requirement for a license to handle heavy equipment be to secure the surrounding area or something like that?
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1759469795056247151) I'm only assuming "an age when AI is better at desk jobs". Since desk jobs are easier to learn than handling heavy machinery, they will be learned by AI sooner, and that's why heavy machinery skills will still remain in that era.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1759400525639061552) What, in an age when AI produces greater labor production than [[old humans]], [old humans made to improve the efficiency of exchanging their labor for what they need How can a [[piece of paper]] be worth anything?
> [monjudoh](https://twitter.com/monjudoh/status/1759401252465872921) real estate and such
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1759402191864140126) Ah, sure. If labor is "no longer a scarce resource" and its value goes down, then relatively speaking, does the "limited amount of land on the planet" go up in value?
- [[Labor is no longer a scarce resource.]]
- [[Land is a limited resource.]]
