> [_nishinayuri](https://x.com/_nishinayuri/status/1816458910611734692) I've written this many times, but jealousy is not an emotion you have for someone who is more amazing than you. It is an emotion that arises when someone who you think is lower than you gets lucky. Therefore, people who tend to look down on others will suffer more from jealousy.
