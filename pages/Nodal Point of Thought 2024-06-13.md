Chatting in front of a whiteboard for two hours

Write down what you remember and get out of your mouth in the order you remember it later.
- Strong impressions are adjoined by opportunities for bonding by
- Opportunity to clarify one's values that have not yet been verbalized per se
- [[time structure broken down]].
        - [[Destruction of time structure]]


Once you understand the composition of the game, you can't enjoy the game.
- [[Shrine of Tiaquin]]
- [[Gamification of work]]

Some information is difficult to distribute.
- Technology has accelerated the distribution of distributable information.
    - Scarcity decreases as they are duplicated.
    - commoditization
- Abstraction makes it distributable.
    - Can the recipient receive and understand the abstraction product?
            - [[Taking the top of the pyramid is not what I expected.]]
    - Easy to understand when accompanied by specific details
    - When you make an application, you end up abstracting once.
            - [[Conversion with abstraction as the axial foot]]

What are some tips for good intellectual production?
    - [[There are no silver bullets.]]
- Answers to general questions are more abstract.
    - The abstract answer is that you already know it, you just haven't connected it to the concrete in your mind.
    - [[Exercise is a good way to get rid of obesity]].
- for example
    - You just have to mess around a lot.
        - Increase the number of times you go to bat
    - MVP
    - PDCA cycle
    - We hear it so much that it's hard to hear, because it really is the truth.
        - After all, "Exercise is a good way to get rid of obesity."
            - There is no such thing as a good diet.
    - [[Conceptual ability is the ability to limit problems]]
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/構想力は問題を限定する能力/icon' alt='構想力は問題を限定する能力.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Creating a more narrowly focused question is necessary before getting an answer.

Organization with strong intellectual productivity
- Inside and outside the organization
        - [[Duplex organization]]
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/二重組織/icon' alt='二重組織.icon' height="19.5"/>

Some things can be financed with money and some can't.
    - [[Difficult-to-procure resources]]
- People, goods, money, and information.
    - You often put these four things in parallel, but some of them are procurable with money and some are not.
- Procurable = there is a market
    - Most of the [[transferable]] stuff is bought and sold for money.
            - [[non-transferable resource]]
    - After all, [[Enthusiasm is a valuable resource]]?

Personally, I can follow the record of associations of what I've already thought about [[and a network of knowledge allows me to move fast]], but if I stay within that network, there's no return for me.
- Uncle just saying what he associates with.
    - human-vector search engine
- I'm hoping to get new information and expand my network?
- When I was younger than you are now, I was more inclined to do so, but I think it's weakening.
    - Uh, that one.
    - My physical body is foreseen to be in decline in 20 years.
    - As a result, the boundaries of "me" are changing.
        - I am the sum total of the information that has been made public.
    - Planting information (=a part of me) in another young, creative body is like bamboo extending its underground stem into another land
    - You're moving away from the physical body of the self in the way you emit your desire to grow.
- In other words, it has changed from "the addition of new information to my physical body" to "the addition of new information to a body of knowledge (which I initially made public but which has lost its clear boundaries due to the involvement of various people).

- [[Blurring of organizational boundaries]]
    - [[smoothing (e.g. numbers)]]

Sources.
- I'm losing time and energy to read books, and that's not good.
- I'm tired and lazy on Twitter, not good.
    - I just hit the bookmark button and didn't write it in Scrapbox.
    - The wider the source as [[randomizer]], the better.
    - No clarification of collection criteria, etc.
    - The new is outside the delineated boundaries.
- Delve into your interests until you are satisfied.


I liked having a white board.
- There are certain types of concepts that are expensive to communicate when verbalized, but less expensive when illustrated.
- On the other hand, it's hard to come up with "I see something about that in Scrapbox" in a verbal discussion.
    - Well, when I tell them, they're not going to read it on the spot.
- In other words, the whiteboard and verbal communication is a "communication festival," a meeting to shake things up, break down boundaries of thought, and introduce new perspectives, after which each person may need a phase to deepen their distributed asynchronous thinking.
- I guess we need another meeting to bring it up afterwards.

I wrote this so far on the train on the way home, so no graphical thinking.

- [[Boosting exponential growth]]
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/指数的成長の後押し/icon' alt='指数的成長の後押し.icon' height="19.5"/>
- I thought there might be a J-curve.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Jカーブ/icon' alt='Jカーブ.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Of course, theoretically there is.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/4789287f27cae07dce872f1dac336b52/thumb/1000)

    - Possibly a curve like B.
    - but it is agnostic because it is in the future
    - It's hard mentally to spend S's "uninteresting time" trying to get to B when there's an A curve in front of you.
    - Is it also influenced by the fact that my KPI in life is to maximize the good times in my life?
- PS
        - [[Better off investing in a new S-curve.]]
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/新しいS字曲線に投資した方が得/icon' alt='新しいS字曲線に投資した方が得.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - In the past, I've thought about this.
        - So the difference is whether you think the curve grows exponentially or sluggishly in an S-curve fashion.
        - Basically, history has been a series of S-shaped developments.
        - Exponential growth during the first half even with S-shaped
        - I think we're in the early stages of a [[avalanche]] of social changes triggered by the development of LLMs in the current cross-section of June 2024 that will change things in a chain of events, so I guess my perception of it as an exponential function is getting stronger in my mind.
    - Further added 2024-08-03
        - Related: [[Exponential growth over the pass]].

- Can't the person who started on B first build [[barriers to entry]] and switch from A to B when A is about to be overtaken?
    - Or can the A's compress the cost that the B's chose to pay in the S's time?
    - In the area of technology, for example, tools that were not well documented in the early days and had to be used through trial and error while reading and interpreting source code, are documented as they develop and later become easy to use.
        - Documentation is an easily transferable resource
    - On the other hand, the mental model built by that hardship s difficult to transfer resources
        - There are things that can be done by people who have this mental model and can do it "this way," but can't be done by people who entered the market after the library was in place.

        - Mr. P., who uses Tool X as a black box, doesn't develop his thinking.
        - Q who understands what's in it, does he develop thoughts?
            - By what mechanism?
            - Like, "I should be able to change the 'C' to a 'C'."

- When you wrote this, you implicitly assumed your own pattern of m
    - In this story, I am not the M pattern.
    - I think I'm S.

- Relay information to the source when the mediator observes a demand
    - Communication of information without market distribution
- But this diagram seems a little off to me.
    - S is too passive.
    - Well, it's non-committal.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/db55c9d126b03d986a6b532ae882732f/thumb/1000)
    - First of all, I was originally one of the S's.
    - M was an active relationship builder with many Ss.
        - My job was as a consultant, so there must have been a lot of demand on the other side that S. couldn't see from me.
        - I think they were [[trader]] by observing the demand, then selecting the appropriate supply, consulting with them, getting advanced technical knowledge that was not distributed in the market, and then returning it to the demand side.
- It started out like that, with a non-committal engineer getting involved with a consultant with strong involvement skills, and then I, who understood the value of getting involved, actively engaged in the act of getting involved, and that's how the first figure came to be.

Abstraction of interesting concrete examples
    - [[interesting]]

    - [[Close Cycle]]
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/サイクルを閉じる/icon' alt='サイクルを閉じる.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - This specific case itself is not that useful.
    - I saw this tweet and thought, "I see, I never thought of that idea."
        - Then why didn't I have the idea, something was missing, what was it that I was missing?
    - Abstraction.
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/8aa4e08aff1f3b44fb97d3998f5d97fd/thumb/1000)
        - The original one connects A and C by cutting out B as the middle man.
            - Pointing out that "only different parities can be connected" is an assumption.
        - The rest of the article says, "One person can have both parities."
            - Pointing out that "either/or parity" is an assumption.
            - I've been thinking of things that aren't parity as parity.
            - You are making the mistake of assuming that attributes that are not transgressions are transgressions.
        - # Blind Spot Card Candidate

Scrapbox can [Stock of associations
- Is there always value in associative links? Should we just create more and more links?
- That's a sign of [[Incorrect KPI setting]]...
- For example, it is not useful to write "book" on every book page
- What is a useful link and what is not?
- Anyone can look at a book and think "this is a book", commodity
    - When few people see A and associate it with B, isn't there value in linking A and B?
        - [[The Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard" and "The Correct Theory of the Evil One."]]
    - Something like connecting distant objects in the space of Embedding.
    - Why is it worth it?
    - Is it because connecting far away allows us to explore faster by following it?
        - [[A network of knowledge allows for fast travel]].

I never finished reflecting on the two-hour meeting.
- Because it's growing while we're looking back.


There's a vein of gold at the end of the dig.
- Nothing.
- A little something.
    - When you dig, you hit a big vein of gold.
- I'm not passionate about it, but I dig it because I was told to dig it.
    - It's not my fault if I dig and find nothing.
    - It's my boss's fault for telling me to dig here, not mine.
    - Give me my paycheck for all the digging I do.
    - Do you need to dig in with [[passion]]?

    - [[expertise]] in depth
    - And when you reach something that the world hasn't done yet, you get a [[doctorate]].
        - [[The illustrated guide to a Ph.D.]]
- Tried it once and didn't like it.
    - I'm the type of person who moves around and digs a lot.
    - Then fill in the gaps.

- The set of human accomplishments is [[Spiny spikes in higher dimensional space]]
    - There are lots of gaps.
    - [[serial mastery]]
        - [[Serial mastery is a barbell strategy]]

How deep do you dig into your interests and how far do you need to dig to be effective as a "specialty"?
- Processing to [[live ammunition]].
    - Making the card usable.
- What is a real bullet and what is a usable card?
    - Resources not easily acquired by others
        - Resources that cannot be procured in the market
        - [[Activity history is for goods that are difficult to procure on the market.]]
        - It's like processing these goods to make them better weapons.
        - Not 0 or 1, but something that gets bigger and bigger.
            - 0.9 is zero when truncated.
            - It becomes available when 1.
            - While you're using a 1 card, random events can grow it into a 2.
                    - [[Rolling Snowball]]


[[supercooling metaphor]].
- Crystals grow all at once with random stimuli.
- There's no point in stimulating a lot of uncooled water.
- The "cold state" is important.
        - [[Parable of the New Combination and the Surface of the Water]]
        - It is pointless to create only bonding when there is no difference in the water surface.


[Connecting the Dots
    - [[Opportunities for decision-making are a dime a dozen.]]
- The value is determined by [[Retrospective]] after the results are in.


Enrichment increases the probability of bonding occurring.


I don't know where to look to acquire what I don't know now.
