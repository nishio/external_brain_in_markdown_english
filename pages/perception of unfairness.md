Perceived injustice / unfairness perception is,
- Definition: a subjective perception that an event or treatment is so rated as "unfair and outside of legitimate standards". It refers to "seeming/feeling" that way, rather than whether or not it is actually unfair.
- Different from what?
    - [Justice sensitivity = A personality trait (tendency) to find and react strongly to injustice.
    - Perceived unfairness = Evaluation of the level of state that occurs in each situation and how often it occurs (how much unfairness do you think you see).
- Types of [[injustice]] covered (4 typical classifications)
    - 1.[[Inequity of distribution]]: Unjust distribution of results, rewards, and burdens
    - 2.[[Procedural unfairness]]: The decision-making process and rule operation are unfair.
    3. interpersonal (interaction) inequity: [[rudeness]], prejudice, lack of respect
        - [[Inequity in interpersonal interaction]]
        - [[対等でない]]、[[対等ではない]]、[[対等に扱われてない]]という気持ち<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    4. unfairness of information/explanation: Insufficient or dishonest disclosure of reasons/information
        - [[Inequity of information]].
- Viewpoint:
    - Victim's perspective (I'm taking the brunt of it)
    - Observer's perspective (others are being treated unfairly)
    - Perpetrator's perspective (I may have done injustice to others)
- How to measure (example): on a self-report scale
    - Likert-graded "I often see/get unfair treatment in my daily life," etc.
    - How unfair do you feel it is" rating for specific case assumptions (vignettes)
    - Depending on the field of study, the IEQ (Injustice Experience Questionnaire) in the pain domain and the Organizational Justice in the Workplace (Distribution, Procedures, and Interactions) scale measure proximity concepts.
- Related psychological processes:
    - High perceived unfairness is more likely to be associated with anger, hostility attribution bias, and distrust, and can be associated with whistleblowing and norm-corrective behavior, while increasing the risk of reactive aggression, depression, and stress.
- A simple mathematical view (reference):
    - There is a formulation in the literature that a large discrepancy (e.g., bias in $A/C$) between the actual quantity $A$ obtained and the "quantity you think is reasonable" $C$ is likely to cause unfair perception.
In short, inequity perception is "the evaluation of events" and justice sensitivity is "the trait of ease of evaluation". In research and interventions, it is helpful to separate the two to gain perspective.
