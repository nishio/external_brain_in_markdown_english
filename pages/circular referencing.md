title: "circular referencing"
---

- Circulatory references are often thought of as if they are bad
- It's good if it's beneficial even if it's a circular reference.
- At first glance, it may sound like a radical thought, "It's okay to make circular references."
    - However, in [[Dynamic systems]], there is nothing strange about a value X being represented as $X_{t+1}=f(X_t)$.
    - It's not even strictly a circular reference because the time is off.
- It is [[excessive abstraction]] that humans equate $X_{t+1}$ and $X_t$ by calling both "X"!
