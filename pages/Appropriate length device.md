title: "Appropriate length device"
---

- Writing on a sticky note is a deterrent to not writing [[long sentence]].
- On the other hand, there is often a pattern of writing only words, like "sticky notes" or "short sentences.
    - Not an instant no-no, but better to fatten them up.
    - Sticky notes won't prevent this.

- If it was to create a KJ method support system,
    - Let them write out short or long sentences without worrying about it anyway, and the system will ask them
    - This is kind of long, but in a nutshell, what does it mean?"
    - I know this is short, but what would you like to say to make up for it?"

I'll try to keep it short.
- Sticky note is not a long deterrent
- Sticky notes do not deter those that are too short.
- Write first without worrying about length.
- The system asks questions and makes them of reasonable length.
