title: "A prophecy that hits a wall"
---

"Because of ownership, we run into a wall where the design patterns of the majority language are largely unintelligible."

I thought to myself, "I don't say these things anymore.
- If your future prediction tells you that there is a wall in the direction that other person A is going, whether or not you will tell it to other person A.
- Now I am.
    - Might: A word to suggest a possibility
    - Might be: keep a record of what you suggest.
    - Do not: try to persuade if the other party is not convinced of the possibility
- After all, predicting the future is subjective and difficult to persuade
    - There's no point in trying to persuade them, especially if they're not stakeholders.
            - [[Don't persuade people you don't need to persuade.]]
    - Mr. A can go ahead and hit the wall.
    - Maybe they won't bump into each other.
    - Before Mr. A reaches the wall, people who hit the wall earlier than Mr. A might [[punch a hole in the wall]].
        - And in that case, for Mr. A, it's no different than if there were no wall.
- Rust's concept of ownership makes design patterns in Java and other languages infeasible or unhelpful
    - I think this future prediction is almost certain.
    - When Java became popular, people who came from C, etc. and could not adapt to the new concepts and used only static methods came out and were called [[static uncle]] and ridiculed.
        - [static uncle [https://xtech.nikkei.com/it/atcl/watcher/14/334361/122100450/#:~:text=while](https://xtech.nikkei.com/it/atcl/watcher/14/334361/122100450/#:~:text=while) %E3%80%81static method calls the instance,uncle%E3%80%8D E3%80%82]
        - I suspect this history will repeat itself.

I'm afraid that people who have a good impression of Rust are probably just "airheads" who have only done Hello World, considering the dilemma of the industry that was always worried about Nulpo and wished there was no such a complicated language.

> [tanakahisateru](https://twitter.com/tanakahisateru/status/1693976092506472461) If we actually adopt a language that is currently working in another language at the whim of a superior who has no idea what he is doing and says, "I hear it has a good reputation, so let's adopt it," I think we will run into a wall that will allow us to migrate as is. I think that if we do this, we will run into a wall where the design patterns of the majority language will not be understood due to ownership rights. Well, it's a statement that makes it even more combustible, isn't it?

> [tanakahisateru](https://twitter.com/tanakahisateru/status/1693978085853679857) My point is that Scala is pretty much a continuation of Java, and if you really start trying to use Rust in a big way, you're going to get a lot more allergic reactions from a lot of people. I'm focusing on the fact that Java and Scala are pretty close, and I'm sure many people will have a more severe allergic reaction if they really start trying to use Rust in a radical way, because of all the language features related to problems that will inevitably come up in an incremental way like in Scala.

> [tanakahisateru](https://twitter.com/tanakahisateru/status/1693986339388285012) var and mutable and writing exceptions would result in a compile error Scala, and then around variables and quadrature operations. I wonder what would have happened if I had been forced to branch fundamentally and put everything on a reactive framework.
