title: "Don't let them know the extent of your capabilities."
---

As the Japanese proverb goes, [[a wise man keeps some of his talents in reserve]].

from [[The Art of Worldly Wisdom]]
Don't let them know the extent of your capabilities.
xciv

A wise man does not echo his knowledge and abilities to the bottom if he wants to be respected by all. He allows you to know them, but not to understand them. No one should know the extent of his abilities, lest he disappoint you. No one has the opportunity to fully understand him. For speculation and doubt about the extent of his talents, however great they may be, arouses more adoration than accurate knowledge of them.
