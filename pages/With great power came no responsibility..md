Taking Google as an example, at first they monopolized the market by providing quality search, but then they intentionally degraded the search quality by favoring advertisers and business customers. Today, Google search is full of advertisements and AI-generated worthless information, and only siphons off profits while keeping users locked up.

This "meta-dickification" is carried out through internal corporate "twiddling," such as algorithmic wage discrimination in the gig economy that examines nurses' financial status in real time and offers lower-paying jobs to nurses with high debts. This is a method of exploitation that is only possible in a digitalized world.

The prevalence of these problems is due to the fact that for the past 40 years antitrust laws (competition laws) have been skimmed and monopolies tolerated, regulators have been captured by corporations and regulations have not worked, and the law prohibits circumventing digital locks (DRM) to improve services. .......

However, with the Trump administration's destruction of trade agreements, there is a great opportunity for "de-metaxification". Countries could develop interoperable tools and services that are not bound by U.S.-led IP laws and DRM, freeing users from U.S. Big Tech.

The final solution will require stronger antitrust laws, regulatory rehabilitation, interoperability, and worker solidarity. In particular, workers' solidarity and resistance to corporations will be a powerful counterbalance to metaxification.

## Claim 1: "Google intentionally degraded the quality of its search results in order to increase its own advertising revenue."
- This claim is supported to a certain extent by internal documents and testimonies revealed from antitrust court battles in the U.S. and other sources. Specifically, internal Google e-mails and documents have been made public, and the results of internal experiments show that lowering the quality of search results does not have a significant negative impact on revenue, and also suggest that there was a move within the company to prioritize advertising revenue over improving the user experience.
    - Strategies Read from Internal Emails: In the 2023-2024 U.S. Department of Justice v. Google antitrust case (United States v. Google LLC), emails between Google executives were presented as evidence. According to their contents, it was clear that there was a conflict between the search services division and the advertising business division over growth measures that were negative for users (i.e., measures that would damage the search experience). These internal communications suggest that intentionally lowering the quality of search results does not result in a loss of users or a decrease in revenue, and it has been confirmed that there was an internal tug-of-war between those who wanted to provide users with high-quality results and those who wanted to prioritize revenue maximization. In fact, the publicly disclosed e-mail stated that "Google can maintain revenue even if search results deteriorate," indicating that the executives were aware that an increase in search queries would lead to an increase in revenue (the more times users search again and again, the more opportunities they have to be exposed to advertisements).
    - Management Decisions and Declining Quality Trends: In addition, in June 2020, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet (Google's parent company), merged the previously independent search and advertising departments' chain of command, placing the head of the advertising business at the head of the search department. This decision was made to unify search and advertising. This decision to integrate search and advertising is seen by watchers as a shift from "user-first" to "revenue-first. In fact, in the DOJ lawsuit, the judge in charge of the case focused on the fact that Google had been gradually raising the price of search ads while limiting search query report information for advertisers and otherwise lowering quality, which he found to be evidence of the company's illegal attempts to maintain its monopoly. While these actions directly relate to the quality of search results for users, they also confirm the company's prioritization of revenue over the overall quality of its products.

Findings: In light of internal documents and court testimony, there is strong evidence to support the claim that Google intentionally lowered search quality to increase ad revenue. Google itself has not publicly admitted this, but internal analysis and communications suggest that there was a strategy that prioritized revenue over search quality, and claim 1 is highly likely to be true.

## Claim 2: "U.S. gig workers (especially nurses) are placed in a system where wages are algorithmically adjusted (e.g., by ShiftKey) based on credit card debt and other personal financial circumstances."
Recent research reports and surveys have provided supporting evidence for this claim as well. The nursing gig work (on-demand staffing) platform ShiftKey and similar services (e.g., ShiftMed and CareRev) use algorithms to dynamically determine the amount of compensation offered to nurses. Researchers and experts point to these wage-determination algorithms as a "black box" that fluctuates according to each worker's individual circumstances, and as an emerging problem in the labor economy.

- Algorithmic Individual Wage Determination: A think tank report (Roosevelt Institute) released in December 2024 conducted a detailed study of wage determination methods in the gig nurse industry. The report found that in some cases, on-demand nursing applications offer different hourly rates to different workers for the same job description. Because wages are not uniform and vary for each individual, this is a "black box wage" where the algorithm's calculation criteria are not visible to the worker. Legal scholar Veena Duval calls this "[[algorithmic wage discrimination]]," and describes it as a method of paying different compensation to different workers for the same job.
- Personal data and economic conditions taken into account: At issue is the data on individual workers that such algorithms use to determine wages. The aforementioned Roosevelt Institute research report suggests that gig nursing platforms may adjust pay based on the following information about each nurse
        - The minimum wage amount the nurse previously accepted (how low the nurse has tolerated pay in past jobs)
        - How often they bid (apply) for shifts (frequent job seekers are likely to have income difficulties)
        - Information about the person's financial burdens and borrowing status, such as credit card debt
    - The system may take all of these factors into account, estimate the minimum wage that the person would accept, and how desperately the person needs the work, and offer a lower wage to match. For example, the more debt a person has, the lower his or her wages may be. In fact, some nurses who participated in the survey reported that they felt their wage offers were unfairly low compared to other nurses working in the same application.
    - Competitive bidding puts downward pressure on wages: In addition to these algorithmic adjustments, the platform also puts downward pressure on wages by forcing workers to compete with each other for compensation. On ShiftKey, for example, nurses bid on open shifts at their preferred hourly rate, with the more popular shifts more likely to go to the lowest bidder. In addition, some applications charge a fee for bidding for a shift, so workers offer lower wages in order to get the job even if they have to pay the fee, a vicious cycle. This creates a "race to the bottom," where economically strapped workers are forced to accept lower wages than others. In short, there is a strong possibility that the algorithm implicitly understands the economic situation of each worker and sets individual wages at the lowest level that is just barely acceptable.
- Institutional and legal points: labor researchers and policymakers are beginning to take notice of these realities. In a circular issued in 2024, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) warned of problems when AI and algorithms are involved in hiring and employment terms and conditions, and mentioned "algorithmic wage discrimination" in the circular. This is primarily a concern about individually optimized wage decisions in the labor market at large, not just for gig workers, but in the context of cases on platforms such as Uber and ShiftKey. Academic studies (e.g., Professor Duval's work at the University of California, San Francisco) have also criticized this issue as an unfair practice that could deviate from the traditional "equal pay for equal work" principle.

VERIFICATION: Reliable research reports and expert analysis suggest that the claim that gig-worker nurses have their wages algorithmically adjusted according to their individual economic circumstances is true. Although the companies have not officially disclosed the details of these algorithms, interviews conducted by independent researchers and testimonies from insiders indicate a high probability that such [[wage optimization based on personal data]] (discrimination to the detriment of workers) is indeed taking place. . Based on the above, we can conclude that claim 2 also has a reasonable basis for confirmation and is a highly plausible claim. References and sources of information: publicly available court documents (U.S. Department of Justice, Texas Attorney General public documents, etc.), Roosevelt Institute reports, and reliable media reports (Open Markets Institute commentary and Common Dreams articles). Preference was given to analyses by academic experts and government agencies to verify each claim.
