title: "empathy"
---

A thought that makes you feel as if you could observe something about another person's inner life that is unobservable.
They sometimes think they have or do not have "empathy" based on a few successes or failures. [[overgeneralization]].

It is not a special ability to read the inner life of others that cannot be observed,
In some cases, you understand by listening to the other person carefully. The term [[listening closely]] is sometimes used.
There is an expression, "One mouth, two ears, and you need to hear twice as much as you speak."

When a sufficient amount of information is collected from a particular person, it becomes possible to emulate that person's thought patterns.
It is easy to do, especially for those who think in logic, because if you know what they are given, you can emulate them in logic. see [[Differences in axiomatic systems]].
Sometimes the expression "acquisition of a [[mental model]]" is used.
