I pulled artificial grass on the balcony.
I just put a 1 square meter artificial grass mat on my small balcony, but it's quite an interesting change in atmosphere. I'm about to make coffee and eat some bread.

In addition, artificial turf is now recognized as "a long-furred rug made of waterproof material.

- Can be cut with scissors.
- Note that fine plastic pieces are produced when opening and cutting.
    - Cat tried to eat it, dangerous.

- Even if left out when it rains, the surface dries quickly because of its water repellency.
- But when you sit down, you get used to it about as much as a lawn wet with morning dew.
    - If you don't like that, I suggest you roll it up and leave it standing.
    - The reason is that when it's horizontal, there's no place for the water to escape and wait for it to dry on the spot.

Bought the second one.
- I couldn't stretch my legs or lie down in one piece because it was one meter long.
- When cutting with scissors, sliding the scissors along the seam makes it easier to cut straight.

    - Last time I made a vertical joki joki cut, so the cut was messy.
- Excess pieces can be cut into pieces and piled up to make a fluffy cushion for the lawn.

- Might be a good idea to water the artificial turf when it's hot.
- If you sprinkle it normally, it will run off quickly, but with artificial turf, it will retain some water.
