- There is room to reduce the selection load and improve learning efficiency through the use of AI, expert recommendations, level diagnostic tools, etc.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Books that match one's level of knowledge are likely to reduce learning waste and provide effective understanding. However, finding the ideal book involves many time and effort costs, including searching for book reviews, consulting with experts, and sample trial readings.
    - To address this issue, AI-based text difficulty assessment tools, questions in online communities, and aptitude diagnosis through knowledge tests could be considered. Combining these tools would allow users to more efficiently find the right material for them and, as a result, promote comprehension through reading.

- Books have high reliability and depth because they compile systematic knowledge through rigorous editing and proofreading by experts. On the other hand, online information and AI are quickly updated and highly convenient, but may be fragmented and of mixed quality. Therefore, books are not necessarily outdated, and their use in the right places has value.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>

        - The "right place at the right time" means choosing the best source of knowledge for the situation and purpose. Books are useful when a structured and in-depth understanding is needed, while AI and online resources are useful when immediacy and breadth of information are required.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - In-depth expertise is required:
                - Books that have undergone editing by skilled experts are highly reliable and systematic in their information. Books are especially useful if you want to have a solid understanding of the basic theory of a field, to learn in a form close to primary information, or to have the background and historical context of the research.
            - When immediate problem solving or extensive information seeking is required:
                - AI chats, online articles, and community forums are useful for immediate resolution of pinpoint questions, obtaining the latest information, and gathering a wide range of ideas. They are also highly updatable, making them ideal for responding to the latest trends, new technologies, and unanticipated needs.
            - Intermediate use:
                - It is also possible to use AI first to get an overview, and then use books for in-depth study. This step-by-step approach allows for maximum improvement in understanding at minimum cost.
