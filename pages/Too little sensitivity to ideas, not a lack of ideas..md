title: "Too little sensitivity to ideas, not a lack of ideas."

I often see people who don't realize the value of the great ideas they receive from others, and are just blank staring at them.

> [philomyu](https://twitter.com/philomyu/status/1693418459538084327) I think that people who can't come up with good ideas tend to like the idea of "creating something from nothing," while people who can mass-produce interesting ideas are always interested in the elements that abound in nature and society, and can create anything new just by combining them as needed. On the other hand, those who can mass-produce interesting ideas are always interested in nature and the elements that abound in society, and can create anything new just by combining them as needed.
- [[The curse of having to create from zero]].
    - [[combination]]
    - [[Ideas are new combinations of existing ones]].
