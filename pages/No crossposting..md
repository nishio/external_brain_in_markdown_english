title: "No crossposting."

    - [[Virtual Nishio Laboratory]] Operation Policy
    - There are multiple groups as described in [[MMORPG Parable]].
- I'm in all the groups, and I'd prefer not to post the same content in more than one group if at all possible.
- Dare to post to "the group you think is best suited" and the group will gradually differentiate
- At this point, Lab 1 is mostly about the design of the lab structure itself, since the NDA discussion was done after the fact and the decision to create Lab 2 was made after discussing the issue of the number of people in the lab.

- However, I feel that the self-introductions should be the same everywhere, and the management announcements are the same.

- There is no rational reason for the evolution and growth of a group, and it is greatly swayed by the element of luck.
- A well-grown tree should be increased by dividing the roots
