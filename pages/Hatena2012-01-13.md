*1326464756*Google NGram Viewer to find out when the concept of mashups became popular.
The graph below shows search results for mashup, JSON, and XHR.

The following graph shows the evolution of searches done on Ajax.

So I found that mentions of these keywords increased dramatically in 2005-2006.

JSON was created around 2001, and Yahoo and then Google started providing APIs around 2005. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON

XHR was first supported by IE5.0 in 1999, and then Firefox, Opera, and Safari implemented it toward 2005 and it became de facto. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHR

So I thought it was about right with the graph.
