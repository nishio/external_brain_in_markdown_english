- Not fixed and falls according to gravity
    - Metaphors of earthly things
- It is not fixed and gravity does not work.
    - (weightless) space
    - underwater
- Search in the direction of gravity and fix at the point of contact with something.
    - Something = often the ground or floor
        - Metaphor for [establishment

    - A large wall would be a metaphor for "[[Fixed to wall]]".

There are other metaphors for [[curtains]] that are visible and fixed, but not hit-and-run.
