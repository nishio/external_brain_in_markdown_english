- 1 year ago
    - A page with only links to articles that I found interesting.
        - And there's a typo in the title.
        - It was interesting to read it again, so I wrote a few thoughts and linked to related ones
    - Technical Memo
        - Title lacks information, so add, add link, and specify date and time of experiment.
    - Notes on relevant pages in an attempt to explain what was experienced.
        - I was going to explain it in detail, but it got tedious.
        - I only wrote the important parts.
- n years ago
    - I wrote 12 years ago about something related to what was recently discussed.
        - Cut out and title
    - I saw the article and thought, well, I've talked about that on Twitter recently.
        - I thought I'd just post the URL without the title and summarize it later.
        - Summary.
        - I searched for keywords and found relevant pages.
        - They linked up.
