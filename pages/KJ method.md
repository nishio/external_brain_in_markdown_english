If you looks something interesting but the auto-translated English is not good enough to understand it, feel free to let me know at [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en). I'm very happy to spread my thought to non-Japanese readers.
KJ Method
In English-speaking contexts, the KJ method is often referred to as the [[Affinity Diagram]]. However, from my perspective as native Japanese reading Jiro Kawakita's work in Japanese, the introduction of the KJ method in English as part of the "[[Seven Management and Planning Tools]]" appears to have oversimplified and omitted important elements, resulting in a completely different methodology.
