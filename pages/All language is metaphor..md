title: "All language is metaphor."
---

- [[Mathematics as Metaphor]] p.47
Interpretation by Nishio
    - [[metaphor]] is to connect A and B such that A cannot be B
- then language is basically a metaphor, since word A cannot be the B to which it refers.

That's a funny thing to say.
- It's not the author who said this, but it's interesting that he picks this up to explain the metaphor in his book on metaphor

    - [[quick and dirty logic]] reminded me of this
        - I couldn't remember the title [[Mathematics as Metaphor]], so I was searching for [[Mathematics and Metaphor]].
