title: "Usefulness of the classics"
---

- Information is created in large quantities every day.
    - Observing the new book section of a bookstore month by month is very revealing.
- It is physically impossible to input all of that large amount of information to yourself #Cognitive limitations
- So you need to make a choice.
- However, I cannot properly [[select]] information in areas that I am not familiar with. Because I do not have the criteria to judge whether it is good or bad.
    - [[usefulness]] in [[classic]] must be filtered by time

- The downside, of course, is that the situation at the time it was written and the situation today may have changed
- Does not work well in fast changing areas
- But isn't it bad to invest in it in the first place because of the [[obsolescence]] speed of knowledge in fast changing fields?

    - [[Test of Time]]
