Comparison of [[Scrapbox]] and [[Kozaneba]] structures

The relationship between "link" and "vector search" between Scrapbox pages is the relationship between "line" and "proximity placement" between Kozane and Kozane in Kozaneba
- [[Scrapbox's 2-hop link distinguishes between directions]].
    - Kozaneba's link doesn't distinguish between directions?
        - There are rare ones that do, but it's not a mention-subject relationship like the links from the Scrapbox page.
        - [[Scrapbox Link]] is often a "non-existent link" concept.
        - At its root, it is only an existence page.
        - Are there more non-existent pages ahead?
            - Look at the statistics later to see if there are too many
    - There is no non-existent Kozane in Kozaneba
        - Not even in the KJ method.
        - It corresponds to what is called [[associative mood]] rather than physical presence
            - Description by Jiro Kawakita: [[You're abstracting too much.]]
                - There is an associative atmosphere of abstract non-existence around concrete existence.
                - Scrapbox succeeded in externalizing the "associations that have not yet led to a concrete page" in the form of red links.
                - (As written [[Unexplored Junior Achievement Report Meeting]] began)

[[page to split titles that are too long]].
- Split titles that are too long, usually the granularity of Kozane when I'm doing Kozaneba.
- This is a fine label for the KJ method
    - I'm doing about the same thing as "[[knee-swing (gymnastics)]]".
        - Why? Because we have a near-term goal such as "creating lecture materials".
    - Maybe I should do something more coarse grained if I'm lost and want a large area map.
