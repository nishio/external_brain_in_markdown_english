> [Yu_Ayato](https://twitter.com/Yu_Ayato/status/1699221087740190851) The very same is true of [[Nike]], which is increasingly being described as [[digital collectible]] rather than NFT, and the NFT of [[Dior]], which was sold recently, was also titled "[[digital twin]]" rather than NFT. I think that the number of cases approaching NFT from the [[metaverse]] context itself is increasing.

### Summary
.
It was revealed that the eSports project had concealed the sale of the product as NFT, causing a backlash from buyers and players. This sparked a debate about how to relate to NFTs. Some are increasingly referring to the project as a "digital collectible" or "digital twin" rather than an NFT. However, while hiding the fact that one is an NFT has become problematic, others argue that there are more and more patterns that make it difficult to tell that one is an NFT.

### Relevance
.
Nishio's research note, "Thinking about NFT," includes a discussion of the value of NFT and its transparency, which is relevant to this note. In addition, "Notes on the Day of Plurality Tokyo" includes a discussion of how NFTs are used, which is relevant to this Note's discussion of how to present NFTs.

### deep thinking
The debate about how to present NFT and its value illustrates the gap between the evolution of technology and how society accepts it; further discussion is needed on how the new technology of NFT should be accepted and utilized by society.

### summary of thoughts
