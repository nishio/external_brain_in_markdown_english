[[pProjectIndex]]
I'm not sure this is the right project title for me to use when I want to move away from the concept of "motivation," but I haven't come up with a good name for it yet.
- Like pChangeMaker?
- Prompting Action.

Once everything is moved to Kozaneba

- What I've learned from organizing so far
- The "improvements" are being torn in two directions.
    - Route to be put on the current chat system.
    - A route I'm thinking of that can't be done by putting it on the chat system.
        - Retention of per-user information is not possible with the current implementation of the chat system, which forgets information for each conversation.
        - Not a conversation, but an attempt to gather information about physical activity, not chatty.
- There are three levels.
    - There are some suggestions for improvements that can be made without changing the current system of options.
    - There are things that can't be done with the current choice formula, but can be done with a chat system that does natural language processing.
    - Something the current chat system can't do.


- [[20180408Note on task abstraction sticky note]]
- This looks like a good idea to move the whole thing to Kozaneba.
- I'll just do the motivation system part first.



    - [[I would like to think about a non-chat form of Keichobot]]
    - [[Hopefully some thoughts will develop on the relationship between motivational systems and Keichobot.]]
