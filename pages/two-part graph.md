### Summary of notes
.
From the "blind spot card with no picture yet" comes the notion of bipartite graphs, two-side platforms, network externalities, and the notion that they don't have to be the same network.

### Relation to Fragment
.
Fragment 1034 contains the same content as the note. It illustrates the concepts of bipartite graphs, two-side platforms, network externalities, and not necessarily the same network.

### deep thinking
These concepts help us better understand the structure of networks and how they function. In particular, the notion that they need not be identical provides a new perspective on the sharing of information and resources between different networks.

### summary of thoughts and title
.
which provides a new perspective for understanding network diversity and interconnectivity.
