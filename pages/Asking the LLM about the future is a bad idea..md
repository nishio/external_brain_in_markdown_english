title: "Asking the LLM about the future is a bad idea."
---

I think that asking [[LLM]] about [[future tense]] is [[bad]] business in and of itself.
    - [[The best way to predict the future is to invent it.]]
- Written [[future prediction]] is not the best
- Collect, learn and output its not the best future predictions.
- Conversely, maybe [[imagining the future]] is the only task left to humans that LLMs can't do.
