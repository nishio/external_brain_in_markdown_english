title: 'The statement "useless."'

2019-07-03
When the statement is made, "This method is [[useless]]," it is not meant literally.
It means "the speaker has never obtained [[Beneficial Results]] with this method."

From this observation alone, it is impossible to determine whether "this approach does not produce [[beneficial]] results for anyone" or "[[Lack of speaker competence]]".

digression
- If person X says, "Method A is useless, Method B is also useless, ..." and accumulates many cases of "never getting useful results", resulting in an increase in certainty of X's lack of ability.
    - When he said, "Method A is useless," I assume he intended to lower Method A.
    - However, as a result of the act of speaking out, my reputation, not method A, goes down.
        - Intended and opposite effect, interesting. [[human bug]]

relevance
    - [[Poor communication skills]]
    - [[overgeneralization]]
    - [[the subject is large]]
    - [[Seek causes for your failures other than your own abilities.]]
    - [[X is not available.]]
    - [[Before you say design thinking is useless.]]

When someone says that someone else's research is "useless," it is difficult to distinguish whether the research is universally "useless" or whether the speaker simply does not know how to make it useful.
