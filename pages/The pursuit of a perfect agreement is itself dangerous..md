The pursuit of a perfect agreement is itself dangerous.

Political theorist [[Chantal Mouffe]] explains that the pursuit of complete consensus in a democracy is itself dangerous, and that a system in which objections and conflicts (agon) can always be expressed is necessary. According to Mouffe, the public good on which everyone can reasonably agree is a myth, and "consensus-oriented politics" that aims for such a good often involves the "elimination of minorities. Rather, in a healthy democracy, it is inevitable and desirable that there be consensus on certain basic values, but that there be constant clashes of opinion on specific policies. Hence, Mouffe warns that an excessive inclination toward the "politics of consensus" leads people to political apathy or boredom and diminishes democratic participation. This is the position of [[agonism]] ([[controversialism]]), presented as a critique of the Habermasian model of deliberative democracy, which emphasizes the importance of institutionalizing "[[constructive disagreement]]" as opposed to the [[illusion of consensus]].
