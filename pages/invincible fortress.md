I came across it while researching the concept of "invincibles," and it's surprisingly science fiction.
- A world where VR goggles are all over the place.
- AI uses big data analysis to find "invincibles" who are likely to cause mass murders and uses another "invincible" to prevent them from happening.
- The AI wants the human to make the final decision, and the protagonist is forced into that role (in exchange for his/her life).
