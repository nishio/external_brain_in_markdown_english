# the flow of this book

- Chapter 1, "How to Learn Something New," considers how to learn something without [[correct]]. We will explain in detail how to learn by turning [[cycle]] in order to be able to apply it to situations, rather than memorizing it. #Learning Cycles

- In order to turn the learning cycle around, you need "[willingness (e.g., to do something)" as fuel. Chapter 2, "How to Get Motivated," explains how to stay highly motivated, based on data from over 12,000 unmotivated people. #TaskManagement

- We want to remember what we have learned. Chapter 3, "How to Train [[Memory]]," explains how the hardware called the brain works, the results of experiments on how we learn, and how software makes it possible to consolidate memories efficiently. #Interval Repetition Method

- Many people buy too many books and end up with piles of them. Chapter 4, "How to Read Efficiently," discusses how to improve the efficiency of information input centered on [[reading a book]], comparing [[speed reading]] and slow reading methods.

- Chapter 5, "How to Organize Your Thoughts," is about output. We tend to think "learning = input," but it is important to output and verify. However, as the amount of knowledge increases with a lot of input, it becomes a struggle to organize it and communicate it to others. Since human beings cannot copy the entire knowledge in our brains to others, we need to work on cutting, bundling, rearranging, and converting the [[knowledge network]] in our brains into words and diagrams. In this chapter, I will explain how to [[summarize]] many inputs into a form that can be output to others, based on [[Jiro Kawakita's]] [[KJ method]] and my writing method.

- Many people think that intellectual production is a way to come up with new [[ideas]]. I believe that [[Come up with an idea]], [[cultivate a better understanding]], and [[Discovering Patterns]] have some elements in common. In Chapter 6, "How to Come Up with an Idea," we will consider how to come up with an idea and make it a reality. #newcombination

- There are many other things I would like to talk about, but the number of pages is limited. In chapters 1 through 6, I assume that the "what" (what to learn) is already decided, and I explain the "how" (how to learn). However, I believe that "what" is a more important question than "how. In Chapter 7, "How to Decide What to Learn," I will consider this question.
