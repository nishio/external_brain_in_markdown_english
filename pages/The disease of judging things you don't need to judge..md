title: "The disease of judging things you don't need to judge."

- Making the right decision requires careful information gathering.
- High cognitive cost
- I can't afford to waste my time on things I don't need to do.
- It's not a good idea to have a prolonged reflex to information that comes through social networking sites.
- Wasting cognitive costs without creating value.
- #Self-Commandments
