To generate new perspectives and ideas, it is necessary to go beyond existing frameworks
- The capitalist-labor rivalry was established at a time when the means of increasing productivity was the purchase of production equipment by capital. Today, however, knowledge has become increasingly important, and this antagonistic structure has become obsolete. This indicates the difficulty of updating the frame of thinking.
- The KJ method of reflection points out the problem of information overflow and messiness. This is an important issue to consider when thinking about how to organize and analyze information. Another problem noted is that it does not generate new ideas, using only the parts that match the existing framework of ideas.

Uncomfortable metaphors have the potential to generate new perspectives and ideas by expanding them before denying them. This can be a useful technique for creative thinking and idea generation.

Anti-vulnerability is the state of being able to benefit from the positive aspects of uncertainty without suffering serious harm from the negative aspects of uncertainty. This is an important perspective in risk management and strategy development.


The concept of derailment = association = new combined discovery is considered an important process for generating new perspectives and ideas. This is considered an important process for increasing freedom of thought and generating new perspectives and ideas.


- When will you change the front page of the KJ Act?
    - Exciting" because "something new" is created that was not anticipated.
    - It is considered an important process for generating new perspectives and ideas.
- Re-titling in collaborative editing projects
    - Communication Issues
    - Challenges when people with different perspectives and understandings work together
    - The Importance of Collaboration
    - Also related to SECI model
- Regarding the relationship between the SECI model and the PDCA cycle, S (collaboration) is necessary before PDCA
    - Share tacit knowledge before creating a plan to create a plan that makes sense.
- Regarding anxiety tolerance, this shows the connection between human psychology and behavior. This is also related to the interpretation of "skillful and slow is better than poor" and the re-titling of the project in the joint editing project.
- Having a "skillful or slow is better than poor" perspective requires a certain level of anxiety tolerance. People with low anxiety tolerance tend to be "zero-risk oriented" and may have a tendency to pursue short-term success.

## Research Notes

### The British experiment with a three-day workweek
A large-scale experiment with a three-day workweek was conducted in the United Kingdom, and the results showed that most of the participating companies have decided not to return to a two-day workweek. Increased sales, reduced turnover, and lower burnout seem to have been the deciding factors. This indicates that reducing working hours may have a positive impact on productivity and employee wellbeing. However, we need to be careful how we interpret these results and apply them to other countries, regions, and industries.

### Creation of easy-to-read articles
Regarding the way the articles are displayed, the text must wrap at the width of the screen after zooming in on an iPad, and the articles must properly appear in the preview when posted on Facebook or other sites. These are important elements for accessibility of legal documents and need to be taken into account to improve the user experience.

### Capitalist-labor conflict structure
The capitalist-labor rivalry was established at a time when the means of increasing productivity was the purchase of production equipment by capital. Today, however, knowledge has become increasingly important, and this antagonistic structure has become obsolete. This illustrates the difficulty of updating the framework of thinking. In order to generate new perspectives and ideas, it is necessary to go beyond the existing framework.

### Transcript of One Night Werewolf
Reading the transcript of a one-night werewolf game will reveal the thoughts and strategies of the players. This is a useful resource for understanding the human decision-making and communication process.

### Add language model to IBM model 1
Adding a language model to IBM Model 1 may improve translation accuracy. However, if a sequence of words does not appear in the teacher data, it may be judged to have a probability of 0 without smoothing and may not translate properly. This represents an important challenge in designing and tuning machine learning models.

### 2 out of 10 heavy fake coin issues
The problem of finding two heavy fake coins out of ten coins can be determined in four worst-case moves. This is a useful problem for problem solving strategies and algorithms.

### Reflection on the KJ Method
The KJ method of reflection points out the problem of information overflow and messiness. This is an important issue to consider when thinking about how to organize and analyze information. Another problem noted is the problem of using only those parts of the existing framework of ideas that match the existing framework of ideas and do not generate new ideas. This indicates that it is necessary to go beyond the existing framework in order to generate new perspectives and ideas.

### Uncomfortable metaphors
Uncomfortable metaphors have the potential to generate new perspectives and ideas by expanding them before denying them. This can be a useful technique for creative thinking and idea generation.

### Anti-Vulnerability
Anti-vulnerability is the state of being able to benefit from the positive aspects of uncertainty without suffering serious harm from the negative aspects of uncertainty. This is an important perspective in risk management and strategy development.

### SECI model and PDCA cycle
Regarding the relationship between the SECI model and the PDCA cycle, it has been argued that S (collaboration) is necessary before PDCA. This is an important method to share tacit knowledge before creating a plan, which is an important method to create a convincing plan.

### Derailment = association = new combined discovery
The concept of derailment = association = new combined discovery is considered an important process for generating new perspectives and ideas. This is considered an important process for increasing freedom of thought and generating new perspectives and ideas.

### When to change the nameplate in the KJ Act
As for when to change the front page of the KJ method, the idea that it is "exciting" because it creates something unexpected and "new" has been presented. This is considered an important process for generating new perspectives and ideas.
