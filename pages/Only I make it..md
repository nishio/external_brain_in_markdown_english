title: "Only I make it."

> [@hayashi_lanturn](https://twitter.com/hayashi_lanturn/status/1661221965984837633?s=46&t=gkSZtjGEtUZPO0JCzBxCBw): In order to continue [[creative activity]] for a long time, large or small I think it's important to be able to swallow the fact that "no one will be bothered without my work" and then to be able to use "but there's no one else who would make something like this except me" as [[a driving force]].

The state of affairs where people are strongly demanding what you make at a level where they can't do without it [[PMF]].
- Lots of people struggle to pursue that.
- It's not an easy thing to get.

We don't need to create something that no one else feels is worthwhile.
- It's easy to forget, but "I feel valued" is a prerequisite.

If "[[no one but me]] makes that [[thing]] that [[I feel is valuable]]," then "[[I]] have no choice but to make it.

A case of watching someone making something and imitating them.
- This is not "[[no one but]] myself makes it."
    - [People who have never wanted to make it and have never made it.
- Sometimes they are looking for "to be cheered up by the people around them for having made it," not for making it or the thing itself.
- In this case, they imitate the person who is being cheesed off and do the same thing, but when they are done, they stop because they are not cheesed off.
