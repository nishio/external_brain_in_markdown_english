- [[Nodal point of thought 2024-02-01]]
- I shared it with my dinner friends, "It's a messy note," and they said, "It's really messy."

Even if you don't starve with a meal ticket, you might get crappy ramen with one meal ticket, or a chashu mashimashi with three.
- I'm not sure if the system allows multiple meal tickets to be exercised.
    - Assumes anonymous, physically transferable tokens, like paper money.
    - For example, if a breakfast coupon comes to the miner's portal, and if you show it to the restaurant staff, the coupon will be burned on the spot and the meal will be served, and if you don't use it by midnight, the coupon will expire.
    - I think it's a spec bug if meal tickets can be accumulated and exchanged for expensive stuff, and that's my opinion as an IT engineer.
- Aside from that, during the transitional period, I think there could be a form of regular ramen for one meal ticket and chashu mashimashi for an additional 500 yen.
    - The timing of the introduction of meal tickets need not kill the market economy.
    - Payments for "non-essential entertainment" such as "a little something nice to eat."
    - That topping market will naturally arise, but will shrink as the quality of meal-ticket ramen gradually improves.
    - The "current capitalism" and the "universal basic income world" do not switch between 0 or 1, but rather transition smoothly


Where is my main body?
- I don't know if I'm being told to make my physical avatar's hair blonde or what...
    - I'm relatively uninterested in the physical body.
    - I feel that the people who say such things to me and I have different perceptions and values.
    - I don't feel the need to be the same, so I'm smiling and going through the motions.
- The main body is the output information
- Q: But doesn't that mean that there is no "fun!" feelings, right?
    - When AI can write the same sentences that I wrote late at night in a fit of excitement, others will see that I am having fun.
- Observations from me that will be gone when I die.
    - What you output will remain after you die.
    - In the long run, only the latter is me.
- Talk about being happy to see your child sleeping.
    - I think that's a good thing.
    - I'll never get it in my life, so from my point of view it's a resource I can't procure.
    - There should be many sources of happiness.
    - On the other hand, "happiness" is a resource that belongs to the individual and is lost with death
    - From a long-term perspective, from the standpoint of civilization, it's like a ripple.


People who play games, people who don't.
- Who reads novels and who doesn't?
- An element of entertainment
- There should be plenty of sources of enjoyment.
- There is no need to force someone who says, "I don't do X" to do it.
    - All it says is, "You are someone who doesn't get any enjoyment out of X."
    - Some people feel disrespected when this is said and it happens, so don't say it.
    - I myself am someone who doesn't get much enjoyment from watching sports, so I'm amazed that my friends really travel around the world to watch soccer games.
        - And it seems beneficial that friends are being made from that play.
        - On the other hand, I can't go to a sporting event I don't enjoy to make friends.
        - So this is something we cannot control.
    - I happen to find [[Murder Mysteries]] interesting, and I'm being invited to join, which is great because I'm making more friends!
        - After all, the act of being interested in something and pursuing it expands the world.
        - So was digging deeper into programming languages.


When inviting someone to join you, create an escape.
- Can you do it on this day?" "No, I can't do it on this day" is acceptable.
- No "I want to play a game with you, when are you free?" because there is no way out of it.


Murder Mysteries
- Theory of high psychopathic rate
- Some people have a hard time being the culprit.
    - People like that are hard to call.
- Murder Mystery itself is suited for psychopaths.
- Extreme use of the word "psychopath."
- Even if you don't become the culprit, "being suspected of being the culprit" happens.
    - If you find that hard, you're not the right person for it.
- A story about how some people subjectively "have a hard time reading the air" in response to Murder Mystery.
    - Are you reading the air?
- Which is it?
    - I don't need to be able to read the air, because I can't read the air.
    - Since Nishio is enjoying himself, he must actually be able to read the air."
- The latter [[air-reading is not a zero-factor]], so I think Nishio-san can read somewhat.
