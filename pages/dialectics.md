The idea that a proposition (thesis) and a proposition that denies it (antithesis) are considered, and a new proposition (synthesis) is obtained by abandoning them and rising to a higher level (cessation: Aufheben). #comprehension
Hegel's dialectic is famous, but the concept of "conflict and its resolution" is widely used beyond it.

[[TRIZ]] is an attempt to view patents as "conflicts between physical performances and their resolution," and to extract patterns of what can be used for what conflicts.

- [[NMDA]] is a method of mapping a problem to a space of analogies for the purpose of resolving conflicts in real-world problems.
