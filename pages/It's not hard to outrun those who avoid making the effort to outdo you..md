context
> [@TJO_datasci](https://twitter.com/tjo_datasci/status/1534032899644981248): If you want to stand out from others, you have to make an [[effort]] to stand out from others somewhere. But this kind of talk is usually not understood.

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1534077281626656768): When I say "If you want to stand out from others, you have to make outstanding efforts", the expected response is "I can't make such efforts", But most of the others say that and don't make any effort at all, so just a little bit of effort will give you an advantage.
