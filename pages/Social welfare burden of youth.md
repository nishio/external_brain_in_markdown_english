<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>According to the "White Paper on Aging Society in 2022 []"](https://www8.cao.go.jp/kourei/whitepaper/w-2022/html/zenbun/s1_1_1.html) and "[White Paper on Aging Society in 2023 [https://www8.cao.go](https://www8.cao.go) .jp/kourei/whitepaper/w-2023/zenbun/05pdf_index.html]" show that Japan's population is aging rapidly and that this is having a significant impact on the social welfare burden on the young. As of October 1, 2021, the elderly population aged 65 and over accounted for approximately 28.9% of the total population, and this percentage is expected to increase further in the future. In particular, according to future population projections, it is estimated that by 2045 (year 2065), one out of every 2.6 persons in Japan will be 65 years of age or older, and the number of people of working age supporting one elderly person will be 1.3 persons. As a result, there are concerns that [[social security benefit costs]] will increase as the youth population and [[working-age population]] continue to decline, and the increasing social welfare burden on young people is becoming an issue.

The Japanese government is promoting various measures to help the elderly lead healthy and active lives. Examples include comprehensive promotion of health promotion, operation of a sustainable long-term care insurance system, enhancement of long-term care services, operation of a sustainable medical care system for the elderly, and promotion of measures to support the elderly with dementia. Efforts are also being made to establish an all-generation social security system and to realize a universal society, aiming to build a society in which all people, from the young to the elderly, support each other ([2023 White Paper on Aging Society [https://www8.cao.go.jp/kourei/](https://www8.cao.go.jp/kourei/) whitepaper/w-2023/zenbun/05pdf_index.html]).

Thus, the Japanese government has implemented a variety of measures to address the problem of the social welfare burden on young people in an aging society, but it will be necessary to revise policies and introduce new measures to accommodate the changing demographic structure.
