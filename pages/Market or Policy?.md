> [kazuho](https://twitter.com/kazuho/status/1701925126537953557) To begin with, salary is basically determined by the point where the supply and demand for the labor match. If you are paid less for a certain type of work even though you have the same skills, it is probably because you are choosing a job that is in oversupply (in other words, a job that is scarce but popular)....

> [kazuho](https://twitter.com/kazuho/status/1701926822135652822) Just like why Tokyo pays more than rural areas (or California more than Tokyo, or Japan more than Vietnam) for the same job. Because if you don't raise salaries, you won't attract people (OR you'll attract people even if you lower the salaries).

> [kazuho](https://twitter.com/kazuho/status/1701930040269885946) So, while I sympathize with the lamentations of the university faculty, I don't think it's a problem with the system or with the state's finances, nor do I think it's solvable. ...

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1701972740603785530) There are different interpretations of whether [[university faculty]] are workers whose salaries are determined by the benefits they receive, or whether they are [[public infrastructure]] that the government should invest in for the future. Seems to be.

> [kazuho](https://twitter.com/kazuho/status/1702048611046146120) Whether it's public infrastructure or not, salaries will go up if we don't get the people we need, and as long as we get the people we need, they won't go up.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1702168922546642961) Is it "[[policy]]" or "[[(the) market (as a concept)]]" that determines "[[necessary]]"? is. [[Public infrastructure]] is invested in through policy because "[[if]] left to the market, necessary investments will not be made.

- > According to the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology's National Institute of Science and Technology Policy, China's R&D expenditures in 2016 totaled more than 45 trillion yen, more than tripling in 10 years. This amount is more than double that of Japan and is approaching that of the U.S., which is in first place.
