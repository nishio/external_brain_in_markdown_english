> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1812104661459247545) The mechanism of the style of living that reveals the individual and the style of living that doesn't (there are several patterns to this again) are two different things, and the latter person can use their own experience to If the latter person gives advice to the former, it will seem misguided to the former person, and you don't guarantee the risk of following it.
It is not good to write something critical of an organization because it tends to be interpreted as criticism of the organization to which you belong.
A situation where one person in a volunteer circle who is not paid in any way is criticizing a certain kind of behavior that is not actually considered a problem by the organization that is the main payer of the salary.

The president liked me on the web.


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1812126274963529781) "Takuji Izawa was angry with me, saying that he wanted to talk about Takahiro Yasuno, who was bound not to mention anything other than the four main candidates during the election."
>  I missed it, I wonder if it's on TVer or something.
>  >FzkWkkk0wwXFcuKG: TBS Info 7days
>
>  I found the opening timpani dive by Mr. Shinozaki of Kanagawa Philharmonic Orchestra too funny, and then Mr. Takahiro Yasuno appeared on stage.
>
>  Mr. Takuji Izawa angrily said, "I wanted to talk about Mr. Takahiro Yasuno, who was bound not to mention other than the four main candidates during the election period.
>  This is something the people of Tokyo will be upset about.
> [r28](https://x.com/r28/status/1812133678275051811) I was watching. Izawa-san, you said it pretty strongly.
>  7days doesn't seem to be available on TVer or anything.
>  For what it's worth, there was an article.

[Quiz King Takuji Izawa Complains about Election Coverage: "Does This Make Any Sense? (Daily Sports) - Yahoo! News](https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/62b018559d11123b4fc289437280e9b8a63d9f0d)
> Recently, politicians are expected to be perfect, or rather, perfect because they have to choose the best person, but there is no such thing as perfect, so they should just update each other. But there is no such thing as perfect, so we should update each other.
> I wanted to talk about this during the campaign... I wanted to say it so badly, but I was told by all the stations, 'Please don't talk about individual candidates. Does this make sense? I'd like to think about it.
[[If you want perfection, you get into a frying match; there is no such thing as perfection, so update each other]].

Long supplement from the person in question
> [tax_i_](https://x.com/tax_i_/status/1812141121373601860) I don't like to spread the word in an unintended way, and Twitter is not the best place to talk about these things, so I'm going to put a rep limit on it. I don't like to spread it around too much and Twitter is not the best place to talk about this kind of thing, so I'm going to limit the number of replies. I tried to soften the strong expressions by making it comical, but there were some good parts and some bad parts, so I will supplement the content.
>
>  I myself have been told by the media that "this is the way it should be" in terms of the direction of my statements during the campaign, but it was a bit softer, not the best use of the words regulation or repression. No exaggeration. I was also explained why, and I understood it as my job. Personal opinions are another thing, but it's very important to draw the line there. I've never actually felt the pressure to be funny, at least not to me.
>
>  And what I was told was that it is not good to talk too much about by-names because it is biased, not that we should not talk about anything other than the four main candidates. I find the word "certain" to be polysyllabic and inconvenient. I meant to say "pick any one person," but it could also mean "a fixed portion.
>
>  I understand and am aware of that, but in my personal opinion, shouldn't we be taking up more things? I don't want to say who I voted for because of the secret election. I don't want to say who I voted for because of the secret election, but I think it would be easier to talk about this or that on a by-name basis. That's what I was talking about.
>
>  Since this is a live broadcast, please excuse the language. The letter of a statement does not necessarily equal the intended idea, the way you speak, and the contents of your head. I will try to bring it closer, though. I have my ideas, you have yours, and I am not speaking for anyone else.
>
>  I am sorry for the compliments, but I thought there were some discrepancies, partly due to my lack of ability. I will continue to work hard and try to express myself more politely.
>  #Info7days
> [tax_i_](https://x.com/tax_i_/status/1812143114334916894) If you didn't watch the live broadcast, I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about, so I'm glad you'd prefer avoidance over interpretation. There is such a thing as context, and I would be more than happy to be ignored than to cause unnecessary misunderstandings.


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1812298989729202355) If we have a "policy of not mentioning" because we think "[[mentioning is a risk]]" and that policy is too strict and mismatched with the current situation, we ]", we have no choice but to visualize that it is "[[a risk to do]]. Between [[the risk of doing]] and [[the risk of not doing]], the latter tends to be underestimated.
