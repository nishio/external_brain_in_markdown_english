title: "Ritual of the revival of subjectivity"
---

The energy to act actively, proactively, and [[proactively]] seems to wear off and take time to recover when overworked.
But this idea itself is a false assumption, and it is possible that you feel depleted when in fact you are not depleted of anything, what do you do about this?

If energy depletion is imaginary, its counterbalance would be an equally imaginary faith. So, for now, I took the quick way out [[faith in drinks]] and drank a bottle of drink and it's been a while. I got the idea that I should go out for a walk to breathe oxygen, so I walked to the park. [[Walking faith]]. [[Oxygen faith]].

I bought a Morinaga Ramune to get in on the [[glucose faith]].

We have been parading around for two hours. To finish off, we buy the black bitter liquid (coffee) that is the belief of the largest faction and go home.

Hideki Kondo: The energy metaphor seems to be good, but I wonder if it is more likely to cause the structure of temporary memories and knowledge (that make up the context?) to be disorganized and scattered. I wonder if it's because the structure of temporary memories and knowledge (that make up the context?) is disorganized and cluttered. So, the solution is "[[tidying up]], [[tidying up]]."

The [[clutter metaphor]] is convincing. The disruption of the rhythm of life due to a series of events has been a bad thing. By misinterpreting the disruption of rhythm as "I am tired and need to rest," we may have confused our sense of the days of the week or woken up at different times in the morning, and as a result, we may not be able to sleep properly at night?
