title: "metamoderation"

> [@otsune](https://twitter.com/otsune/status/1678244428732051456?s=20): In the old days, [[slashdot]] org used a system called meta-moderation, in which "we evaluate whether a post or comment is excellent" and "the I remember [[slashdot]] org used to have a system called meta-moderation to avoid comments from getting too rough.
> There's a history of things that work as intended in the beginning but gradually stop working.
- [[Slashdot]]

> [@shujisado](https://twitter.com/shujisado/status/1678326771698257922?s=20): It was working exactly, but at a certain point it was decided that [[moderation]] was enough, and the improvements stopped there. On the Japanese side, users became fixed before moderation reached a sufficient level and meta-moderation in particular became meaningless. It requires a huge "light account base".

> [@kazuho](https://twitter.com/kazuho/status/1678609625455951873?s=20): it was compared to the old slad around here, but that was a recognition for those who showed the ability to write excellent comments. Community notes are a lot tougher, if voting is the gateway, not excellent tweets.

> [@kazuho](https://twitter.com/kazuho/status/1678609990544920578?s=20): For those who have tweeted in the past to garner support regardless of party affiliation (this should be able to be automatically parsed), their comments and responses will be displayed first, I think it would have been better to design it in such a way
> [@kazuho](https://twitter.com/kazuho/status/1678611165763751938?s=20): after all, people who can disseminate good information (i.e. get attention with tweets) have less incentive to write community notes!

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1678635598150606850?s=20): I'm not sure that "being able to get attention with tweets" indicates "the ability to disseminate good information", I think it's more about "the ability to stir up emotions".

> [@kazuho](https://twitter.com/kazuho/status/1678636257394524160?s=20): if you understand that I'm paraphrasing the aforementioned "people who have tweeted in the past to garner support regardless of party affiliation"

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1678637584073859080?s=20): then the Community Notes algorithm is measuring exactly that "[[gathering support regardless of party affiliation]]"
