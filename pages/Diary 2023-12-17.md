[[long vertical concepts and wide horizontal concepts]].
- Is [[vertically deep concept]] an appropriate description?
        - [[deep understanding]]
[[trickle down concept]].
    - [[analogy]]

- [[Knowledge Network]]
- [[The bias of easy drawing]]

The relationship between "[[Writing with the expectation that others will process the information]]" and "[I don't expect others to do it.
- If it is in your personal Scrapbox, no one else can write on it.
- If you put it in a [[shared Scrapbox]], other people may write in it.
- Expect there to be "[[an]] unknown development" by the latter.
- But this is a stochastic event.
    - Whether it will develop or not
    - Whether the development is beneficial or not
    - Whether or not I can understand the beneficial development
- Not something that has a definite value [[that has a probability of value]].
    - You are responsible for fitting your expectations, not others.
    - I wrote that in "[I don't expect others to do it.
- By the way, substitute "AI" for "others".
    - At least we can force them to "read and write comments".
    - Development will occur, whether that development is beneficial or not is probabilistic.
    - The responsibility for beneficial development lies with you, not with AI.

- [[One step forward question.]]
    - [[Knowledge Network]]
        - [[Distance is subjective]]
        - [[There is more than one kind of distance.]]
    - [[The bias of easy drawing]]

- Mr. X has a link between concept A and B
- Mr. Y has a link between concepts B and C
- At this time, those [[subjective distances between concepts]] are different for the two of us.
- When Mr. X makes a statement that relates A to B and Mr. Y makes a statement that relates B to C, they both obtain a "link between the distant A and C".

- [[One step forward question.]] As depicted in
- Venn diagrammatic depiction of knowledge.
- Overlaying the knowledge of several people on a single figure.
These are [The bias of easy drawing
- By overlaying them on a single figure [[implicitly assuming that they are a common distance space]].

- Relationship between [[Venn diagram notation for knowledge]] and [knowledge network notation

In light of this, let's look back at the diagram in [One step forward question.

Assuming a knowledge set of A, we asked a question on the edge of A's knowledge set: QA
- This is intended to be both understandable to people in A and an opportunity to step outside of A
    - My own question is QB, but I don't think that comes across directly.
- The explanation of X and Y is no different than what I already wrote
- Z description changes.
    - I felt that the answer Z far from A was just not linked in my B's subjective distance space, but in Mr. C's subjective distance space, there was a link and it was a "close position".
    - Not an answer to the question QA itself, but an answer after "stepping back" to the concept of "difficult questions".
            - [[The optimal solution is not unconditionally determined.]]

[[long vertical concepts and wide horizontal concepts]].
- Is [[vertically deep concept]] an appropriate description?
        - [[deep understanding]]
        - This one might be a little different.
- In mathematics and programming, logical precision allows for concepts that are vertically longer than thinking in natural language.
- Knowledge is transferred from that concept to other areas in [[analogy]].
    - [[trickle down concept]].

About Today's Diary
- I did Dr.Stretch yesterday, fell asleep after dinner, then moved to the futon and went back to sleep and woke up around 5:00.
- Did you sleep well?
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/3d889fdccff517d8299507ff9a9036ad/thumb/1000)
- That gave me a few crystals in my head waiting for output after I woke up.
    - It wasn't in the form of a clear explanation.
    - At any rate, I've got an output.
    - It became clearer and clearer as I wrote it down.
- This phenomenon itself is interesting and I want to save it.
    - Cut it out and you'll lose it.
    - On the other hand, there are components that look like they should be cut out.
    - I don't know what's going on.
        - [The appropriate way to cut out the need is determined after the need is identified.

[[Graph of Thoughts: Solving Elaborate Problems with Large Language Models]]
    - [[Scrapbox is a purifier of ideas]]
- Card-type databases (such as [[information card]]) have been used not only in Japan (such as [[zetterkasten]]).
    - [[Why write on the card?]] ？
    - Because it's beneficial to come across cards I've written in the past.
        - (This is a bit dubious. I'm OK with reading over what I've written in my booklet notes for this purpose.)
- Why is it beneficial to encounter something written by your past self?
    - Because my past self has a different perspective than my present self.
        - Why is it beneficial to be different?
            - Because dialogue with people with different perspectives leads to awareness.
                - Others have different perspectives, why not simply interact with others?
                    - When others don't have knowledge about the subject you now want to develop, it costs you money to communicate it.
