title: "Move to local environment?"

from [[pKeicho]]
Move to local environment?
Moving to a local environment can grab a large memory and keep the instance running.
- For use with BERT, etc.

- What would you like to see called out of the export tool?
    - Why not just use the chat to do the export itself?
