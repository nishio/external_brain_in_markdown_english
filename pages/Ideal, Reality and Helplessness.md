- I mentioned it in the line link, so I cut it out.


This "helplessness" part, another abstraction, is "an assumption contrary to the fact that 'I can't do it.'"
- Isn't that [[policy constraint]]?
- I sometimes think something is "impossible" or [Unconsciously excluded from options
- This can be a case of "physical constraints" that really can't be done physically, or it can be a "policy constraint" that people just think it is.
- By clarifying the reasons for "I can't," once we get to the policy constraints, we may be able to change the constraints themselves.
- First of all, there is the state of not being able to verbalize "I can't" and unconsciously excluding it as an option.
- Next, there is a state of being able to verbalize "I can't do it," but not being able to verbalize the reason why.
- As I verbalize the reason, I see a constraint. We think these constraints are unchangeable, but are they really unchangeable?
