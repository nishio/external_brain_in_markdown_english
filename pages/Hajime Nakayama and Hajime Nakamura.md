- I confused [[Hajime Nakayama]] and [[Hajime Nakamura]].

> Hajime Nakamura (November 28, 1912 - October 10, 1999) was a Japanese Indian philosopher, Buddhist scholar, and scholar of comparative thought. He was a professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo and a member of the Japan Academy. He was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure, the Order of Culture, and the Medal with Purple Ribbon.
