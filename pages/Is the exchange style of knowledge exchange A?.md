Is the exchange style of knowledge exchange A?
- When you consider that [[knowledge exchange]] is also [[exchange]], I think it's a little different to say that the [[interchange format]] of knowledge exchange is A.
I feel that there is a form of [[Public as the object of the gift]], although not necessarily in the form of giving first to the "individual" you meet and then receiving a gift in return.
First gift knowledge to the public, and as a result [[information is gathered to the sender of information]].
I get to know and [[hit it off]] with individuals through that activity.

context
    - [[Information exchange is exchange]]
