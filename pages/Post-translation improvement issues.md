- Post-translation improvement issues
    - Approach to correcting the original text -> not always getting the expected translation
    - Approach to fixing the English text -> the question is what to do when the original text is updated.
    - Approach to fixing the translation system -> difficult
    - I guess I'll end up fixing the English text and not worrying about updating the original.
        - That's the thing with automatic updates.
        - let's see
        - You're forking when it comes to the manually fixed English text.

- [[Post-translation improvement issues]]
- Two types of improvements
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/6d0abd0fc16ca23e92ee7fcf5b0b465d/thumb/1000)
    - The type of improvement that makes what is not there become what it is.
        - This can be achieved by machine translating all Japanese articles.
    - The type of improvements that make some things better.
        - Humans need to start a cycle of improvement.
- Gradually spread through links from key intersections in the network of knowledge

- These two actions are called the same "improvement" but are different
    - So don't think that one system can achieve both goals.
    - If not designed well, one side A will interfere with the other side B.
        - The first step tends to be to start from A, which has a clear way of doing things, but as a result, B, which does not have a clear way of doing things, is hindered by the existence of A and has to be verbalized, which makes it even more difficult to do things.

    - A is for Automatic, H is for Human
    - The previous system only considered the "Japanese to English A" part.
        - As a result, when I read and found something I liked, I had the hesitation of thinking, "If I correct this, it will be overwritten when the original Japanese is updated," and this hindered efficient intellectual production.
- Given all this, the question arises.
    - I'm tracing the design of <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/blu3mo/icon' alt='blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>, which is now "convert to Markdown, then translate and publish in Quartz," but does that fit my purpose?
    - I don't think I did.
        - English H reinterpreted as "human output" rather than Japanese downstream
            - Translation only assists in the "creation of English H
        - When English H is created, a fork has occurred and should be connected to Japanese by a two-way link.
