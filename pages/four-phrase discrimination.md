title: "four-phrase discrimination"
---

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>Shikku-funbetsu is one of the most important logical methods in Zhongguan thought. We will explain this concept in detail:

1. basic meaning:
- Shikkusen is a method of denying the ultimate reality or essence of a matter by examining four possible logical possibilities of a matter and denying each of them.

2. four phrases:
- In general, a four-phrase phrase consists of the following
    - Yes (Affirmative)
    2. nothing (negative)
    3. also or nothing (both positive and negative)
    4. non-existence/non-negativity (neither positive nor negative)

3. purpose:
- The purpose of this method is to transcend any conceptual constructs or extreme views and to present a middle-of-the-road position.

4. examples of application:
- For example, if we apply the four-phrase distinction to the nature of the "ego":
1. the ego exists
2. the ego does not exist
3. the ego exists and does not exist
4. the ego neither exists nor does it not exist

- By examining and denying each of these possibilities, we deny the ultimate reality of the ego.

5. its relation to the Middle View philosophy:
- The four-phrase syllogism is used frequently in Ryuju's Zhong-geum, and is one of the core methodologies of Zhong-guan thought.

6. understanding of the sky:
- Through this method, we understand that things do not have a fixed essence (autopoiesis) and recognize that they exist in an interdependent relationship (karma).

7. practical significance:
- Through shikkusen, the goal is to free oneself from attachments and stereotypes and to have a more flexible and open view of the world.

8. promotion of critical thinking:
- This method encourages deeper insight and critical thinking beyond simple dualism and fixed views.

Shikkusen is not just a logical technique, but an important way of thinking to gain deeper insight into the nature of reality and to detach oneself from attachment. Understanding and practicing it is said to open the way to liberation or enlightenment, the ultimate goal of Buddhism.
