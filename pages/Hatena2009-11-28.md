The laundry cycle has started to turn nicely and socks have been rescued from bed crevices and the like. There are like 10 pairs of socks when folded properly and put away in a box. That's too many. I used to have a single basket for underwear, socks, and towels, but as things got too much, I took out the two stacked baskets and moved the towels to a place closer to the bathroom. As for the underwear basket, it's in plain sight for now, but I'll move it under the bed when the cycle gets going and they get used to it.
