title: "Gather the good and scatter the bad."
---

Synergies occur among the good ones.
- Attentions can shift, or they can stimulate each other to develop.
    - [[network resources]]

Don't be part of the gathering of bad things.
- Bad ones try to gather too.
- Don't help it.

After-the-fact, those that create greater value are considered good
- We don't know in advance which is good and which is evil.
