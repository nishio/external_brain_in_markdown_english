title: '"AI will take our jobs" is a low job resolution.'

Many people who make the statement "[[AI will take your job.]]" are "Low resolution" for the word "[[work]].

Some jobs are easy to automate with AI and others are difficult, and the easiest to automate will be replaced by the least easy to automate.

- Person A, who can use AI, will benefit from automation and get 5 results in 4 hours.
- For person B, who cannot use AI, 1/5 of his job is lost.

Whether or not it's an AI" isn't very essential.
- It just means that when a new tool is introduced, some people can learn that tool and some can't.
- Those who cannot master it will be at a disadvantage in the marketplace. This is a given.

What happens to Mr. B's job at this time is that he moves to Mr. A.

        - [[AI will not take jobs.]], people who learn will take the jobs of those who don't.
- This work used to consume a lot of human time, so Mr. A couldn't do a lot of it.
        - [[automation]] is "lowering the consumption of human time," so those who can automate will be able to do more work in the same amount of time

> [@CrubClub](https://twitter.com/crubclub/status/1565167997475778562?s=21&t=PsE-H6knUrEnC5Di9nAuRw): only if AI is the property of workers, not management. Right.
- Good point. In that sense, Stable Diffusion running on a consumer PC that costs less than 200,000 is a historical epoch.

        - [[AI will take your job and give you three days off a week.]]
    - Rather, since the productive population is declining [[If AI doesn't take away jobs, there will be three fewer days off per month.]]
