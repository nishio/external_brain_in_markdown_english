title: "That's not what I'm talking about."
---

Often, in situations where I'm tempted to respond, "We're not talking about that."
- Objectively, "I do."
- Subjectively, we both think "we're not talking about that" to the other.

Suppose that on a social networking site like Twitter, a statement A generates many objections B and similar objections (in the form of quoted RTs, not in the form of a reply tree) (with a slightly odd reaction C).
- The person who observes this perceives that "many people are opposing the strange opinion A" with the opinion B.

- However, what you ignore as "a slightly strange reaction C" from yourself is, in the eyes of another person, "a strange statement A"
- They assume "B not A" and "D not C" are "the story here" respectively.
    - We both feel "we're not talking about that" to the other.
- Objectively, "I do."
    - Both sides are just not in the [[Observation range]].
