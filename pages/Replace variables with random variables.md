Replace variables with random variables

Does the variable really have to be deterministic?
The reason Newtonian mechanics, which is based on the naive idea that velocity and position can both be determined, does not seem to break down at first glance is that at familiar scales the variance of the random variables becomes negligibly small. The reason is that the probability of rice spilling from a bowl due to tunneling effect is negligibly small. If we had stuck to deterministic ideas on that familiar scale, quantum mechanics would never have been born.

For example, in protocols such as the CSMA protocol used in LANs, if a communication collides, it waits for a random time and retransmits the message.

### Summary of notes
.
Discusses the usefulness of replacing variables with random variables. He points out that the deterministic approach of Newtonian mechanics is valid on familiar scales, but that this may have prevented the development of quantum mechanics. He also gives examples of how stochastic variables are utilized in communication protocols and random choice algorithms.

### Relation to Fragment
.
Fragment 1014, "Replacing Variables with Stochastic Variables," is directly related to the note. The note explains the usefulness of random variables, and the fragment illustrates the concept in detail.

### deep thinking
The introduction of stochastic variables represents an expansion of horizons from a deterministic to a probabilistic perspective. This is an important step in the progress of science and allows for the development of new theories and approaches.
