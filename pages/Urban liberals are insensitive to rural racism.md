> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757256426643451932) I recognize that Dr. Kazuto Suzuki is a respected scholar, although we have different positions on international politics. However, I would like to strongly disagree with opinions such as "Trump is insane. I will state my reasons for this below.

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757257027196456989) First, in the absence of a "capitalism vs. communism" economic system design conflict, it is not at all clear why the United States of America should be spending the blood money of its citizens to maintain peace in the world. First, it is not at all clear why the United States should invest the blood money of the people of the United States in maintaining world peace in a time when there is no "capitalism vs.

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757257522426363965) For example, why should the US across the ocean have to incur huge costs to protect an island in the Philippines? If I were a US taxpayer, I would be totally unconvinced; the same goes for NATO and the US-Japan Security Treaty.

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757258228713541944) After all, whether there are skirmishes in Europe or the Philippines or the Senkaku Islands, far from China and far from Russia, with its vast nuclear arsenal The possibility of a threat to the security of the United States is close to zero. In fact, it would be insane for the U.S. to have any interest in securing the "sovereignty" of those countries.

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757259648930050495) Such a shift in America's position does not stem from Trump's personal political orientation. As evidence, Kennedy, who is still working to run as an independent candidate in the upcoming election, also seems to be backpedaling on providing the "public good" of international political stability.

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757260172798611946) Regardless of the outcome of this presidential election, it seems almost certain that the United States will increasingly lean toward so-called "isolationism. We need to prepare for such a future. The term "sanity/madness" is nothing but an impediment to calm judgment.

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757260780582666375) Second, Trump supporters (MAGA-oriented Republicans) should not be easily criticized. Trump supporters are also quite reasonable. It became clear during the last presidential election that Trump supporters actually discount Trump's "ranting" during the campaign.

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757261243130478829) For example, Trump failed to defend his statement during the 2016 presidential campaign that he would build a wall with Mexico during his term. However, MAGA supporters did not give up on Trump because of that separately.

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757261627815321841) In other words, Trump is "trusted" by his supporters as a "political representative". A representative has broad political freedom of action during his term of office. Promises made during an election campaign are just that: promises, and they are allowed to be violated.

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757262085032182240) This is because politics is extremely complex and it is politically counterproductive if politicians are bound by the promises they make at the time of election. This is why the so-called relationship between voters and politicians is not a "mandate" but a "free mandate.

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757262596217196830) And when there is a certain level of trust established between the voter and the representative, the voter will tolerate the representative's leap of faith, and his or her lack of words and actions. In other words, whether Trump wins the election or not, it must be said that Trump already "represents" a large portion of the American people, like it or not.

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757262979299754078) Third, then, as long as we are dependent on the US for security, the Japanese side should refrain from speaking ill of Trump and his supporters. Thirdly, since Japan depends on the U.S. for its security, it should refrain from easily speaking ill of Trump and his supporters. Such bad-mouthing is dangerous behavior that could damage Japan's national interests.

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757263488085639450) Fourth, the very bad language against Trump supporters (and by extension, many Republican supporters) promotes a division that can be deadly for the United States. This is an important factor in the division of the country.

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757264390607536267) For example, Hochschild, "Dwellers Behind the Wall," reports the perception of one gospel singer who was involved in the Louisiana Republican Women's Association. She said, "This is what liberals think. Southerners who believe in the Bible are ignorant, outdated, uneducated, poor white people. We are all losers. They think we are losers,

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757264878824476940) They think we're the kind of people who discriminate against people based on race, sex, or sexual orientation. Then they probably say they're all fat.", Hock Shield (p. 35). It is this disdain by urban liberals for rural Republicans that exacerbates the division between Democrats and Republicans.

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757265543198114069) American urban liberals are sensitive to racist and sexist attitudes. On the other hand, they are surprisingly insensitive to local discriminatory attitudes. This is proof that it is always difficult to recognize the discriminatory mindset that lurks in our hearts.

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757266568667631732) Fifth, it is certainly true that many American Republicans are ignorant (from our point of view), believe wild things that clearly do not match the facts, do not respect expertise It is certainly true that they do not respect and are prone to believe in conspiracy theories. But I don't think that ignorance should be attributed to their "responsibility".

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757267656238117347) The public education system in the United States is essentially funded at its community level, with not much assistance at the federal level. In this case, the quality of primary and secondary education in poor areas declines, while the quality in affluent areas improves. If this is the case, it is not surprising that the gap in knowledge (and ethics) between poor and rich areas widens to the point of fatality!

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757268834321670169) Even more hopelessly, even if wages are not high, teachers can (and seemingly do) have health insurance at least. But poor people in rural America cannot afford health insurance. As a result, a listening survey of Republican supporters in Wisconsin reveals that there is animosity toward teachers

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757271566428307521) (Cramer 2016, The Politics of Resentment, p. 161). Antagonism toward teachers engaged in public education has terrible consequences. This is because, as Lazarfeld's classic "two-step flow of communication" made clear, the public receives information about complex matters from those in leadership positions in their respective communities

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757272676874452999) because it is believed that they are obtained from the community. For example, in Japan, along with temple priests, village constables, and village officials, elementary school teachers, as community leaders, mediated the ordinary people as the so-called "sub-intellectuals". The situation in which teachers engaged in public education were repulsed was a situation in which the level of knowledge of the rural American people was

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757273200650789177) would be greatly constrained. Instead, rural Americans are forced to rely on Bible-centered Christian churches with a weak degree of organization and cable TV and radio with little oversight in the name of free competition.

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757273950248440172) Furthermore, local newspapers have become extremely weak, and then came the age of social networking. There are no bookstores. University tuition is punishingly high. Public libraries in various areas are said to be doing their best, almost as a last resort, but even their collections are under fire from partisan conflict.

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757274635299852743) If I were from a rural poor part of the US, I would want to shout. 'What do you want me to do? What's with the "Expertise We Don't Need Any More: Ignorance Reverence and Democracy" (Tom Nichols). If you are born poor, you will never have access to expertise! Stop fooling around! Die!"

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757305538973765714) Of course, people dying will not solve the problem. We must calm down. So what should we do? In the name of "epistocracy" (politics by the wise), the American political philosopher Brennan, in "Against Democracy," proposes a method of imposing a written test in examining voter qualifications.

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757306241985249404) This argument is not new. Since the dawn of the representative (electoral) system, there has been widespread support for those who argue that it is dangerous to give the right to vote to uninformed voters. It is no secret that it has taken a long time to break through this debate and move from limited to universal suffrage.

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757306774745714794) All I can say in response to Brennan's proposal is that it is impossible to "test" political knowledge or political ability. I can't go into details here, but if you think for a moment about, say, who would create and grade that written test, and how to assure that it is valid, the problem would be obvious.

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757307398094754116) This is probably why no system of selecting politicians by a written test has ever been established since the beginning of time. Or a simple literacy test, but since there are probably very few illiterate people in the US today, it is unlikely that it would function as a practical test of voter ability.

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757307686960709633) Moreover, even literacy has not been proven to be a proxy for political competence or knowledge. Thus, Brennan's proposal is rejected.

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757308614438703605) So what should be done? The problems in the U.S. mentioned earlier would be (1) the weakness of public education and (2) the gross inequality of access to health insurance. (2) is widely recognized, and Obama has devoted almost heroic efforts to improving the health insurance system. However, he seems to have been hampered by partisan conflict and was unable to achieve sufficient results.

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757309187363848530) It seems that the federal government has been trying for many years to improve public education in (1). However, due to the extremely decentralized nature of the U.S. Constitution, it has not been successful. This is because it is no longer possible to unify the curriculum or fund it from the federal level.

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757310519311302843) would mean that the problem is a constitutional amendment mater. One possible solution would be to greatly strengthen the power of the federal government and constrain state rights. Is it feasible? It is not feasible. States' rights are the cornerstone of the United States, and it is highly unlikely that politicians at the state level would approve the delegation of authority.

> [shintoyo](https://twitter.com/shintoyo/status/1757310958404514151) If constitutional reform is not possible, the next best thing is party reform, which would change the party structure of both the Democratic and Republican parties into an oligarchy. If the parties become oligarchical, politicians at the federal level can effectively strengthen the authority of the federal government through party discipline over politicians at the state level.
