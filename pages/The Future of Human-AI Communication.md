iceberg model
If you don't write it, it disappears.
Reading what you write stimulates your thinking.
What you write will come back to you over time.
Stimulated by communication with others
- interaction
Format for implicitly conversing with others
legacy format
I even use it when I write.
Not appropriate.
Case Study of Jiro Kawakita's Point Memo
No need for others to be able to read.
mental hurdles
The effect of what you write coming back to you after a period of time.
What has happened so far
Here is the new constraint
- Emergence of non-human conversational beings
- Its presence can read and write multiple languages.
What happens.

- The iceberg model is the idea that the visible part (the surface) is only a small portion, and that the majority hidden underneath has the actual size and information. This model is used in many situations and can be applied to the conscious and subconscious mind and to explicit and tacit knowledge within an organization.

Based on the information and keywords provided, the following may be considered

- Importance of Writing: Some information, knowledge, and experiences would disappear without writing. This could refer to the importance of the act of writing as a means of accumulating knowledge, organizing thoughts, and reflecting on oneself.
- Feedback from writing: Writings can be reviewed later for new discoveries and inspiration. In addition, communication with others can provide new perspectives and ideas.
- Writing format: the importance of recording in one's own way without being locked into a particular format, such as the example of Jiro Kawakita's point memos and the format for implicitly conversing with others.
- New constraint: The "non-human conversational beings" here could conceivably refer to AI, robots, or other intelligent beings. If these entities can handle multiple languages, information sharing and communication across borders will become even easier.

The changes and impacts under these new constraints could include the following

- Equality of access to information: The emergence of a presence that understands and transmits in multiple languages will reduce language barriers and provide equal access to information.
- Diffusion and Deepening of Knowledge: The diffusion and deepening of knowledge will be enhanced by the increased exchange of information not only between humans but also between humans and non-human entities.
- New ways of learning: Through interaction with AI, robots, and other entities, new ways of learning and acquiring knowledge may emerge.
- Thus, technological and environmental changes can have a profound impact on the way we communicate and learn.

### digest of notes
.
AI's multilingual capabilities have the potential to improve equality of access to information and create new ways of learning. The importance of writing, feedback from writing, writing formats, and the presence of AI as a new constraint are discussed. In particular, the ability of AI to handle multilingualism may improve equality of information access and create new ways of learning.

### Relation to Fragment
.
"The fragment "[[ü§ñIntelligent collaboration between AI and humans]]" describes new possibilities for AI-human collaboration and intellectual production, which is relevant to the note. In particular, the discussion of the boundaries between AI and human writing and new forms of teamwork are directly related to the future of AI and human communication, the theme of the note.

### Deep thoughts and questions
What is the optimal balance in AI-human collaboration; how does AI's presence and statements affect human discussions; how should the quality and accuracy of AI's new capabilities be guaranteed; and how can the AI's ability to provide new and useful information be improved? These are important questions to address in order to maximize the potential of AI-human collaboration.

### title of thought
