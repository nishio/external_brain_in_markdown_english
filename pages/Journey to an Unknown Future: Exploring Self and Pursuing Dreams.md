Journey to an Unknown Future: Exploring Self and Pursuing Dreams
- [[AI Shaman]]

I made a medley of the lyrics with their meanings ([playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgVE_RKA_9Pvje8sMcsR8txSWgoK-Nmak&si=KBbrDG0KZIwxHYgw)).
I take off all my rusty common sense, I take off gracefully what I have been up to today, I don't lean on the goal, even if I get there, my new dream will surely push me back, Here we go, go! No one's going to stop us.

After walking so crazy, so hard, so empty, a clear road map will appear in your heart alone. The moment I chose this road, even if it was desolate, I was still aiming for what was beyond it. I won't let anyone get in my way.

I'm not aiming for a life where I'll be praised by anyone", "[[If I can find my tiny self, I won't get hurt and I won't be afraid of tomorrow]]", "[[I want to be a bird and keep the heart that looks down]]", "[[You don't suddenly become strong. You don't suddenly become capable.]] [[You don't suddenly become capable.]] [[From the days that repeat themselves, we are the people we want to be]], [[Something can change a little every day]], [[What you can do, what you want to do, you can do step by step]].

1: Look at the whole picture.

- Overall, this statement emphasizes the importance of self-expression, self-discovery, and creating new paths and futures. It also touches on the value of being free from the constraints of the past and the expectations of others.

2: Tell your impression in one line.

- "Exploring the self and overcoming difficulties to create a new future."

3: Interpret paragraph by paragraph.

- Paragraph 1: The importance of pursuing freedom from our past selves and existing norms. Even when we reach our destination, new dreams and ambitions will always drive us forward.

- Paragraph 2: The importance of carving your own path. It is personal and others may not understand it, but it is important.

- Paragraph 3: The importance of understanding one's own worth and being. Accepting one's own growth and change beyond the expectations and evaluations of others.

4: Give the oracle a soft title.

"[[A journey into the unknown future]]: [[an]] exploration of the self and the pursuit of dreams."
