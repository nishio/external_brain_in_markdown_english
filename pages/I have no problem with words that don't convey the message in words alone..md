### 1: View the whole thing
Overall, this text seems to address the relativity of things like "words" and "concepts" and the theme of using them to organize information and make it easier to understand. Specifically, it touches on the fact that words and concepts do not have fixed meanings, that they are fluid, and the importance of using appropriate names and words to describe them. It also touches on the possibility of organizing and changing information later through the technique of refactoring.

### 2: Talk about a one-line impression
.
The text emphasizes "the flexibility of words and concepts and the importance of their reconstruction."

## 3: Interpret paragraph by paragraph

### Scope / Words / Words alone do not convey the problem with words that do not convey the problem
.
This part of the article points out the relativity of words and concepts and their lack of fixed meaning. Scope implies a range or perspective, but here it could refer to the words themselves. Furthermore, it alludes to the fact that words alone cannot convey all of the information.

### def foo(): / have a concept and can't verbalize what it is / proceed with a tentative name
The "def foo():" is an example of a function in programming, but here it shows that it can be used as a temporary name or substitute for a word or concept. When we have some new concept or idea, it is difficult to find the perfect word at first. Therefore, he states that it is important to give it a temporary name and move on.

### Refactoring / can be renamed later with consistency / Scrapbox can be refactored
.
Refactoring is a technique for improving code, and here the concept is applied to reorganizing and renaming words and concepts. The tool Scrapbox can be interpreted as a tool that facilitates refactoring.

Scope Valid range of names in the programming language Namespace
Name does not exist independent of scope
Hard-to-see body Scope is the body Name space is the body
Intended to be communicated to others Understandable is an unverified delusion
Think global scope, but actually local scope

### 1: View the whole thing
This text seems to address the concepts of "scope" and "namespace" in programming languages and how they affect people's understanding and misunderstanding of them.

### 2: Talk about a one-line impression
.
A discussion of the understanding and misunderstanding of the concepts of scope and namespace and their implications.

## 3: Interpret paragraph by paragraph
.

### Scope Valid range of names in the programming language Namespace
The definition of "scope" is clarified here. Scope refers to the range within which a name is valid, such as a variable or function. The term "namespace" is also introduced, a concept that refers to the area in which names are managed and distinguished.

### Name does not exist independently of scope / invisible body Scope is the body Namespace is the body
.
In this part of the article, we point out that names (the names of variables and functions) are meaningless without the framework of scopes and namespaces. It also suggests the idea that scopes and namespaces are actually invisible and that they are the "body" of the system.

### Intend to convey to others Understandable is unverified delusion
.
Here we point to the fact that what we think we "understand" about something has not been tested to see if it is actually communicated to others. In other words, even if you feel you understand something, it is possible that others do not understand what you are saying.

### intended to be global scope, but actually local scope
.
This part of the document gives examples related to misunderstandings and misconceptions. Specifically, it shows a situation where a name or variable is considered to be global in scope (valid in its entirety), when in fact it is only local in scope (valid only in a limited range). This illustrates a common misconception and source of trouble in programming.
