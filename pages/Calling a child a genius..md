title: "Calling a child a genius."

> I don't care if someone is amazing by absolute standards, what about calling a so-called precocious person who is "that's amazing at that age" a "genius X student" or something like that. I don't think this is good for those around them or for the person in question.
> I like to use the word "tough" in these situations. It can be used for people who are absolutely amazing or for people who are precocious. And I don't want to say "I want to be a genius" or "I want to be more of a genius," but I like that I can say "I want to be strong" or "I want to be stronger. I think the word "genius" implies resignation.

What I muttered inspired by this tweet
- When you call a child "[[genius]]," some adults who have never been called geniuses [[envy]] and start spouting curses like, "They call you a genius, but you're not much of a genius," or "You're a genius and you don't even know this?" or "You're a genius, but you don't know this?
- However, once you and those around you recognize that "it is natural to be able to do it," you unconsciously avoid challenges that could cause [[failure]] because you feel [[fear]].
- In order to create something that does not exist in the world yet, we need "[[ability to move forward on one's own]]", so we shine a spotlight on young people who have that ability and encourage them to consolidate their resources. If that light is creating a [[curse]] for the adults around them and a fear of losing them, then something needs to be improved.

Comparing "genius" and "strong," I see that the former is a dichotomy between "genius" and "non - genius," while the latter is a continuous value.
The dichotomy can cause jealousy from "non - geniuses" to "geniuses" and fear of "geniuses" falling to "non - geniuses". [[False dichotomy]].
