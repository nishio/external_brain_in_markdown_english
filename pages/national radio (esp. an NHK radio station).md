> Kokumin [[radio]] (German: Volksempfänger) is the general term for a series of radio receivers that were mass-produced and sold at low prices as a means of [[propaganda]] against the general public in [[Nazi Germany]].
[National Radio - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%BD%E6%B0%91%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B8%E3%82%AA)
- > By 1939, 70% of all households owned a radio receiver. This was the highest penetration rate in the world at that time.

- Examples in the context of how [[information transmission]] has become more efficient due to developments in [[technology]].
- Some people may be concerned about this now because of the negative things that have happened as a result of efficiency, but [[technology is neutral]], and it can be good or bad depending on how you use it.
- As technology makes human behavior more efficient, human behavior with [[bad intentions]] also becomes more efficient, and evil is done efficiently.
    - The only way to combat this is for people with [[good intentions]] to become more efficient as well.
        - Even if you try to bind them with [[ethics]] or [[law]], people with bad intentions will ignore them.
