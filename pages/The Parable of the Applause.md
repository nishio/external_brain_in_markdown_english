- clash with one's right hand and left hand
    - There's a snapping sound.
    - Was the sound made by the right hand? Was the sound made by the left hand?

- For example, Mr. A gave instructions to Mr. B, but Mr. B misunderstood them and they were not handled correctly.
    - Is it Mr. A's fault or Mr. B's fault?
