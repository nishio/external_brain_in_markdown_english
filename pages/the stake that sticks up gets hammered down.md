This proverb is used to convey a sense of conformity and the dangers of going against [[societal norms]] or expectations.

In its use, this phrase is often employed to warn or advise against actions or behaviors that deviate from what is considered "[[normal]]" or "[[typical]]" within the context of Japanese society. It underscores the value placed on [[harmony]] and cooperation within groups, a cornerstone of Japanese culture.

On a deeper level, the proverb reflects the concept of "[[wa]]" ([[和]]), or social harmony, which is highly valued in Japanese culture. The saying suggests that individuals should not disturb the existing harmony of their group or society by standing out or challenging the [[status quo]]. While this attitude promotes a sense of unity and cohesion, it can also potentially discourage individuality and assertiveness.

It's important to note, however, that like any cultural concept, interpretations can vary, and not all individuals or situations within Japanese society will necessarily adhere to this proverb's implications. Some may interpret it as emphasizing the importance of teamwork and unity, while others might see it as a critique of a culture that discourages individuality.
