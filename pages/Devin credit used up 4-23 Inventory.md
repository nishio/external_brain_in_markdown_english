Devin credit used up 4/23 Inventory

It's not good that the Devin order placed the day before yesterday has not been resolved.
- What's left.
- Analysis of the ability to state the approximate time it takes to output a report.

    - We could collect information on the time
    - Trouble where to collect length of comments
        - I think example-polis is GitHub LFS.
        - Devin and I got confused about the fix for this.
    - Discard.
- Ability to duplicate and reuse reports

    - I thought it was not good enough to test it without implementing it up to step2, so I decided to record the report and move on.
    - TODO: waiting for step2 implementation
- When displaying dense clusters, the cluster description is also displayed together.

    - I decided to have it implemented.
- week 6
    - I let run.sh run.
        - It's better to let Devin do it than to share the errors you've run into and fix them on your end.

        - Why did he reveal the "collective processing" of the lidobata?
    - Because you didn't merge PR36.
    - I merged 36 and 38 was conflated.
        - Let's get it fixed.
    - ✅
- [[Microsoft vs Cursor]]
- (Experimental) embedding-based preprocessing

    - [[Scott Wu YouTube Japan 2025-04-22]] cleanup, easily succeeded with NotebookLLM.
    - The same method should be used for the [[trilogy interview transcription]] that was being done.
