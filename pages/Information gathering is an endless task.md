title: "Information gathering is an endless task"
---

    - [[information gathering]] is [[an infinite number of tasks]].
    - Tends to overestimate because [rewards are given probabilistically
            - [[Intermittent reinforcement]]
        - [Interior Exploration and External Exploration
        - [Wandering around without thinking about where to explore is inefficient.
                - [[Look for keys under a street lamp.]]
        - It is important to [[Interior Exploration]] first
    - A [[aimless stroll]] is also useful [[as entertainment]], but don't feel like you're doing useful information gathering.
        - This is "[[self-explanatory]]."
        - Lately, I tend to be [[sobbing]] when I see OpenAI's movements and so on.
        - I need [[calmness]].
        - You can't get [[peace of mind]] or [[confidence (in oneself)]] or [[calmness]] by sobbing [[aimlessly gathering information]].
