What exactly is your contribution to making a name for yourself in an election where you have almost no chance of winning?

Even in elections where there is little or no chance of winning, being named as a candidate has the following pragmatic and symbolic value.

1. official "transmission channels" can be secured
- During the election period, publicly-funded announcement slots are available for political announcements, debates, election poster boards, and so on.
- It is far more efficient for emerging forces than buying their own media exposure costs, and it allows them to get the party name and policies known on a national scale.

2. acquire and expand a database of supporters
- Contacts for inquiries, volunteers, and donations collected through speeches and publicity will form the basis for the next election or campaign.
- This will allow for hands-on testing to see which areas respond well, which messages stick, etc., and promote organizational learning.

3. prove "seriousness" and mobilize supporters
- Deposit money (¥3 million for the upper house proportional district and more than ¥3 million for the electoral district) is likely not to be returned, and individual candidates bear the financial risk.
- Even so, the willingness to put one's name out there symbolizes that "there are people who are willing to put their lives on the line for this movement," and serves as a catalyst for sympathy, donations, and volunteer participation.

4. generating "news value" for the media
- Even if a new party or policy theme is innovative, without a candidate, the press coverage will be extremely small.
- The presence of a candidate makes it easier to create a "people story" and secure a print and program slot.

5. improving negotiation skills with a view to post-election
- A certain percentage of close losses and votes may lead to next election subsidies and party requirements if the percentage is above a certain level.
- Even if the number of votes is small, it can be a "bargaining chip" for policy discussions with other parties and invitations to appear in the media.

6. internal leadership development
- Through practical experience, the participants will be able to gain a full range of experience in policy making, public relations, fundraising, and on-site management.
- The "discarded stones" of this time often turn out to be immediate leaders in the next main elections and local councilor elections.

Running for office when you know you can't win."
- Making the party and the movement visible to society,
- Accumulate data and human resources,
- "Seriousness" to attract empathy...
This creates a triple leverage of
For an emerging force such as Team Mirai, this is an extremely significant contribution, as it allows a single person to serve as the public relations manager, business development officer, and training instructor.
