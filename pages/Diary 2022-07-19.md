I couldn't bear to make a lecture material saying "Let's do fireworks with thinking" without verifying whether or not Miro could do fireworks with thinking, so I ended up doing fireworks with thinking entirely in Miro.

I thought that I could use the Frame function for island tori, but I was dissatisfied with a number of things, such as the fact that the stickies did not follow the Frame when I moved the Frame after selecting the stickies, I did not know how to make the letters of the Frame title larger, and the overflowing title was hidden, so I ended up using a pen. So I ended up using a pen.
- Well, Kozaneba should be able to write a title that sticks out too... what's up with that?
- I wonder if I need a pen after all (I'm thinking of Kozaneba).
