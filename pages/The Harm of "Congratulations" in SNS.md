The pros and cons of being told "[[Congratulations]]."

Benefits:
    - Satisfaction of [[desire for approval]]: blessings and positive reactions from others increase self-esteem and motivation.
- Strengthening [[social connections]]: Through comments on the blessing, you will be more connected to your friends and followers and have more opportunities to communicate with them.
- Information sharing: sharing important events and accomplishments to keep people informed of what is going on.

Disadvantages:
- [[Excessive expectations]] and [[Pressure]]: Receiving congratulations increases expectations and pressure, which leads to mental stress.
    - Decreased [[self-assessment]]: excessive reliance on the reactions of others can easily lead to fluctuating self-evaluations.
- Risk of dependence: [[The act of satisfying the need for approval]] becomes a habit, and posting on social networking sites becomes like [[addiction]]. This dependence can lead to decreased productivity, worsening mental health, and [[deterioration of real-life relationships]].

Measures:
- To prevent these problems, it is useful to limit the time spent on social networking sites and to perform a digital detox. It is also important to maintain balance and value real relationships and self-esteem.
