title: 'The next step is to get rid of the "hazy" feeling.'

> I think "[[tacit knowledge (knowledge management terminology)]]" is like a hazy idea or feeling inside of me, but if I try to express it in words instead of keeping it to myself, [[empathy]] might be able to help me. If you express it in words instead of keeping it to yourself, you may find someone who will be able to [[empathize]] with it. I interpret this as meaning that if you repeat this process, you may generate wisdom that you could not have conceived on your own.
>  And in fact, I think this repetition is the very seed of communication and [[innovation]] within the company....
> That interpretation is fine. As you said, tacit knowledge is hazy. The key is to put it into words and express it, so as to dissolve that haze... It is very important to "co-create" by putting your feelings (tacit knowledge) into words (formal knowledge) to stimulate the feelings (tacit knowledge) of others and to sympathize, resonate, and resonate with them. We have some feelings, and while sharing tacit knowledge with people, or drawing out tacit knowledge from others, we create new knowledge.

> (Aono)I once posted a review of our strategy on a bulletin board that all employees could see. In my mind, I wrote, "As a result of deciding and doing it this way, this is what I did." I explained it logically, with the intention of saying, "You all understand, don't you? Then one employee asked me, "What do you think about that, Mr. Aono?" I was asked, "What do you think about that, Mr. Aono? I thought, "I don't have enough words to empathize." So I honestly wrote, "I feel frustrated. I want to win. I'm frustrated. And then everyone said, "I understand. Words like "I regret" and "I want to win" didn't mean much to me. I thought they were [[subject]] that I thought on my own. However, that was the word that everyone was looking for. By uttering it, everyone started to give me ideas. At that time, I realized that "logic alone cannot turn the cycle," that I needed some words to inspire everyone's feelings, and that unless I uttered those words (my tacit knowledge), the next collaboration would not be born. When I experienced this, I felt that I was able to experience a little of the theory that Dr. Nonaka was talking about. I thought, "Oh, this is it. Innovation will never happen by theory alone. I thought that we can create something new by sharing our feelings (tacit knowledge) in words (formal knowledge) and having people share and empathize with each other, and from there, through dialogue, we can exchange our words and give birth to something new.
> That is exactly right. We can compensate for each other's deficiencies by talking to each other, even though our own [[it is impossible to recount the experience]]. The key to creating knowledge is to read the different relationships, which I call Context... [[SECI Spiral]] is about sharing context... It is very important to see the world from a relational perspective... In order to see the world from a relational perspective, we need to continually spiral between "tacit knowledge," which is difficult to express in such language and text, and "formal knowledge," which is somehow expressed in words.
    - [[Properly subjective]]
- [[RELEVANCE]]

- Putting [[subjective]] mumbo-jumbo into words is important for multi-person organizations to create knowledge as an organization.
Hopefully [[Keichobot]] can help with this.
