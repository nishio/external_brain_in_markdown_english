He thinks he is a communicator even though he is not communicator in the sense of "[[Ability to understand different ways of thinking]].
- Or his/her idea of "communicative competence" is "talking at a drinking party," which is seriously at odds with the idea of the person he/she wants to communicate with, but he/she is unaware of it.
