- Talk about how to take the moment when the pendulum comes right down.
- Humans have a delay in reaction to seeing and then pressing a button.
    - When "seeing reality and taking pictures with an optical camera" and "seeing the monitor and taking pictures with a digital camera
        - If the pendulum is pushed only after seeing that it has come directly under the pendulum, it will be delayed.
        - So you need to push a little faster.
- Digital cameras lag behind humans.
    - When "seeing reality and taking pictures with a digital camera"
        - If you press it after you see it come directly below you, you can still get an image before it comes directly below you.
        - In this situation, you need to push a little slower.
            - I felt it was necessary to delay one beat as a skin sensation.
            - 250 ms, so it was a good approximation.

- Practice shooting the lowest point of a moving swing with the iPhone11ProMax camera ([Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/nishiohirokazu/posts/10219958183641482))
    - I was looking at the screen and taking pictures early on, and when I switched to the naked eye, it didn't show up at all.

    - [[iPhone11ProMax camera resolution]]
    - If you are not willing to train your body's sense of timing (you want the machine to feel good)
        - Don't look at the screen or look away once you've just composed the image → Timing is determined by looking at reality, not the screen.
        - If resolution is important, shoot in burst (3024 × 4032, 100msec)
        - Turn to 4K video recording (2160 × 3840, 33msec) if timing consistency (resolution in time axis) is important.
        - In both cases, the senses can shoot faster than human reaction time.

    - Eventually, with higher resolution, there will come a time when "video is all that's needed.
