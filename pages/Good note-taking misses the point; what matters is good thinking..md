[“Better note-taking” misses the point; what matters is “better thinking”](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7kEFe6NfUSgtaDuUjST1oczKKzQQeQWk4Dbc)

- "Better Note-taking" misses the point, the key is "better thinking."
- Many people have written about solutions to the problem that note-taking habits are generally ineffective.
- Most of it in a short-sighted, "life-hack" frame of mind,
- It is written with a focus on answering the following questions
    - How do I organize my notes?"
    - What kind of journal should I use?"
    - How can I easily keep track of the bits and pieces of books I read?"
- The answers to these questions are unsatisfactory because the questions focus on the wrong things.
    - The goal is not to take notes, but to think effectively.
    - A better question is.
        - What kind of exercises can we do to ensure that we gain insight over time?"
        - How can I effectively direct my attention?"
    - This is the frame in which evergreen note writing, the basic unit of knowledge work, makes sense.
    - Evergreen note writing helps accumulate insights.
- Technically, it is not about "computer-supported note-taking" but "computer-supported thinking."
    - This is because "note-taking" is the visible element of an invisible habit.
    - If you see insightful people writing in notebooks, you might imagine that if you get the right notebooks and organize them well, you too can gain insight.
    - And of course, note taking is visible.
    - It's relatively simple, [[it makes me feel like I'm doing something, even if it's for nothing.]] (The habit of writing notes gives weak feedback.)
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> [[ritualization]].
    - So it is a fascinating nuisance.
- Those who write extensively about note-taking rarely have any serious context for its use.
