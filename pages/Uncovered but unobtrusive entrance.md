title: "Uncovered but unobtrusive entrance"
---

- [[gated community]]
- There is a pattern where the entrance is open, but not decorated, so most people don't realize there is value inside.

- When you want to strike a [[permissionless]] pose, it tends to look like this
- I'm not actively looking for more people, so I don't make the entrance obvious.

- [[Take a position before others see the value.]]
