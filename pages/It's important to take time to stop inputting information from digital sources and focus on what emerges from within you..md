It came out to the station.
[[It's important to change the environment.]]
It is important to stop inputting information from digital sources [[and spend time paying attention to what emerges from within you]].

Often, a change in environment can bring about new insights and stimulate creativity. Especially now, when we tend to be overwhelmed by information from digital devices in the midst of our daily busyness, it is extremely valuable to consciously stop the flow and have time to look inside ourselves.

Being away from digital devices and focusing on [[thoughts that emerge from within you]] and your emotions can lead to new ideas and a deeper understanding of [[your own feelings and state of being]]. Having this kind of time is also very beneficial to one's own [[mental health]].

How about setting aside a time for such [[self-reflection]] or [[introspection]] over lunch or after lunch? You may come up with new insights and ideas in a new environment. In addition, setting aside such time regularly in your daily life may be a step toward your own personal growth.
