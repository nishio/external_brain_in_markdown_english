title: "Work Excitement through Ritual"
---

- I have a big [[task]] that requires a lot of mental energy to tackle.
- Prepare a "[[ritual]]" of things to do before you do this.
    - Individually, this ritual is small and simple.
    - For example.
        - put on earplugs
        - Stack muffled headphones on top of each other.
        - Keep a carton of tea within easy reach.
        - Take out your smartphone, launch the timer app, and with one more tap, the 25-minute timer is ready to start.
- Work Excitement] occurs by doing the work of ritual.
    - By doing this series of rituals, I'm driving myself into a [[zone]].
