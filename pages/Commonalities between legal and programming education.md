    - > I was watching a newcomer who was not progressing well in programming, and apparently he said, "I can't write a program if I don't know the correct answer to how to write it.
    - > "There is no right answer, so you should think of your own answer and write it. If you can't write without a correct answer, you are nothing but a copy-and-paste programmer," but this has no effect and I am having trouble.
