- [[Carl Schmidt]]'s "Critique of Congress" and "Dictatorship" Theory
1. why the parliamentary system was considered "incompatible with democracy
    - In The Psychohistorical Situation of Modern Parliamentarism (1923), Schmidt wrote that the two assumptions that have justified the Congress--the
        - 1: Open discussion (council members persuade each other in a reasoned manner)
        - 2: Variable willingness (each legislator's position can change during the debate)
    - He pointed out that the Congress of the United States has been dismantled. He argued that the real parliament has become a place of party trade, and that debate is a "hollowed-out apparatus" that remains only a formality.

He therefore said, "Compromises made by majority rule cannot express the identical will of the people. The self-identical will of a homogeneous people is the essence of democracy," and he separated parliamentarism from democracy.

2. "[[dictatorship]]" (1921) - typifying forms of power in times of emergency
[Kommissarische
- Temporarily suspends the law, but leaves the Constitution as a prerequisite.
- Objective: Restoration of constitutional order
- Example: Emergency Dictator of the Roman Republic
[[Sovereign dictatorship]] (Souveräne)
- Suspended the old Constitution and determined the fundamental norms
- Purpose: Creation of a new constitutional order
- Example: Jacobins during the French Revolution, etc.

This distinction positions the dictatorship as a "legal system for dealing with states of exception" rather than mere arbitrary rule.

3. plebiscitary dictatorship
- The late Schmitt defended popular-vote dictatorship in his "Constitutional Theory" (1928) and other works.
- The leader obtains direct approval by referendum (plebiscite) or acclamation (akklamation), not through the parliament.
- Here, "the decision of the leader = the will of the people" is considered to be valid, and the immediacy and identity of the decision is more important than in the Congress.
