- One Night Werewolf Transcript 2-7 Discussion - AI Summary 1

Tachikawa: We are progressing at a pretty good pace right now. More than I expected. Let's take a look back at what we have done so far and see what you think.

Nishio: Yes, I think so. Especially for the first time.

Male Y: I didn't get the hang of it at first.

Tachikawa: I was getting really good at the end.

Male Y: Also, I didn't know how to bluff, so I tried to find out what would happen if a werewolf revealed himself as a werewolf, and I learned that, according to the theory, he would be exposed as a werewolf. What was interesting was that I could sense that everyone had a certain expectation that this kind of person would confess in this way. I was not sure at first, so the second time, I let myself see what kind of conversation would take place. I learned a little bit more about how to do it, and I realized that it was okay to say something peripheral to what I was saying, and that it was also effective to blurt it out.

Nishio: Yes, yes. It makes the game more interesting. Whether it leads to victory or not, it makes the game more interesting.

Male Y: That's what I mean. In the end, the way you speak and the atmosphere of the room are the key factors to be read. On the contrary, I felt that the person who can create such a mood wins in the end. I thought it would have been great if Nishida's behavior at the end was a bluff. I thought he is a strong character if it was a bluff. Probably knowing Nishida-san up to now, I decided that it probably wouldn't happen. So I thought that what these two guys are saying is right first of all.

Nishio: If I had said confidently that I was a villager, it would have led to suspicion that these two might be werewolves.

Male Y: Yeah, yeah. That was probably that one.

Nishio: I have an image of these two werewolves teaming up to deceive each other.

Man X: Well, I studied in the Department of Systems Innovation in the School of Engineering at the University of Tokyo,

Tachikawa: Oh, so it is system creation.

Male X: Yes. The test is like game theory. It is the famous Tit for Tat of game theory, which is about trust and betrayal, and in infinite trials, the optimal solution is for everyone to cooperate, but when there is a finite solution, they will betray each other.

Nishio: Yes, yes.

Man X: I know it sounds naive, but I am a person who believes that in my lifetime, a future or society will be created in which this will be the optimal solution. So, while I acknowledge the existence of werewolf-like elements in this world, I live as if I am the one who should destroy them.

Male Y: I see. Excellent, that's it.

Tachikawa: Well, I don't really understand what you're talking about. I'm not sure what you mean by "TFT" in the game "Tit For Tat.

Male X: Yes.

Nishio: Well, I'm talking about an ideal world where there are people who betray each other, but everyone stops betraying each other and everyone does good things for each other.

Male X: Well, yes.

Nishio: That community. I would like to see that happen too, but I think it would be better to create a closed community that would not allow the type of people who are already out there to betray us to do so.

Man X: Ah~.

Nishio: Because it has been tried in various patterns by human beings to direct all people in the world toward the ideal, but it has not been successful.

Male X: Well, yes.

Male Y: Yes.

Nishio: I thought it would be a good idea to start with a small 5-meter radius and create a trustworthy group, and then expand it while protecting it. I don't know how we came to this point. In this sense, playing a wargame and exposing all the deceptions, including the deception, is a way to win trust. If I had intended to cheat when my life was in danger, I wouldn't have played like this.

Man X: I'm sorry. Well, which one?

Nishio: Well, let's say that the person is planning to steal money or something like that, regardless of whether there is any chance or not, it is totally wrong to cheat them in a game. If you are a person who is planning to steal money or something like that, you can't cheat in a game at all.

Male X: Oh, that's what I mean.

Nishio: I wonder if it has a little bit to do with getting stronger with werewolves.
