title: "Learning History"
---

When asked in an interview, I was curious myself, so I sorted out a bit of what I have learned and when. I am a transitional person. And I thought that because I had been "learning = producing some kind of output," I could put it all together like this later.

- 2008 Haskell, ActionScript 3, Jython
    - [Blog post at](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/archive/200801)
    - Published "Jython Programming" in April 2008
        - [[2008 Slump]]

- 2009 TopCoder, Autism Spectrum, Erlang, Blender, Google App Engine, iOS App
    - I was doing a lot of computer graphics stuff, from Context Free Art to Blender to SVG projects.
        - Then I wrote a C++ program that directly hits libpng to render things that can't be rendered by the existing SVG renderer [Won an art contest [http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20090611/](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20090611/) 1244714716]
    - After learning about a foreign card game called "Programmer's Nightmare," I created my own card game and played it, rewriting the rules to my liking and creating new game rules: [[Overview of the "Battle of the Spaghetti Monster"]].
    - I was interested in the autism spectrum and did a lot of research.
        - I was halfway through the certification process for the [Autism Spectrum Support Specialist](http://www.autistic-spectrum.jp/publics/index/149/), but when I was asked to help with the facility's festival-like activities, I felt a mismatch with what I was looking for. I felt it was a mismatch with what I was looking for, so I quit.

- 2010
    - Around this time [[Drucker.]] boom triggered him to start reading Drucker → Entered Department of Technology Management at Tokyo Institute of Technology in 2011
    - Created a prototype that can recognize the position and orientation of a figure by placing it on an iPad capacitive touch panel.
    - I'm Haskell'ing again.
    - [blog post](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/archive/201001) would tell you more about it, but I'm bored.
