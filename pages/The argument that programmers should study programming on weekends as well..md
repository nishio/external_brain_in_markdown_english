The argument that programmers should study programming on weekends as well.
> [kaityo256](https://x.com/kaityo256/status/1854175509367947385) When discussing whether programmers should study programming on weekends, the conclusion is usually, "You can study or not as you wish, but your competition should be those who study all the time. This seems to mean that if you want to compete head-to-head, you should study, but I don't think that's true.

> [kaityo256](https://x.com/kaityo256/status/1854175742894170473) I don't think it's limited to programming, but it's hard for someone who does it out of necessity to beat someone who does it out of love. So you shouldn't compete head-to-head in programming with someone who is like, "My job is programming and my hobby is also programming.

> [kaityo256](https://x.com/kaityo256/status/1854176053746659358) Then, what we should do is not to compete only in programming. For example, we could combine two skills, such as programming and law, programming and foreign languages, or programming and design, and aim for a so-called "pie strategy.

Of the skill sets that I have that are not sharp, every skill I look at has its own top competitor. But few people have that skill "set" and they are not here now. That's why there is a world where you can be active.
