title: "I don't use it that way."
---

Suppose that Mr. A uses a certain word X in the sense of Y, and another Mr. B insists that he does not use X in the sense of Y.

This is a "use" [[The subject is unclear.]] claim.
- If the claim is that "not all people use X in the sense of Y", then it is obviously false because we have a counterexample in front of us, Mr. A.
- If the assertion is, "I don't use X in the sense of Y," that is no basis for denying that Mr. A uses X in the sense of Y.
    - No reason to deny Mr. B's claim.

In many cases, it is appropriate for Mr. B to say that he has never seen anyone use X to mean Y
- To say that it's [[excessive abstraction]] to say, "We don't use X in the sense of Y."
- My experience is the whole world type thinking mistake: [[My experience is the whole world type thinking]].

    - [[I have a counterexample in front of me.]] An example of communication is "That's [[common sense]]" (=everyone knows it).
