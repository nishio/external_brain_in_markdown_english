Abstraction is not necessarily a good thing.
- It is important to keep labels as hooks for recalling specific things and associating various things as long as possible.
- It is important to increase the chances of associative connections rather than abstract concepts. This is also related to the associative meaning of words to connect and why the KJ method from the survey is so difficult.

err and not change one's ways, this is what it is to err
- A quote from The Analects. Making mistakes is human nature and inevitable. However, to recognize the mistake and not change it is the true mistake. This is an important lesson for the research and design process as well.

In-house recruitment of directors
- It has been pointed out that the position of director usually serves as an expert in management skills and an elder in the internal order, but this is not the case for Cybozu's openly recruited directors. Although there are concerns about delays in decision-making and bias due to the increase in the number of directors, Cybozu's culture of "try it and if a problem becomes apparent, you can stop.

Easy backup of the map itself
- To cover situations where you want to make a major configuration change but are afraid to do so, it is suggested that the map itself could be easily duplicated and backed up.
- This was essentially impossible when the work was done on paper, but digitization has made it possible. Backups have the effect of alleviating the fear of making changes.

- I guess there's a connection between Cybozu's "try it and stop if the problem becomes apparent" culture and "backups alleviate the fear of making changes".

A discussion of contextual proto and insight
This section reviews the 2020 activities and discusses the relevance of the contextual proto and the insights presented in the design research textbook. Contextual prototypes are prototypes to test whether users perceive value in a story, while insights are about the participants in the design process. These two elements have the potential to produce more effective designs when both the user and the design process are taken into account.
