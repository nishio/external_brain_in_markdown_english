Polis: "Self-Supporting Learners" and "Expected Learners"
"Self-serving learners" are "self-serving job creators."
The "self-serving learners" aren't willing to go all the way.
The world is changing so rapidly right now that the relevance of long-term plans is declining, so using the decision guideline of "if you want to go far, go together" is not appropriate.
When the world is changing rapidly, it is beneficial to have a style of collaboration where individuals move quickly to gather information and then share it with each other when there is room.
The phrase "If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together" originally means "Old people cannot run as fast as young people, but they can help you go far because they have knowledge. Taking a young man with no knowledge and slow legs is not beneficial to "go far".
When speed is required, you should run alone first, without regard for others.
The expression "the gap cannot be bridged" implicitly assumes that "bridging the gap" is a good thing, and this assumption is incorrect.
Those who believe their abilities will never change set "achievement goals" to maintain their self-image. On the other hand, those with a supple mindset set "learning goals.
When learning becomes a goal in itself, people take risks instead of asking stupid questions or worrying that they will look stupid if they get the answer wrong.
Learning Animals are not concerned with immediate failure because they know that in the long run they will learn more and rise to greater heights.
You can't survive if you don't use your own independent judgment in adjacent areas like "self-directed learners."
The perception that learning models can be made more efficient in the long run is quite dangerous.
With the "expect and learn" style, they'll be out of the game and gone.
For those who learn on their own, "desire for knowledge" is the reward system, and for those who grow with expectation, expectation is the reward.
People who "learn on their own" don't always "grow in expectation."
I'm glad to see that the barriers to learning are disappearing and the number of boosters is increasing... The internet is full of teaching materials, chat teachers are as kind and helpful as tutors, and if you have the aura of a "self-learner," there are many (human) people who will answer your questions if you ask a few.
The "self-serving learners" learn at a faster pace than the "expected learners," so the gap widens, and the gap is not good.
The change from someone who learns by expectation to someone who learns on their own is hinted at by "problem awareness.
Just make sure that only those who learn on their own stay.
I don't like the phrase people "learn" on the job.
This is about "work ethic" or "motivation"
I'm uncomfortable with the use of the terms "self-learning" and "expected to learn."
Voluntary" and "other-initiative" are better than "self-learning" and "expected to learn."
People who learn on their own are better than those who learn because they are expected to.
Majority of "people don't learn when they're expected to."
Only those who learn on their own can maintain order.
Worst case is a boss or organization that forces you to learn without compensation or other incentives.
There are people who learn on their own without compensation or other incentives, I'm talking about the disparity between them and the rest of us.
Even companies that are downsizing are learning.
If people who learn on their own give back to the team, it's good for everyone's benefit.
It is not correct to expect "expected learners" to 'find and solve jobs that no one else in the company is working on next' because that is "forced initiative."
People who continue to learn have the ability to face and enjoy great change
Many people have a complex about being the type of person who doesn't learn on their own.
Some people are turning on the "learn on your own" types.
The "together" just doesn't fit anymore.
Not "disparity," but "combination."
The "learn on your own" type will actually stop doing areas of past work/learning less due to decreased motivation.
I like a team that has both types.
People who learn on their own learn according to their own interests, so it is difficult to control the timing and field of study
We want to leave learning to solve the team's current problems to "people who learn by being expected to learn".
The problem is that the amount of information varies widely within the team
Need to develop a culture of sharing and returning knowledge to the team
