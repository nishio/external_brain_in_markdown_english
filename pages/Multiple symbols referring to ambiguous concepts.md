- Concepts used in general conversation do not have clear boundaries, unlike mathematics, etc.
- Boundary blurred meaning M expressed by symbol A or B
    - The two are not synonymous, but there are nuanced differences that have yet to be verbalized.
    - The two symbols are associated with different "aspects" of M (related: [[Aspects of Experience]]).
- It happens that some symbol C1 is exclusively connected to A, some symbol C2 is exclusively connected to B, some symbol C3 is connected to both A and B, and so on.
- (See [[Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning" Study Session 4]] for diagrams and terminology used in this area.)
