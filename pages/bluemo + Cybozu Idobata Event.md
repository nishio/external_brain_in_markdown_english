title: "bluemo + Cybozu Idobata Event"
---

Planning to have [[blu3mo]] do an event using [[IIDOBATA system]] on [[Cybozu]].
    - Create a practical example in the private sector of something like the [IRA IIDA Conference (1959 meeting of the Communist Party of China to discuss the Great Leap Forward)
- Publish the results of your practices so that other organizations can use them as a reference.
- Set a precedent of "what you pay to hold" by paying them properly.
    - Free work by blu3mo does not scale, money needs to move in order to increase the number of players, and precedent is useful for private companies to consider.
