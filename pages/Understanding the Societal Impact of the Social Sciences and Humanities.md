[Frontiers | Understanding the Societal Impact of the Social Sciences and Humanities: Remarks on Roles, Challenges, and Expectations](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frma.2021.696804/full)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This article discusses the social impact of social science and humanities (SSH) research based on an online consultation of 125 experts in Germany. Key findings include.
1. SSH research addresses a wide range of social issues, including politics, economics, culture, education, ecology, civil society, health, and technology.
2. the role of SSH in addressing social issues includes explaining, reflecting, educating, signaling, predicting, and informing; SSH provides different types of knowledge, including systems knowledge, practical knowledge, and critical knowledge. Overall, SSH produces "[[cohesive knowledge]]" that helps to anticipate and coordinate social change.
3. challenges in the interaction between SSH researchers and societal stakeholders include translation challenges (language barriers, conflicting systems logic), institutional challenges (lack of resources, rewards, organizational support), [[epistemological challenges]] (ambiguous results, conflicting paradigms), and utilization challenges (lack of public appreciation, attention dynamics, risk of instrumentalization).
4. expectations for the quality of SSH-society interactions are process-related ([[understandability]], appropriateness, comprehensiveness, formality), outcome-related (transparency, relevance), and people-related (empathy, selflessness). Quality expectations can be conflicting and need to be considered on a situational basis.
5. the social impacts of SSH are often modest, indirect, conceptual, and counterintuitive, questioning problems and solutions rather than providing solutions. Formative assessment approaches that focus on the process of interaction are best suited to evaluate the impact of SSH.

In summary, the paper provides a nuanced understanding of the diverse contributions of SSH research to society, its challenges and qualitative considerations, and suggests a focus on the process of interaction rather than outcomes in impact evaluation.
