<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>The following is a summary of the text
- Study scope: analysis of data from approximately 5 million freelance jobs on Upwork from November 2022 to February 2024.
- Main Results
    - After the release of ChatGPT (from December 2022), the number of jobs in "Writing," "Translation," and "Customer Service" decreased significantly (Writing: -33%, Translation: -19%, Customer Service: -16%).
    - On the other hand, jobs in "video editing/production," "graphic design," "web design," and "software development" increased.
    - In terms of hourly wages, the translation field fell by more than -20%, while graphic design and web design maintained or increased.
consideration
- Text generation AI can replace writing and translation, but video and image generation systems still require skilled prompt design and fine-tuning and are not yet fully replaceable.
- While ML engineering and data annotation demand has not increased significantly, "AI utilization" projects such as chatbot construction and OpenAI API utilization have increased dramatically.
Conclusion.
- Writing, translation, and customer service are most affected at this time.
- Demand for graphics, web-related and software development is maintained or increasing.
- It is suggested that companies are focusing on API integration and chatbot implementation rather than developing their own LLM.

- [[AI will take jobs.]]
