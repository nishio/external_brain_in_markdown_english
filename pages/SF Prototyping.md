[The current state of science fiction prototyping, from science fiction writer Kyosuke Higuchi: Will "making a proposal with PowerPoint" become "writing and showing science fiction"? The future of innovation with science fiction prototyping! (Page 1 of 3) - ITmedia NEWS](https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/2206/17/news035.html)
- > SF prototyping is a science fiction version of the concept of "[[prototyping]]" that was originally practiced by designers. I think people were dubious at first about prototyping, where you make sketches and mockups without a proposal, but now prototyping is the norm. But now prototyping is commonplace, and I think SF prototyping will follow in the footsteps of prototyping and become commonplace as well.
- > I feel that many of the outputs of SF prototyping are not yet completed as a work of art. Or rather, I don't think it even needs to be completed as a work of art in the first place.
- > Since SF prototyping is also prototyping, it is positioned as a material for consideration, not a finished product in itself. So I personally think it is a bit different to ask people to appreciate this.
        - [[The purpose of prototypes is to fail.]]
- > When doing science fiction prototyping, science fiction writers should not pursue things like their [[authorship]].
