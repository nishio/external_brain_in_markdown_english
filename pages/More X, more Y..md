- When we say, "If you increase X, Y will also increase," we are implicitly thinking in terms of two choices: increase/no increase.
- However, when considering the amount of increase, even if "if you increase X, Y will also increase" is true, there are cases where the increase is not as great as expected.
- Whether the amount of increase is 0 or not, it's not 0, so it's "increased".
