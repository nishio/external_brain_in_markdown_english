title: "What you need to know"
---

- Assume that what we want them to know, they do not know.
    - Many people are unable to say, "I don't know, please tell me," when they think they know and have to leave out an explanation.
    - When asked the question, "Do you know?" many people answer "yes" even though they don't know.
    - If you explain something to someone thinking they don't know and in fact they do know.
        - Many people can't say, "I know."
        - In that case, time is wasted, but it does not lead to a situation where "we think they know, but they don't."
        - The cost of time to explain" is compared to "the future cost of the situation in which the other party thinks he or she knows, but the other party does not.
- What should I do that you don't want me to know?
    - Acting as if you know may result in letting them know even though you don't.
    - I can't even check to see if you know.
