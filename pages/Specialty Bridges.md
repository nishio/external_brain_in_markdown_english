A concept that was created in 2018 as a derivative of [[The illustrated guide to a Ph.D.]] and expressed in terms of "[[Valleys between specialties]]".
    - [[Assumption that it is a circle]]

Areas of expertise are often very deep, causing self-reinforcing feedback
- The field is highly dimensional and only a very limited number of areas have received attention.
- So, "[[the area reachable by humans]]" is [[Spiny spikes in higher dimensional space]].
- This [[connecting between the spikes]] has the potential to greatly expand the "area reachable by mankind".
- Sometimes called [[social implementation]] when one is a local domain
- As of December 2024, we feel that [[o1 Pro]] has the potential to be very effective with respect to this specialty bridge
        - [[Let o1 Pro do PICSY+Birdwatch]]
