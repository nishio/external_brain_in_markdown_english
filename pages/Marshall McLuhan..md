Marshall McLuhan.
Marshall McLuhan was one of the leading media theorists of the 20th century, especially known for his concept of "The medium is the message. His ideas about media provided a framework for a new understanding of the interplay between technology, society, and culture.

Below is an explanation of his main arguments.

1. "The media is the message."
The meaning of this phrase is that the very nature of the media itself has a greater impact on society than the content (message) conveyed in it.
Example: The
Television is a medium for conveying images, but its impact on society lies less in the images themselves and more in the visually-centered culture and behavioral patterns brought about by the television medium.
The Internet, too, has the power to change society not only through the content of its information, but also through its very structure of immediacy and interactivity.
2. hot and cool media
McLuhan classified media as **hot** and **cool**. This distinction is based on the degree of "participation" or "sensory impact" of the receiver.

Hot Media:.
High-resolution, information-rich media that demand less participation from the receiver.
Examples: film, radio, print.
Cool Media:.
Media with low resolution and low information content that must be actively supplemented by the receiver.
Examples: TV, telephone, cartoons.
3. the media is an extension of human beings
McLuhan saw media as an extension of human senses and abilities.

Example: The

The car extends the human leg.
Radio extends the sense of hearing.
The Internet extends access to knowledge and information.
However, he noted that these enhancements would also come with limitations. For example, he believed that a "shift in the balance of the senses" would occur, with radio reinforcing hearing while decreasing reliance on sight.

4. global village
McLuhan predicted that "the evolution of media will turn the world into a global village.
Meaning: to
The concept that electronic media (TV, radio, Internet, etc.) will reduce physical distance and interconnect the entire world as if it were a single village.
Because information is transmitted instantaneously, local events quickly become global concerns.
5. technological determinism and media influence
McLuhan believed that media and technology had the power to fundamentally change the structure and culture of human society.
The viewpoint that technological evolution defines societal behaviors, values, and thought patterns, sometimes criticized as technological determinism, is being reevaluated in the digital age.
6. relationship between media and environment
McLuhan viewed the media as an "environment. Media is more than just a means of conveying information; it is an entity that forms the foundation of people's lives and thinking.
Example: The
While print culture (print-centric) emphasized logical, linear thinking, the prevalence of electronic media promoted sensory, non-linear thinking.
7. impact and contemporary significance
McLuhan's theory is important for understanding the impact of digital media, as it is applicable to television and radio in the 20th century and to the Internet age in the 21st century.
The changes in modern society brought about by social media and smartphones confirm McLuhan's foresight that media will reconfigure humans and society.
summary
McLuhan believed that media is not merely a means of conveying information, but an essential force in shaping culture and society. His concepts of "media is the message" and "global village" remain valid in today's digital society and provide an important framework for rethinking the role of media in our lives and values.
