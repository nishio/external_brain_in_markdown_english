title: "The power to notice what is not yet there"

> [knshtyk](https://twitter.com/knshtyk/status/1644259235356901377) The phrase "[[make something if it is not there]]" tends to focus on the "[[make up (one's face, etc.)]]" part. However, if you don't notice what "[[not (verb-negating suffix; may indicate question or invitation with rising intonation)]]" is, you can't or won't make it in the first place, and therefore, "[[Something that doesn't exist]]" is not a good way to perceive the word "something". Therefore, the ability to perceive "[[Something that doesn't exist]]" or the ability to [[fantasize]] or assume "[[Something that does not yet exist]]" is more important. [[Discoveries and questions]].

- [[What we already have and what we don't yet have]]

- [[what we don't have yet]] to [[notice]] force
- [[What's missing.]] The ability to notice.
[[Not yet present]]
[[Not yet.]]
