title: "Rebuttable outputs"
---

A [[science fiction]]-style story.
- Without some form of "[[falsifiable]] output" in the course of [[intelligent life]] activities, one cannot be sure that one's understanding is correct, and one cannot build on one's understanding. But the means of output can take different forms.
Homo sapiens primarily uses natural language, which is a one-dimensional series of symbols, but this is just a continuation of the practice when we communicated by speech, so other intelligent beings can take other forms.
In a world where things can be easily duplicated and stored, it would be more accurate to store, duplicate, and share the experimental apparatus and obtained materials as they are, rather than writing down the experimental procedures and results in natural language when, for example, a chemical experiment is conducted.
That was not possible in the world that Homo sapiens experienced early on, but subsequent advances in information science have made the "shared source code" approach possible.
