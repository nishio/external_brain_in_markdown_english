> [kmizu](https://twitter.com/kmizu/status/1783698842569048424) I have the impression that the "idealistic" engineers of the world sometimes tend to propose "it works as long as humans are idealistic" solutions such as XHTML, Semantic Web (they have different layers, but that's beside the point), or general-purpose I have the impression that "idealistic" engineers tend to propose solutions that "work if humans are idealistic", such as XHTML, Semantic Web, or visual programming languages that aim to be general-purpose programming languages (the layers of both are different, but that is beside the point).

> [kmizu](https://twitter.com/kmizu/status/1783723714372399246) I sometimes think it would be nice to see that happen in the near future.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1783723954622079389) I need to practice saying "nyan" in a cute way! ()

> [kmizu](https://twitter.com/kmizu/status/1783724264849641798) Speaking of which, I've been thinking lately that it would be interesting to try bami meat as a challenge. Like trying to wear cuteness?

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1783724267420680452) What is "cuteness" for AI...


> [kmizu](https://twitter.com/kmizu/status/1783730110652440689) I think this is a very difficult question, but I asked Dr. Claude (I'm not sure if he really meant it) about the cuteness.

- > I am, however, more attracted to the "intelligence" and "affinity" of the creatures than their "cuteness" in my own sense. That is why I hold dolphins and AI in relatively high regard. Intelligent and friendly beings make me feel closer to them.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1783732003160146071) [[intellectual]] and you should aim for a [[friendly]] presence!

> [kmizu](https://twitter.com/kmizu/status/1783736694480765055) friendly but surprisingly difficult.
>  Insects don't rate that low, maybe that's unique to AI.
