State of the Broadband AI 2025-09-10
- What dd2030 is developing
    - I was so busy with Team Mirai's campaign that I didn't see it at all.
    - To be tweaked in the next week or so
    - memo: If we extract "problem consciousness" from issues and cluster them (as we did in Team Mirai), we can see the problem consciousness that should be prioritized for solution.
    - Forked for [Policy Policy Utilization Project
    - If I let Devin handle it, I can't merge it easily because I rewrote a lot of stuff around libraries and such.
    - With respect to the main scatterplot view, the pull-out line view was created assuming that the number of clusters is limited.
    - As for the dark cluster display, I think it would be nice to put a list and use it as a pull-out line, but it has not been implemented yet.
    - The hierarchical view is a new page itself.
- [[YouTube comment spreading AI]].
    - I'll start working on it in the next week or so.
    - I'm wondering if I should fork it or not.
        - But, well, I guess I'd better fork it.
        - And the AI merges what it writes without review.
    - How to reflect what has been forked and developed is troubling.
        - But I think we're coming soon to a future where AI will do a good job of that.
