title: "Calibration meeting generation process"

Communication [[calibration]] group
- Monthly 1-on-1 between [[Tomoya Tachikawa]] and Nishio
see  [[Calibration Session]]

Notes on outbreak process
- In 2018, Tachikawa tried to use Nishio for a [[BMOT]] event, and since the two options were about a month apart when trying to coordinate dates, Nishio said, "Why not both instead of either?" ([[choosing the wrong two options]]), and the event was held once a month.
    - > 2018-05-30
    - > T: There is a classroom available for 6/20 or 7/11. How is Nishio-san's availability?
    - > N: Both are fine, so let's hold both!
    - > T: Ewww, I hadn't thought of that idea.
    - > N: Isn't that a once-a-month pace?
- This caused "meetings for events" to occur at a monthly pace.
- The event itself disappeared after about five sessions, but the meetings themselves were continued because both parties felt they were beneficial.
- I've experimented with a lot of things, not just 1-on-1.
    - 2019-06  [[KJ method for "interesting]]
- Calibration meeting was called in 2019.
    - > 2019-09-12
    - > N: Where is the best place to schedule a regular calibration for September, other than 26 or 27 for the rest of the month?
    - > T: How about either 18 or 30 for the dates?
    - > T: (named "regular calibration session")
    - This led to the event being called a "calibration meeting" every time, and "what is calibration?" was delved into after the fact see May 2020
- 2019-10-15  [[Properly subjective]]
- May 2020 [[MP Recovery]].
    - >  [[Tomoya Tachikawa]] sometimes says "[[calibration]] is needed".
    - > The meaning of this word calibration is a little clearer now.
- May 2021 [[calibration]].
- October 2021 [[Calibration Session Partial Open Experiment]].
        - [[Parable of the Ropes]]
        - I think we need to not only do 1-on-1s, but also turn the keywords that come out of them into "ropes".
