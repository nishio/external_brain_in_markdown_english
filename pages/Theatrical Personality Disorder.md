Theatrical Personality Disorder (also called Acting Personality Disorder) is a personality disorder characterized by a very dramatic [[self-expression]] and a tendency to constantly seek the attention of those around them. Specifically, it is characterized by the following points.

- Strength of [[attention need]]
    - Always seeking the attention and admiration of others, self-expression and behavior are often exaggerated to the extreme.

- Excessive emotional expression
    - Emotions are shallow and fluctuate over a short period of time, while at the same time accompanied by dramatic production.

- interpersonal characteristics.
    - Relationships tend to be superficial and it is difficult to build deep trust.

- Self-assessment dependent.
    - Because their self-evaluation is largely dependent on the reactions of others, they may be hypersensitive to criticism and rejection.

Treatment is primarily through psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy), which aims to regulate emotions and improve self-awareness.


[[Extreme]]
- [[The more radical things you say, the more attention you get]].
