Repeat small bet wins.

If you can win 60% of the time where it is a 50%50% bet for most people, you can lead to a more favorable outcome than most by making a lot of smaller sized bets
- The assumption is that the position should be small enough that a 40% chance of losing is not fatal.
        - [[position sizing]]

At this time, information sharing does not take place where people scoff at the 40% chance of losing.
- Some people don't understand that we are aiming for a profit as a bundle, not a win in a single game.
    - Is that what happens when you're not used to dealing with stochastic events?
