- John Locke's [[John Locke's]] "right to appeal to heaven" justifies resistance and [[revolution]] as a last resort, looking to God (or heaven) as a guarantor of judgment when the government violates the rights of citizens and the [[social compact]] is broken. The right to "revolution" is the right to be free. According to Locke, when the social contract that people have entered into to protect their natural rights to life, liberty, and property is violated, it can no longer be resolved by ordinary means. In such cases, the act of "appealing to heaven" is positioned as the ethical basis for legitimate rebellion and revolution when rights are violated by those in power.
