title: "Seriousness and initiative"
---

    - Some people interpret [[serious]] to mean "not actively doing anything on their own" [pointed out](https://www.facebook.com/nishiohirokazu/posts/10212427183331181?pnref=story).
- Why is this so?
    - Is "doing only what the teacher tells you to do and not what you are not told to do" interpreted as being serious?
        - If you don't [[have a burst of courage]] to be [[proactive]], you might grow up to be that kind of person.
