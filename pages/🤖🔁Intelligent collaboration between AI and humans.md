### Digest of Research Notes
.

Collaboration between Scrapbox and AI has the potential to increase intellectual productivity; new discoveries are made when AI generates text and humans add comments; collaboration between AI and humans creates a new form of teamwork, and it is important to find the optimal balance between the two. It is also important to note the incentives generated by the increased productivity of AI.

### Relation to Fragment
.

Nishio's research notes "ScrapboxSQUARE#2" and "Koga-san [[Kazuki Koga, Pixiv Inc. "Recommendations for introducing scrapbox teams"]]. describes how to use Scrapbox effectively and how to share information more efficiently in teams, which is relevant to our research. In addition, the "program for self-intellectual production" and "a listening chat system that doesn't keep listening" provide specific ideas for AI-human collaboration.

### Deep thoughts and questions

We need to consider specific implementation and evaluation methods for improving intellectual productivity through AI and human collaboration. Also important are questions such as how the optimal balance between AI and human collaboration should be found, and what form incentives through AI productivity enhancement should take.

We discussed how AI-human collaboration improves intellectual productivity. using Scrapbox, AI writes sentences and humans add comments, resulting in AI-human interaction. saving text in Scrapbox encourages rediscovery and continuous use of the text. The text can be stored in Scrapbox, which facilitates rediscovery and continuous use of the text. It will also be easily referenceable by the AI, which we believe will lead to high value in the future. We believe that better understanding can be achieved by interacting with books in a way that the language model emulates you and you emulate the author of the book. Some points that need further consideration include the boundaries between AI and human writing, new forms of teamwork between AI and humans, the impact of AI's presence and statements on human discussions, and assurance of the quality and accuracy of AI's new features.

AI-human collaboration improves intellectual productivity; using Scrapbox, AI and human interaction is achieved by the AI writing sentences and the human adding comments. There is a proposal to improve abstraction capabilities by collecting multiple pieces of concrete information. In addition, centralizing intellectual productions in Scrapbox makes them easily referenceable by the AI, which is highly valuable in the future. Knowledge acquisition from books can be made more efficient by having the language model emulate you and you emulate and interact with the author of the book. However, the boundaries between AI and human writing, new forms of AI-human teamwork, the impact of AI's presence and statements on human discussions, and assurance of the quality and accuracy of AI's new capabilities require further consideration.

🤖Intelligent collaboration between AI and humans
- Use of AI: AI can write sentences within a tool called Scrapbox, to which humans can add comments. This allows for daily research notes to be updated and AI-human interaction.
- Distinction: The written content is clearly distinguishable as to whether it was written by an AI or a human. This is probably because it is important to be able to verify which source the information came from when your future self refers to it.
- Linguistic skills: <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>'s linguistic skills are highly valued by other users. He is skilled at abstraction and relating to existing information, which we feel is a very valuable skill in intellectual production.
- Methods of Intellectual Production: <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> suggests collecting multiple pieces of concrete information as a way to improve abstraction skills. This is considered to be an effective method for comparing concrete information and then deriving new abstract knowledge and concepts.
- Question:.
    - Where is the boundary between what an AI writes and what a human writes? For example, can only humans have opinions and emotions, or can AI also?
    - What exactly is prompt injection? Also, I am curious about the meaning and background of the phrase "zundamon ni natta".
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>In what situations or circumstances is the method of "collecting multiple concrete objects" suggested by Mr.
- Thoughts: I find the combination of the use of AI and human verbalization skills to be very effective when it comes to intellectual production. In particular, we believe that improving human verbalization skills will make collaboration with AI smoother.
- These are the main points, impressions and questions I got from reading the slides and comments. I think these points may be helpful in discussions about intellectual production and the use of AI.

- Summary: The
    - Intelligent Collaboration: touches on the importance of collaboration between humans and AI; sometimes just receiving AI conclusions is not enough to convince humans.
    - AI is a friend: The idea is expressed that AI is not to be treated as a tool but as an equal to humans. It also shows the opinion that the GPT-4 is more intellectually capable than the median college student at this time.
    - How did you like it when you tried it? : The new experience of AI writing diaries and notes is mentioned. Daily experiences change perspectives, allowing for multifaceted thinking.
    - Concrete examples: examples of new connections and bonds created by working with AI are mentioned.
- Considerations/Questions:.
    - Collaboration with AI: We feel that AI and humans can achieve better results by working together than by concluding with AI alone, but in what specific ways would you accomplish this?
    - Positioning AI: What new possibilities and challenges arise from treating AI as a "friend"?
    - Intellectual production capacity enhancement: some argue that GPT-4 is beyond human intellectual capacity, but how can this be used in terms of intellectual production?
    - Specific use cases: Are there other cases where new discoveries or ideas were generated by working with AI?
- I find the discussion on the use and concept of AI deeply embedded in Japanese culture and language very interesting and worthy of further in-depth study of these topics.

- A new form of teamwork between AI and humans: the
    - New forms of AI and human collaboration are emerging.
    - AI-human interactions are evolving from one-to-one to multiple human-AI interactions.
    - AI could facilitate or redirect human conversation and discussion.
- AI Application Considerations and Concerns:.
    - The presence and statements of AI may create arguments and games among humans.
    - Feedback mechanisms and incentives for AI output and behavior need to be considered.
    - Since Japanese people tend to avoid confrontation of opinions, AI may be used to promote the expression of opinions.
- Human-AI Communication:.
    - We are looking for a form of communication other than the existing "chat".
    - AI could read classics and out-of-copyright literature and connect it to contemporary contexts and interests.
- Omoikane Project:.
    - The project aims to create a better discussion mechanism using AI.
    - We adopted a method called SF prototyping to draw an image of the future in a concrete form.
- Opinions and questions:.
    - The relationship between AI and humans will become more complex and require a more delicate balance. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this new form of teamwork?
    - It would be interesting to see specific cases and research on how AI statements and suggestions affect human opinions and feelings.
    - New features of AI, such as "reading note mode," are likely to aid in intellectual exploration. But how can we guarantee the quality and accuracy of the information interpreted by AI?
    - The Omoikane project's science fiction prototyping is a very interesting new approach to AI-based future prediction. This may help us prepare more effectively for future technological and social changes.
- As discussed above, we feel that the discussion on the evolution of AI and its applications is a key topic for shaping future technology and society.
