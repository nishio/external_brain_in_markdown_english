title: "Series of pictures in which the same word refers to different things"

- [A series of pictures of two people saying different things
- But I've noticed that in some cases the same word describes different situations.
    - Or simply "[[misunderstanding]]"?
- concrete example
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/1c46a26e73c5f94c3f5ce11f44aeb4d7/thumb/1000)
    - There is one little thing X and one big thing Y.
    - There's X, there's Y, and there's Z.
        - I would assume the ratios are the same here.
    - Saying "we took first place in market share in Z in Y" is misinterpreted as "of course more than Z in X."
    - But if the ratio of Z in Y is small, it could actually be smaller than Z in X

- Scenario:
    - There is a small village X and a large city Y.
    - Both have a Chinese restaurant Z.
- Situation:
    - Village X has three restaurants, two of which are Chinese restaurants.
    - City Y has 300 restaurants, 30 of which are Chinese restaurants.
- Misunderstanding:
    - The village has little diversity and few types of restaurants.
    - You would assume that a city 100 times the size would have a similar ratio of cooks.
        - 200 Chinese restaurants
    - In fact, there are only 30 houses.
        - The city has a wide variety of restaurants, including Turkish and Vietnamese restaurants that were not in the village!
