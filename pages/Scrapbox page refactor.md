title: "Scrapbox page refactor"
---

- A page X is pinned to the top
- I wrote a lot of things down there.
- The result was a very large quantity.
- You're going to lose perspective.
- I want to solve this problem.
- I want to preserve it first.
    - plan 1
        - Make a copy of X on duplicate page (call it X2)
        - X2 has unfortunately lost all the data on the update date and time, etc.
        - So I want to preserve the X's as original data.
    - Rename X to "X(-20190522)", etc.
        - It asks if you want to auto-update the link, but ignore it.
    - unpin someone
- Create a new X page
    - Link to "X(-20190522)"
    - Now we have "split logs" for now.
    - If you keep writing on a new page, the log will be "divided by date of creation".
- refactor
    - At the beginning of the old page there was a line link to the middle of the page
    - This is "frequently accessed but buried halfway down the page and unwieldy"
        - [Row links are cut-out opportunities
    - Oh, the row links are broken by the above refactoring
    - Links to a page as a concept can be switched above, but line links are linked to a part of the page, so if the content of the page is rewritten, they will not be connected.
