Publication Date Action
- nishio: tomorrow we'll file a runoff with the Governing Body and move to the first voice venue in Shibuya, then ad-lib!
- Q: Are you running for office?
- A: No, it means that the candidate does not have time to go through the inefficient government procedures, so he/she has to have a proxy.
    - Specifically, it means that the three people who are running for proportional representation will receive the baggage they are supposed to receive by submitting their runoff papers.

8:27
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1940552910041137609) We are in a "high-ceilinged room with a surveillance window above" that looks like something out of a shonen manga. The death game may be starting!

8:32
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1940554274003624439) The ritual started with a time signal to measure the time. Seems to be a ball with numbers on it, like bingo, to determine the order.

8:38
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1940555658547679303) I'm number 8 in the reception order.

8:40
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1940556279816376628) I'm being shown some kind of lottery ritual for everyone when I should just go through the process as soon as the order is decided.

8:43
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1940556894554521956) I heard that after all the drawings are done, the first party is called in order, it's a ritual that uses time extravagantly.

8:53
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1940559487800430788) 9 minutes have passed and we are now at number 3, simple math says it will take 54 minutes...

8:54
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1940559808593289353) I feel sorry for the staff who have to sit around this time just doing nothing, torture of being forced to spend their time aimlessly when they probably have a lot of work that needs to be done to get done.

8:55
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1940560095894761749) Why is it taking so long to pre-screen and seal the documents?

8:56
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1940560331514040669) The list of the #1 party now has been accepted. Long way to go!

8:59
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1940561028095553897) just had number 5 called.

9:01
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1940561620608155830) Just now #2 was accepted and #6 was called.

9:09
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1940563409604694482) called!

9:17
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1940565488314261754) extended wait times.
>  They can't accept proportional representation until they have completed the national candidate process and can confirm that there are over 10 candidates. Well, that's not an option. ......

9:21
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1940566547808112844) I'm feeling like was it worth it to meet at 8:30 to raffle it off?

9:31
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1940569164303028483) just now #14 was called.

9:38
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1940570691046461919) Number 15 is being called right now, and it seems to be the last party!

9:57
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1940575654506123705) delay start by 30 minutes
>  >[team_mirai_jp](https://x.com/team_mirai_jp/status/1940574978883358806) [Notice of change of start time / The event will start at 10:30
>  Proportional Yasuno was scheduled to speak at the Shibuya Station Hachiko Exit scramble crossing at 10:00, but this has been rescheduled for 10:30.
>  Sorry to keep you waiting in the heat, but thank you for your patience!
>  #Team Mirai #Takahiro Yasuno #Yuya Mineshima

10:05
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1940577595193737272) Our side is aware via Slack that more than 10 people have already been accepted, but it seems that MIC is taking some time to call? We are still waiting for the MIC to confirm the fact by phone?

10:08
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1940578321844392142) Finally confirmed!

10:47
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1940588100461515032) Leaving the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications! I'm heading to Shibuya by cab!
>  ![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gu5alhnWUAA_3I-?format=jpg&name=medium#.png)

10:50
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1940588956497989643) I stamped my seal about 18 times, probably more than I've stamped in a decade.

11:31
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1940599197591605553) arrived safely at Shibuya

> [hrjn](https://x.com/hrjn/status/1940730497476465008) election live coverage interesting.

> [city_booy](https://x.com/city_booy/status/1940574753150193841) I'm at the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications with Mr. Nishio to do the proportional procedure, but the whole situation starting from this post, the blurring is amazing!

> [YK22612](https://x.com/YK22612/status/1941340595638894737) The retro system of how inefficiently this series of posts is making the best people devote their precious time to inefficient things... I wonder if they could write a whole paper in that time (speculation). I wonder if they could write a paper in that time (speculation).
