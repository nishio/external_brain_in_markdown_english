<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It would be good if Scrapbox could decide which is the priority among creating a table of contents, reflecting the 4th edition and typesetting.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "Scrapbox" is this "Scrapbox"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>No bookish navigation, so it cannot be read bookishly without a table of contents.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "table of contents" is that "table of contents"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>A representation of the author's hierarchical structure of a single piece of content
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  No bookish navigation, so you can't read it bookishly without a table of contents.
- Is there anything else about this "Table of Contents"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Can be generated automatically by typesetting scripts.

- >  No bookish navigation, so you can't read it bookishly without a table of contents.
- Where can I find this "Table of Contents"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Not now.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  No bookish navigation, so you can't read it bookishly without a table of contents.
- How do you know this "Table of Contents"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It's the same as the Japanese version, so I'm just lining it up.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "Japanese version" is this "Japanese version"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Original version of the book
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "book" is this "book"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Books on Intellectual Production
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "intellectual production techniques" are those?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>The main focus is on the process of writing a book, but the know-how of how to structure a book on Scrapbox is not included here.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that "Scrapbox"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I don't think I'm cut out for writing, not bad for translating.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "translation" is this "translation"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>The work of expressing in another language what is already organized, finite and serialized in the original content
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Hmmm, it sounds like you want to avoid manual work in creating a table of contents in Scrapbox, and avoid having to do it twice in the typesetting afterwards.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between that "Scrapbox" and the "Table of Contents"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>(And when you want to avoid it, what would you like to see happen? If the table of contents for Scrapbox should also appear from the typesetting script, or)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Scrapbox itself does not have the ability to create a table of contents, a human has to do the simple work, which is not good.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is that "Scrapbox" the same as a "Table of Contents"? Is it different?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>No. It would be nice if it could be generated from Scrapbox.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Where does this "Scrapbox" come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Already there.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  Scrapbox itself does not have the ability to create a table of contents, a human has to do the simple work, which is not good.
- Where is this "Table of Contents" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>No, we need to make it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
