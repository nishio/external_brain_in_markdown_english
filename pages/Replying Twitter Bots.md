title: "Replying Twitter Bots"
---

- I was wondering if I could just follow only the people I could reply to and see the timeline.
- If the number of people you are following is small, even "likes" will flow to your timeline.
- And of course the retweets flow in.
- It is a nice nuisance when a bot replies to something that has been retweeted or liked.
