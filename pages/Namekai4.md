There is a book that Audrey and Glenn are writing on Github with CC0.
I've mentioned it in bits and pieces a few times, but I'll explain it properly again.

- Occupy Parliament at 32
- Cable pulled, broadband connection, Live relay
- [[Reverse Mentoring]]
Minister of Digital(2022~)

Glenn's description.
Quadratic Voting
Quadratic Funding
- Co-authored with Vitalik of Ethereum
Radical Market
- Many of you have probably read it since it was translated into Japanese.
Plural Management
- Open to the public in January 2024, freshly completed.

RadicalxChange
- incorporated nonprofit organization
- X: Exchange style X derived from Yukito Emaya

(Brief description of the exchange style)
- [[Structure of World History]]
- 1:
    - A small group of us shared the food we took.
    - Reciprocal Gifts, Exchange Form A
- 2:
    - It doesn't work well when there are more people.
    - Need a "governing" mechanism.
    - Obey and you will be protected, Exchange Form B
- 3:
    - The "contract" was made possible by the deterrent power of the ruler to "punish you if you don't follow the rules".

Depth vs. space tradeoff
- intimate relationship
- capitalism
- trade-off
- production possibility frontier
- Technology pushes this frontier.

In the CC0-licensed book that Audrey and Glenn are co-authoring, you are exploring the possibilities of a new social system.

Audrey took a radical step when she was 32 years old by taking over Parliament, pulling cable and broadcasting live over the Internet. She then joined the government as Minister of Digital and is probably trying to incorporate the views of the younger generation using the reverse mentoring approach.

Glen, on the other hand, has proposed a series of innovative social system ideas, including Quadratic Voting, Quadratic Funding, Radical Markets, and Plural Management, and has co-authored a book with Vitalik, co-founder of Ethereum. He has also co-authored a book with Vitalik, co-founder of Ethereum, and is a high-profile figure in the field. RadicalxChange, a non-profit organization led by the two men, is thought to be working to put these ideas into practice.

To borrow Yukito Emorya's concept of "Mode of Exchange," the society they are aiming for might be called "Mode of Exchange X." They may be trying to create a new social system by combining the advantages of a small-scale community based on reciprocal gifts and a large-scale capitalist society based on contracts, with the power of technology.

There is a trade-off between intimate relationships and efficient resource allocation, but I believe they are exploring the possibility of achieving both by pushing the production possibility frontier. It may still be experimental, but Audrey and Glenn's attempt to change society for the better is worthy of attention.
