title: "Self-promotion and branding"
---

I felt uncomfortable when I saw the statement "[[self-promotion]] is not [[branding]]," so I drew it.

- It is often observed that [[unpleasant feelings (e.g. hatred, disgust, revulsion, fear)]] are held toward people who are not good at what they do, but only appeal to others.
- On the other hand, we often observe people who are competent but lose out due to poor appeal.
- Some people think, "I don't want to appeal, but I do want people around me to recognize my abilities."
    - But people around you are not that interested in you.
    - The fallacy that "if you improve your competence, you will be recognized" is similar to "if you make a good product, you will sell it."
    - Most people are not capable of correctly perceiving the competence of others.

    - [[real ability]] must be demonstrated by [results
    - Just because you think you are "competent" doesn't mean you are well-informed.
    - Because it is possible for people who are not competent to falsely believe that they are competent.
        - [[Dunning-Kruger effect]]

- But [[opportunity]] to get results is not given equally
        - [Opportunity is a scarce resource.
    - Basically, society is a [competitive environment
    - Not even equal opportunities to grow in competence.
        - [[Chicken and Egg Relationship]]
