title: "Economic stability is a recession"
---

- [Joseph Schumpeter
> When entrepreneurs implement innovations, the economy is disturbed, but the growing imbalance is the process of a boom. On the other hand, a recession was considered to be a process in which the entire economy responds by following the leading firms that have obtained monopoly profits in the new situation brought about by the innovation, and the economy gradually [[balances]] out due to credit contraction (repayment to banks).
In other words, "When the economy [[stabilizes]] without [[change]], it is a [[recession]].

from  [[Maintaining the status quo is a step backward]]
