- The other "was" not raised.
- by the creation of a common language.
- What grows between two people

a matter that does not concern either sex
When we talk about men and women, we say, "I don't have a good marriage partner."
- Not someone in a good marriage situation for you falls down and you pick them up.
- bring up by oneself
- This also creates a relationship between, rather than "changing" the other party.

You don't need to make dozens of people in these relationships, but it's better to have a few.
- To enhance the happiness of your life
