- When the [[ideal]] state cannot be achieved, you need to drag it down to the [[achievable]] area, but then there is [[room for choice]] where to drag it towards

Even if a person hears a description of an ideal state that has not yet been realized and says, "I like that," there is a possibility that the person will [[compromise]] and look at what has been realized and say, "This is not good" because the attributes that the person thinks are "good" are unknown.

    - [[production possibility frontier]]

- [[Dare to draw without words]]
