> Lately, when I "read" an article, I try to make a note of it in Scrapbox as much as possible. But when I do that, I can really make connections between various stories. I guess this kind of effort is a way to avoid [[hoarding]].

        - [[More links.]]   [[spread one's roots (of a tree, etc.)]]

We usually work under the assumption that the concept expressed by a word X is the same, even though it is different for each person.
- Sometimes when a major problem arises, we express that a "misunderstanding has occurred," but it was never a "0% misunderstanding" in the first place.
    - Some areas, such as mathematics, are meticulously and cost-effectively worked out to avoid misunderstandings.
    - The average person doesn't care about the definition of a word.
- The reason why it's important to make it "[[one's own words]]" is because other people's words are not adequate to express one's understanding
