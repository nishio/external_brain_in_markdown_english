Knowledge gained from "pure experience" is formed through collaboration and working with AIs; Nishio's "Hare Moya Hare is the Next Step" and "Knowledge Transfer through Collaboration" have relevance to my research. However, fragments such as "What Were Books Selling?" and "BMOT Special Class No. 1: Intellectual Production" show the limits of knowledge transfer through words.

Nishio's "creating a state of high intellectual productivity," "that ideas are a resource that can be replicated, and that producing the same idea as one that already exists is of little value," and "that ideas only become valuable after they are created and after a lot of effort is put into nurturing and refining them. perspective is important for increasing the productivity of knowledge.

Discovering and communicating new knowledge is a means of value creation, and knowledge can be reshaped and communicated to others, creating customer value. Updating knowledge is more burdensome than learning new knowledge. This is because it requires negating existing knowledge. Investing in knowledge-producing technologies expands and reproduces knowledge capital.

While the cost of "writing knowledge" is going down, there comes a time when "having knowledge" and "being able to write and publish knowledge" are not enough. The ability to communicate in detail what you want to do and what you think is good for you is important.

Empirical knowledge derived from the senses is confusing and tacit knowledge is difficult to share; effective collaboration between AI and human collaborators is required. A generative collective intelligence system collects responses given a group and prompts, evaluates them, and condenses them into meaningful generative outputs that best represent the group. It is important to elicit unverbalized knowledge.

### Relation to Fragment
.

In "Conversation Log 2020-06-08-2," it is stated that the flow of ideas is more likely to be generated by looking at actions. This is associated with eliciting unverbalized knowledge. It also states that "engagement = a state of repeated collaboration" promotes a cooperative attitude, which is associated with effective collaboration between AI and human collaborators.

In "Collective Intelligence," it is stated that groups perform better. This is related to the nature of generative collective intelligence systems.

In Study Session 2 of "Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning," "There is a 'pure experience' before words!" is stated. This relates to experiential knowledge gained from the senses.

### Deep thoughts and questions

What elements are needed to achieve effective collaboration between AI and humans? And what are the specific methods for eliciting unlinguistic knowledge? These questions need to be considered in depth.

Collaboration and the SECI model will be beneficial to AI and human knowledge productivity, and new forms of teamwork will be required. Improvements in Japanese AI technology will impact Japanese culture and identity; AI governance will require international interoperability; AI assistant personalization will need to achieve balance with user data control; and AI governance will require a new form of teamwork.

The Omoikane project aims to test a new methodology for deliberation based on science fiction prototyping and to create an AI that reflects Japanese culture and thinking. However, empirical knowledge derived from the senses is confusing and obscure, and tacit knowledge is difficult to share; effective collaboration between AI and human collaborators is required.

According to Nishio's research note, "Omoikane Project Commentary at the end of June," the goal of the Omoikane project is to summarize the results of the deliberations on the question of AI assistants, test a new methodology for deliberation based on SF prototyping, and create an AI that reflects Japanese culture and thinking The goal of the project is to create an AI that reflects Japanese culture and thinking. This is relevant to my research and should be considered in depth.

Also, in "Deliberation Technology: Generative CI through 'Collective Response Systems,'" the essence of a generative collective intelligence system is to collect responses given a group and prompts, evaluate them, and condense them into meaningful generative outputs that best represent the group. This relates to effective collaboration between AI and human collaborators.

In "From One Subjectivity to Many, Not Subjective or Objective," the importance of tapping into knowledge that has not yet been verbalized is stated. This is related to the difficulty of sharing experiential knowledge derived from the senses and tacit knowledge.

Based on the above, we believe that new forms of teamwork, collaboration, and the SECI model will be beneficial for improving AI and human knowledge productivity. In addition, Japanese culture and identity and international interoperability are important for improving Japanese AI technology and AI governance. Furthermore, personalization of AI assistants needs to achieve balance with user data control. From these perspectives, we should deeply consider the goals and methodology of the Omoikane project, the nature of generative collective intelligence systems, and the importance of knowledge that has not yet been translated into language.

Increasing knowledge productivity requires diverse perspectives, and AI can provide a broad perspective. However, the current use of AI makes it difficult to share tacit knowledge between humans and AI that has not been verbalized. To solve this, "collaboration" is necessary, where humans and AI share experiences, and cycles that include collaboration, such as the SECI model, are beneficial for this purpose.

There are two types of intelligent collaboration between AI and humans: a process in which humans and AI cooperate and integrate, and a process in which AI assists humans to integrate. New forms of teamwork are also emerging in which AI and humans are team members.

Improvements in Japanese AI technology will allow AI to provide efficient communication and services while maintaining Japanese as the official language. However, it is necessary to consider how AI's proficiency in English will affect Japanese culture and identity.

International interoperability" is an important keyword in AI governance, and OpenAI wants to create a forum for international discussion because we want international interoperability to increase.

Regarding personalization of AI assistants, a balance could be achieved by allowing users to control their own data.

The Omoikane project aims to test a new methodology for deliberation based on science fiction prototyping and to create an AI that reflects Japanese culture and thinking.
