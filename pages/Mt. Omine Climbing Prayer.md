Maybe I noticed the application form a little too late.

Last fall after [[Kumano Kodo 2023]], I was thinking, "It's around summer, so maybe I'll apply in the spring.
It was an application through the web form by 5/15.
At any rate, I'm going to apply because it's fate that I realized when "it might not be too late".
