- A1: Mr. A has some existing words that cannot be well expressed in any existing language, blurred F1.
- A2: Not the best fit, but I found a word S1 that tentatively describes F1
- B1: Mr. B does not know what S1 means
- B2: I thought about it for a while and then I thought, "Maybe like this?" (F2)
- B3: Mr. B thought it would be more appropriate to describe F2 as S2,
- B4: S1 replaced by S2
- A3: From A's point of view, S2 is not connected to F1 at all
    - The barely grasped handle to the F1 appears to have been destroyed.
