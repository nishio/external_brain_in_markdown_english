title: "Right knee pain due to mountain climbing"

- Pain in [[right knee]] due to [mountain climbing
- We know that the cause is in the thigh muscles ([[quadriceps muscle]]).
- So why right?
- Possibility 1: Unintentional overuse of the right side.
- Possibility 2: Weak right side
- I thought it was two.
    - I've been consciously using my left leg since my right knee started hurting, all the climbs on the second day were up on my left leg, if it was as weak as it was, I would have expected some inflammation in my left leg, but I didn't.
    - Usually, for example, when washing dishes or waiting for a train, you may unconsciously stand with your left foot center of gravity.
    - The left calf tends to be injured when walking a lot, but the right side of the ankle joint has a narrower range of motion
- Guess:.
    - The left leg is usually overworked to protect the [[Right ankle]], which has a narrow range of motion, and as a result, the left leg muscles are stronger than the right.
    - This time, the ankle is fixed by the high-cut mountaineering shoes, and the load is equally applied to the left and right foot, and the weaker right foot broke first.
