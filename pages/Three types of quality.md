Three types of [[(material) quality]]
    - [[search quality]] ・ [[experiential quality]] ・ [[reliability]]
    - [[search quality]] :
    - Quality that consumers can evaluate before purchasing a product
    - For example, clothes can be tried on before purchase.
    - [[experiential quality]] :
    - Quality that consumers can evaluate after purchasing the product
    - For example, restaurant food can be evaluated after eating it.
    - [[reliability]] :
    - Difficult to evaluate even after purchasing product
    - For example, it is difficult to move into more than one nursing home and compare them.
    - I'm not sure if the home I chose was the right one.
