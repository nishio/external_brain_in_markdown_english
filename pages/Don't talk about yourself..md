title: "Don't talk about yourself."

from [[The Art of Worldly Wisdom]]
Don't talk about yourself.

cxvii
Do not talk about yourself.
> To blame oneself is narrow-minded.
- [[servility]] Right.

To praise oneself is vain, to reproach oneself is narrow-minded: it is inconvenient for the speaker and unpleasant for the listener. If this is to be avoided in ordinary conversation, it is even more so in public matters, especially in public speaking, where the appearance of lack of wisdom is in fact lack of wisdom. For there is a danger of being divided into two extremes: flattery or reproach.
