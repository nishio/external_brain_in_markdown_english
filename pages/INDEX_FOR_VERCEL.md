If you are interested in how to make custom view on custom domain, see [Github:nishio/mem](https://github.com/nishio/mem).

I'm currently programming new translation system using GPT3.5 ChatGPT API, for better translation and custom view using Quartz.

This page is auto-translated from [/nishio/INDEX_FOR_VERCEL](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/INDEX_FOR_VERCEL) using DeepL. If you looks something interesting but the auto-translated English is not good enough to understand it, feel free to let me know at [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en). I'm very happy to spread my thought to non-Japanese readers.
