- [[route]] You can [[pivot]] in the future because there's something to gain on
    - [[goal]] doesn't have to be [[clear]] to [[in advance]], because it will pivot in the future.

People who don't see [[value on the path]] only see the goal.
- Trying to read value directly from the goal

What you get on the path
- Do you want to keep it a secret?
- A case where, even if it's not a secret, if it's not common to everyone, you don't bother to tell them, and there's no merit in telling them.
    - So this is [[The bias of easy drawing]], too.
        - If you are physically on the same path
            - Beautiful scenery is the common property of all who share the same path.
            - If you're going to pick flowers that are blooming on the side of the road, the early bird gets the early bird's competition.
        - However, when [[a bond has value]], what kind of bond occurs depends on the individual
            - It's burdensome for an individual to disclose everything they have now, and there's no incentive, so even if they're not actively keeping it secret, it's [[in the fog]].
