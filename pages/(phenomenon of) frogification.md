Most of them have low self-esteem, so they think any guy who likes them is a low-class, crappy guy. A loop where you are forever chasing only cheating jerks. When they are loved by a nice, faithful guy, they get cold feet and can't stay without breaking it. It's sick.


interesting
I'll look for a decent source later.
