title: "social rate of return on investment"

[SROI (Social Return on Investment) is a quantitative measure of the amount of social value created for the money invested. It converts the economic and social results per invested amount into a monetary value, and evaluates "how many times more social value is created for every one invested. For example, in the case of supporting local NPO activities, SROI quantifies the employment creation, life improvement, community revitalization, etc. caused by the donated funds, and expresses them as a ratio to the investment.

Advantages of Introduction
- Objective evaluation: The results of activities can be converted into monetary values and explained to funders and supporters in an easy-to-understand manner.
- Improved decision-making: Guidance when considering which areas/projects to focus investments and grants on.
- Accountability: The recipient of financial support should be able to demonstrate results in numerical form, so that social consensus can be easily reached.

notes
- Methods for converting social outcomes into monetary terms require estimation and assumptions, and are prone to a certain degree of error and subjectivity.
- Without clear criteria for valuation, there is a risk of underestimating or overestimating the actual value.

Therefore, SROI is an important framework for visualizing "how much positive impact we have had on society" rather than simply measuring financial returns.

I guess it's hard to translate social outcomes into monetary terms.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
