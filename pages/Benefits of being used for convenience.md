title: "Benefits of being used for convenience"
---

I've been conveniently used to [[indefinite tasks]] my whole life.
- In retrospect, I think this was very beneficial.
- But in general, "[[used for]] convenience" has a negative connotation.
- I was trying to figure out why this was, and [[resolution (e.g., display, dpi)]] of "conveniently used" came up
- From Mr. A's point of view
    - Conveniently used for Mr. A's [[private]] gain.
    - Conveniently used for the [[public]] good.
- The former is bad, the latter is good.
- "Conveniently" means "matching the right person with the right job."
    - Mr. A sees it and I don't [[opportunity to contribute]].
    - I have trust that it's okay for Mr. A to make an ill-defined, fluffy throw at me.
        - [[Matching Needs and Seeds]]

    - [[entanglement power]]
