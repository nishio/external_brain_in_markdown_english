[[イングランド国教会]]はヘンリー8世の下でカトリック教会から独立したものの、カトリック的要素を一部保持している。[[清教徒]]はプロテスタントの一派で、イングランド国教会の「純化」を求めた。<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Puritans are Protestant and the Church of England is Catholic?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>No, that understanding is incorrect. I will explain in more detail below.
- Puritans (Puritans, [[Puritans]]):.
    - The Puritans originated as a sect within the Church of England (also known as the Anglican Church or Church of England).
    - They felt that the Church of England retained many Catholic practices and rituals after its independence from the Catholic Church and called for reforms to "purify" these. For this reason, they were called "Puritans," meaning "those who seek purification.
        - カトリック的な慣習や儀式を多く残しているから純化を求めるのね、なるほど<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - The Puritans were a Protestant sect and were strongly influenced by [[Calvinism]].
- Church of England
    - The Church of England became the official Church of England in 1534 when it became independent from the Roman Catholic Church under Henry VIII.... Both the Puritans and the Church of England are Protestant. However, the Church of England retains some Catholic elements due to its origins and historical background.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Is it OK to understand that during the reign of [[Henry VIII]], the Roman Catholic Church forbade divorce, and that Henry VIII divorced several times after independence?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Your understanding is partially accurate, but I will add a few details... Henry VIII asked the Roman Catholic Church to annul his marriage to his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, in order to dissolve the marriage. But when the Pope refused to grant this request, Henry VIII separated and seceded the Church of England from the Roman Catholic Church... He married six more times, but those marriages also ended in divorce, bereavement, or other reasons... He did not "divorce" himself many times. The history of his marriages is complex and includes many different events, including the declaration of annulment of marriages and the fate of his wives.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Ah, I see, so you think that "dissolution of marriage status" in the form of "marriage is invalid because the marriage procedure was flawed" is not "divorce". I'm not a big fan of the word "divorce," so that's fine with me.
