> I'm repeating what I wrote on the web about 16 years ago.
>  In the Internet, "[[technical]] [[use of force]]" is currently driving the situation. Therefore, the forceful opinions of software engineers and those with computational power are more likely to prevail.
>  For example, "We have the technology to record posts with [[fishtraps]], etc." goes through, and the requests of people who want to write bad words and delete them and get away with it don't go through.
