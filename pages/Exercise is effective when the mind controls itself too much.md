title: "Exercise is effective when the mind controls itself too much"
---

- [When [[spirit]] controls itself too much, [[motion]] is effective

> [joybuda](https://x.com/joybuda/status/1817448618460406085) As important as it is to take care of yourself, it's just as important to "not take care of yourself".

> [joybuda](https://x.com/joybuda/status/1819712915731370470) Maybe people who are skilled in meditation and zazen can "not deal with themselves" through meditation and zazen, but for ordinary people like me, "aerobic exercise " would be the first choice. Stop rambling on in your head and go for a run. Ride a bike. Swim. Walk.
>  >joybuda: It's just as important to "not deal with yourself" as it is to take care of yourself.
> [joybuda](https://x.com/joybuda/status/1819714421301871041) Once you start running, your brain begins to focus on the breathing and muscle loading associated with physical exercise, and a moment soon arrives when the worries and challenges you had earlier are no longer your top priority. The ability to perceive this shift in the order of priorities has a very positive effect.

> [HironoYuna](https://x.com/HironoYuna/status/1820034288584368240) "Exercise is good" sounds like muscle supremacy, but it's not, it's this very "when your mind and thoughts dominate you too much, you can overcome them by moving your body. It's not about muscle supremacy when we say "exercise is good". If you are looking at your inner self and feeling down, you can ask your body to pull you up.
