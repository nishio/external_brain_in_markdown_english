> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1823035971560189953) Knowledge allows [[Narrowing the search area]] and efficient discovery of the correct answer and decision making. When we realize the results, we feel that it is very inefficient and time-consuming to search without using the knowledge-based range limitation, and we cannot choose it with a rational mind. But the environment is always changing, so the distribution of solutions changes.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1823036828125180080) Ignorant people don't have this limitation of search range, so they often don't reach a solution to a nuisance that they would easily notice if they had the limitation, whereas they don't notice it because of the limitation. On the other hand, there is a probability of noticing a solution that is not noticed because of the limitation. Here, I thought it was important to note that this "solution" itself is also knowledge, and that it is hierarchically structured.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1823037403671748659) In other words, "knowledgeable person A and not knowledgeable person B" is the presence or absence of knowledge at one layer, and the lack of knowledge at that layer causes B to search inefficiently over a wider area than A, The result is that B may search inefficiently for a wider range of knowledge than A, and as a result, may come to have knowledge that A does not have in another layer. Because of this composition, the label "knowledgeable/non-knowledgeable" is inappropriate

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1823038568534876472) So, ultimately, "[[human encounters with different search ranges are profitable]]. Player A has already found the [[gushing point]] of value and is profiting from it, while player B is searching for it. If the "gush point" is something to be competed for like water, then player B should not tell player A.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1823039270724276457) Interestingly, this is a [[supermodular]] case: if B teaches A about the still small gush point he found, the gush itself grows and both A's profit and B's A's profit and B's profit both increase. The basic premise is that we are playing a [[plus-sum]] game of this type. Under these conditions, there is an incentive for [[map sharing]] for players with different search areas

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1823040041473699851) In reality, even if only a map is shared, there are [[barriers to entry]], there are resource outflows that cannot be retrieved, there are [[walls]], [[membranes]] and [[gates]] in the world. Not all places are [[permissionless]].

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1823040410606031106) "Ignorance is a resource" is an overly abstract expression that has mysteriously caught on, and I've been trying to verbalize in more detail how ignorance is not always a resource. I tried to verbalize in more detail when ignorance is a resource.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1823041924909220172) Humans are used to [[scramble]] for [[Rare resources]]. Scramble (for)" means "the more users, the less each person gets", which does not apply to [[digital goods]] that can be replicated inexpensively. When people gather and the number of contributors increases, the gain rather increases. This is [an oasis where the more people gather, the more water gushes out

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1823042821068357758) [[excess, not deficiency]]. What is the problem with excess, for example, [[more choices increase the cost of search]], which leads to the first point here. When information is abundant, [[attention becomes a scarce resource]]. The means of attracting people and [[biasing]] attention becomes important. This is where legitimacy becomes a scarce resource.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1823043697996693788) If [[legitimacy]] becomes a scarce resource, then [[legitimacy engineering]] and [[legitimacy management]] of how to create legitimacy becomes useful. Legitimacy engineering] and [[legitimacy management]] will become useful. [For global legitimization, local legitimation tools invented before the Internet are of limited power. The process of global [[new public]] creating [new legitimization
