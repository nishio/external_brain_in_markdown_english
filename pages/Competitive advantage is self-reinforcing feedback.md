title: "Competitive advantage is self-reinforcing feedback"

- Creating a [[competitive edge]] is a [[self-reinforcing feedback]] in the business activity.

What is the logic behind the manifestation of self-reinforcing feedback? I recommend making a systems thinking loop diagram and agreeing on it with all parties involved, even if it is poorly written. It is easier to see the story than a spreadsheet business plan.
