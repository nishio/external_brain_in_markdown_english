When a person becomes tired beyond a certain point, he or she is unable to generate the energy to leave the state and continues to linger in that environment.


Well, that means I'm still at work when I should just go home. Oh well. If I don't go home soon, I'm going to be wondering about the last train if I linger around for another 20 minutes or so.
