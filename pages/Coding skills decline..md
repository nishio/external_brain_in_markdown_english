title: "Coding skills decline."
---

> [kur](https://x.com/kur/status/1888944024826053116) Since I started using [[Cursor]], the amount of code I write has decreased so much that I'm worried that my [[coding skills]] are not up to par.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1888945317862863218) The amount of code I write has been decreasing dramatically, but the production of code itself has been increasing (the problem is that the quality has not been maintained so far). I think this is the same as the time when I used to write Kanji with a pen and the time when I started to do [[kana-kanji conversion (on a computer, etc.)]].

My ability to write kanji has declined since I started using kana-to-kanji conversion.
- So should we not use kana-kanji conversion?
    - It doesn't work that way.
