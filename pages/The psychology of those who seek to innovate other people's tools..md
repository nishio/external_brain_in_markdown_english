The psychology of people who try to innovate tools that others are using that they don't even use themselves.

1. desire to dominate and control
    - It is similar to the "internal control motive" in organizational psychology, in which one wants to indirectly control the behavior patterns of others by redesigning the system.
            - [[lust for power]]
    - Because "not using = no user perspective," the main goal tends to be to expand one's own sphere of influence rather than to solve essential problems.
2. desire for approval and self-efficacy
    - Improving the tools of others is likely to produce tangible results and social recognition ("this person reformed").
    - The more you have not yet touched the field, the more your self-efficacy will soar if you succeed - a sense of "winning in uncharted territory".
- 3.[[patternalistic good will]].
    - He or she works with good intentions, saying that he or she wants to help and that he or she should make things more convenient.
    - However, because they do not know the actual conditions of use, there is a high risk of imposing their own ideal image over the actual needs.
    - A mild version of the "savior complex" ([[savior syndrome]]) found in the medical and development assistance fields.
4. too much rationalism and engineering thinking
    - If I were the designer, I would do it this way.
    - Because tools are viewed as "systems" and as optimization problems, it is easy to neglect the emotional and cultural factors of users.
    - Typical example: outside consultants completely reorganize the site flow → site collapses.
5. social comparison and status signals
    - They subconsciously label themselves as "old-fashioned" and send a "status signal" that they are "progressive" by proposing renewal.
    - Use the image that the person leading the upgrade = excellent.

Tips on how to get along
- The person in question is working with good intentions.
    - Have them visit the site of use → fill in the gaps in understanding
- Reform is self-righteous
    - Propose small-scale demonstrations to limit failure costs
- True issue is unknown
    - Mandatory set of user hearings
- Strong desire for approval
    - Separate easy-to-visualize performance indicators from essential improvements

PS
- This is doing the opposite of "[[respecting]] the existing system."
