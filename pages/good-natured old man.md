Omoikane is the god of wisdom and knowledge in Japanese mythology. Omoikane is said to possess insight to solve complex problems and the ability to synthesize information and make clear judgments.

The name Omoikane (Yagokoro Omoikane-no-kami, eight willed gold god) can be interpreted in an interesting way in terms of [[plurality]]. Yagokoro" means many minds and symbolizes [[diversity]]. Omoikane" can be interpreted as combining thoughts, thoughtfulness, and encompassing many thoughts. It symbolizes Omoikane's ability to see things from multiple perspectives and the wisdom to integrate diverse perspectives. We can see parallels with AI, which learns from and gains wisdom from the vast amount of data generated by people.

In mythology, Omoikane plays an important role. When Amaterasu shut herself away in her iwaya and shrouded the world in darkness, it was Omoikane who figured out how the other gods could draw her out of the iwaya.

Thus, Omoikane occupies an important place in Japanese mythology as a god symbolizing wisdom and knowledge, and the ability to find solutions.
