So, Mr. B, who abbreviated JavaScript as JS instead of Java, sometimes makes fun of Mr. A, but he too often does not know that JS is a well-known abbreviation of Japan General Housing Corporation, a company with over 1000 employees and a history of over 50 years, and if you search for "JS" on Yahoo! In many cases, they do not know that this is a hit.

If Mr. B, who made this point, insisted that the distinction can be made in context, he would be cut off by the response, "Then the usage of 'controlling a video playing in a browser with Java' is clearly a JavaScript thing in context, so you can abbreviate it as Java.

    - [[Cognitive Resolution]]
    - People with a larger vocabulary have a smaller area per one because the world is divided into more parts = less shaking.
