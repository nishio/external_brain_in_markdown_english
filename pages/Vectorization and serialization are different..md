title: "Vectorization and serialization are different."

- There is a difference between [[vectorization]] and [[serialization]].
- Vectoring a word to [[one-hot expression]] is also vectorization, and vectorizing a sentence to [[BoW Expression]] is also vectorization.
- These are vector elements 0/1
- Continuation is to make this a continuous value.
        - [[word distributed representation]]
