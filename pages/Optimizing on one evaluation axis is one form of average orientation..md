title: "Optimizing on one evaluation axis is one form of average orientation."
---

- [[Average orientation is the worst environment]]
- What about schools of higher education?
    - Aiming for the top instead of aiming for average results.
    - Optimizing [[on a single evaluation axis]]" is a form of [[average-orientation]].
        - coherent
- I want to express this well.
    - Convergence to the average in the pattern space of ideas rather than the average of scores
    - peer pressure



[[Optimization on a single evaluation axis]].
- [[one evaluation axis]].
        - [[Axis is one-dimensional]]
    - [[optimization]]
        - [[Premature optimization is the root of all evil.]]
