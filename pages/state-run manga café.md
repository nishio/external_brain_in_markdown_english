> [enders_shadow](https://x.com/enders_shadow/status/1802259918436827312) That's a "state-run comic book cafe" from 15 years ago!
>  The one that disappeared due to fierce opposition from the Democratic Party.

> [pakaracing](https://x.com/pakaracing/status/1801918113560264904) Too late! I know that's a fair comment, but this is the National Media Arts Center that you were trying to establish about 15 years ago, right?
>  The media and public opinion ridiculed the project as an anime hall of fame or a state-run manga cafe, and it was completely destroyed by the DPJ administration, which at the time thought it was a necessary project.

> The "National Media Arts Center" that Mr. Taro Aso had proposed was criticized by Mr. Hatoyama of the Democratic Party of Japan as an "anime hall of fame" and a "state-run manga cafe," but in fact it was designed to pass on to future generations the beauty of the founding works of manga, which are deteriorating due to paper works, using the most advanced digital archiving technology in the world. In fact, it was to preserve for posterity the beauty of the early works of manga, which were deteriorating because of the paper works.

## circa 2009
.
> As deliberations on the supplementary budget, which is worth 15 trillion yen, reach a critical point, the opposition parties are criticizing the breakdown of the budget. Particularly problematic was the "National Media Arts Center (tentative name)," a facility with a budget of 11.7 billion yen.... Hatoyama was asked about the supplementary budget at a plenary session of the House of Representatives on April 28, 2009... For example, the Anime Hall of Fame. I know that the prime minister loves anime, but why is it necessary to spend 11.7 billion yen to build a "giant state-run manga cafe" and to burn down an independent administrative agency?

> Just because you like manga, what, you're building a facility that your buddies who hang out in Akihabara would like?
>  What is this, a state-run manga cafe?
>  What's more, what's the use of 11.7 billion yen of taxpayers' money?
>  Who do you think pays taxes and for what?
