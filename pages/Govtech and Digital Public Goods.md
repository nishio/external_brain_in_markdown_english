title: "Govtech and Digital Public Goods"

> [0xtkgshn](https://x.com/0xtkgshn/status/1817408871608021230) I think the word "[[GovTech]]" is the result of compromise or optimization, [[contracting]] or SaaS for government (internal). I used the word "compromise" here because that is what [[B2B SaaS]] is on [[LGWAN]]. Because of the contamination of this word, the word "[[digital public goods]]" has appeared. (continued)

> [0xtkgshn](https://x.com/0xtkgshn/status/1817408874150052338) Assuming the tainted word, I think Govtech and Digital Public Goods (DPG) are opposites. The former is proprietary and the latter refers to free. The ideal system would have a normal B2B SaaS put in for enforcement in government agencies, and DPG for governance. (continued)

> [0xtkgshn](https://x.com/0xtkgshn/status/1817408875542569410) I think DPG can also be divided into two layers. Infrastructure and applications. The infrastructure will be done by GovTech Tokyo and the Digital Agency, the applications by NPOs, etc., and the platform for support for this will be something like QF.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1818288377084420513) Aside from the appropriate choice of name, I think a resolution here would lead to a useful discussion. Instead of [[open source (software, etc.)]] and [[proprietary]] being divided and hostile, they should cooperate with each other to improve society.
