title: "Seniority and risk aversion"
---

    - [[risk aversion]] Highly inclined people are favored in an environment where the majority of people are rewarded,
- In companies that have a seniority by length of service type personnel system, such people are promoted,
- Suppress distribution and challenge of risky information (= new, uncertain information).
- This undermines the catch-up to new changes.

- Average orientation is advantageous in an environment where the majority of people receive compensation: [[Average orientation is the worst environment]].

    - > It is not because Japan did not have that technology, but because when you try to introduce that technology, some people ask if it is safe, and they are not convinced even if you explain why it is technically safe. Such people have been observed many times, not only in this case but also in radiation and fish markets.
        - The need for [[safety]] and [[peace of mind]] hinders the adoption of technology.
