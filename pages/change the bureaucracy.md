title: "change the bureaucracy"

> [masanork](https://twitter.com/masanork/status/1757062173317304383) After being in government for a little over 10 years, I personally think that things have changed dramatically even in the last few years, but I'm not sure how to convey that live feeling. I am also troubled as to how to convey the live experience of the changes, and when I am asked if the changes are like this, all I can say is, well, it takes time. I guess it would be better to change something with them than to talk about it with them.

[[Dramatic change.]]
    - [[live performance]]
- "[[It's not like]] this for a change."
    - [[take time]]
- It's better to change something with them than to sit around moping.
- [[Why aren't things working?]]
    - [[reads wind]]
    - [[Swell of change]]
    - [[window open]]
    - [[notice when the window opens]]
    - [[the mechanism that holds things together]].
    - [[mental gymnastics]] and [[swinging]].
            - [[instantaneous force]]

It's interesting that the feelings are strongly related but the vocabulary used to express them is quite different.
- [[Social maintenance system is slow.]]
