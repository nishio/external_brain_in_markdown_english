[I got a new job at Google and suddenly got 3 months maternity leave - Software Transactional Memo](https://kumagi.hatenablog.com/entry/ikukyu)
> [@twk](https://twitter.com/twk/status/1098375265468657664): [[childcare leave]] out of the blue is surprising, but at a job interview when changing jobs, the exchange of "I'm expecting a baby a month after joining the company" and "You can take 3 months off if the baby is born. I'll take 3 months off after the baby is born, so please still come.

> [@kumagi](https://twitter.com/kumagi/status/1098447367089475584?s=20&t=oqezXHHddEK3JYP_MmzIFQ): exactly right!
> I said, "I'm about to have a baby, so I think I'll take my new job after I get maternity leave at NTT.
> G "If you don't have a baby after you come to us, you can't use our benefits, so hurry up and come."
> I'm like, "Seriously?"
> I had to move to the new company without having to take off NTT's paid time off because there was an exchange of "I'll take off NTT's paid time off.

> [@cifar10](https://twitter.com/cifar10/status/1574299411034779649): When I see discussions like "We don't want you to take maternity leave right after you join the company", I remember the G Company's "If you don't have a baby after you join the company, our [[welfare programme]] can't be used, so please join us quickly before the baby is born", I get the feeling that only a very fat company can win!
