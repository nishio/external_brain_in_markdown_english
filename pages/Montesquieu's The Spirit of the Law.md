In The Spirit of the Law, Montesquieu argued that [[a system in which power is not concentrated]] is necessary to protect liberty. Specifically, he made the following points

- The principle of [separation of powers.
    - By separating the executive, legislative, and judicial functions, the idea is to prevent the concentration of power in one institution and the resulting tyranny. By having each institution check and balance each other, he explained, civil liberties would be protected.

- Diversity of political institutions.
    - He argued that politics and laws should differ according to a country's climate, culture, and economic conditions. He stated that it is important to design institutions that are tailored to the circumstances of each country, rather than a single universal law.

- The [[British Constitution]] as an example
    - Montesquieu took the British political system as one example, noting that the separation of powers actually works. By doing so, he attempted to provide not only a theoretical but also a practical basis.

These arguments have had a profound impact on the institutional design of the modern state and the development of democracy.
