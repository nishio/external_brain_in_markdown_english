title: "Example of finding information in episodic memory"
---

- I remember "Dr. Masui wrote a program in JavaScript in Scrapbox," and I want to find it.
- But I don't know what keywords to search for on Google.
- I recall an episodic memory: "When I learned about it, you were collecting mathematical wonders."
- I don't know what the title of that page is.
- I recall, "I believe I wrote a story about [[Efron's Dice]] on that page."
- Search for `Efron`. You can find more than one.
    - [[Unexpected Phenomena]] had a link to the page I was looking for [/prog-exercises/generate normal distribution
- Side note: There was a confusion between "Efron's dice" and "Efron's dice", so I tagged them both.
