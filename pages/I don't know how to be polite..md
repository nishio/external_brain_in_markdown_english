title: "I don't know how to be polite."

A. "I didn't know how to be polite when I was 12."
B "Is it because I was born in the Showa era that I think courtesy is something you learn before the age of 12, if not before?"
C (I wonder if he has any idea that he was born in the Showa era and has no idea that there is no courtesy in this statement of his...)
