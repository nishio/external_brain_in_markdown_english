[[Convincing]].

    - Trust in a fair process] makes conclusions acceptable, even if they don't agree with them.
    - This "[[sense of]] consensus" contributes to [[social stability]] as a kind of public good ([[commons]]).

Rather, it is important for all participants to feel that they have made their own decision through the process, even if it is imperfect.

[Information Science and Technology to Support Decision-Making and Consensus Building in Complex Societies｜Strategic Proposals and Reports｜CRDS (CRDS)](https://www.jst.go.jp/crds/report/CRDS-FY2017-SP-03.html)
> In today's world of information science and technology, situations often arise that are difficult for humans to deliberate and deliberate. One of the reasons for this is that the information explosion and the borderless nature of society have created a variety of possibilities for the factors and influences involved in decision-making, and the scope of these possibilities has become too large for the human mind to consider. Moreover, in an intensifying competitive environment, decision-making is increasingly demanding speed, and situations frequently arise in which decisions must be made without fully considering all the possibilities of factors and influences. Another possible cause is that it has become easier to manipulate information to influence others' decisions with malicious or inciting intent.

A viewpoint that sees "conviction" as a social resource, rather than merely a subjective satisfaction.
- As something similar to "[[social credit]]" in economics or "[[legitimacy capital]]" in political science, the accumulation of conviction has public goods properties.
- If those in power despise it, it will eat away at the [[SOC]] of [[citizen cooperation]], and the cost of governing will jump in the long run.
- On the other hand, if a process is followed to gain the public's understanding through careful dialogue and explanation, even painful policies are more likely to be accepted by society.
- In recent years, there have been cases in which governments and administrators simply imposing the opinions of experts on decision making regarding new coronas and large-scale development has resulted in backlash and, in turn, reduced effectiveness. This can be said to be the result of disregarding the commons, which is a sense of conviction.

- Conviction" is a social resource and contributes to social stability
    - If so, isn't it a good thing to create and distribute?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - This argument is "If the leaf is creating a sense of well-being, then isn't distributing leafs to the people an act of increasing the total amount of well-being, and therefore good?" I feel it is relevant to

[[Astroturfing]] ([[Artificial Grassroots Movement]])
- > In a recent report, the think tank Rand Corporation raised concerns about national security based on the extensive use of AI and manipulation of social media by foreign adversaries of the United States, including the armed wing of the Chinese Communist Party.
- >  The Rand report noted, for instance, that AI will use an army of bots—software applications that can perform repetitive tasks—to create the illusion of consensus on an issue, which is called "astroturfing."

    - In a recent report, the RAND Institute, a think tank, raised national security concerns based on the widespread use of AI and manipulation of social media by U.S. adversaries, including the armed wing of the Chinese Communist Party. The RAND report noted, for example, that AI uses armies of bots (software applications that can perform repetitive tasks) to create the illusion of consensus on issues. This is known as "astroturfing."

> Social networking algorithms prioritize information preferred by users, creating an "echo chamber" where each person sees only opinions similar to their own. As a result, a "false consensus effect" is likely to occur, in which people believe that their ideas must be shared by many others.

> The paradoxical situation is that each person holds a different illusory "agreed-upon public opinion," and as a result, society as a whole becomes more divided than it otherwise would be.

It is important to note that AI itself is not a neutral facilitator, but can amplify illusions. AI, including the recently popular large-scale language models (LLMs), generate "plausible" answers from vast amounts of historical data. But it often tends to trace the dominant narrative, [[smoothing out]] diverse perspectives.
