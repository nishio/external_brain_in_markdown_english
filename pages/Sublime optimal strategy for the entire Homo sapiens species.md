title: "Sublime optimal strategy for the entire Homo sapiens species"

> [rkmt](https://twitter.com/rkmt/status/1259451380558790658) Open software and free software is a sublime optimal strategy for the entire homo sapiens species because "[[it is]] a human loss to duplicate and recreate code that someone else has already made." I hope you don't reduce it to a trivialized story like "I'm cracking it.

Gosh.

It is necessary to put it in a server and operate it. Since duplicating this operation is also a loss to humanity, wouldn't the best strategy be to consolidate the operation to a company that performs the operation and pay the maintenance fee as a sub-subscriber?

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1259588381173936128) If the source code is made public, there will be multiple operators and it will be a loss to humanity, so the best strategy is to keep the source code secret, crush it with patents to prevent similar services from being created, and create a [[ monopoly]] by keeping the source code secret and using patents to prevent the creation of similar services, isn't this the optimal strategy? Should we abandon the [[antitrust law]] because it is a loss to humanity?

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1259590164021559296) Even if "monopolistic firms can be inefficient due to lack of competition," there are better methods of human efficiency than banning monopolies because "competition is a human loss." I guess so.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1259590786745643009) For example, a spin-out promotion tax system to promote the distribution of knowledge, or nationalizing the facilities of large inefficient companies and lending them cheaply to start-ups.
