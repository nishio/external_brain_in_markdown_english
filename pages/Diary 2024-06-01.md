I think he is a mere hoax generator for those who cannot discern the truth of what he is saying.
>  >All_is_regicide: Sukientia, the speed of his tweets and the volume of his lies are synergistic, and he has become an outrageous monster who keeps lying at an explosive rate.
> [nappasan](https://x.com/nappasan/status/1796560974541099056) I don't care about people who can't keep up with my level or who take every single thing I say seriously, and I don't care about them as long as I get to the truth. It seems that they have an attitude of disregarding responsibility and ethics, which is interesting to watch from the side, and I think it's fine that there are people like that, but it's not something to be praised.
> [nappasan](https://x.com/nappasan/status/1796564062081597741) With a high sense of trust in his own wisdom and indifference to others, he ignores social communication and outputs everything that ordinary people can think of within themselves. My impression of her is that she is a person who waits for others to respond with "reactions" that are beneficial to her. It seems that he is not interested in others.

I agree with you that "output increases the probability that others will respond in a way that is beneficial to me" and "as a result, I hope I can arrive at the truth.

This concept of "normal" is interesting.
- It's like, "You think that's normal."
    - Let's flip it around.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - A normal person would not keep everything inside what he or she is thinking, but would speak out what he or she feels or what comes to mind without hiding it in the moment.
        - Ordinary people would take it for granted that by daring to put into words what they intuitively feel and share it with others, they would gain empathy and new perspectives.
- The style of criticism on the basis of "normal" reminded me of "[[An ordinary man killing a genius]]" and "I don't understand it, so I'm going to exclude him."

Only correct information should be circulated." v.s. "Anything can be distributed and should be filtered by the recipient."
- I recently talked about [[big government and small government]] on another matter: [[OSS and Small Government]].
- Only correct information should be circulated" is a dangerous statement, because it means that the distribution of information is hindered by the entity that judges "correctness": [[censor]].
- By the way [[Freedom creates disparity due to differences in ability...]], so the freedom to "let everything flow and the receiver should filter" inevitably creates a "disparity that hurts the weak who don't have the ability to filter"!
- The weak, ordinary people say, "Kill the genius," but there's no way you can do that.

[[Thinking patterns of people who don't create new things]].
