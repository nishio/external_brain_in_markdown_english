darkness of the throne
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1807427257427992752) I have experienced the #Darkness of the Throne 6 of 28 Madamis at Yogakuji in Monzennaka-cho. I was in charge of Zhuge Liang Kongming. I played a role of diplomacy with several countries. Someone once said "Yami of the Throne is more of a political game than a Murder Mystery" and that's exactly how I felt. It was the first time for me to experience such a feeling and it was very interesting.
