title: "Overcome antipathy to excellence."

Sympathy for great men exalts us; hatred degrades us. There is nothing more unreliable than to dislike those who are better than you.
We often develop an aversion to things and people we don't know much about. Overcome this.

from [[The Art of Worldly Wisdom]]
Master your animosity.
xlvi Master your animosity.

Often we allow ourselves to develop an aversion to a person before we know anything about him or her. Sometimes this innate yet vulgar dislike attaches itself to a prominent person. For there is nothing more unreliable than to dislike someone better than oneself. Just as our sympathy for great men exalts us, our dislike of them degrades us.
