Criticism of [[certain language fanatics]] by [[Linus]].
> Quite frankly, even if the choice of C were to do nothing but keep the C++ programmers out, that in itself would be a huge reason to use C.
>  ...
>  The fact that we also piss off people who cannot see that is just a big additional advantage.

(DeepL)Frankly, even if choosing C would only shut out C++ programmers, that in itself would be a great reason to use C... The fact that it also offends those who don't understand it is only an even bigger advantage.

- You might want to keep in mind that this was 2007, when C++ was still in all sorts of bad shape.
    - > A major update was enacted in 2011, ISO/IEC 14882:2011, commonly known as "C++11". This version was originally unofficially called "C++0x," a provisional name in anticipation of its enactment and official designation as "C++09" during the 2000s, but this did not happen during the 2000s.
- However, this is not about C++ being bad, but about disrespect for the [[fanatics]] of a particular language who come to a person who has created a product that creates [[customer value]] and say, "This is written in language X, so it's no good, it should be in language Y". Feelings
