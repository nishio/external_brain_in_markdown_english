- [[Exploratory Studies of Knowledge]]  p.86

- Improvement proposal by [[Jiro Kawakita]] of [[brainstorming]].
- [[Blenstorming must record all ideas submitted]], but if the discussion gets too heated, the recording staff will not be able to keep up with the work, and the recording staff will not have time to say their ideas.
So the idea is that during [[gather for discussion]], each of us can create [[dot-notes]].

After that, a "Renka no Kai (the renga association)" is held separately, where the notes are used as the basis for a clean copy, which is then shared with the members.
