title: "LLM as a new computer"
---

People who understand how computers work can use them better.
- Especially so in the beginning, because the user interface is unfriendly.

Gradually, even those who don't understand it can use it.
- Because it is often better (more profitable, data collection, etc.) if many people can use it.

Even if you don't understand it and it's easier to use.
The usefulness of understanding will not disappear.
    - [[law of leaky abstraction]]

This metaphor can be applied to LLMs.
