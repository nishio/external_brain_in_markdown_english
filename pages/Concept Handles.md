title: "Concept Handles"
---

This "[[handle]]" is the image of [[handle]], not the steering wheel of a car.

- The concept is made easier to manipulate by adding the word [[handle]] to the concept.
        - [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]]  p.36  [[(Column) To name the pattern.]]
        - > Name the pattern.
            - > Engelbart saw language as a means for individuals to break down their perceptions of the world into "concepts" for modeling the world. Language is used to map symbols to these "concepts" and to consciously manipulate them. This conscious manipulation of concepts, he believes, is what "thinking" is all about.
    - The Intellectual Production of Engineers p.137 [[(4.5.3.3) Get the tools of your thinking]].
        - > In his Chapter 1 column, "Naming Patterns," Douglas Carl Engelbart cites language as one of the ways "to augment human intelligence. By creating abstract models of external events and naming these models, we can manipulate them in our minds and think about them. This is the enhancement of intelligence through language.

- This word as a "conceptual handle" is to increase the efficiency with which you think, so it does not have to be a word shared with others

    - [[Pointer to object]] # Pointer
- For example, `https://scrapbox.io/nishio/%E6%A6%82%E5%BF%B5%E3%81%AE%E3%83%8F%E3%83%B3%E3%83%89%E3%83%AB` is a pointer to a single object
    - URL:  [[resource locator]]
        - The pointer is [pointing at
    - When we think of [[natural language processing]], we tend to assume [[word]] as the object [[object]], but that is not the case [[representation]].
        - As [[knowledge]], it may [[indicate]] external things that are not included in the [[corpus]].
    - Words can also be interpreted as referring to "its meaning."
    - URL is an expression that quite clearly points to an external object
    - This should be treated as the equivalent of a "word".
    - Bracketing in [[Scrapbox corpus]] `[target page]`.
    - This is an expression that points to another page
    - The page title and its content may be strongly related, but they are separate
        - see  [[Distributed representation of books]]
