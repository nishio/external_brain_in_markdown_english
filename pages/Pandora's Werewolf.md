> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1881396455120007510) I experienced "**Pandora's Werewolf**" with GM [[Rin Sato]] ([[jankichi]]), who won the CEDEC AWARDS for "[[Reminiscences of Randolph Lawrence]]". Pandora's Werewolf]" with Mr. [[Rin Sato]] ([[Jankichi]]), who won the CEDEC AWARDS with [[Randolph Lawrence]]. It was very interesting and I recommend it. Pandora's Werewolf is different from normal [[werewolf]] games in that the probability distribution of the positions is not public information, so there are no set rules and the game has a [[Madamis (Japanese brand of haloperidol)]] nature.

It was so much fun.
