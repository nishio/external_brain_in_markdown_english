> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/904049328871751681) Insider game, by far more interesting than werewolf, one game is over in 10 minutes, and people who get hacked early in the game don't feel lonely like werewolves do!

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/904127307375194113) Rules explanation: pick GM and insider, pick a word, only GM and insider know it, not even GM knows who the insider is, no one but GM, good for GM Ask a question that can be answered with a "yes" and find the correct answer within 5 minutes, then free talk for 5 minutes to figure out who the insider is, then vote to hang.

A double mind manipulation game. The word guessing part is also more interesting than playing by itself (because people give hints so that you don't know).

> [uchan_nos](https://x.com/uchan_nos/status/904130459042332672) I see. You can still do it. I guess the method of multiple subjects on a card is a device to reduce the number of cards. After that, I think you will notice that there are some points where the rules of that game are not good if you play it over. If you refine that a little more, it would be a really good game.
