title: "System is a knowledge network that can be raised or lowered in abstraction."

from [/unnamedcamp/system is a knowledge network that can be raised or lowered in abstraction](https://scrapbox.io/unnamedcamp/system is a knowledge network that can be raised or lowered in abstraction).
- [[system]] = [[knowledge network]] with [[integrity]]
- [[What constitutes systematic?]]

- Mere arrangement of fragmented knowledge is not [[systematic]].
- A link between them brings us closer to the system.
    - Linkage is a necessary but not sufficient condition.
        - For example, how about a daily diary linked to the previous day, the next day, and N years ago?
    - The links here are not limited to digital, but [[Associative links]] in the brain.
        - Associative links come together to form [Associative Networks
- Can follow a link [[Can go up or down in abstraction.]] and move fast in the network
        - Principle of [[skip list]] (metaphor not conveyed)
    - When you see a concrete example, you can immediately associate it with "Oh, this is that pattern," and this is the link of association that raises the level of abstraction
    - [[Fast movement within the knowledge network]] reduces the time it takes to search for knowledge.
- The shorter time it takes to search improves the time to find useful knowledge for a given external situation and the probability of success.
- People around you describe this phenomenon as "smart," "idea man," "good at verbalization," etc.
    - And when I say that it's the result of learning, not innate, I'm talking about what's the difference compared to someone who has learned but can't do it.
    - That's where I say, "Because I learned it systematically."
