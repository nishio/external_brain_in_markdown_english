title: "Empirical"
---

In Japanese, the word empirical corresponds to [[実証的]](JISSHOU-TEKI) and [[経験的]](KEIKEN-TEKI), those have different nuance.

'JISSHOU-TEKI' refers to a more [[objective]], [[data-driven]] approach, while 'KEIKEN-TEKI' denotes a more [[subjective]] approach based on [[personal experience]]. Although these two often overlap, there is a nuanced difference between them.
