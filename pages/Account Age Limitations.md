- > Age requirements for Google Accounts
- >  Your child must meet the minimum age requirements below to own a Google Account. However, in countries where Family Link is available, parents may help their children create and manage their own accounts.
- In Japan, the requirement for account ownership is 13 years of age or older, but since the country is eligible for Family Link, parents can create their own accounts.
