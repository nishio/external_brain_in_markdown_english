[[Spatial Chat]]
First, people rushed to listen to a live recorder performance, then a group was formed to play werewolf, but since voices leak out in SpatialChat, dead people had to go far away, and meanwhile the group that was competing next door expanded its power (personal opinion).
Afterwards, there was a lot of excitement about solving problems in a weird programming language, and creators and mentors who were new to AtCoder started solving past problems in public!
