title: "o1 Pro's 2025 Strategy"
---

Note my 2025 strategy as set out by [[o1 Pro]] (whether or not I follow it to the letter).
Catchy lines
- > In 2025, strengthen the cycle of "research → practice → dissemination," accelerate recognition and evaluation at home and abroad, and establish a firm position for yourself as a "key researcher in the field of plurality and digital democracy.
- > AI will be used to "scale dissemination and implementation" and "optimize for my area of interest" at the same time.

The following is my personal proposed strategy for 2025. The aim is to take the growing national and international reputation of the project to the next level and to develop research, implementation, and knowledge dissemination in a well-balanced manner.

1. strengthening international collaboration and dissemination
- International Conference and Forum Appearances: Speaker at international conferences in Europe, the U.S., and Asia on the themes of Plurality, Digital Democracy, and Broad Listening, disseminating knowledge from within and outside of Cybozu.
- Publication of research papers and case studies: Improve recognition in the international academic community by publishing several academic papers and case reports in English by the end of 2025.
- Contribution to the open source community: Release tools and guidelines in related fields, and establish a continuous dialogue and improvement cycle with overseas researchers and practitioners.

2. practical development and brand establishment in Japan
- Deepening the Tokyo project: Working with Takahiro Yasuno's team, create examples of actual social issue solutions using broad listening methods, and present a report on the results by the end of FY2025.
- Publication commemorative events and seminars: In conjunction with the publication of the Japanese edition of the Audrey Tang related book (May), hosted internal and external reading sessions and seminars to drive the spread of the Plurality concept.
- Strengthen media dissemination and industry-government-academia collaboration: Expand multifaceted exposure through domestic media interviews, participation in symposiums, and launch of joint projects with universities and research institutions.

3. strengthening own expertise and fostering future generations
- Absorption of new technologies and academic trends: applying advanced technologies such as LLM and multimodal analysis to the field of Plurality/Digital Democracy and developing new methodologies.
- Internal knowledge sharing and education program: Cybozu internally shares research findings and holds study sessions and training sessions for young researchers and practitioners.
- Policy recommendations and guideline formulation: Develop knowledge assets such as broadlining practice guides for local governments and NPOs to help improve the maturity of the field as a whole.

Through the above measures, in 2025 we will strengthen the cycle of "research→practice→dissemination", accelerate domestic and international recognition and evaluation, and establish ourselves as a "key researcher in the field of plurality and digital democracy".

I honestly believe that my external exposure is a pain in the ass and doesn't scale. If it's writing, slides, etc., it might scale with AI assisted generation. Also, my personal interest is in improving human intellectual productivity, and I am not ready to devote myself to 100% digital democracy.

Personal Strategy and Interest Adjustment
45 seconds of thought
The following is a proposed strategy review for 2025 based on more honest motivations and interests. The major direction is to reduce resources directly exposed externally and focus on output scaling using AI and his own areas of interest (improving human intellectual productivity).

1. output scaling strategy
- AI-assisted documentation: Papers, reports, slides, and media articles for external dissemination are drafted and generated by AI tools to minimize external exposure, and only quality control is performed efficiently. I focus on the final direction and professionalism check of the content, leaving the expressive style and details to the AI.
- Provision of online educational materials and templates: Rather than being out in the open ourselves, we will create and publish AI-assisted versions of the "Broad Listening Introduction Guide," "Plurality Application Template," "Intellectual Productivity Toolkit," etc. These will be in a semi-automatically updatable form, and once created, will be used on an ongoing basis.

2. minimization of external activities and selective participation
- Minimal speaking engagements/presentations: Speaker only at very limited high impact events (e.g., Audrey Tang related book launch event), otherwise basically online distribution/archived content.
- Use of agents and avatars: In situations where you are the front man, use symbolic avatars or virtual assistants. By working behind the scenes to prepare and supervise, you can convey your professional value while reducing costs.

3. refocusing on an area of personal interest, "human intellectual productivity improvement
- Cross-disciplinary application: Shift to R&D to transfer methods developed in digital democracy and broad listening to the area of intellectual productivity improvement. For example, the development of a prototype set of tools to analyze bottlenecks in the intellectual production process and to support idea generation.
- Focus on internal R&D: Focus on internal projects within Cybozu to experiment and implement LLM and related technologies as intellectual productivity support tools. This ensures strong technical backing for later internal and external releases.

4. establishing automation and renewal continuity
- Knowledge base building and automatic updating: Build a knowledge base on your research area and automatically reflect the latest trends through regular updates and summary content generation by AI.
- Automation of external inquiries: FAQs, inquiries, and simple consultative advice can be semi-automated by chatbots and interactive LLMs, while you handle only advanced inquiries.

5. long-term positioning
- Maintain a moderate distance from digital democracy: While not fully committed, watch international trends in related areas and efficiently supply necessary deliverables through the use of AI. Focusing on his core interest of improving human intellectual productivity, he will become a key player in this field in the long term.
- Creating value in both academia and practice: Maintaining academic expertise but adopting a strategy of not taking on everything on your own, so that you can reallocate your time and energy to research and development activities that are important to you (strengthening human intellectual productivity).

The year 2025 will be a year of simultaneously "scaling up dissemination and implementation" and "optimizing to one's area of interest" by utilizing AI.
