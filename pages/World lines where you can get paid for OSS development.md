World lines where you can get paid for OSS development
- > [@0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1646389564502872064?s=20): and assuming automatic execution, just by putting npm on-chain now, the "library developers can get paid for OSS development The "can get paid for OSS development" world line can be achieved.
    - relevance
        - > [@_ywzx](https://twitter.com/_ywzx/status/1641063406978433027?s=20): is there a mechanism to trastress github commits and token submissions?
        - > [@0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1641155687366692864?s=20): @_ywzx I guess I'll have to make a full-on chain Github, but a similar idea is the full-on chain npm tea. Also OpenFare, or Stargaze which I saw at a hackathon. Please explore the rest!
            - [[tea.xyz]]
            - [/tkgshn/OpenFare](https://scrapbox.io/tkgshn/OpenFare)
            - [/tkgshn/Stargaze](https://scrapbox.io/tkgshn/Stargaze)
        - > [@_ywzx](https://twitter.com/_ywzx/status/1641810902315048963?s=20): @0xtkgshn I saw that! Thank you.
        - > OpenFare :Since you are looking at the receiving end, it would be good to combine it with TEA.
        - > StargazeIt's nice because only this one line is complete!

            - `cast send $STARGAZER_CONTRACT "updateUnits(string,address,uint128)" "stargazer" $contributor $additions --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --rpc-url $OPTIMISM_RPC;`
        - > I'd like to know the definition of payment and whether it has changed or not, so github management is sufficient!
