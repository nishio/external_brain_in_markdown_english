opening
Mr. Ken Suzuki, Chairman of the Board of SmartNews Company and Specially Appointed Researcher at the University of Tokyo, and Mr. Shunsuke Takagi, Researcher at SmartNews Media Research Institute, Founder of Plurality Tokyo, gave opening remarks. They expressed their gratitude for hosting the conference and emphasized their goal to make the word "plurality" known to as many people as possible in Japan, and to put it into practice.

Session 1: Intersection of Plurality and Academic Knowledge
The speakers in this session included Shigenori Uno (Professor, Institute of Social Science, University of Tokyo; researcher in political thought), Keigo Komamura (Professor, Faculty of Law, Keio University; constitutional law scholar), Yosuke Yasuda (Professor, Osaka University; economist), and Glenn Weyl and Audrey Tang, authors of the book "Plurality". An approach to plurality was attempted from a very academic context.
•
Shigenori Uno: Noting that as a scholar of political thought and philosophy, he has long been interested in and studied Tokuvil, John Dewey, and Hannah Arendt, he expressed his surprise and delight that the plurarities dealt with all three thinkers and gave them important roles. Uno argued that democracy is never about achieving one popular will, but should be a society that allows for diverse experimentation. He mentioned fandom as a form of association in our time, and said that fandom, which is often exclusive, should be created with openness. He also defined politics as the art of plurality and the art of cooperation among mutually different and equal people, and called for its restoration. Finally, he asked Audrey Tang and Glenn Weyl why they chose these three individuals.

Keigo Komamura: As a constitutional scholar, referring to his work "Doubting the Sovereign," he stated that constitutional law has a fundamental role in doubting and overriding democracy. He pointed out that the current political system is "wacky" and that there are obvious conflicts of interest in representative government. He expressed hope that simple democracy tends to become unconstrained populism and that Deliberative Democracy (Deliberative Democracy) and Democratic Experimentalism (Democratic Experimentalism) will become the driving force. In Japan today, lawsuits, rather than politics, have become an effective platform for social change. The presentation posed the following questions.
•
Yosuke Yasuda: As an economist, Mr. Yasuda mentioned his experience of receiving his Ph.D. from Princeton University at the same time as Glenn Weyl. He himself specializes in game theory, mechanism design, and social choice theory, and mentioned that he translated Glenn Weyl's book** "Radical Markets" and provided commentary. He stated that he came across Radical Markets while feeling troubled by the current capitalist system but feeling that existing alternatives were insufficient. Noting that economics has not adequately addressed market failures and economic disparities, he mentioned the keyword "Alone" proposed by Glenn Weyl and said that he recognized the challenge of economics' overemphasis on personal rationality and decision-making. He introduced the idea of economics contributing to plurality through a mechanism (e.g., the TTC algorithm) and a collective decision-making mechanism that does not rely on the number of votes (boat count). In particular, he praised the Majority Judgment mechanism for its superiority in revealing the distribution of ratings for each candidate and its potential to make collective decision-making visible.

Throughout the session, the potential of the concept of plurality to provide new perspectives and solutions to the challenges facing existing disciplines (political thought, constitutional law, economics) was discussed.

Session 2: New Forms of Consensus Using Collective Intelligence
The speakers in this session were Mr. Tonfi, an attorney and president of Mielka, a non-profit organization, and Mr. Yasukazu Nishio, who is deeply involved in activities to promote plurarities.

Mr. Tonfi: He introduced JPAN Choice, a service he developed and operates. He emphasized the importance of design in particular, and stated that the service aims for inclusive participation, including those with limited access to information. He explained that JPAN Choice aims to improve these three issues in democracy: information input (disinformation problem), information digestion process (moving away from intuitive and reflexive decision making by the system1), and reflection of collective will (forms other than elections and representation). Choice offers a variety of features, including boat-matching**, gamification with quizzes, policy comparisons (80+ topics), tracking of key KPIs, and guides on how to vote, and reported that over 1 million people, primarily teens to early 40s, are using it. He introduced the **"poll map" he and Nishio developed for last year's election using open source software called Polis**, explaining how this can visualize not just simple approval or disapproval, but also diverse clusters of opinion, divisions**, commonalities, and more.

Mr. Yasukazu Nishio: In order to spread the concept of plurality in Japan, he said he has been working on creating automatic translation lines for books and promoting broad listening tools such as Polis and Talk to the City. Together with Mr. Tonfi, he participated in the development of the public opinion map. During the discussion, he argued that a clear distinction needs to be made between collective decision-making (deciding something by voting) and gathering everyone's opinions to better understand the world (gathering information for decision-makers). Polis and the Public Opinion Map are the latter, he explained, and are "glasses" or observation systems that allow humans to better understand the world and the opinions of others, not for AI to automatically make decisions.
Through the introduction of specific tools such as Polis and the Public Opinion Map, this session demonstrated how technology can help visualize diverse opinions and deepen people's understanding, thereby supporting higher quality collective knowledge formation and decision-making.
Session 3: Fighting Disinformation, What Civil Society Can Do
In this session, the Japan Fact Check Center took the stage to discuss how to tackle the issue of disinformation, and in particular what the Civil Society can do to help.

The strengthening of international cooperation was emphasized. He reported that even under difficult circumstances such as the Trump Factor, cooperation among fact-checking organizations has rather been strengthened, and that there are about 180 certified fact-checking organizations worldwide called IFCN (International Fact-Checking Network), which are actively exchanging information. He stated that there is a movement to establish a regional association in the Asian region as well.
•
He noted that cooperation with Taiwan is particularly strong, with the Japan Fact-Check Center exchanging information and conducting joint fact-checking with the Taiwan Fact-Check Center on a daily basis. He mentioned that fact-checking education for young people in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, and Indonesia is also being conducted jointly. He noted that a joint seminar with Taiwanese Daset researchers is also planned, and expressed hope that the seminar will be held at a great venue like the Keio University X-Design Center. He mentioned that Taiwanese Minister Lo-Ping Cheng also emphasized the importance of international cooperation.
•
He strongly argued that Japan has the experience of enjoying a stable democracy for a long period of time in Asia and, as its responsibility, should become the Asian hub in the fight against disinformation.
The session underscored the message that international collaboration, especially within the Asian region, is essential for the Civil Society to combat disinformation, and that Japan should play a central role in this effort.

Session 4: Democratic Funding Allocation QF/QV Discussion and Practice
The timetable listed the session names, but there was little transcription of the specific discussions related to this session in the sources provided. Throughout the conference, there were comments that all sessions were closely related and there was a sense that the content of the book was being recovered in various places, a general reference to the challenge for civic organizations to secure stable funding, and a reference to the Retrospective Funding concept that funding should be provided later for successful ones. There were some references to the concept of Retrospective Funding, whereby successful projects should be funded later, but the details of the session itself could not be confirmed by the source.

Session 5: Will AI Evolve Democracy?
This session discussed how AI can contribute to the democratic process. The name of the session was listed on the timetable.
In the discussion, it was introduced that research and experiments are being conducted on "well-informed" discussions using AI agents and externalization of inner dialogues (conversations that take place in the head) by LLM agents that play diverse selves. and how to maintain alignment in reward design, and the importance of openness as a solution to this problem.
He also mentioned that experiments have suggested that LLMs may increase emotional expression and recognition of inner voice in self-reflection, such as journaling. The possibility of alternating writing experiments, in which a human begins writing and the LLM continues, or a human writes where the LLM stopped writing, was also mentioned.
The role of the moderator was also discussed, and the viewpoint that actively presenting opinions, in addition to asking good questions, may help stimulate discussion and facilitate communication.
Furthermore, it was emphasized that the design of voice (voice) as well as text could have a significant impact on the willingness to participate in discussions and the quality of communication. He mentioned the influence of character voices such as Zundamon on discussions and the importance of optimizing voices suitable for voice interaction.
The Principal AI initiative was introduced as an approach that continues the good points of Talk to the City, but increases its practicality in actual policy-making and public comment aggregation.
In this session (and related chats), the potential for AI to evolve democracy as a tool for human understanding, a system to pick up and visualize diverse voices and opinions, and an agent to energize the debate process was discussed from multiple perspectives. In particular, the role of AI in supporting human judgment and understanding, rather than automatic decision-making by AI, and the importance of elements such as design and voice for this purpose were suggested.
closing
Ken Suzuki and Shunsuke Takagi expressed their appreciation for the success of the conference, its participants, and all those involved. The organizers, a total of 33 volunteer staff, the venue (Keio University X-Design Center, the important room where the Board of Trustees meeting to choose the President of Keio University is held), SmartNews collaborators (Se-san, Yusuke-san, Hirahara-san, etc.), the Tokyo community, interpreters, distribution companies, the person who served as the general moderator on short notice, etc, He expressed his gratitude for the many collaborations that made the event possible.
He expressed his determination not to let Plurality end with this event, but to further root it in Japan and connect it to practice. He emphasized the importance of purchasing books and spreading the content (archived Japanese and English versions) through social networking sites to achieve this goal.
He also introduced Tokyo Plurality Week, a series of events scheduled for tomorrow and beyond, even after the conference. Specifically, he mentioned a publishing event at the Reading Monkey Bookstore the following day (hosted by Scipose, fully booked but to be live-streamed), and a closed conference at the University of Tokyo on May 12 (with invitation slots available).
Regarding the future promotion structure of Plurality, there was mention of issues such as taking over from Anno (Audrey Tang?) and who will take over the leadership, and the hope that someone from the community will be found who can provide leadership.
Overall, the conference was a great success, and was shown to be an important step forward in promoting the concept of plurality and collaboration among diverse people in Japan.
Due to the nature of the source, not all session discussions are recorded in detail, especially sessions 4 and 5, which contain a lot of fragmentary information and related banter.

The audio file you provided appears to be a chronological record of a conversation that seems to be between the symposium "AI Evolution and Digital Democracy" and the reception that followed. The following is a chronological record of the content of the conversation.
Before the start of the symposium - beginning of the symposium
•
The symposium appeared to be held at the Keio University venue (East Wing Hall). Participants were guided to the venue and moved by elevator.
•
Prior to the start of the session, the speakers were asked to confirm the preparation of their presentation materials (slides) and their responses to the translators.
•
The symposium timetable was introduced. The opening was followed by sessions on "The Intersection of Plurality and Academia," "New Forms of Consensus Building Using Collective Intelligence," "Fighting Disinformation," "Democratic Funding Allocation QFQV," "Will AI Evolve Democracy," and finally the closing was scheduled.
•
Opening remarks were made by Ken Suzuki of Smart News Corporation and Plurality Tokyo funder Shunsuke Takagi.
•
It was announced that this event was to celebrate the publication of the Japanese edition of **"Plurality: How to Transcend Fragmentation and Refine Collective Intelligence. It was emphasized that the book is released under a CC0 license and that the Japanese edition was published with significant contributions from the community.
•
Panelists introduced were Professors Ken Suzuki and Shigekane Uno of the University of Tokyo, Keigo Komamura and Yosuke Yasuda of Keio University, and the authors of this book, Glenn Weil and Audrey Tan.
•
The opening speeches spoke of the potential of digital technology as a basis for cooperation and innovation, and of the vision that the power of digital can improve the trade-off between "depth of deliberation" and "number of participants".
•
Mr. Shigekane Uno argued three points: that a society that allows diverse experimentation is a democracy, that fandom is the association of our time, and that politics is the art of plurality. He also asked about the book's references to John Dewey, Alexis de Tocqueville, and Taneomi Soejima.
•
Responses from Audrey Tan and Glenn Weil noted that John Dewey played a very important role in Taiwan's history and that a country the size of Japan is expected to play an important role in spreading initiatives such as Plurality around the world.
•
Mr. Yosuke Yasuda spoke about his work on designing new social systems from the perspective of economics, and introduced his encounter with Mr. Glenn Weil during his time at Princeton University, along with photos from that time.

Middle to end of symposium session
•
The session introduced a visualization tool called Map of Public Opinion. It is based on a tool called Polis, which visualizes diverse opinions on a topic such as sales tax cuts as clusters and helps to understand divisions and points of agreement, it was explained.
•
The cultural tendency in Japan to avoid explicitly expressing strong opinions and how this might affect mechanisms such as quadratic baiting were discussed.
•
Research was shared that quadratic funding has limitations when dealing with large numbers of items (100 is possible, but 1000 or 100,000 is difficult).
•
During the Q&A session, in response to the question "Do individual opinions need to be based on correct understanding?", it was emphasized that collective decision-making itself should be separated from data collection to gather diverse opinions and better understand the world and the perspectives of others. polis and maps of public opinion serve the latter Polis and maps of public opinion serve the latter purpose, i.e., as "glasses "** to help decision makers make better decisions.
•
The importance of data access from platform companies was discussed. It was argued that data is essential for civic action and research to experiment and analyze in the digital space, and that it is necessary for platforms to provide data access to researchers and civil society through legislation such as the EU's Digital Marketplace Act (DMA).X (formerly Twitter) has made its API The fact that they are charging a fee and making it more expensive was raised as an issue.
•
The current situation and countermeasures against the generation of false information by AI were discussed, and the fact that AI can now generate realistic false information (fake news, images, and audio), making it difficult to determine the authenticity of information sources, was cited as a challenge. The results of an experiment showed that warnings displayed during video viewing effectively reduced the intent to share fake information.
•
As a countermeasure against disinformation, it was suggested that mechanisms (KYC, signature plans, etc.) be introduced to prove that the statements were made by a human being while maintaining anonymity.
•
It was recognized that Japan's countermeasures against disinformation are lagging behind the rest of the world (about 8 years behind), but it was introduced that international cooperation such as the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) and Taiwan is being strengthened. The opinion was also expressed that Japan should become a hub for countermeasures against disinformation in Asia.
•
After a break, the session continued.
•
The application of quadratic funding to participatory budgeting, a system for visualizing community contributions (assigning roles), and funding digital disaster response teams were introduced.
•
He emphasized the idea that democratic systems are not fixed, but should be constantly experimented with and continuously improved as technology advances. He stated that social systems, like software development, need to have an ongoing cycle of product development, implementation, testing, and improvement.
•
The Digital Democracy 2030 project was introduced. He talked about how this is an open source project, that participants are being recruited via Slack, and that they are developing a virtual deliberation system (a system that allows 120 million people to deliberate through dialogue with an AI) and an information disclosure system aimed at real-time disclosure of political fund balance reports.
Reception/conversation after the symposium
•
Participants exchanged their thoughts and additional discussion about each session and specific speakers at the symposium.
•
Regarding the Principal AI, he explained that it is an improved version of Polis, with enhanced opinion drilling and cluster extraction for policy makers.
•
The audience was reminded that the high cost of the X API is a major issue in the implementation of broad listening. X API is a major challenge in the implementation of broad listening.
•
He spoke about the current state of the pluraritaly community in Japan. There were specific references to the sharing of information in the scrap box and the involvement of various parties (e.g., Mr. Hamada, Ms. Kay, Mr. Nou, Mr. Ito, Mr. Nishio, etc.).
•
Difficult issues regarding the nature of community leadership were shared. They spoke of the limitations of allowing certain people to continue to take the initiative and the challenge of how to discover and transition to natural leadership.
•
He mentioned the difficulty of fundraising for community activities and NPO operations.
•
With regard to the future of AI and democracy, he talked about research being conducted on the simulation of dialogue between individuals' inner selves (diverse selves) using AI agents and the possibility of AI agents that would want to dialogue.
•
The possibility that AI politicians/AI agents could more easily make decisions and be more accountable based on model specifications than human politicians was discussed. However, it was noted that designing incentives and ensuring openness were important; it was suggested that the role of politicians may change as AI begins to assist in deep research.
•
Ideas for experimental voting systems that differ from the current "one person, one vote" system, such as voting proportional to income tax, age, and assets, were discussed.
•
There were also more abstract and philosophical discussions about the future of technological evolution and the role of humans: the possibility of AI and robots surpassing many human activities, the accompanying questioning of human labor and value, the potential of AI robots as companion animals, and various perspectives on the speed of technological development, safety, and anti-technology (e.g., suicide attacks on AI) competition. The discussion covered a variety of perspectives, including the speed of technological development, safety, and the competition of anti-technology (e.g., self-destruct attacks against AI).
•
Surprises about the rate of development of the latest AI technologies, including OpenAI, and concerns about their impact were expressed.
•
Information was provided on how to participate in the Slack workspace for the Digital Democracy 2030 project.
•
Expectations were expressed regarding future possibilities (e.g., input/output in markdown format) for linking scrapboxes and LLMs (large-scale language models).
•
Conversations and personal stories about the move after the reception were included.
Throughout the symposium and subsequent conversations, themes such as democracy as a plurality experiment reappeared.
