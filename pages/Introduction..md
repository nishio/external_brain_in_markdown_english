Welcome to Scrapbox. You can freely edit and utilize this page.

**Invite members to this project**
- You can get a link to invite others from Menu -> Members.
- Scrapbox allows multiple people to collaboratively edit the same page in real time.

**Try Basic Usage**
- Paragraphs can be created with tabs or spaces at the beginning of lines.
- Enclose `[[ ]]` to make it **bold**.
- Enclose `[ ]` to create a [[link]] to [[another page]].
- Any text after the `#` becomes a #hashtag. It works the same as a link.

    - Type `Ctrl+I` or write `[myusername.icon]` to embed the icon.
