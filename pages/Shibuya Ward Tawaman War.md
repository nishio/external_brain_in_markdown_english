Transaction details
- Shimizu and Tokyu to rebuild Jinnan Elementary School next to Shibuya Homes
- Shibuya Ward will provide the elementary school's floor area ratio and 610 m2 of land for the adjacent ward road.
- As a result, it became possible to build a new condominium 150 meters high on the site of the former Shibuya Homes
    - Until then, the plan was for 110 meters.
- This is the first attempt to exchange public property for private property without bidding in the name of urban planning" (Mr. Hideharu Moriguchi, real estate appraiser).

Stakeholder Opinion
- Park Court Shibuya The Tower
    - Height: approximately 143 meters
    - Concerned about loss of views and property values
    - Park Court is built on land owned by Shibuya Ward, and the residents believe they should fulfill their responsibilities as landowners.

Note: I thought this was an interesting case study of the fluctuation in the value of [[real estate]] in the context of [[Partial Common Ownership]].
