If you can notice and correct distortions, you have good drawing ability.

>  "Painting ability" is a fluffy, vague term.
>  I don't like it much,
>  [[powers of observation]] on the subject, or
>  Besides the ability to dexterously draw it.
>  I hear that you are sensitive to [[uncomfortable feeling]] in your drawings.
>  Something like [[noticing something missing]].
>  I think that kind of [[good]] intuition is also included.
>  People with this ability grow fast.

Those who repeatedly draw and erase to reduce the number of incorrect answers are usually this type. It is also a great talent, but it is hard in a world where you are competing against time, so everyone aims to be a "person who knows the correct answer. >RP
