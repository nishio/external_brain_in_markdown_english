title: "Impress Zombies and Cats"

> [stdaux](https://x.com/stdaux/status/1792721057490563539) [[impresario zombie]] posted a combination of "words from [[trend]]" and "images of [[cat]]" in an attempt to get human attention. I'm afraid to see the hack that this is what happens. When human predators spread pseudo-bait, they're going to use cat images.
