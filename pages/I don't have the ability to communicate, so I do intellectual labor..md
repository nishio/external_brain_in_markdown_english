Theory of intellectual labor due to lack of communication skills.
> [@cicada3301_kig](https://twitter.com/cicada3301_kig/status/1653431974927941632): It is important to understand that people doing [[manual or physical labor]] are doing physical labor because they lack [intelligence I think it's important to understand that people who do [[manual or physical labor]] are doing it because they don't have [[intelligence]], not because they have [[strength of an organization (e.g. profitability, productivity, economic clout, stability, growth potential)]]. I think it's important to understand that
> [@cicada3301_kig](https://twitter.com/cicada3301_kig/status/1653432061418704896?s=20): it's a [[comparative advantage]] in economics

(e.g., "people who do intellectual labour do it because they are good at it")
