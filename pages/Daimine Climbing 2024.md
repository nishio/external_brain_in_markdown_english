> Please check the PDF and bring it with you when you visit the shrine.
- So should I print this?

> Meet 7/6 at 6:30 a.m.
Oops, it's much earlier than I thought. I need to stay the night before.

Since there doesn't seem to be a particular list of things to bring
[https://oomine.gozaru.jp/](https://oomine.gozaru.jp/)
> ◆Slip-resistant footwear.
>  Bring your own rain gear.
>  ◆Bring a flashlight.
>  ◆New guests bring sarashi (8 feet).
>  (Used at Mt. Omine and Mt.)
>  ◆Please print out the following (PDF) and bring it with you when you visit the shrine.

>  ◆Magic (thin) - For gomagi/fuda applications.
>  ◆Precedents must wear white coats, hakama, or other mountaineering attire.
Let's call this a list.
I think I wore white clothes when I participated before as a child, but looking at the pictures, the participants who are not [[predecessors]] seem to be wearing normal clothes, especially not mountaineering clothes
- Short-sleeved T-shirt-like
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/6fd1485cab1bda0079754e0bf58ad63d/thumb/1000)
- Also, I can't carry your luggage.
- Or you can go without outerwear and just wear underwear and a long-sleeved shirt and roll up your sleeves.
- I bought the sarashi (8 feet) from Amazon because I'm not sure about it.

# 2024-07-04
- I cut the sarashi to 8 feet.
- Rain gear (parasol) ✅ Flashlight ✅ Printing ✅
- non-slip footwear
    - Put your climbing shoes in your bag.
    - Vibram on the way back
- I hope I don't need a bath towel.

- Change underwear in case of rain
- magic


# 2024-07-05
- I was able to get a hotel 4 minutes from Tennoji station.
    - Should have been done earlier as they tended to fill up.
- Shinkansen is empty.
    - It's a weekday evening move.
    - I have to be quick because if I'm accidentally late, people will come and travel after work and it will get crowded.
- The videoconference scheduled for this evening has been rescheduled.
    - The question of whether or not to bring a PC is gone, I won't.

- Document seal ✅

The breakup will be around 5:00 p.m. at Tennoji, so we'll take the bullet train directly home from there.

I packed just the clothes for the trip home in a separate bag.

Quick charger, mobile battery, iPhone

My wife and I read the description, and I think this needs a knapsack. She pointed out that
- The question of when to use a bleach
- I thought the mountains were so harsh that I would go empty handed, but the interpretation is that you leave your stuff halfway up the mountain and then you go empty handed from there.
- If this is the case, you cannot carry a sara-sara in your hand or put it in a tote bag for walking around town, so you need a knapsack.

Difficult to detect because the shapes are too different

## 13:50
Buy marker/knapsack at Muji done
Heading to Tokyo Station

## 14:45
Bought a boxed lunch at Tokyo Station.

Next, I'll get a ticket for the Shinkansen.

    - Ah, there's a trap like that, but this time I didn't think anything of it and came in with a card, so it's safe.
- I got 1,500 rounds.
- There was some option I didn't know about, so I put it on.
    - We decided that even if they charge extra, it won't be such an eye-popping amount.
    - In fact, it looks like the amount of money is the same if you simply add this to your plan, since you now have the option of a plan with or without additional charges.
- S work
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/b2844fa998ac16ec7ad536feac40a3d9/thumb/1000)

    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/9d1622881e01f503b16753cedcc8cb44/thumb/1000)
        - I see.
        - There's another wifi flying around that says "for Biz".
        - I saw a seat for additional charges.
            - ![image](https://gyazo.com/e0d1083e9081f10a07b23d485f0d5d1e/thumb/1000)

    - Participation in a videoconference is allowed as a rule of seating.
        - However, I didn't bring my PC or headset this time.
            - The headset isn't heavy, so you could have brought it with you: ......
        - I have a videoconference scheduled for 4pm (paid time off so I don't have to attend), but as far as joining a confidential outside company meeting from here... I don't think so.
            - It's possible to just ask.
            - It's possible to listen and respond with a keyboard.
            - If you're going to talk, don't you need mutalk?
    - Uploading images to Scrapbox on both Wifi and 5G doesn't work at all.
        - Can you do video conferencing with this?
        - I can hear about two people clattering on the keyboard.
        - It's a pain to look at Twitter and wait for images to load, so let's do a digital detox!


Scheduled to arrive at 17:30
- Preview the meeting place, then buy dinner and go to the hotel.
- However, I'm not sure if they'll have lunch at 3:00 p.m. and then have dinner.
- Maybe some Wider In Jelly.
- Buy a sleep aid and a caffeine-free drink.
    - I'd rather have a portable breakfast if we're meeting at 6:30.
    - I had brought the base bread.
    - Is a drink and a Widerin Jelly enough?

## 17:30 Shin-Osaka arrival
Possibility of not getting a reserved seat for the return trip
- Since it's a Sunday flight to Tokyo, it clashes with the return of Tokyo residents who went sightseeing in the Kansai region.
- Got a reserved seat for 19:00 departure -> Tokyo Station 2127
    - Late because you don't want the bus to be late.
- I realized I probably should have bought it from a physical ticket machine and then taken it on Eki-net so I could change it online.

- I brought a folding umbrella, but when it rains in the mountains, I don't let it umbrella me.

- [[Mt. Utaki]]
- > Ontakesan is a 3,067-meter-high composite stratovolcano located at the western end of the East Japan Volcanic Belt, straddling Kiso-machi and Otaki-mura in Kiso-gun, Nagano Prefecture, and Gero and Takayama in Gifu Prefecture. It is an independent peak with a broad base. It is the 14th highest mountain in Japan and the second highest free-standing mountain after Mt.

Kinpusan in the Yoshino region (Nara Prefecture), the center of Shugendo, which has developed since the Middle Ages as a sacred place of mountain worship, enshrining Zaogongen and Kushimachinomikoto, and has acquired a religious sphere that extends over Musashi and Sagami. The shrine is currently a single shrine that is not affiliated with the Jinja Honcho (Shinto Shrine Headquarters).
            - >  It is said to have been founded in the 7th year of [[Emperor Sojin's]] reign (91 B.C.), and in 736 [[Gyoki]] is said to have invoked Zao Gongen... In the Meiji era (1868-1912), due to the separation of Shinto and Buddhism, the name of the shrine was changed from Ontake Daigongen (Ontake Zao Gongen) to Ohmadono-Tenjinsha. This was because the shrine was compared to "Omadonomizunotenjinsha" listed in the Engishiki, but since there was another shrine that was also compared to Omadonomizunotenjinsha (Omadonomizunoten Shrine in Daimaru, Inagi City, Tokyo), the name was changed to Ontake Shrine. In 1952, the name was changed to the current Musashi Ontake Shrine.
- There is a shrine associated with Nara.

I wrote a comment in support of Yasuno and tweeted poster information while rocking on the bus up the mountain road.

I'd put the mobile battery in a knapsack that I'd check in, not in my pocket.
- The battery will last until we climb up and down.

I lost the signal here, so I made a note in my Apple Notebook.
- I think I'll just have to go back to where the PC is to reflect it.
- Merged.

Mother" was going to write about [[ha-ha-kodo]].
- > This hermitage was built by En no Gyoja for his mother who was chasing him for her own safety. The "women-prohibited gate" that was built to prevent his mother "Shiratoume" from entering the dangerous mountain was the beginning of the "women-prohibited" policy, which has been maintained for more than 1,300 years. This is a reflection of En no Gyoja's kind heart for his mother, and since his mother assisted villagers in childbirth, the temple is believed to have a sacred power to bring forth a child and ensure safe delivery.

Downhill?


Too much pain in the knee, so I bought a vajra cane at Matsukiyo Chaya, 2,500 yen.
- I think I read something about renting it downstairs for 1500 yen and getting 500 yen back when you return it.
- Well, I can't help it.

- I'd like to pass on this one.

Wake up at 5:00 a.m.
- I got down there with a quick change of clothes and packed luggage in about 10 minutes, but there wasn't much to do since my next appointment was a 6:00 breakfast!

Reflection on Yesterday
- It would be better to buy onigiri (rice balls) and bring them with you for lunch than to wait in line to buy udon noodles, rather than eat them on the bus.
- Right knee still hurts.
    - They gave me a [[molas]], but I should have brought my own.
- I should have brought a branch for the electrical outlet since we're staying in a large room at an inn for the first night.

Meals from 6:00 a.m.
- Load the truck before departure.

Ryusenji at 7:00.
