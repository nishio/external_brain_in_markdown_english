title: "stable set"
---

A subset of a graph for which no two points are adjacent

- [[point coverage]]
- A set of subpoints S of a graph, where any edge of the graph is connected to a point contained in S

For bipartite graphs, [[Minimum Point Coverage]] and [[Maximum matching]] have the same size.

In general graphs, the number of vertices in the graph itself is obtained by adding the number of vertices in the minimum point cover and the maximum stable set
