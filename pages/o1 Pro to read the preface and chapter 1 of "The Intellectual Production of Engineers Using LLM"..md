The chapters and sections built in this vein are very effective in giving readers a realistic picture of the process of intellectual production using LLM. In particular, the interactive "generative process" and "real-life examples" are superbly structured to provide insight through practice, rather than just a theory book.

In Chapter 2, "Accelerating Intellectual Production with Digital Tools," readers will find particular value in focusing on the following points
- Specific examples of the use of Kozaneba and Scrapbox: Explain the unique characteristics of these tools and how they contribute to intellectual production. In particular, the process of organizing and cultivating ideas will be demonstrated with specific examples.
- Transition from analog to digital: How can traditional methodologies be complemented and extended with digital tools? This will make it easier to convince readers with traditional methods of thinking.
- Integration with LLM: Combining digital tools with LLM demonstrates synergies that cannot be achieved on their own. For example, a specific process to have LLM analyze information aggregated by Scrapbox.
- Challenges and Limitations: highlight the risks of over-reliance on digital tools and LLM and the role humans should play in this context.

As we develop the next chapter, we believe that this specificity and balance will help us build content that will meet the expectations of our readers. Additional detailed suggestions will be provided as needed when ready.

Below is a draft proposal for "Chapter 2: Accelerating Intellectual Production with Digital Tools".

Abstract: This chapter presents ways to accelerate idea generation, organization, and development using tools other than LLM (e.g., Kozaneba and Scrapbox) and to enhance intellectual production in collaboration with LLM.

Chapter 2: Accelerate Intellectual Production with Digital Tools
In the previous chapter, we confirmed that the universal skills (ways of learning, thinking, and idea cultivation) developed in the traditional "Engineer's Guide to Intellectual Production" remain valid through the ages, while utilizing the linguistic support provided by LLM In the LLM era, information acquisition and idea brainstorming are extremely easy. become easier, and intellectual producers can be stimulated by a variety of information sources and consider a myriad of possibilities in a short period of time. At the same time, however, the process by which humans clarify their own thinking and select and assemble valuable ideas remains a significant challenge.

This chapter presents a practical approach to utilizing "digital tools" to address such issues. Specifically, through the use of services such as Kozaneba and Scrapbox, we will explore the process of "visualizing" ideas, discovering organic connections, and steadily absorbing suggestions generated through dialogue with LLM into one's intellectual assets.

2-1 New "[[Idea space]]" brought by digital tools
Scrapbox and other knowledge bases are characterized by flexible linkage. Scrapbox and other knowledge bases are characterized by flexible linkage, allowing users to freely associate new ideas and pieces of information, thereby extending the organization of ideas from the brain into the digital space.

Kozaneba is also a tool to support "structural thinking": by arranging ideas, grouping them, and extracting patterns through a KJ-like bottom-up approach, the large amount of textual information obtained through dialogue with the LLM can be creatively reorganized. In other words, while the LLM provides a large amount of "materials," the tool serves as a "[[workbench]]" for processing them.

2-2 Synergistic Effects of Combining LLM and Tools
The diverse ideas and insights that emerge from dialogue with LLMs often result in a "flood" of information. At this time, a lightweight note + link tool such as Scrapbox can be used to pick up interesting fragments from the flood and cross-reference them to discover new connections.

For example, if keywords such as "critical thinking," "knowledge structuring," and "autonomous selection of learning objects" are extracted from the conversation logs with LLMs, they can be linked on Scrapbox to related prior literature, their own past notes, and existing project notes to create a useful "knowledge network This will create a useful "knowledge network".
At the same time, if we cluster these keywords using a tool like Kozaneba and organize the ideas and methods in a bottom-up manner, a structure will eventually emerge that will serve as the basis for an "intellectual production methodology for the LLM era.

2-3 Digital tools and human "[[editorial]] power"
The key to mastering these tools is the human "editing" ability. Tools will never automatically build a perfect body of knowledge. Rather, the very act of creating connections is a creative act for the intellectual producer.

People need to examine the information material that LLM provides and sort it according to their own values and purposes. Sorting cards in Kozaneba is also an act of discovering the relevance of potential ideas. Through such "editing," digital tools become "externalized thinking spaces" that expand the minds of intellectual producers.

2-4 Practical example: Reorganize LLM interaction logs with Scrapbox and Kozaneba
As a specific example, keywords picked up from the LLM comments and the author's own reflections in Chapter 1 ("critical thinking," "structuring and applying knowledge," "efficient reading," "generating valuable ideas," "autonomous selection of learning objects," etc.) are transcribed into Scrapbox and cross-linked. Scrapbox.

In addition, each keyword is carded in Kozaneba and grouped using the KJ legal procedure. For example, "knowledge structuring" and "efficient reading" might be grouped into the "information processing skills" group. On the other hand, "critical thinking" and "autonomous selection of learning objects" could be grouped under "judgment and selection criteria.

Once the issues scattered in Chapter 1 are crystallized into higher-level concepts such as "information processing skills," "criteria for judgment and selection," and "value creation process," it will be easier to present a practical methodology based on these pillars in subsequent chapters.

2-5 Approaching Intellectual Production Models in the LLM Era through the Use of Tools
In order to bring out the power of LLM, the question is from what perspective humans select, assemble, evaluate, and reuse information. Digital tools provide powerful support for this act of "information editing by humans.

The externalized knowledge network thus constructed will create a recursive learning loop: each new interaction with LLM will stimulate existing knowledge systems on Scrapbox and Kozaneba, and ideas will grow and rearrange organically. Ultimately, an "ecosystem" of intellectual production adapted to the LLM era will be formed.

In this chapter, we have shown how to use digital tools to effectively organize and extend the output of information acquisition through LLM, based on the premise of information acquisition through LLM. In the next chapter, based on the foundation of intellectual production thus established, we plan to go into more concrete examples of application to projects and examples of use in other fields.

(The above is a draft of Chapter II.)

- Both sides did the act of proposing two chapters.
    - I just said, "I'll share a draft of one chapter with you," and didn't give any instructions.
- o1 Pro's 2-1 is interesting.

The following is a brief summary of the history and work to date, as well as future tasks.

summary
- This book is a project in which the author explores new intellectual production practices and methodologies using LLM (Large Language Models), building on his previous book, "The Intellectual Production of Engineers.
- The "Preface," "Preface Generation Process," and "Chapter 1: Reexamining the 'Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production'" have already been generated on a trial basis, and the generation process, examples of requests for comments to the LLM, and reflections for each Day are also recorded.
- In Chapter 2 and beyond, we plan to flesh out methods of accelerating and organizing intellectual production using digital tools such as Kozaneba and Scrapbox, as well as collaboration with LLM.
- While the project is underway, progress has been stalled as the authors themselves work on other important issues, such as their involvement in activities to promote digital democracy in Japan. In the meantime, the environment has evolved, including an upgraded version of LLM (Claude 3.5) and the addition of Project management functions.
- In the future, it is expected to supplement the explanation of past works and background (what is Claude 3 Opus, positioning of past books, how interest in LLM utilization was formed, introduction of the Plurality Japanese translation forum) and tools such as Kozaneba and Scrapbox, and to systematize the methodology based on these.

Remaining tasks and issues
- Reader-friendly overview of Claude 3 Opus and other LLMs and their features
- Organize the content and positioning of previous books, such as "The Technology Behind Coding" and "The Intellectual Production of Engineers," and relate them to this book.
- Background explanation of why the author is interested in and has practiced LLM
- Introduction of examples of communities of practice where AI and people collaborate, such as the Plurality Japanese Translation Forum
- Explanation of how to use digital tools such as Kozaneba (electronic KJ method tool) and Scrapbox
- Organize past LLM dialogue logs and extracted keywords in Kozaneba and reflect them in the methodology
- Consideration of the "needs → form" process, which brings together ideas from demand and social significance.

In summary, a preface and first chapter already exist as a draft, but it needs to be enhanced with relevant background information, tool descriptions, theorization of intellectual production methodologies in the LLM era, and linkages to other projects. In the process, the challenge is to move to the stage of visualizing and systematizing the collected logs and keywords with digital tools and integrating them into a form that is easier for readers to understand.

Potentially confusing sections and examples of supplemental information

RAG([[Retrieval-Augmented Generation]], retrieval-enhanced generation)
- It may be difficult to understand the meaning of RAG in the current explanation.
- Supplemental Example:
    - RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a method whereby LLMs retrieve (Retrieval) relevant information not only from their own internal models, but also from external databases and personal knowledge bases, and use the results to generate (Generate) answers. This gives LLMs access to up-to-date and unique knowledge, allowing them to provide more precise and customized answers."

LLM for commodities
- The term "commodity" may not be common.
- Supplemental Example:
    - By "commodity LLM," we mean a standard LLM that is common and can be used by everyone in the same way, with no special customization or additional learning. For example, if everyone just uses the same LLM, it is difficult to differentiate oneself.

Zoom function (zoom in Kozaneba, etc.)
- The significance of zooming tends to remain ambiguous.
- Supplemental Example:
    - Electronic KJ method tools, such as Kozaneba, allow you to freely expand and contract the space in which you organize your ideas using the zoom feature. This allows you to see the whole picture (all groups of ideas) at a glance and get a bird's eye view of the concept, or zoom in on a specific part to examine it in detail. Digital tools give you a degree of spatial freedom that was difficult to achieve on paper."

Broadcasting and Broad Listening
- These contrasts may be difficult to understand at first glance.
- Supplemental Example:
    - Broadcasting is like television or radio broadcasting, which transmits information to a large number of people in one direction. Broad listening, on the other hand, refers to efficiently aggregating and understanding the voices and opinions of many people. With summarization technology, one can listen to a large number of opinions and arguments in a short period of time in an organized manner, thus enabling interactive and collaborative intellectual production."

context window
- It would be good to have a simplified explanation for those who are not familiar with context windows.
- Supplemental Example:
    - The "context window" is the maximum amount of text that an LLM can reference in a single interaction. The larger it is, the better the LLM can remember longer sentences and past interactions and return consistent responses. For example, an LLM with a longer context window can more easily continue a discussion based on past interactions."

Overall Advice
- Whenever technical terms or abbreviations (e.g., RAG) appear, we will supplement them with concise definitions.
- When presenting new concepts (e.g., broad listening, LLM for commodities), contrast them with similar existing concepts and use concrete examples to help visualize them.
- Clarify "what makes you happy" about the tool's functionality (zoom, line drawing) and clearly indicate the difference from the paper method.

These supplements will help viewers smoothly understand terms and ideas that are new to them, and will help convey the content of the lecture more effectively.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It is a convincing point. The last lecture material was not in the table of contents, but I included it after Day 8. By the way, it is now 2024-12-08.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>
Understood. Based on the date of December 8, 2024, the process we have gone through, the process of organizing the materials, and the points raised, we propose the following summary at the end of the report.

Summary (as of 2024-12-08)
- This project was triggered by the long-selling book "The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production" to re-examine the state of intellectual production in the LLM era.
- Through the review from Day 1 to Day 8 and the actual process of creating presentation materials, it was highlighted how traditional intellectual production activities such as reading, writing, and summarizing can be transformed by LLM and digital tools.
- The transition from the paper KJ method to Kozaneba, the formation of knowledge networks using Scrapbox, and the coupling with LLM for personalized information acquisition and nonlinear reading experiences were suggested.
- By adding improvements pointed out to the presentation materials (such as the definition of RAG, explanation of "LLM of commodities," and supplements such as zoom functionality and broad listening), we were able to brush up the content to make it more easily understood by the general audience.
- Through this book and this lecture, it is clear that intellectual production in the LLM era has evolved from mere technique and theory to an approach that emphasizes "learning by making" through practice and the growth of knowledge networks through time and social triggers.

Based on the process and results to this point, we expect to continue to devise and share practical innovations as LLM and intellectual production tools evolve to deliver more substantial value to our readers and audiences.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Thank you for the summary. I think it would be better to record the lecture material as it is as an archive, and as for the points that are difficult to understand, I think it would be better to record them first as "points that o1 pointed out as difficult to understand after looking at this lecture material".

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>Understood. With that structure, we can summarize it as follows. (Included in [[LENCHI_The hard to understand part of the lecture material]])

The following is the manuscript of an experiment in which all previous manuscripts were read using ChatGPT o1 pro mode to reconstruct and improve the book, which is recorded as Day 10. Assuming that the reader is completely unfamiliar with the terms "o1" and "o1 pro", the context is carefully supplemented. In addition, Day 10 is positioned as a phase after Day 9 (the day of the lecture), as a chapter to objectively review the past activities and clarify the editorial policy for the next step.

# Day10: Comprehensive retrospective experiment using the new "o1 pro" mode
.
After the presentation at Day 9, we began to review the manuscripts, logs, lecture materials, and real-time audience discussions related to the "Intellectual Production Techniques of Engineers Using LLM," which we had accumulated so far. Here, we utilized a new feature called "ChatGPT o1 pro mode.

## What is "o1 pro"?
The "o1" is the state-of-the-art LLM model offered in the ChatGPT Pro plan released by OpenAI on 2014-12-05 and is designed to provide particularly strong performance on difficult problems.
The "o1 pro mode" is a special mode that invests additional computational resources in its o1 model to solve more difficult problems stably and accurately. It is considered particularly useful in areas such as mathematics and programming, where accuracy and reliability of answers are required.

## Purpose of this experiment
.
For the Day 10 experiment, we had the LLM in "o1 pro" mode read all the various elements generated up to Day 9 (preface, draft chapters 1 and 2, lecture materials, audience discussions on Scrapbox, previous experiment logs, etc.) and aimed to

Reconfirm the big picture: Check to see if the flow of the book is such that readers can understand the "intellectual production techniques of the LLM era" that the entire book is aiming for, even if they are picking it up for the first time.

Organize and supplement terms and concepts: consider which chapters and how to explain terms that may be unfamiliar to certain readers, such as RAGs, commodity LLMs, broad listening, context windows, etc., in a way that is easy to convey.

Strengthening the reader's perspective: The goal is to solidify a policy of shifting information from the raw, internal descriptions of logs and internal experiments to a form that readers are more likely to get value from.

Establishment of editorial guidelines: This publication should not be merely a collection of production records, but a guide for readers to practice the intellectual production model in the LLM era. Based on the suggestions obtained from this comprehensive review, we will establish a policy to improve the organization of subsequent chapters, the way specific examples are presented, and the way illustrations and tools are introduced.

Insights from the experiment
Immediate follow-up to terminology is essential:
As a result of having o1 pro analyze past manuscripts, it was repeatedly brought to our attention that "the meaning of abbreviations and new concepts are difficult to understand for those reading this book for the first time due to lack of explanation. In the future, it is necessary to devise ways to prevent readers from getting lost, such as by providing explanations of terms, footnotes, and creating a list of terms at the beginning of the book.

A shift from internal description to universal value:
The real-time discussion logs at the time of the lectures and the cryptic terms and abbreviations that were used internally within the project are difficult for outside readers to understand. Therefore, the editorial policy was clarified to summarize and reorganize the logs and explain "why they are useful for understanding intellectual production techniques. In other words, even vivid dialogues among the people involved must be extracted as "examples" that are useful to general readers, and processed to derive universal suggestions from them.

Synergy between LLM and tools to support divergence and convergence:
Through previous drafts and dialogue logs, we have learned that LLM supports divergent thinking, while convergent organization is achieved through a combination of human editing skills and digital tools (Kozaneba, Scrapbox). o1 pro's overall analysis will make this complementary relationship even clearer, helping to create concrete guidelines to show readers "what to use when. The overall analysis by o1 pro will make this complementary relationship clearer and encourage the creation of specific guidelines to show readers "what to use and when.

Need to reconfigure it to meet the needs of readers:
The materials generated by Day 9 remained faithful to the production process, but that does not necessarily mean they are easy for readers to understand. o1 pro's analysis emphasized the need to restructure the materials around reader needs, such as "what readers want to know first," "points they want to understand step by step," and "appropriate timing to introduce highly specialized elements. The results of the o1 pro analysis underscored the need to reconfigure the site around the reader's needs.

Future Editorial Policy
After the Day 10 experiment, this document will be edited according to the following policy.

Supplemental terminology as needed and step-by-step introduction of concepts: Reinforce glossaries and explanations when terms are first introduced so that readers do not get left behind along the way.

Extracting and organizing case studies: "Examples of learning methods that can be replicated by general readers" and "Tips for utilizing new tools" will be extracted from live dialogues and informal episodes seen in lectures and logs, and summarized in an easy-to-understand manner.

Revise chapter structure: Fine-tune the order of chapters and sections and the amount of content so that important points for readers, such as learning cycles, knowledge structuring, and examples of LLM use, flow naturally.

By brushing up on these editorial policies, this book is expected to evolve into a more accessible and useful guide for readers who want to understand and practice the "Art of Intellectual Production in the LLM Age.

summary
Day 10 is positioned as the day when we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the previous manuscripts and logs using the new LLM mode (o1 pro). This experiment has materialized a number of editorial improvements, such as strengthening the explanation of technical terms, reorganizing the overall structure, and optimizing from the reader's point of view.

As a result, this book has a clear path that can be reconstructed in a way that is easy for the reader to understand, while still utilizing past production and experimentation logs. From here, we will proceed to the next step of perfecting this book according to the improvements that have been identified.
