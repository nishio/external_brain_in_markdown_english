<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This article provides a history of grant programs in the cryptocurrency field and a quantitative comparative analysis of four programs, [[Uniswap]], [[dYdX]], [[Optimism]], and [[Gitcoin]]. Here are the main points
1. [[grants]] are often provided for two purposes: to sustainably provide and maintain [[public goods (i.e. goods or services such as parks or highways)]] and to grow a particular ecosystem.
2. grant programs will develop significantly in 2019 and beyond. [[Ecosystem Support Program]], [[Gitcoin Grants]], [[Moloch DAO]], etc.
3. in 2020-2021, grant programs centered on the DeFi protocols will be active. [[Retroactive Public Goods Funding]], etc.
4. 2022-2024 will see the emergence of grant program impact evaluations, community-driven grant programs, etc.
5. a comparison of four grant programs - Uniswap, dYdX, Optimism, and Gitcoin - revealed significant differences in grant amounts and number of recipients.
6. suggested that there is a correlation between how grant program managers are selected (top-down, bottom-up, or QF) and the amount of grant funding.
7. top-down grants tend to fund projects that benefit their own protocols, while bottom-up or QF grants tend to distribute funds more evenly among projects of public interest.
8. top-down grant bias may serve to fund projects not covered by the QF and create contingencies in the public goods market.
