My research focuses on using clean language to express specific sensations and experiences in words. This allows us to elicit new ideas and deepen our self-understanding. It is also important for evaluating ideas, feasibility, and deciding what to do next. These can be done by capturing specific emotional expressions and physical responses.

Nishio's research note, "Clean Language as a Board Game," provided some insight into learning programming. This is related to my research and suggests that with appropriate questioning and situation setting, learning programming may also be more efficient.

These studies suggest that it is possible to construct a methodology for deepening self-understanding and eliciting new ideas. However, further research is needed on the specific methods and scope of application.

Also, according to Nishio's "The Power of Words: Telling Experiences, Painting the World We Aim For," it is recommended to set goals that are achievable in time and pages to achieve a sense of accomplishment, as effort and results are not proportional. This is also related to my research and may be helpful in setting clean language questions.

We study the use of training, verbalization, metaphors, and clean language to express concrete sensations and experiences in words. This can elicit new ideas and deepen self-understanding. In particular, the setting of clean language questions is important, and it has been confirmed that setting questions of moderate difficulty can induce a flow state. However, we do not yet have answers on how to set them.

Also important are the evaluation of ideas, their feasibility, and the decision on what to do next. These can be done by capturing specific emotional expressions and physical responses. In particular, we are also studying the most effective clean language questions and their use.

Nishio's research notes provided some insight into learning programming. This is related to my research and suggests that learning programming can also be efficiently advanced through appropriate questioning and situation setting. His notes also suggest that the question "What do you value?" as a question to deepen self-understanding is also suggested to be effective.

Clean Language" is a board game that draws out unverbalized ideas and encourages verbalization. By changing perspectives, new ideas are elicited and displayed in two dimensions. The achievement condition is "decide what to do next. A future-focused version of the game, "Why are we doing it?

Using questions that do not bring in preconceived ideas, elicit information, focus on sensations and metaphors, delve into symbols, and ask about the connections between the symbols.

Train yourself to express your own experiences in words, connecting language with specific sensations and experiences. Review and brush up tentative verbalizations over time to make them more precise and expressive.

It is a deeper understanding of metaphor, which in turn leads to a deeper understanding of clean language. This is not a contest where ideas alone are evaluated, but whether or not those ideas can be realized.

As for how to end the presentation, it is appropriate to end with an open question to the audience about what is troubling you at the moment.

### Relation to Fragment
.

The "questions cause a flow state" fragment relates to the concept that Clean Language questions promote verbalization. The point that it is important to enter the flow state by considering questions of moderate difficulty is helpful in setting clean-language questions.

The "Intellectual Production Techniques of Engineers: A Reaction Summary" fragment discusses the phases of information gathering and is related to the study of eliciting information with clean language.

The "Conversation Log 2019-07-27-2" fragment has a discussion about the detection of languageization and is related to the goal of encouraging clean language languageization.

The "Blind Spot Cards Without Pictures Yet" fragment has details about the clean-language questions and helps to further the understanding of the study.

The "Create a Short Version of Lecture Material" fragment is related to the Clean Language objective, as it was noted that verbalization leads to greater self-understanding and personal growth.

### Deep thoughts and questions

How can clean language questions be set up to be of moderate difficulty and to induce a flow state?

How should verbalization detection be performed? Is it possible to capture specific emotional expressions and physical responses?

What are some of the Clean Language questions that are particularly effective? In what situations are they most effective?

Clean Language as 🤖🔁 Board Game
Clean Language as a Board Game elicits unverbalized ideas and encourages verbalization. It elicits new ideas and displays them in two dimensions by changing perspectives. The achievement condition is "I've decided what to do next. Is this a good place to end?" A discussion is needed on the timing of the question "Is this a good place to finish?

A future-focused version of Clean Language is proposed for "Why do it?" What is the next step toward that goal?" The question is proposed to be.

Use only questions that bring in as few preconceived ideas as possible.
- Elicit information, focus on sensations and metaphors, dig deeper to create symbols, and listen for connections between the symbols.

Training to express one's own experiences in words
- First step in connecting words with concrete sensations and experiences
- Review and brush up on tentative verbalizations over time to make them more accurate and expressive

Better understanding of metaphors and thereby a better understanding of clean language

It is not a contest where ideas alone are evaluated, but where the question is whether or not the idea can be realized.

How to end the presentation
- It's appropriate to end with an open question to the audience about what is troubling you at the moment.

The fragment "Kozaneba: Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning" proposes a new framework to explain how Clean Language works.

By viewing Clean Language as a board game, it is believed that it is possible to elicit new perspectives and opinions, which can then be translated into concrete actions. In addition, deeper consideration of the timing and content of Clean Language questions will enable more effective communication.

In the fragment "The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production," the Clean Language method is introduced. The technique is based on the idea of "using only questions that do not bring in preconceived ideas." The information is elicited, the focus is on sensations and metaphors, the process is delved into to create symbols, and the relationship between the symbols is asked.

In the fragment "Worldview after LLM," it is stated that training to express one's own experiences in words is an important first step in connecting words with concrete sensations and experiences. He also believes that by reviewing and brushing up tentative verbalizations over time, they can be made more precise and expressive.

In the fragment "I'm reading about metaphors," I hope to gain a better understanding of metaphors and thereby a better understanding of clean language within myself.

In the fragment "Unexplored is not an idea contest," it is stated that Unexplored is not a contest in which ideas are evaluated only on the basis of ideas, but on whether those ideas can be realized.

In the fragment "It would be good to find a way to cut the interim presentation," it is stated that it is appropriate to end the presentation with an open question to the audience, saying what is troubling you at the moment, given the nature of the meeting.

A chat system using clean language elicits ideas that have not yet been clearly put into words and encourages verbalization. In particular, it serves to elicit and organize the opinions of the elderly. By changing perspectives, the system allows the user to see areas that are not visible, providing new perspectives and eliciting opinions and information that were not visible. It also divides human responses into sticky notes, which are then displayed on the whiteboard. However, questions remain as to how the system can change human perspectives and elicit new opinions and information, and what questions and functions are needed to elicit and organize the opinions of the elderly.

### Relation to Fragment

Nishio's fragment "Clean Language as a Board Game" is related to a chat system using Clean Language. He proposes to treat Clean Language as a board game, and states that this could expand the usage of Keichobot. This is consistent with the idea in my research that chat systems provide new perspectives and elicit opinions and information that were not visible.

### Deep thoughts and questions

The question remains as to how a chat system can change human perspectives and elicit new opinions and information, and what questions and functions are needed to elicit and organize the opinions of the elderly. The question also arises as to what new perspectives and opinions can be elicited by treating Clean Language as a board game, and specifically, what kinds of play styles are possible. In order to clarify these questions, it will be necessary to actually prototype "Clean Language as a board game" and test play it.

The "Conversation Log 20210120" confirms that the chat system asks questions to those that have not yet been clearly verbalized and encourages verbalization. It is expected that this will be input and organized by Regroup.

Given the relevance of these notes to the "Silver Democracy" fragment, it may be possible for chat systems to play a role in eliciting and organizing the opinions of the elderly as their proportion increases.

We also learned from the fragments of the PyCon JP 2014 Keynote Speech the idea that changing perspectives can help us see the unseen. This may lead to chat systems providing new perspectives and eliciting opinions and information that were not visible.

From these considerations, the following questions arise. How can chat systems change human perspectives and elicit new opinions and information? And what kinds of questions and functions are needed to elicit and organize the opinions of the elderly?

- [[Conversation Log 2020-06-05]] at [[Conversation Log 2020-06-05]], we came up with a system where the chat system is not limited to just chatting, but also does other activities.
- Chat system asks questions, human answers them, divides the answers into sticky notes and displays them on a whiteboard [[Regroup]], human can move them around and organize them, chat system highlights keywords that are of interest

I think this is relevant to [[Clean Language as a Board Game]] as well.
