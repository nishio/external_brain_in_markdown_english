title: "Cookie Clicker Rustic Strategies"
---

Strategies that people who don't think much tend to choose naively.
- A: Always buy what you can afford when you can afford it.
- B: Buy the smallest minimum investment price
    - Will be the same as A, savings go up, buy when the minimum price is exceeded.

- C: Buy all in the same quantity
    - Buy the least

- D: Increase the smallest percentage of the total return
- E: Increase the highest return

I want to design such a simple strategy that will not be the right answer.
