title: "eccentrics and oddballs"
---

from [A hacker's last will and testament ─ Ikuo Takeuchi's idle moss No. 11: eccentrics and weirdos | Cybozu style](https://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m000293.html).
- [[eccentric person]] and [[oddball]]

- [[unconventional]]
- > "Odd" has the nuance of being rare and superior, which "strange" does not have. This is the point. We say "[[genius]]" but we don't say "strange genius. Qiwei" means excellent and great, "qiqi" means excellent and clever, "qibone" means having a rare spirit, "qishi" means an outstanding person, "qidou" is synonymous with prodigy, the first meaning of "[[original]]" is outstanding and extraordinary, "qirei" means excellent and beautiful, and so on.
- >  The second meaning of "eccentric" is someone with spare time. It gives a sense of spare time, which is nice.
- >  I made a "[[strange]]" project, not "strange". I even wrote a "[[strange]]" colorful paper while planning the project.
- > "The idea of "[[eccentricity]]"
- > The common denominator of all the eccentrics that I found wonderful in the unexplored world is the strength of [[curiosity]]. In other words, they have [[A heart that loves "strange"]].
- >  "[[bizarre]]" is another word I like.

The word "eccentric" now has a [[deliberately act oddly (e.g. to get attention)]] nuance, but originally it had a [[excellence]] nuance.
- > To be deliberately unusual in order to attract attention. [Digital Daijisen](https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/word/%E5%A5%87%E3%82%92%E8%A1%92%E3%81%86/)
- relevance
        - Difference between Type C and Type D of [Can you spot innovative talent in advance?
        - [[From excellence comes fulfillment and confidence.]]

I guess "kitchy" is also an outstandingly bizarre "thought," so it's a "bizarre idea" in the best sense of the word.
- > Abbreviation of "kisō tenkai yori oraku" (to fall from a strange idea). Kisou" means an eccentric idea. Tengai" means outside of heaven. --- [[A dictionary of four-character phrases]] [What is kisō tenkai - Kotobank](https://kotobank.jp/word/%E5%A5%87%E6%83%B3%E5%A4%A9%E5%A4%96-474173)
- Ah, I see, the nuance of "fell from the heavens".

Curiosity, assuming that "oddity" is a thing of excellence or descent from the heavens, would not include the "Mr. A and his daughter have returned from their marriage, I wonder what happened to them" that is so common in the countryside.

By the way, my sense now is that a culture is emerging in which "weirdo" has a positive meaning of "changeable person".
    - [[An oddball is someone who changes]]
- In the phase of growth when society is left to the [[ordinary person]] ([[mediocre]]), the "eccentric" would have only had to make use of his spare time to do eccentric things.
    - > The second meaning of "eccentric" is someone with spare time. It gives a sense of spare time, which is nice.
- When society shrinks, [[Maintaining the status quo is slow suicide.]] so it is necessary to change it.
    - But the normal people are biased toward maintaining the status quo, so the weirdos have to lead the [[reform]].
    - In that sense [[leadership]].
        - Related: [[The first follower makes the leader.]]
