title: "Sharing of experiences through SF cannot be summarized"
---

In a world where reproducible information is circulating and becoming less rare, the "experience of a possible future" from reading [[science fiction novels]] may be a rare value that is shared only by those who buy and read them.
- It will be more valuable if it has a network goods effect among those who buy and read it.
- It is a world where countless communities are created by the number of books that are read and interacted with only by those who have read them.

- Continued from [AI Summary
- Novel experience cannot be summarized.
- The summary assumes that the fragments themselves have value.
    - [[Stories are worth an array of fragments.]]
