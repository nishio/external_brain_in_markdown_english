- Length 2N, balanced [[Number of bracketed strings]]
- Number of triangulations] of convex n-angles
    - Consider a convex polygon consisting of n + 2 edges, divided into n triangles by drawing lines connecting the vertices so that they do not intersect each other. The number of cases for this division is the Catalan number Cn.
- With n branches (n + 1 leaves) [[Number of binary trees]]
