Bounding box to determine the pertinence of groups containing only paths
- The yellow square in the background of the pass was no longer displayed, so that the pass was judged only on the pass.
- This is hard to grasp.
- As with the original sticky, I made it a hit-and-run decision for the box.
- Possibly unnatural in case of long diagonals, etc.
- There is a proposal to make the line thicker to make it a hit.
