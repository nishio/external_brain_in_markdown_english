title: "Amazon's Guiding Principles"
---

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Specific behavioral guidelines for [[meetings]] and [[discussions]] adopted by [[Amazon]] are the "[[Narrative on page 6]]" style memo and the "[[2 Pizza Rule]]" introduced by [[Jeff Bezos]].

Narrative on page 6
- Amazon prefers to use a detailed six-page document (narrative) rather than a PowerPoint presentation. Jeff Bezos recommends this approach and allows time for everyone to quietly read the document at the beginning of the meeting. This ensures that everyone has the same information and allows for a deeper level of understanding and discussion.

2 Pizza Rule
- The "2-pizza rule" is also based on the idea that a team should consist of enough people to be satisfied with two pizzas, i.e., about 5 to 7 people. This is intended to keep team sizes small to streamline communication and increase productivity.

These approaches have contributed to efficient meeting operations and improved decision-making processes within Amazon. In particular, the "six-page narrative" provides an environment that makes it easier for those with [[dissenting opinion]] to express it, and provides a means to increase [[transparency]] and understanding of the information. These are specific examples of the methods Amazon employs to foster a culture of fast decision-making and efficient meetings.
