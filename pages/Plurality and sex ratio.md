I'd like to know. I'm not saying this to harass you, but I really think that plurality is important, and I feel that it is a movement with great potential.

> [0xtkgshn](https://x.com/0xtkgshn/status/1922864093486108849) It's exactly like that, very little. And I was so worried. In Japan, there are very few women. I am becoming more and more aware of it, but I still don't know how to deal with it. I also feel that calling them "because they are women" is quite discriminatory.

- [[Plurality was coined as a colorless neologism]]
- > Audrey: ... When people say "inclusive diversity," they immediately think of things like gender and race. That of course is also an important part of difference, but it is not the main focus of this advanced coordination technique (=plurality).

> [moriteppei](https://x.com/moriteppei/status/1922838183534084357) After Audrey Tan defines the word plurality while quoting Hannah Arendt, "gender and race" are "not the primary focus" You say: ....... That's an amazing story. ......
> [moriteppei](https://x.com/moriteppei/status/1922842203245760936) I know what you mean, but you don't understand the context in which the phrase "race and gender are not the main focus" is accepted in Japan, You know, so you dare to say it this way. ......

> [moriteppei](https://x.com/moriteppei/status/1922842662891081814) I am extremely ambivalent about the plurality movement. On the one hand, updating democracy through IT and AI is an urgent issue, but on the other hand, Japan is full of discourtesies that can easily undermine even minimal democracy.

> [TenMen_chan](https://x.com/TenMen_chan/status/1923143324258426985) I'm close to the "main note readers" and "conservative leftists" here, but I think people in these phases are simply "heavy-handed". I think people in these phases have a tendency to be "heavy-handed".

> [moriteppei](https://x.com/moriteppei/status/1923200548850827471) Dewey's theory of democracy is interesting here, and thanks to AI, VR, and the latest technology, I think we are entering the most interesting time for philosophy in our lives. I feel like we are entering the most interesting era of philosophy in our lives, thanks to AI, VR, and the latest technology.

> [moriteppei](https://x.com/moriteppei/status/1923140850755960911) In the end, Plurality is a very biased group of "thought leaders" that pretends to have a "colorless, transparent, neutral framework" and says "Let's handle diversity without [[identity politics]]. (I'm not saying that being biased is a bad thing).
>
>  I don't think one group or political ideology can cover everything, so it might be more productive and gainful to think like how we can all climb the same mountain together while being disjointed.
- > [moriteppei](https://x.com/moriteppei/status/1923140850755960911) It may sound like I'm just denying it, but I'm not. It is true that democracy is not working in a sense, and that we have to do something about it using technology and other means.

> [0xtkgshn](https://x.com/0xtkgshn/status/1923194996074872949) Plurality is trying to raise the resolution of what freedom is and why politics is generated. I think it is difficult to recognize it because it has not been explored until now.
>  And I think that meta itself can be an ideology.

>  [[The Will of D]]

> [0xtkgshn](https://x.com/0xtkgshn/status/1923195483872223503) I read your diary too, I like it a lot. I feel like I'm finally getting the world line I've been looking for because this kind of discussion has never even been born before.

> [moriteppei](https://x.com/moriteppei/status/1923196267099980134) I am also inspired by your thoughts and actions every day.
>
>  But I think Audrey Tan already knows a lot of what I've written, and she's still working with Glenn Weil, so I think she's cunning, or rather, she's pushing the envelope in a difficult way.
>
>  Very stimulating, including Dewey's discussion, which is also mentioned in the Plurality book. I'll have to watch Star Trek too (lol).

> [0xtkgshn](https://x.com/0xtkgshn/status/1923197964518031371) Yes - really. Especially in the Japanese-speaking world, Ken Suzuki's contribution has been so significant that I don't think I could have come this far on my own.
>  When I was living in New York, Glen first invited me to UC Berkeley, and I thought, "There are so many people who are concerned about the brokenness of the current governance system with academia and entrepreneurs working together! and that's how I created Plurality Tokyo about two years ago.
>  That is now attracting so much attention that politicians are coming to take pictures with the book.
>  In a sense, we are losing the builder-like element, but I think it is healthy to have communities of various sizes, and I would like to explore this at various levels of granularity.
>  Anyway, the past few decades have been the result of discussions without increasing the amount of information, and now that we finally have the Internet and LLM to implement, there is a sense of urgency that if we don't get it done here, it will be the end of the world.

first of all
- Plurality is a concept that refers to "collaborative diversity," and Audrey has emphasized "the process of bridging heterogeneous values through technology rather than focusing solely on differences in attributes" ([[CoinDesk https www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/05/22/audrey-tang-learning-from-taiwans-digital-civic-experimentation]]). However, when the gender bias of speakers at Japanese events is noticeable, it is understandable that simply saying "gender and race are not the main focus" could be taken as an excuse for exclusion. In the following, I will organize the following three points: 1) the true meaning of the definition, 2) concrete measures for representativeness, and 3) theoretical background, assuming that I am speaking to both the speakers and the organizers.

1. clear the definition of Plurality again
- 1.1 What is cooperative diversity?
    - Plurality is collaborative diversity, a set of technologies that enable collaboration while preserving diversity" ([CoinDesk [https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/05/22/](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/05/22/) audrey-tang-learning-from-taiwans-digital-civic-experimentation])
    - [Attributive diversity (who gathers) and cognitive diversity (how do they mingle) are two wheels. When talking about the latter, it does not mean that the former can be disregarded - I did not make this clear enough.
- 1.2 Role of Technology
    - As g0v and vTaiwan have shown, the Plurality approach is to create a "place for lossless visibility of minority voices" with public APIs and open data ([Time [https://time.com/6979012/audrey-tang-interview-](https://time.com/6979012/audrey-tang-interview-) plurality-democracy/], [CoinDesk [https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/05/22/audrey-tang-learning-from-taiwans-digital-](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/05/22/audrey-tang-learning-from-taiwans-digital-) civic-experimentation]).
    - Using AI-assisted broad listening and multi-axis similarity mapping, the opinion space can be understood contour-wise even when there are few representatives - this is the idea of "[[taking]] the density of diversity over the number of people".
        - I see <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>> Contouring the opinion space with less representation.
            - The idea of balancing the ratio of the number of people is a bad idea because it tries to put information on the number of people in the first place.

2. practical commitment to representativeness
- 2.1 Recognition of Current Status
    - Major global tech conferences 2024 average 32.6 % female speakers ([openPR.com [https://www.openpr.com/news/3966105/the-tech-conference-gender-gap-new-data-reveals-](https://www.openpr.com/news/3966105/the-tech-conference-gender-gap-new-data-reveals-) striking?utm_source=chatgpt.com]).
    - The ratio of women in STEM in Japan is extremely low from the student stage, and the supply pool for the industry as a whole is thin ([Japan Dev [https://japan-dev.com/blog/women-in-tech-field-japan?lang=jp&utm_source=](https://japan-dev.com/blog/women-in-tech-field-japan?lang=jp&utm_source=) chatgpt.com]).
- 2.2 Five actions I would like to ensure the organizer
    1. public dashboarding
        - Automatic posting of speaker demographics (gender self-reported basis, age range, and area of expertise) on the event website. Visualize improvements by keeping a history of each event.
    2. open collective nomination
        - In parallel with the CFP (Call for Participation), a bot was implemented in Slack and X to recommend "people who have not yet been on the stage but have expertise".
    3. removal of economic barriers
        - Secure "no questions asked" scholarships for travel and childcare expenses. Reduce barriers to participation for women, those with additional costs, such as women, those raising children, and those living in rural areas.
    4. paired speakers/commentary slot
        - Reduce the number of single keynote speakers and make it standard to have a dialogue between two keynote speakers with different backgrounds. This will allow for multiple perspectives on technical content.
    5. publication of post-event feedback
        - Each time a participant questionnaire is used to measure whether there were role models with the same attributes as themselves, and this is reflected in the selection of speakers for the next session.
        - This is interesting.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- 2.3 Personal Views on the Calling Issue
    - "Wouldn't it be reverse discrimination to call them because they are women?" In response to this concern, we explain that we will not use a quota system, but rather a quality-guaranteed multiple selection process. For example, the review criteria clearly state "expertise + uniqueness of experience," and if there is a shortage of candidates who meet the latter criteria, we proactively reach out to them.

Theoretical Background: Implications from Arendt and Dewey
- Hannah Arendt said, "Plurality is the condition of human action" ([Goodreads [https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9289926-plurality-is-the-condition-of-human-action](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9289926-plurality-is-the-condition-of-human-action) -because-we-are?utm_source=chatgpt.com]).
- John Dewey tells us that "democracy is a way of life, an attitude of trust in human potential regardless of attributes" ([Goodreads [https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8111950-democracy-is-a-way-of-life-](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8111950-democracy-is-a-way-of-life-) controlled-by-a-working?utm_source=chatgpt.com]).
- Our goal is to implement Arendt's [[pluralism of action]] and Dewey's [[democracy as co-creation]] at the AI, Web3, and open source layers - in this sense, attribute diversity is the gateway and cognitive diversity assurance is the exit.

4. summary - how to respond to the "focus" problem
1. supplement the definition: not only say "the primary focus is the process" but also clearly state "[[do not]] leave out attribute maldistribution".
2. implement concrete measures: continue to make measurable improvements such as representation dashboards, expense support, and paired speakers.
3. shared philosophical foundation: Plurality emphasizes "[[the]] ability to think and act together" over attributes, but consistently says that this can only work if attribute diversity is a prerequisite.
This is the first answer I would give Audrey Tang in the field. Demonstrate commitment with numbers and structure, while continuing to reiterate the ideological core of Plurality - "No one is excluded by being the same.

- Personally, I think the very idea of the "ratio of men to women speakers" is an unwitting attack on the non-binary minority, based on the implicit assumption that people are either male or female binaries.
- I feel it is narrow-minded to try to balance a myriad of axes by focusing on only certain axes.
- In that sense, it's a great way to ask if there were role models who were close to you, rather than "attributes".
    - Because it does not impose a top-down approach to which attributes to focus on, but leaves it up to each individual to decide.

- The administration worked with the Taiwan Executive Yuan's Gender Equalization Committee to promote [[gender-free]] measures (e.g., bathroom guidelines and marriage equality).
- This philosophy is inseparable from the vision of digital democracy, which is to "thin the boundaries with others and encourage collaboration," and is consistently manifested in discussions of SNS design and bridging algorithms.
- Audrey Tan's stance has consistently been that democracy and innovation are strengthened by creating a system that does not separate people by gender and shares diverse experiences. She has transcended existing gender divisions in her own life and continues to implement her philosophy in both policy and technology.
