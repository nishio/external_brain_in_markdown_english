Those who focus on the "not 100%."

In particular, "[[It's not worth it because it's not 100%.]] and "denial of value" as in "[It's not worth it because of its flaws.
- Almost everything in the real world is imperfect
    - So the point that "this is incomplete" is not informative.
- In the first place, the existence of flaws and the existence of value are two different things.
    - If a knife has a flaw that can injure someone and lacks a safety mechanism to prevent it, that does not mean that the knife is worthless.
    - It is important to know whether the disadvantages hinder the use of the thing

    - [[Bug that considers anything that is not 100% as 0]]
    - [[Type thinking that does not solve 100% of problems]]
