- Version of [[Opinion cluster analysis of 110,000 people]] using [[UMAP]] instead of PCA

Impression "Like a stingray"
- I'm curious if the tail part is a political feature or a systemic one (e.g., people choosing "I don't know" or "neutral" on everything).
    - If you look at the data, there's a "don't know" for each question, and I'm including that [[one-hot expression]].
- If even UMAP can't separate them, there's no way PCA can.
    - There was some kind of cluster sticking out of the PCA, so maybe that's the stingray's tail.

- [[The opinion vectors of anonymous citizens are not so clearly separated.]]
