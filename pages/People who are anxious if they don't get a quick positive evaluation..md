Some people get anxious if they don't get a quick positive evaluation.
- It could be more like a majority.

- [[Fast feedback addiction]]
- Children who receive too much fast positive feedback from parents and others become addicted.
- [[They give up too quickly when things don't work out]].

- [[Find value in it while others think it's worthless.]]
- This, finding value in something that others think is worthless is just [[being on the wrong side of (e.g. an attack)]], thinking from someone else's point of view.
        - [[Uniqueness-oriented]] of [[Can you spot innovative talent in advance?]]
- You need [[the strength of mind]] to be able to pursue what you think is valuable, and even if others don't find value in it in the short term, "You still don't know," [[trusting your own values and moving on]].
    - [[Connecting the Dots]].
- So in the process of "finding value in it while others think it is worthless" there is a "period of time when positive evaluation is not available".
