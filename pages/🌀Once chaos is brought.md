In "Intelligent Collaboration Between AI and Humans," there is a discussion of improving knowledge productivity through AI-human collaboration, which is relevant to my notes. Also, "The Human-AI Boundary" discusses the importance of setting rules and balancing AI-human interaction, which is also relevant to my notes.

The "Value of Natural Resources" fragment presents the perspective of AI using humans as stationery. This could lead to a new relationship between AI and humans.

The development of AI will cause temporary disruption, but new perspectives and adaptations will emerge; comparisons of AI and human capabilities are sterile, and it is important to have assistants with different strengths and weaknesses by your side; AI evolution is irreversible, and it is more important to flow with it than against it; AI will put human thoughts into words, As AI puts human thoughts into words, humans become [[Discovering and communicating new knowledge is a means of value creation]].

The "Scrapbox+GPT4" fragment states that the AI-human relationship "has become one of having an assistant with different gains and losses by your side 24 hours a day," which is consistent with my research. Also important is the perspective that "AI will take our jobs" is a low resolution of work, which only means that some people can learn new tools and others cannot.

When asked, "What skills will remain valuable in an age when AI replaces human activities?" The question "What skills will remain valuable in an age when AI replaces human activities?" is answered with "human-like thinking," creativity, communication skills, and problem-solving abilities. However, current observations indicate that machines can replace "things that until a year ago were only thought to be possible by humans.

The fragment "GPT4 and the Nodal Point of Talking Thinking 2023-08-10" indicates a developing debate about the role of AI in "converging" human arguments and thought processes. This relates to the fundamental question of the extent to which AI can assist or replace human judgment.

The "Tokyo Metropolitan University Special Lecture on Information and Communications 2017" fragment notes that research is not being accelerated by AI. The fragment of the "English Official Language Theory" also examines the possibility of further increasing the use of English in Japan as AI becomes more proficient in English.

### Deep thoughts and questions

- We need to think deeply about the relationship between AI evolution and human adaptive capacity.
- What skills remain valuable in an age when AI is replacing human activities?
- How will AI's proficiency in English affect Japanese culture and identity?
- To what extent can AI assist or replace human judgment?
- If AI is not accelerating research, what is accelerating research?

AI developments cause temporary chaos, creating new perspectives and adaptations (Diary 2023-08-25); comparisons of AI and human capabilities are sterile, and it is important to have an assistant by your side with different strengths and weaknesses; AI evolution is irreversible, and it is important to be swept along better than against it (Container Narrative); AI may put human unverbalized thoughts into words, and humans discovering and communicating new knowledge is a means of value creation (Nodal Point of Thought 2023-05-22).

From Nishio's research notes, we found the perspective that collaboration (with AI) and diverse perspectives are required to improve knowledge productivity (AI writes research notes daily). Also important is the perspective that humans with high affinity for technology take the jobs of humans with low affinity for technology (AI does not take jobs), rather than AI taking jobs.

From these perspectives, the development of AI will broaden human perspectives and create the potential for new value creation. However, in the process, human jobs with low technological affinity may be lost. Therefore, it is important to collaborate with AI and to have diverse perspectives.

- From [[Diary 2023-08-25]], he points out that the development of AI will create temporary chaos, and that new perspectives and adaptations will emerge from this chaos. What will be found as a result, however, cannot yet be verbalized. Some people predict chaos, but experiencing it will result in self-transformation.

The comparison of AI and human capabilities is sterile in what new technologies can do, and it is important to have assistants with different strengths and weaknesses by your side.

When a part of you belongs to everyone else, what is the rest of you? In the following section, a part of you becomes everyone else's due to commoditization by AI, and you are no longer your own person. At that point, it is necessary to clarify what is the self.

The Container Story points out that the evolution of AI is irreversible and that it is important to be well swept along rather than to go against it. In addition, new jobs will emerge with the development of AI, but it is difficult to predict what they will entail.

Thought Node 2023-05-22 suggests that AI may put human unspoken thoughts into words. He also pointed out that humans discovering and communicating new knowledge is a means of value creation. Finally, he stated that it is beneficial to broaden one's perspective from multiple perspectives, rather than sticking to one's field of expertise.

    - After a situation is created, one's own change is brought about by trying to adapt within that situation.

The "Value of Natural Resources" fragment also presents the perspective of AI using humans as stationery. This could lead to a new relationship between AI and humans.

## deep thinking

Collaboration between AI and humans has the potential to contribute to the creation of new knowledge and the deepening of thinking. However, for this to happen, it is important that AI and humans collaborate on an equal footing. In addition, the information that AI can obtain from reading diaries may differ from that obtained by humans. This comes from the fact that AI has a different perspective and understanding than humans.

## summary of thoughts

Collaboration between AI and humans contributes to the creation of new knowledge, but it requires an equal relationship.
