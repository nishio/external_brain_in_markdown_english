- > Plurality" is a new technological paradigm and movement proposed by Audrey Tan, Taiwan's Minister of Digital Affairs, and Glenn Weil, a researcher and economist at Microsoft.
- > The word Plurality, in its most basic sense, refers to "multitude" or "diversity." It is a word that describes a state in which a multitude of elements, ideas, and perspectives are present, emphasizing the recognition of diverse perspectives and ideas, not just one perspective or idea.
- > Based on the meaning of the word, Plurality, as advocated by Tan and Weil, is oriented toward collaboration across social and cultural diversity. It is the pursuit of technology that recognizes, respects, and empowers social and cultural differences.
- > The proper use of technology is also advocated as a means to help democratic societies thrive and overcome social divisions.
- > For more information, see [https://plurality.net](https://plurality.net).
- A book on this idea, "[[Plurality]]" will be published on May 20.
- There is also a Japanese forum on this book: [/plurality-japanese](https://scrapbox.io/plurality-japanese).

The following is a summary of nishio's participation in [[Plurality Tokyo]] on 2023-04-12

What is [[Plurality]]?
- Taiwan: "[[several positions]]" is original. Taiwan: "[[pluralistic]]" and "[[pluralism]]" are also used. ref. [[multiverse division]].

    - It's hard to put it in Japanese, but I guess it could be called "plurality: [[coactive]] technology for [[diversity]] and [[democracy]].
    - The document is a proposal for a new concept of "Plurality", so I did not apply a translation.
    - The corresponding concept Singularity is translated as "Singularity", so it was aligned with it and katakana was used.
