- Don't aim to [Looks great as per Scrapbox
- Hard to keep up with changes on the Scrapbox side
:

```
  "image": null,
  "descriptions": [
    "What are we aiming for next?" ,
    "For the purpose of drawing a single figure, I've started using my own notebook app instead of the one I normally use.",.
    "[Almost no problem https://scrapbox.io/nishio/%E3%83%9F%E3%82%B9%E3%82%B3%E3%83%9F%E3%83%A5%E3%83%8B%E3%82%B1%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3% 83%B3%E3%81%AE%E4%B8%80%E4%BE%8B]",
    "A little cumbersome, the color change menu has text, [Picture copy and paste] is not there yet",.
    "Excellent, you can draw dotted lines, and it's saved in a vector format on the internet."
  ],
```

- Why not just display this in a natural way in Regroup?
