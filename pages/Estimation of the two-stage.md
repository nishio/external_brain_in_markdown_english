>  means (and has been interpreted to mean). .

>  But it is very difficult to prove that it was "of my own volition",
>  "This impression was made by this person's stamp being pressed."
>  If a person establishes that he or she has signed the document, it is presumed that he or she has signed it of his or her own volition (Supreme Court case).
