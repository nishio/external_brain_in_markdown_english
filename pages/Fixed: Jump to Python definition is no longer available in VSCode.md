title: "Fixed: Jump to Python definition is no longer available in VSCode"
---

I noticed that jumping to a definition in Python is no longer possible, which is inconvenient and troubling.

Once I uninstalled all Python related extensions, restarted VSCode, and then a dialog box came up saying that there was a recommended extension for Python, so I added that and it fixed the problem.

I don't want to do the experiment to determine the cause and break it again, so I won't do it, but I'll note the relevant information.
- I doubt that I put Pylance in there.

- I don't know the details anymore, but if the problem had happened right after I put it in, I would have noticed the quandary...
- I updated and restarted VSCode several times over the next while.
- I have periods when I am writing TypeScript and periods when I am writing Python, depending on what I am developing, so I am not likely to notice immediately if an update I made during the TypeScript period changes the Python behavior.
