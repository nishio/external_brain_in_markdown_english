[[natural]]" [[put into words]].
    - [[The obvious is a hypothesis]]
- It is only a hypothesis that "It's obvious, so it must be understood without saying so.
    - When you have a group of people who only think alike, you will have misunderstandings that you don't have to say.
    - People think in many different ways, so you have to say what you think to get your ideas across.
- By daring to write about things that you think are so obvious that they don't need to be written about, you will notice the omission of [[understanding]].
        - [[Dare to write the obvious]]
    - The output of writing validates one's understanding.
    - Writing enables [[critical thinking]] about what is written.
    - When you write it down and think about it critically, you realize after the fact that it wasn't as obvious as you thought it was.
    - [[Naturally is subjective]]
    - Suppose someone says, in response to a sentence, "It's obvious.
        - It was just "a concept that was already familiar to that person.
        - It means there's a high degree of consistency between the person's experience and that statement, so objectively speaking, it's positive.
    - On the other hand, if I'm supposed to think X about something, why am I going against it!" and get angry.
        - Observed facts suggest "not the norm."
        - It's only subjectively considered "natural".

conversely
- Bias to be "bizarre" by "trying to write something that is not the norm."
