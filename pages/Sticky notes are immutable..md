title: "Sticky notes are immutable."
---

    - Shouldn't [[sticky object]] be [[immutable]]?
- If stickies are used on more than one map, they can't be rewritten.
- There is only one real body of the sticky, which is referenced by the temporary bodies on each map.
        - [[real/fictitious person system]]
- Only the temporary body has the coordinates of the stickies and the affiliation map.
- Content is updated by referencing the entity, and a new entity is created.

In other words, there should be a "Reuse" button instead of an "Edit" button in the sticky's detail view
