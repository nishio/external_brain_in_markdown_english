- I've been having a lot of trouble lately trying to find things in my memory on the Internet.
    - I thought I could just remember the search terms, but no...

- Unable to recall concepts they should have known well
    - Symptoms similar to "I can't remember people's names" are magnified.
- Different words come out of your mouth than what you intended to say and you don't realize it.
    - Expanding the equivalent of misprints and typos
- I think I've seen something in the past that looks a lot like what I just saw, but I can't remember.
    - If I recall properly, it's not much like that, [[Cognitive Resolution]] drops and starts [[class with]] everything.

- I wrote this under the assumption that I remember the search terms, but <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>'s post makes me think it's some kind of aging phenomenon.
    - [[Deterioration of memory over time]] It's cool to call it that.
