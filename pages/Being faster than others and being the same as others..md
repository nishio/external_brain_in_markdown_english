title: "Being faster than others and being the same as others."
---

There are people A who value being faster than others.
- Be the first to buy new products

There are people B who find value in being the same as others.
- Read books that everyone else is reading.

A doesn't want to do "what everyone else is doing" because it's "not fast enough"
B is anxious because early action is "what everyone else hasn't done yet"

The two appear to be in conflict, but actually have something in common in that others are the basis for value judgments.
