    - [[Organize supporters]]

Producers and consumers of social institutions
- Made by.
    - People who are aware of their shortcomings.
        - Who improves it.
        - People who say it's all bad because of its flaws.

- 0: First, there is a gap between unfulfilled ideals and reality.
- 1: I'm going to fill this gap! and S will be made
- 2: Look at that.
    - A: Fill in more gaps by doing what is newly possible
    - B: Point out gaps that are newly filled
    - C: Point out the gap between the distant ideal that has yet to be filled
    - B and C are easily equated as "criticism of S", but there is a big difference because B leads to A while C does not

Information is replicated, so adding known information is of no value
- If it is known that C has not yet been done, then the point is moot.
When a new combination creates value, it is unlikely that the new combination can be performed without detailed knowledge of the target of the combination.

- [[Don't say, "Why isn't anyone doing it?" You're one of them.]]
- I think "don't say it" is too strong.
- Some people just don't have the capacity to fix it.
    - There's nothing wrong with people like that asking for help.
- People who have the power but do not use it.
    - This is also because "powerful" is subjective.
        - People who are unaware of their power.
        - People who don't realize what to use their power for.

- If you are a corporate executive, for example, you risk attacks on your business from opponents for expressing support for a particular candidate.

> [YoshifumiSeki](https://x.com/YoshifumiSeki/status/1804890227691098203) I've been walking around putting up posters, and I've enjoyed it very much as it's the first DX step against the legacy system of election campaigning.


I just wondered and searched for "unexplored" and "Governor".

> [kyasbal_1994](https://x.com/kyasbal_1994/status/1803666653739421882) An unexplored senior citizen ran as a candidate for Governor and I'm supporting him!

> [nztm_tw](https://x.com/nztm_tw/status/1803666653739421882) A great senior student of mine who has not yet stepped into the race is running for Governor of Tokyo, and his pledge was great and concrete. I didn't know much about digital democracy either, but it was a very good system and a proposal that gave me hope for politics as a young person. The idea of a children's center where children can be exposed to STEAM activities is so good, I hope it will be realized.

I was nervous, but now that I have a good example, it's easier to understand how it's going to go.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1806719434708713666) #Governor-election Hackathon This was my first attempt at a hackathon, and I just tagged the hackathon as something that volunteers were developing on their own, so it wasn't really structured. I'm just sending out the hackathon tag to the volunteers who are developing the hackathon on their own, so I haven't been able to create a structure yet.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1806734792312160378) Right now only one camp is doing it, so I'm working with that camp, but when multiple camps start doing it, I might create a "public goods team" or something that can be used by any camp. Maybe.

> [osawa](https://x.com/osawa/status/1806748709507752410) I wonder why Mr. Yasuno is going out of his way to avoid street speeches and hold them in halls. Maybe he wants people to listen to him more carefully, but I don't think he can compete by unnecessarily forming a closed support base. ......
>  Maybe he was never interested in winning or losing this time around.
Huh? Avoiding street speeches?

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1806761803458003305) I saw a factually incorrect comment about #Takahiro Yasuno's speech tomorrow at 10am at the hall, saying that he is avoiding street speeches, and I thought "that's not true". I looked it up and found that he had already made more than 20 street speeches and already had 10 more scheduled after the speech. It was more than I imagined, great guts. ......

You'd have to go back pretty far to find out how many times in the past, but it's easy to see from his and the office's tweets that there will be town halls on Saturdays and Sundays.
They have no desire to look closely, they just want to attack.
