title: "Exploratory Tasks and Kanban Boards"

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I think using kanban boards in exploratory tasks in a fast changing world is misleading.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>[[Kanban boards]] are effective in [[repetitive tasks]] with a [[clear workflow]], but in [[exploratory tasks]], requirements and policies change from moment to moment, and a fixed board tends to limit thinking and ideas instead. In areas where there are many unknowns, it is better not to delineate the work process too clearly, as this allows for flexible and quick changes in direction, which may result in greater efficiency and results.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Think about and propose a task management method for such a situation.

Suggestion 1: Repeat hypothesis testing in short cycles.
- Set small validation goals in 1-2 week increments and immediately revise direction based on experimental results
- Share and record "what was learned and verified" rather than tasks

Proposal 2: Focus on "visualization" of goals and constraints
- Maintain common understanding by posting objectives, constraints, and success indicators, rather than task status management as in traditional kanban
- Strict column separation is minimal, as status is fluidly changing

Suggestion 3: Try multiple approaches in parallel.
- Multiple proposals at the same time, narrowing down unnecessary directions early on.
- Keep progress to a checklist-like "done/not done" level, and do not pursue too much.

Suggestion 4: Provide regular opportunities for reflection.
- Reflect on "what went well/what didn't go well" on a regular basis, such as once a week.
- Put in place a system that allows immediate reflection of lessons learned in the next sprint.

These methods focus on creating mechanisms to respond quickly to the uncertainties of the exploratory phase. It is important not to focus too much on task management, but to devote energy to the process of sharing the hypothesis testing cycle and the learning gained.

I think the direction is very good. Now that it is being handled by Nishio's personal ad hoc handlers, some balls will fall off, and some will already fall off and I think are important but I can't afford to pick up because I can't afford to pick them up. What should we do about this?
