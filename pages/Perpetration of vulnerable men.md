title: "Perpetration of vulnerable men"

[[Aggravating nature]] of [[vulnerable male]].

> [jiro6663](https://x.com/jiro6663/status/1798203877059448864) By the way, yesterday I was giving a lecture to a student in my laboratory on the subtle nuances of so-called "young people's language," and it was interesting to hear him talk about the nuances of "yotomo. It was interesting to hear about the nuance of "yo-yu" and how "chi-yu" is a word that refers to a category of vulnerable men, but the nuance is becoming different when men use it and when women use it.

However, for women, the emphasis is becoming more on the aggressiveness than the weakness, as "men who are not accustomed to women and therefore cause trouble".

It will become more and more important in the future, and it is also interesting to see the process of "hijacking" of words that were originally sent out by men to raise issues in search of relief.

When you hear about male aggressiveness, most men may think of the behavior of macho, athletic and rear-oriented men, but from a woman's point of view, that is the kind of aggressiveness that is present in the so-called shady or non-relevant men.

> [Sasami_Sasami](https://x.com/Sasami_Sasami/status/1798330359865884688) We are observing the moment when a word that is merely a name when used by the parties concerned takes on discriminatory nuances and will eventually be designated as a banned term.
