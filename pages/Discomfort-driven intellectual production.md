Discomfort-driven intellectual production is the process of verbalizing what has not yet been verbalized and aims to increase the value of ideas.

- Discrepancy-driven intellectual production refers to the process of increasing the value of an idea. Intellectual productivity depends on the value of the end product, but there is a time delay before that value becomes apparent, so the focus is on the productivity of the process. Ideas are replicable resources, and ideas that are identical to existing ideas or that do not generate enthusiasm themselves are of low value. Ideas are valuable when they are nurtured and refined by investing effort. It is important to create and continue this "good state".

Intellectual productivity is the process of increasing the value of an idea, and since that value has a time lag, we focus on the productivity of the process. Ideas are replicable resources, and ideas that are identical to existing ideas or that do not generate enthusiasm themselves are of low value. Ideas are valuable when they are nurtured and refined by investing effort. It is important to create and sustain a "state of goodness."

Intellectual production is a creative process that combines information and ideas to produce new knowledge and output, the quality of which is largely determined by individual experience and expertise. Depending on whether one is aware of the problem and tries to improve the process, or whether one tries to do as one is told, what appears to be the same job may or may not be intellectual production.

Nishio's research notes reaffirmed that the most important objective is to "create a state of high intellectual productivity," that ideas are a resource that can be replicated, that creating something identical to an already existing idea is of little value, and that ideas can only be valuable after they are created and then nurtured and refined with a lot of effort. The workshop reaffirmed that ideas are only valuable when they are nurtured and refined with a lot of effort after they are born.

Q: What factors are important for intellectual productivity? And how can we make use of these elements?

Intellectual production is a creative process that combines information and ideas to produce new knowledge and output, with results obtained depending on the research method and approach. Its quality is largely determined by personal experience and expertise, and its content can be tailored to the needs and interests of the target audience.

Intellectual production may look like the same job, but it may or may not be intellectual production, depending on whether you are aware of the problem and try to improve the process, or whether you try to do as you are told. Without an awareness of the problem, it is possible to get the job done by simply tracing the methods given to you. Even if the same work is given to you, it is important to devise a way to use the time to invest in yourself and to expand and reproduce the work.
