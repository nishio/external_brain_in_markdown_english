[[Alienware]]
- I don't remember when I bought it, but there's at least an email of support from 2018, which is a long time ago.
- I bought a [[galleria]] at Dospara at random because I'm not particularly particular about it.

- Today is a Saturday with nothing scheduled.
    - Nice!<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/taktamur/icon' alt='/villagepump/taktamur.icon' height="19.5"/>
- I woke up to find a huge box delivered to my front door, what's this?
    - Yay, a new gaming PC!
    - I haven't felt like Santa's present in a long time.
- I was going to put the gaming PC behind the TV and stack the back of the TV on top, but then I realized that would block the top exhaust.
- We have no choice but to do a major renovation.
    - If they're in a half-assed state, they're useless and leave the room cluttered.
- The gaming PC was successfully connected and the complex cables were restored to their original state.
    - But they kicked out where the bookshelves used to be and put in a PC, so the room is in serious trouble.
- I would like to take this opportunity to refactor the room!
    - It's getting more interesting than the game.
    - I know it's funny.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
- If the room is not in a decent state for dinner by the time dinner is served, my wife will be in a bad mood.
- I'm tired of making sure the game runs fine on my gaming PC, so I'm done.
    - I don't have the energy to play the game.
- I feel so tired.
    - I blame it on the physical moving of the bookshelves and the decision making with a time limit.
- The [[gaming mouse]] had a [[resolution-switching button]], interesting.
    - It could be interpreted as a 1~4x acceleration.
- Unfortunately, I tried connecting [[XREAL One]] to the USB-C port, but it didn't work.
    - No video signal.
        - [Not USB Type-C with DisplayPort Alt mode available
        - The DisplayPort itself is on the back, so I wonder if I can use it if I connect it with [https://amzn.to/46IMRmi](https://amzn.to/46IMRmi) like this.
- It's been years since I've had a desktop machine at home, maybe more than 10 years.
    - During my master's program, I used a desktop and a Thinkpad, and when I wanted to continue my implementation in the lab, the latest code was only on the desktop.
    - I don't think I've bought a new desktop since that time, so that would be almost 20 years.
    - Not that I haven't used desktops, of course, since I got a job and had a desktop machine at work.

Can be run without Satisfactory problems
- Saved data was also online with Steam cloud save.

Can run Minecraft without problems
- You can play single-player with the Java version.
- I need to find out how to build a server to play multiplayer with my wife.
- I'm too lazy to do it on my own, so I think I'll just pay for Microsoft's Realm to solve the problem.

I've been using a [[thumb trackball]] for a long time, so I'm trying to see if I can adapt to a mouse.
