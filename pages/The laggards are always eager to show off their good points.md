[[Paris Olympics]]

Isn't this history considered a national disgrace?" [[Shinichi Hoshi]] commented, "There is a bar in Paris that is a medieval dungeon, complete with torture devices. There is even a guillotine. These are the ugly parts of the past history and are a national disgrace for them, but they don't want to be afraid to stand up for themselves because they don't live in an underdeveloped country. Foreign tourists are happy. Perhaps it is because of our backwardness that we do not like to show up and show foreigners our past history which we find ugly. I am reminded of the saying, "The more backward you are, the more you want to show off your good points.
>  "[[A Natural History of Whimsy]]. It's a book from 1968. It's amazing. Shinichi Hoshi.
