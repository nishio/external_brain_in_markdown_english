Notes while looking at the latest unpublished data

---
With regard to energy, political funding, and social security, which were roughly divided into two parts, even though they are the same two parts, energy has political parties at both ends covering the axis of conflict, social security has public opinion scattered over a wider area than the parties cover, and political funding is kind of a diagonal axis of conflict from the lower left corner and the upper left corner is "not on that axis. It's not that axis." there's going to be a lot of people who are like, "No, it's not that axis.

If you want to make this bisection interesting by technical means, it might be interesting to force the number of clusters to be divided by 10 or something, while keeping the orientation of the projection fixed...

This idea reminded me of [[UMAP visibility for the 2022 Upper House election]], which was pending.

All six poll maps have over 1,000 votes.
I was concerned that more votes would converge on the dichotomy.
In fact, three cases were dichotomous, three were more than that, and were resolved negatively by the data.
Maybe this means that even if the opinion distribution is ultimately dichotomous, it can break up into fine clusters during the ~100 or so cases, and when it does break up into fine clusters, the impression is so strong that when it finally disappears, the disappointment that it has become a dichotomy is stronger.

As for the three ways of dichotomies, it is interesting because in addition to that, the plotting of the party data shows "where the parties are positioned in the largely dichotomous public opinion", the three ways of dichotomies

I was looking at the latest unpublished screen with about 1000 data points each of the public opinion maps, 3 of 6 (energy, political funding, social security) are split in two - I thought.
Even though it's the same two divisions, energy has parties on both ends, covering opposing sides,
Social Security is scattered over a wider range of public opinion than the parties cover,
Political funding is kind of a diagonal axis of opposition from the bottom left corner, and there's a lot of people in the upper left corner who are like, "It's not that axis.
I think I can pull out some interesting information...
