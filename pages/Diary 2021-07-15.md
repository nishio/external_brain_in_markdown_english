- That's typical of [[systems thinking]]'s "systems with time delays are hard to understand" talk.
At the time of the lifting of the state of emergency declaration on June 20, the number of executing reproductions was over one times the number of infected people per day, and "even at this rate, the number of infected people per day would increase," and since it was lifted in that state, it was easily foreseeable to anyone used to systems thinking that this would happen with a few weeks delay.
There are many people in the world who say, "Over 1,000 people! Surprise!" I have a feeling that the world's level of understanding of the world is just like that.
I'll continue to live my life as a recluse and develop software, but I'm not sure what to think about it.
