title: "Focusing on the individual subdivides the group."

> If we focus on "[[counter for the ichi-ni-san counting system (usu. directly preceding the item being counted)]]", the "[[group]]" is further [[subdivided]], or sometimes the segment is mislabeled. In other words, the "group" segmentation is limited, so we need to look at the "individual" segment.

I think the reason is that "we marketers face customers by segmenting them into "groups", and when we focus on "individuals", the "groups" are further subdivided, sometimes the segment labels themselves are wrong, and in short, we have to look at "individuals" because of the limitations of the "group" segmentation." A "group" is what we call a "segment".

If we look closely, we can see that the needs are slightly different, but with digital we can communicate in more detail: one communication (creative) for the needs of 10 people, and there are 10,000 different ways this mass can be achieved... and so on, with digital and AI.

>  However, as we move from the group to the individual, from the macro to the micro level, the traditional "group" approach to understanding customers becomes less and less effective, and the customer becomes more and more confused about his or her needs. As shown in the illustration, when we interviewed customers about pet food, we found that they have the desire to "protect their beloved dogs until the end of their lives," but their behavior is changing. We believe that this is the limit of looking at "groups" and that it is important to "go to see each person individually" in order to prevent "misunderstanding of needs unless we face them properly.

For example, "Donbei tastes better if you let it sit for 10 minutes," "Industrial masking tape is cute," and "Beer tastes better if it is chilled in the freezer. When people enthusiastically support the behavior of consumers who engage in "strange and unusual behavior," it can become a need in and of itself.

>  Extreme users are characterized by the fact that they "solve jobs through uses not envisioned by the manufacturer" and "use the value provided by the product or service for a different purpose. Therefore, there are very few Extreme Users, only one or two.
>
>  However, there is a background or reason for the unusual behavior. Desire. Because behavior is always driven by desire. Instead of looking at the behavior, look at the desire. If you look at desires, you may find that they are "surprisingly ordinary," or you may actually feel that they are "desires with universal value. And "desires with universal value" may be supported by many.
>
>  In other words, it is quite possible that by implementing a value or benefit that was not considered by the manufacturer and was perceived by a small number of consumers, a large number of consumers who find it "new" will purchase it again (and purchase it more frequently). (2/n)
