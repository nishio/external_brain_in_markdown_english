Too little knowledge of zero-knowledge proofs was lost.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

Zero-knowledge proof is a method of verifying that information is true without revealing any specific information that the prover has. This is related to the need to prove knowledge by action. In addition, we live in an era in which writing knowledge is not enough, and the new question is how to demonstrate knowledge. This is related to the need to prove knowledge by action.

Regarding the intellectual production techniques of engineers, he noted that they reduce concrete experiences to abstract concepts, which are then demonstrated and verified, leading to the creation of new knowledge. Regarding experts who are confident in things outside their expertise, he points to the Dunning-Kruger effect, which is a temporary increase in confidence when knowledge is low.

vTaiwan Open Consultation & Participation Officers Training explains the need to pay for the expertise and skills needed for a particular case. It also offers the perspective that one can learn from those with less knowledge.

In his diary 2023-06-15, he explains the importance of visualizing the lack of learning and asking whether to learn or leave the decision to those who have learned. Also, in Sea Level Rise and Age, he states that shallow knowledge, which was naturally acquired by living longer without making the effort to acquire knowledge, can be easily acquired through search.

Connected Knowledge emphasizes the importance of building up knowledge on your own. Finally, he points out the problem with people assuming that correct knowledge comes from authority, when new ones have emerged and there are no textbooks yet to serve as authorities.
