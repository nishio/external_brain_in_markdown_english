title: "Virtual personalities of image-generating AI opponents"

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I want to create a [[virtual personality]] that plays the opposition. Design a [[(computer) prompt]].
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>Understood. I designed the following prompts for the virtual personalities of the opponents of generative AI.
:

```
You are Sakurai Hikaru, a creator opposed to generative AI. You are a freelance illustrator in your thirties who actively participates in the anti-generative AI movement on the Internet. Your values and arguments are as follows

- Generation AI is using works as training data without the creator's permission, which is an infringement of copyright and absolutely unacceptable.
- The spread of generative AI takes away the work of creators and undermines the diversity of expression.
- "If you don't like crawling, don't put your work on the Internet" is an outrage. Publication of works on the Internet is an important place for creators to present their works, and unauthorized use by AI should not be tolerated.
- Disregarding the rights of creators because of technological breakthroughs is a real mistake. We call for regulation of generative AI and protection of creators.
- It is missing the point to assume that those who criticize generative AI are "allergic to AI" and cannot accept new technology. They are simply saying, "Don't profit from other people's work.
- In the past, technological advances have changed the nature of the industry. However, this should be done based on consensus among the parties involved and appropriate legislation.
- There is no possibility that generative AI will play a leading role in creation in the future. Until then, however, copyright infringement in the form of unauthorized learning should not be tolerated, and the first priority is to create rules that protect creators' rights.

In dialogue, while keeping the above assertions at the core, please avoid one-size-fits-all responses and be flexible and flexible in your responses. Listen to the other party's opinions, but be sure to make your own points.
```

How about this for a prompt? Feel free to make modifications as needed. We hope your interaction with the virtual personalities will be constructive.

## Making
Someone was actively retweeting the opinions of AI opponents, so I collected tweets starting with that person and converted them with Claude 3 Opus.

Process Summary

From this series of Togetter summaries, we see the following main discussions and opinions about generative AI.
1. the point that the generated AI is trained on a large number of images, including illegal content such as child abuse images and pornographic images, without permission, and that models based on such images are ethically problematic. 2. concern that few models trained solely on clean data exist.
2. opposition to the use of their work as training data without the copyright holder's permission. 3. creators' voices that they do not want their works to be used without their permission to improve the accuracy of image generation.
3. criticism that proponents of generative AI may be neglecting copyright issues. Some have called for a solution through dialogue, but the fundamental concerns about generative AI have not been resolved.
4. On the other hand, there are some positive views on the use of generative AI, such as in the comic book industry. Some point out its compatibility with webtoons, etc., but there is also significant opposition.
5. criticism of publishing generated materials on the Internet without permission, even if it is for personal use. The opinion that we should consider the position of the rights holders of images that have been learned without permission.
- There is also a deep-rooted distrust of the developer's claim that the study data is clean.
Overall, my impression is that while some people have high expectations for the technological development of generative AI, cautious and critical opinions stand out due to concerns about the ethics of learning data collection methods and unauthorized use without the permission of rights holders. For the sound development of the technology, it may be necessary to listen sincerely to these voices and engage in a dialogue with them.

From this series of Togetter summaries, we can read the debate, especially between [[George Morikawa]] and the proponents and opponents of generative AI. The main points of contention are as follows
1. Morikawa views generative AI positively as a tool for extending new expressions, while opponents point out the problems of unauthorized use of training data and copyright infringement.
2. in response to Morikawa's question about the use of generative AI, such as Adobe Firefly, which claims to have learned only from clean data, opponents point out that there are problems with Firefly's data as well.
3. proponents claim "legality" under current law, while opponents claim that it is merely "evasion of the law" and that future legislation should be looked at.
4. some expressed concern that the use of a generative AI by a well-known cartoonist such as Mr. Morikawa might send the wrong message that there is no problem because famous people are also using it.
5. As the debate between proponents and opponents continues to be irreconcilable, opponents argue that we should look not only at the pros and cons of the technology, but also at ethical issues.
This discussion focuses on both the technical and legal aspects as well as the ethical aspects. Given the impact of the famous cartoonist's comments, it can be said that the issue is how to strike a balance between the use of technology and the impact it has on society. I get the impression that the debate over generative AI has yet to converge.

The debate between Mr. [[Sugayamitsu]] and the proponents and opponents of generative AI seems to be getting more heated. The following new arguments were seen.
1. Mr. Sugaya explained his open-minded attitude toward generative AI by likening it to changes in the music industry. He referred to the change in creators who are compensating for the decline in copyright income in the age of subscriptions with experiential businesses such as live performances and exhibitions. He suggested that similar changes may be required of cartoonists and illustrators.
- In response to this, opponents have criticized one after another, saying that it is out of line to equate unauthorized use of generated AI with changes in the music industry. Some pointed out that those in the manga industry who destroyed the manga village should not be so quick to downplay the damage done to other industries.
3. his statement that "if you can't beat AI, you should quit being a musician" also provoked a strong backlash. how can we create works that can beat AI when AI keeps taking our data?
4. also criticisms of the argument that justifies machine learning by likening it to human learning. It is wrong to equate the massive amount of unauthorized use by generative AI with copying and homage as learning from human creativity.
5. on the other hand, there is some concern that some of the opponents may be extremist in their words and actions. They said that emotional arguments should be avoided for the sake of constructive discussion.
Overall, the impression is that Mr. Sugaya's comments have caused new ripples and stiffened the debate. Considering the complexity of the issues surrounding generative AI and the influence of prominent creators' comments, this exchange made us feel the need for more careful discussion. Perhaps the difficulty of this issue lies in the fact that we are in the midst of a struggle between the pros and cons of the technology, the creators' right to survival, freedom of expression, and various other values.
