title: "One-dimensional cheating reading"
---

- If we compare reading [[slurping]] in one dimension to "Eating without chewing and swallowing," we can say, "It is better to eat nutritious food [[chewing and digestion]] than to gulp down [[gulp down without chewing]] a lot of food," and it will make sense. Chewing and Digestion] is better than [[gulping down without chewing]] a lot of food.
- They don't teach us how to read in school to structure knowledge inside ourselves. On the contrary, some poor people are forced to practice "putting somen in their mouth and spitting it out immediately," like reading a novel aloud.
