title: "self-proclaimed sapience"
---

- I came up with a derogatory term to make fun of [[Homo sapiens]].
- Nuance like, "He calls himself a smart guy."
- Sapience = smart

- [[throwing one's weight around in a small group without knowing one's real worth in a larger world]]
- > Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty wanted to conquer Nanyue State in the southern region. As a first step, he sent envoys to the neighboring provinces of Nanyue and Yalu.
- >  The kings of 滇国 and Yarrow Province asked the envoys from the Han Dynasty about their respective countries.
- >  "Which is greater, Han or our country?"
- >  Of course, the Han Dynasty was more powerful. Both the 滇王 and 夜郎王 were too ignorant about the situation outside the country.
- >  From here, people who are naive and overbearing are called "yoro-jidai" (yoro, to make oneself great). --- [[A dictionary of four-character phrases]] [What is yoro-jidai - Kotobank](https://kotobank.jp/word/%E5%A4%9C%E9%83%8E%E8%87%AA%E5%A4%A7-649952)
