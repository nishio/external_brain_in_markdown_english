title: "Mentoring that does not undermine spontaneity"
---

When doing technical [mentoring
Discussion of design policy
There is no right answer.
Tend to make claims based on experiences that are not clearly verbalized.
Unable to determine if advice is correct.
If there is a disparity in age, it is not an equal discussion.
- [[authoritarian gradient]]
It is counterproductive to let age or authority be the reason for being right.
- [[spontaneity]] is not compromised.
Focus on specific technical knowledge that is objectively correct
Should I not speak up regarding design policy?
