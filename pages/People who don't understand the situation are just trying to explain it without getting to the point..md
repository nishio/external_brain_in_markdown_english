<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Clear and effective communication is critical when dealing with complex situations. If the other party is explaining something that is not to the point, try the following approach

- [Be specific: Asking specific questions can help the person organize the information and focus on the necessary areas. For example, "What part of the process takes the most time?" or "What are the main challenges to this issue?" are helpful.
- [Organize information step-by-step: If you have a wide range of information, it is effective to understand it step-by-step. It is best to go through each point one at a time, rather than trying to understand everything at once.
- [Use visual aids: Visualizing information using diagrams and tables can help facilitate understanding. One way to do this is to ask the other person to illustrate the data or process.
- [Ask for a summary: Ask for a summary at the end of the talk to confirm your understanding of the information shared. This gives you the opportunity to correct any misunderstandings immediately.
- [Provide feedback proactively: If you feel that an explanation is unclear, it is important to communicate this calmly and ask for more clarification. Feedback should be constructive, and it is effective to provide specific pointers to help the person improve.

Through these approaches, you can improve communication with others while helping them to understand information clearly.
