title: "People who think they know."
---

There are people who naturally accept that "there are things in the world that I don't know."
- When you feel something is not right, you naturally think, "Isn't the cause of this discomfort due to something I don't know?" I naturally think, "Is there something I don't know that is causing this discomfort?

Some people feel like they "know everything."
- Once in this state, it becomes difficult to get out.
- That's because if other people know something that "person X who [[thinks one knows]] everything" doesn't know, they don't try to point it out to X.
