title: "Media and platforms"
---

A term used by [[Audrey Tang]] to refer to herself.

- [The word "media" was originally intended as a medium for information transmission, but it has somehow become a nuanced term that suggests the creation and dissemination of information, rather than merely a medium for information.
- This can be interpreted as centralized or monopolized information dissemination.
- In response, use cases have emerged in which social networking sites such as Twitter are used as "[[social media]]", especially in countries that do not have a [[free press]].
- This is "[[de-centralization of information dissemination]]" and "[[democratization of information dissemination]]."
        - [[Everyone is a member of the media]]
- Based on this, we need to go one step further and create a "[[platform]]" for people to disseminate information and engage in [[careful deliberation]].
- Social networking sites are not designed for deliberation, so more platforms are needed
- As its [[concierge-type MVP]], Audrey appears to be using itself as a platform
- When you bring a story to Audrey, there is a high likelihood that a new bond will occur, and when that happens, more people will bring stories in anticipation of the benefits, and the probability of a new bond is increased when a wide range of information is gathered.
