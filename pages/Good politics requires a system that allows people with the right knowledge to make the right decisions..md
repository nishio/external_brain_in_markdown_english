In other words, we can literally listen to the voices of the people of Tokyo and reflect them back to them. In other words, it can literally listen to and reflect the voices of the people of Tokyo." --- [Audrey Tan's "genius AI engineer" in the Tokyo gubernatorial race | Courier Japon](https://courrier.jp/news/archives/367639/)

>  I think the root of the problem in politics today is not that people don't understand the word "politics" or that they don't listen to the voices of the people, but that they don't put the above into practice.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1802894410486784219) I agree with [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1802894410486784219) "I think good politics requires the establishment of a system that allows people with the right knowledge to make the right decisions" to make the lives of its citizens better. What is "correct knowledge" is [[raw facts from the citizens' perspective]]. The current pubic commenting mechanism is not collecting them well, so a better mechanism is needed
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1802895270541414743) "It is a raw fact from a citizen's perspective" was not a good idea because it could be interpreted as "that's all", the intent is that "raw facts from a citizen's perspective are also necessary"

> [tmu777](https://x.com/tmu777/status/1802899586752917955) I agree!
