Allies for Beginners
![image](https://gyazo.com/c6660ce322b9b60e4224c401bd8db914/thumb/1000)
The effect of the alliance is a workshop with 2 Favers. if there is a way to earn Favers, I wonder if a workshop garden is possible.
Maybe he's a mediator and destroys the deception.

- Oh, no, it's not compatible with the garden due to the relationship between destroying it and creating friendship.

- Strong when the vassal chain is connected.
    - It's hard to dispose of the initial deck with a mediator.
    - AI has come a long way.
    - Need more action in the capital.
    - Sailing to gain more turns
    - If you want to get an additive chain, you don't buy treasures, but that makes it hard to put in a 5-cost card.
        - Coin the destruction of the intermediary.
    - Acquisition of 5-cost cards in undersea treasures

- First hand, intermediary, and deception.
- Acquire a mediator, destroy the sesame and coin it, and capital
    - That's a good start.
- Would you rather draw on a map than have three mediators? Destroy the mansion and buy the capital
- voyage
- pioneer

Winning the game by scoring 27 points in one turn against a 21-point opponent.
- Bought 2 gardens 2 copper coins 3 in Gushu.
- (Well, the score difference was 3 points, so I could have won simply by buying two genshu.)

looking back
- Basically a vassal chain
- To achieve this, the action ratio needs to be high, but the only discarded card is the mediator, so what to do about this situation
- First move: Sesame Street, mediator. Gain a mediator through the power of alliances.
- After 2 rounds
    - When the mediator destroys the mansion or the sesame seed, he changes it to coins and takes the 5-cost capital.
    - Draw with old maps, increasing the probability that intermediaries will overlap with discarded material.
    - Precursor if there is nothing else to buy for 3 coins.
    - Buy undersea treasures and acquire capitals and markets.
    - Once we have enough room for action, we will increase the number of vassals.
        - The terminal action, mediators and renovations, are not actively included.
        - Should I not buy sesame seeds because of the possibility of an outburst in the vassal?
            - Vassals can choose to use it or not.

AI also does Distant Shore and Garden.

I think you have to play a lot to converge, but with random matching, it's a bit more subtle because it takes longer depending on who you're playing with...
