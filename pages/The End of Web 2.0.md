> [@masanork](https://twitter.com/masanork/status/1655727102073905155?s=20): Twitter's API ecosystem is broken and this and that service has stopped. It looks like the beginning of the end of Web 2.0. After that, it will be a world of web 3 distributed in countless Wallets, or Metamask will be the sole winner, or it will be an oligopoly of Web 2.0, where Apple Google will eventually take over the management of smartphone keys....

> [@takiuchi](https://twitter.com/takiuchi/status/1655739045467807745?s=20): the reality in most cases is that they just haven't been able to migrate from API v1.1 to v2, so it probably stopped at v1.1 a long time ago. I think it was probably stuck in v1.1 for a long time, and the developers are no longer in charge of the development.

I'll look back on it after a year.
