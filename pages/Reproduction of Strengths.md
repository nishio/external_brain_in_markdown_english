- > The strengths we had in 2015 when we launched "CloudSign" and the strengths we have at this time are very different. In other words, the strengths we have at the moment will be almost gone in three years. Our challenge is how to continue to reproduce our unique strengths. Naturally, given the competitive environment, we need to create a scalable system that allows us to continue reproducing our strengths as an organization, not as individuals. CloudSign must continue to be a service that can continue to solve customer problems.

When we create something new, we often hear people say, "That's not a strength/differentiation because it will be taken away from the competition," but it is still an intrinsic value to be able to run ahead of the competition until they follow suit. It is an illusion to say that strength/differentiation is something that will last forever, and that strength is something that is constantly being produced anew.
