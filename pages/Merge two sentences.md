A story about merging two sentences
- I used the chop to pieces and then merge method.
- But then I thought, "Couldn't I do this with GPT-4?" I tried it and it worked easily.
- GPT-4 did the "why don't you add this keyword?" GPT-4 did the work for me.
- So, first of all, the perception that this kind of work is expensive is wrong, and secondly, the way to make it even less expensive was to chop it into pieces and arrange them two-dimensionally, but now LLM has made it even less expensive.

I was not sure if I could find a concrete methodology, and it might seem like a costly task to most people. I, of course, fragmented it with my first move [[Kozaneba]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1669714475447115776) There was a Tweet about people who "just look at it" and "move their hands" in front of a math problem, but it's the same thing about producing writing, Don't look at it, just move your hands. But no one will teach you how to do it, so only those who have mastered it themselves will do it.
