Knowledge areas will increase.
Sometimes entirely new areas are added, but often new areas are created within existing areas.

With respect to this new area, one can make inferences using knowledge in the area that is close to one's own. Therefore, they can catch up efficiently.
However, leaving it too long will not compensate for the use of guesswork.
