title: "constructive"
---

- Group work without [[Jun Kuikei]] [[who is not constructive]] is more efficient because each member shares roles and there is no split loss of work. (Constructive, because they are in the same place but split into independent work.)
If someone is not constructive, it is more efficient to do it alone.
By the way, constructiveness has nothing to do with how smart you are, you don't need someone with a clever [[critic]] temperament, and you don't need someone who is not very learned, but can take the initiative.

Nishio Hirokazu How can we improve [[constructiveness]]?

Jun KUIKEI: Generally, people who are not constructive are those who have a high "desire for approval" but low ability in the area they want to be recognized in and who neglect to make efforts in that area, or those who are in an inappropriate position but do not want their "unworthiness of the position" to be exposed. I think it's important to destroy these incentives, because there is an incentive to short-circuit, to try to stand out, to delay.

Nishio Hirokazu Very specific! I'll make a note of it üìù.
