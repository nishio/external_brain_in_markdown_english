<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The following is a summary of the response to the Forkwell Library event on Twitter.
- Many participants were so impressed with the content of Nishio's presentation that they felt compelled to re-read "The Intellectual Production of Engineers.
- The knowledge network building function of Scrapbox (now Cosense) attracted a lot of attention, and many expressed interest in utilizing it.
- There is growing interest in experimenting with intellectual production using LLM (e.g., linking his Scrapbox and ChatGPT, using LLM for project management, etc.).
- Comments were received that Mr. Nishio's [[enjoyable attitude]] toward intellectual production using LLM was impressive.
- Discussions were held on the possibility that the development of LLM will change the way of [[knowledge sharing]] and [[round-reading meetings]].
- The participants shared the recognition that although it is difficult to predict 10 years from now, it is important to focus on what LLMs cannot do and to adapt while observing changes.
- During the event, participants were observed collaboratively editing Scrapbox and taking notes in real time, creating a form of multi-person, synchronous learning.
- Concerns about LLM's ability to summarize and the importance of using AI as a third-party perspective were also discussed.
Overall, the content of Nishio's presentation was very well received on Twitter, indicating that there was a lively discussion about the possibilities of new intellectual production using LLM.


> Participants collaboratively editing and taking notes in Scrapbox in real time
- The "well-wishers" of the Scrapbox community have created a page behind the scenes as I speak, so I thought I'd share it with you. This community is open to everyone!
    - Shared Note: [/villagepump/intellectual-productivity-of-engineers-using-LLM](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/intellectual-productivity-of-engineers-using-LLM)
- This is an example of "the true value of Cosense, which is truly effective when used by multiple people." By having multiple people listen to the same lecture synchronously and take notes by jointly editing, a cooperative form of learning is realized. Then, asynchronously, the speaker adds comments to enhance the value of the lecture.
