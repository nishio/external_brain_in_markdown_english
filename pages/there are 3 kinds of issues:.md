title: "there are 3 kinds of issues:"
---

from [[pIntEn]]
there are 3 kinds of issues:
- Semantic issues: you find it difficult to understand.
- Grammatical issues: you understand the meaning but the syntax is not correct.
- Style issues: you understand the meaning and the syntax is correct, but you think it is not a natural expression.

You reported all kinds of issues. It is OK. But, I want to process the semantic issues with high priority. Due to there are a lot of style issues, I feel difficult to find the semantic issues. Could you please notify me those semantic issues on this chat?
