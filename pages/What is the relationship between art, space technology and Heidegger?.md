In Heidegger's philosophy, art and **cosmic art (cosmos techne)** are deeply related in ontology and technological theory. He specifically viewed art and technology as disclosures of the truth of existence (Aletheia), which he argued had a fundamental meaning distinct from that of modern technology (techne).

This relationship is explained below.

1. the truth of art and existence (Aletheia)
Heidegger saw art not as mere aesthetic expression, but as an act of disclosing the truth of existence.

(1) "The Origin of the Work of Art"
In this work, Heidegger discusses art as "the place where the truth of being is opened.

A work of art is formed by two elements

Earth (Erde): hidden, unexplored nature, material.
World (Welt): constructs meaning and order and appears as meaningful to humans.
It is in this tension between the "earth" and the "world" that art makes the essence of existence manifest.

(2) Role of art
The work of art provides a place of disclosure, where presence (Sein) is revealed to us, even if only for a moment.
Example: the Greek temple (Heidegger's example) functions as a place of disclosure of the sacred or order beyond its physical presence.
2. cosmic art (cosmos-like techne)
Heidegger discussed the concept of technology (technē) in relation to the ancient Greek "craft" or "technical knowledge.

(1) Ancient Greek view of technology
In ancient Greece, technē was not just a mechanical task, but a way of disclosing existence.
Fusion of Art and Technology:.
Technē was a concept that included both art (ars) and technology and functioned as a synthesis of the aesthetic and the practical.
(2) Cosmological perspective
Heidegger emphasized that ancient Greek technology was in harmony with the cosmic (kosmos) order and that humans existed as part of nature.
Technology was in harmony with existence (Sein) and served to "disclose" rather than "expose" it.
Contrast with modern technology
Heidegger criticized modern technology for losing this "disclosure of existence" role and treating nature as a mere resource (Bestand).

(1) Transformation of Essence
With modern technology, technology has been transformed not into a disclosure of existence but into a means of controlling and efficiently utilizing nature.
Nature is reduced to instrumental value as a "provoked being" (Ge-stell).
(2) Positioning of art
For Heidegger, art is a form of disclosure of existence in opposition to modern technology.
Art has the potential to re-disclose the truths of existence that modern technology has obscured.
4. relationship between space technology and art
(1) Harmony between nature and mankind
Ancient Greek technē (cosmic art) emphasized harmony with nature and respect for the essence of existence.
Heidegger believed that art could carry on this ancient tradition of craftsmanship and serve to awaken us from the "forgetfulness of existence" of the modern age.
(2) Cosmic perspective
Cosmic artistry discloses existence in a way that mimics and responds to nature and the cosmic order.
Art also serves as a symbolic means of expressing cosmic order and truth.
5. contemporary significance of art and space technology
An example of the application of Heidegger's ideas in modern society:

(1) Environmental problems and technological criticism
While modern technology continues to consume nature as a resource, art and traditional techniques can be a means of restoring harmony with nature.
(2) Restorative role of art
In the midst of the development of digital technology, art provides a venue for humans to once again question the meaning of the senses and existence.
Example: Sustainable design and installation art explore new relationships between nature and technology.
6. conclusion
For Heidegger, art and cosmic craft are deeply connected as acts that disclose the truth of existence. Art is the inheritor of the ancient Greek tradition of craftsmanship, with the potential to restore harmony with nature and to disclose again the essence of existence that modern technology has forgotten. This idea has important implications for contemporary environmental issues and digital society.
