title: 'Should be able to" and "would be nice to'
---

- [[ought to be able to]]" and "[I hope you can.
- "[[ought to be]]" and "[[(after neg. verb stem) ought to (verb)]]"
- [[ought to do]]" and "[[had better ...]]" ."

I sometimes use "[[must]]" for some reason.
Is it really a "should"? When you think about it, often not so much.

- After I wrote all this, I thought it was similar to the distinction between [[MUST and NICE TO HAVE]].
    - [[MUST]] and [[NICE TO HAVE]].
