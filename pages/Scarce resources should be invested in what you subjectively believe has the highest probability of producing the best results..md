- This argument is based on basic economic principles about resource allocation.
- Assuming you have finite resources (time, money, personnel, supplies, etc.), where to focus them is an important decision.
- In situations where resources are scarce, it is ideal to invest in areas most likely to produce results in order to maximize the use of those resources. Here, "[[results]]," whatever that may be, can be interpreted as referring to a clear benefit toward achieving a goal. This is true both from a business perspective and from an individual lifestyle management perspective.
- However, this assertion includes the phrase "[[what]] I subjectively believe." This indicates that one's [[intuition]] or [[belief]] plays a major role in deciding where to invest. While decisions based on data and objective facts are important, the phrase can be interpreted to mean that experience, observation, and intuition are also important.

### Summary of notes
.
When resources (time, money, personnel, supplies, etc.) are scarce, it is ideal to invest in areas that are most likely to produce results. One's intuition and beliefs play a major role in deciding where to invest. This can be interpreted to mean that experience, observation, and intuition are also important in making decisions.

### Relation to Fragment
.
Fragment "What resources are needed to accomplish this?" shows a connection between the two. Resource scarcity and the choice of where to invest may produce more effective results by clarifying the resources needed to achieve the goals one wants to achieve. Also relevant is "Resource scarcity is a structural strength of innovation realization. Resource scarcity may facilitate innovation to create new ideas and products.

### Summary of thoughts
