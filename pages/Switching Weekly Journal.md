title: "Switching Weekly Journal"
---

Rotating pages of reflections in units larger than a diary (approximately a week).
If there is nothing special, it will take place on Saturday and Sunday.
Often not done mechanically because "we are busy with events on weekends".
Forgetting to switch the weekly journal is in itself a [[barometer]] of [[mental state]].
