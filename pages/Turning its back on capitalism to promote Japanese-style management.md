title: "Turning its back on capitalism to promote Japanese-style management"

> [osamu419:](https://twitter.com/osamu419/status/1379750301268250625) The expression is apt, but I somehow think that different ideal kaisha have different governance methods. The good old Japanese companies wanted to go to the right if possible, but after the collapse of the bubble economy, foreign investors became shareholders and they had to go to the ideal of capitalism, and the laws and TSE policies are moving in that direction. On the other hand, there is no end to fraud.
- nishio: I thought it would be easier to understand if you wrote [[campfire (usually large, and for gathering and singing, etc.)]] in the new management chart and pretended it was "philosophy". It should be in the intersection of the Venn diagram with [[Adoption of corporate philosophy as a resolution item for the General Meeting of Shareholders]].
> [@osamu419](https://twitter.com/osamu419/status/1379941406488158209): @nishio Indeed! I guess it would be something like this. It's detailed, but I increased the overlap of the circle between shareholders and friends. LOL.

- Turn your back on [[capitalism]] and promote [Japanese-style business management
