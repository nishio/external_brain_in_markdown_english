title: "intellitech Create an enlarged and revised edition."

- I thought I had written a book on "knowledge that won't be obsolete for 10 years."
    - The obi says as much.
    - This is only a hypothesis and must be tested
        - Verification improves understanding.
- Therefore, it is necessary to review it after 10 years and verify what has become obsolete and what has not.
        - [[Test of Time]]
- If so, why not just publish an enlarged and revised edition at that time?

feedback
- Why not give it 3 years instead of 10?
    - Isn't it a little early for that?
    - The life cycle of a paper book is long, so maybe we should do it a little slower, but keep doing it online.
        - [[Publishing is not a goal, but a start]]
            - [The enlarged and revised edition is upgraded.
