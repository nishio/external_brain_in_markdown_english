title: "Passion Fit and Develop"
---

- There are two mindsets toward [passion
- Fit: Meet the object of your passion
- Develop: Passion grows over time as you do it.

I used to refer to the former thought as "the idea that [[white prince]] should come someday," but I never explained it in terms of a contrastive structure.

- [Let's stop advising people to "find your passion" - Taka Umada - Medium](https://medium.com/@tumada/do-not-find-your-passion-a7b2f290b5a)
        - [[No more advice to "find your passion."]]

- It is related to the story [[Values are verbalized bottom-up.]] introduced in [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]].
    - [[(2.2.4.2) Values are verbalized bottom-up]]
