00:00 Digest

    - Related: [[semilachis]].
- A proposal that goes beyond [[binary lines]] of nationality, organization, etc.
    - Related: [[Blurring of organizational boundaries]], [[Duplex organization]].
- Prospects for a society that embraces complexity through the use of technology.
05:55 The Limits of the Human Brain "[[Cognitive Limitations]]" Answer
- The limitation that humans cannot process information that is too complex.
- New technologies have gradually extended those limits.
- It also leads to the possibility of eliminating the fragmentation of society as a whole.
11:16 Technology expands the space of possibilities
- Tools such as AI and the Internet enable diverse social designs.
- Various platforms explore new democratic and economic mechanisms.
- The use of technology can also create the seeds for overcoming division.
11:50 Will "[[Smooth Society]]" be a reality in 300 years?
- Generational change as well as technological evolution is key.
- Society updates itself in the span of a few hundred years after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
- Look at the transition to "a system that can accept complexity" from a long-term perspective.
17:20 "Democracy Dysfunctional" The Future of U.S. Divisions
- The dialogue base has been lost due to severe divisions within the United States.

- Social media spread information and amplified conflicts of opinion.
- Each reinforces the other, creating a loop that is difficult to break out of.
22:15 Can division be solved? "There is no definitive solution."
- The cause is a loop structure, and addressing only one part of the problem is not enough.
    - relevance
            - [[Linear and circular problem solving]]
                - [[Vicious Cycle of Problems and False Solutions]]
- Creating a common external enemy will bring them together temporarily, but it will create another division.
- It is important to attempt to remake the social structure itself with new technology.
26:24 Evaluating Elon Musk's "always [being on the wrong side of (e.g. an attack)"
- He moved closer to the Republican side against the liberal mainstream in Silicon Valley.
- His specialty is ideas that turn existing common sense and power structures upside down.
- They are crossing the boundaries between politics and business to gain new influence.
27:32 Trump Support Spreading in Silicon Valley
- Even in Democratic-dominated areas, Republican support increased in some areas.
- We are beginning to see the management class, VCs, etc., moving to Trump's side.
- Potential for a new wave in the technology sector, changing the relationship with regulators.
30:54 "The Future of Generative AI" Discussion by Ken Suzuki, Researcher
- Neural nets, which had been disfavored in the 1990s, made great strides.
- Generative AI is developing rapidly, with the versatility of deep learning being key.
- It is expected to spread not only to human thought aids but also to multiple domains.
34:05 Worldline where generative AI does "[[metacognition]]".
- AI will be able to figure out "how sure of their knowledge" they are.
- If we can self-evaluate our evidence and errors, we can make decisions that are more human-like.
- Once metacognition is achieved, it also opens the way for further self-evolution.
36:08 AI's self-evolution = Singularity
- The point at which the AI learns and improves itself and grows almost independently.
- If it also begins to supply its own energy and maintain itself, it will approach the point of loss of control.
- It has the potential to shake [[anthropocentric]] values to their very foundations.
41:10 [[AI gives people the right to vote]]`? The world has become "[Planet of the Apes]"`
- Suggests the possibility of AIs making decisions with each other using their own protocols.
- A future in which humans no longer have a monopoly on political participation is possible.
- The image of a "Planet of the Apes"-like situation that reexamines the nature of coexistence.
42:00 New Form of Society "Plurality
- A concept promoted by Audrey Tan and Glenn Weil.
    - See also: [[What is Plurality?]], [[Why I Am not a Market Radical]].
- It is important to design technologies and institutions that enable collaboration across heterogeneous positions.
- [The movement toward acceptance of diversity, which can also be described as a "smooth society.
45:17 Countries where "plurality" is acceptable
- The West is so divided that it tends to sound idealistic.
- Taiwan's digital democracy was briefly in the limelight, but it relied on personal charisma.
    - Related: [[Yasuno Team Taiwan Debriefing]].
- Japan is expected to be the next to be put into practice by a diverse group of leaders.
50:35 Will the modern era end?
- Modern [[individualism]] and [[state-centered]] frameworks need long-term change.
- Possibility of new technology and generational change to loosen the boundaries a little.
- A trend toward a [[de-modern]] vision of society while building on past institutions.
        - [[Layers overlap instead of ending.]]
53:11 History and Evolution of Media and Technology
- Rapid change from mass media to [[personal media]].
- Further technological innovation, such as generative AI, continues to be unstoppable and confusing.
- The effects at the simultaneous multi-layered level are intertwined in a loop.
01:00:25 Propagating investment money "[[PICSY]]" and capitalism
- The concept is to visualize the trading network and distribute rewards according to the level of contribution.
