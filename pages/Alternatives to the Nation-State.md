I feel that it would be most convenient for us to be kinder to the state by flirting with crypto as an alternative to the nation-state and making the [[governing market]] a fully [[competitive]] state.

[[alternative]] in [[nation-state]].
- [[more options]]
    - [[Forking the social system]]

relevance
    - [[democracy]] requires [[competitiveness]] to function
