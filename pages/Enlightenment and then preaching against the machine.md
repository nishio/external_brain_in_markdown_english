- Open [[enlightenment]] and then [[teaching Buddhism through the use of dialogue]], not the other way around
- First, understand [[non-verbal]].
    - After that, it becomes "a word that I understand but [[others]] don't."
    - Then you try to explain it to individual others, and it becomes "[[a]] language they can understand.
- It will be a long time before it becomes [[a language that can be communicated to an unspecified number of people]].
    - It may not be expressible in the current vocabulary to begin with.
    - There are problems on the part of people to begin with, and they may not understand whatever way you tell them.
            - [[Sanyuttha Nikaya 6.1.1]]

    - [[Words that are being spoken]]
