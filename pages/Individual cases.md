title: "Individual cases"

- On the thought pattern of "not getting too deep into [[individual]] cases."
- Although "[[n=1]] doesn't make a decision" is the correct attitude from a [[scientific]] point of view, that [[way of thinking]] implicitly assumes a subject on which [[repeated experiments]] can be performed.
- Using that way of thinking on a subject that cannot be repeatedly experimented with yields only the sterile output of "[Not enough examples to say anything.
    - If you are trying to make [[zero to one]], if you are trying to do something new, it is rarer to have enough data on the subject to make a decision.
- If there is a bias to avoid [[delve into]] n=1 cases, then "try to [[abstraction]]" when exposed to that type of problem
- They consider it a positive act implicitly in phrases such as "[[trifling]] to throw away [[foliage]]," and "[[essence]]."
- On the other hand, this abstraction is an individual's [[interpretation]], not a fact # Fact and interpretation ref. [[Einstein's empirical axiom verification model]].
- It can also be described as a negative act of "arguing based on interpretation without properly delving into the [[Facts in front of you]]."
- Even when confronted with the same fact, each person has a different interpretation of it.
- Discussions based on interpretation are prone to discrepancies.
- The ethnographic approach to this type of problem is to try to collect as much [[Related Information]] on the case as possible.
- Even though there is only one case and we cannot infer the distribution of the event itself from it, we can describe the [[generation system]] itself that produces the event if we know the [[Neighborhood Information]].
