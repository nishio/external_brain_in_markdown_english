- [[hype curve]], which combines the entire population into one line, but it's not really true.

- 1 is the so-called hype curve ([[hype cycle]]).
- 2 is the actual value
    - Stair-step jump up and then gradual improvement.
        - [[S-shape development of technology]]
- 3 are the ones who see a jump up and become paranoid, over-promoting it or conversely shouting, "It's a threat!" or, on the contrary, shouts "Threat!
    - Both press releases and social networking posts have a bias to focus on the "wow factor".
    - People who don't work with their own hands can only get information from them and are prone to overestimation.
- 4 is the person who actually does the hands-on work.
    - We get a lot of information about the actual behavior, so we get an understanding that's a little blurry, but generally close to the actual value.
- After that, the 5 voices that kept saying "this stuff is no big deal" early on started to stand out and become the dimples in the hype curve.
    - Sometimes this person thinks 3 is an idiot and is doing the opposite as a clever self-direction.
    - The 3s that erupted at the beginning of the game will decrease as people get tired, bored, or move on to other new and interesting things, so the 5s will become relatively louder.
- 4 is sometimes referred to as [[early adopter]] and 5 as [[late majority]].
