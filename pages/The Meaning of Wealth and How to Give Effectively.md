title: "The Meaning of Wealth and How to Give Effectively"
---

Summary <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>:.
- Wealth is not in the amount possessed, but in how much value one can bring to others. At first glance, this may seem to contradict the value of living only for oneself, but in reality, the act of giving should be evaluated by how much value it brings to society. The ideas of effective altruism and long-term investment complement this, and care must be taken in selecting the recipients of giving.

「 [[Wealth is not how much you have, but how much you can give]] 」

I wondered if there might be a discrepancy between these values and the [[Atlas shrugs]]-like values. I thought about it.
    - [I never live for others and I never ask others to live for me.
- Seemingly discrepant, but not really discrepant.
- How much you can give is not measured when it leaves your hands, but over the long term.
    - If you measure the value of the money when it leaves your hands, then giving 10,000 yen to a person who immediately spends it on pachinko is exactly the same as giving 10,000 yen to a brilliant but needy child in a developing country.
        - This is crazy.
    - Why is it funny? Because the latter saves "dozens of hours of work to earn the money needed to survive" and makes time to study
        - It is of greater value to society.
    - In other words, giving to "an entity that becomes stronger and creates greater value by giving.
