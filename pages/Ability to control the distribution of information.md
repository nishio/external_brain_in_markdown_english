Ability to control the distribution of information

> [daniel_takedaa](https://twitter.com/daniel_takedaa/status/1785483503867678900) I'm picking and choosing important information to RT. I want you to see what is happening now.

>  Right now, students at [[Columbia University]] are being overrun by a large number of armed police, and all media and bystanders are not allowed inside. The only real-time reporting being able to be done is on the student journalist's radio. They are making the assault possible by creating a situation where there are no witnesses.

> [daniel_takedaa](https://twitter.com/daniel_takedaa/status/1785484011655327855) WKCR students are live on the radio with local information. Just now, they were taken away by police and said "there is no one left who can document what is happening in Hamilton Hall" #WKCR
>  >jdgtranen: "No one here is left to document what happens at Hamilton Hall" -- WKCR reporters being escorted by the NYPD outside the vicinity of Hind Hall
>  "There is no one left here who can document what is happening in Hamilton Hall" -- WKCR reporters near Hynd Hall, escorted by NYPD

> [blu3mo](https://twitter.com/blu3mo/status/1785506795705831632) NYPD has thoroughly kept onlookers away from the surrounding area, but a large amount of footage is still being recorded and shared among students.
>  I feel the power of having cameras and social networking for all mankind.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1785509323470422525) It reminds me of how Audrey Tang pulled the cable and set up the live broadcast mechanism during the [[Sunflower Student Movement]] in Taiwan. This is reminiscent of Taiwan's [[Sunflower Student Movement]].

We just talked about this on Friday.
The power to control the distribution of information is shifting to citizens, not the TV and radio media



> [blu3mo](https://twitter.com/blu3mo/status/1785464650554912859/photo/1) I got an email from the university saying, "Stay out of the dorms. If you don't comply, you may be punished."
