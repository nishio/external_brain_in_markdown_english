    - What is the difference between the two?
        - Leaving aside the obvious answer of "scale"...

    - Pages that were in the process of being created
            - [[Plurality and Cybozu (2023)]] and how to situate it in the current context.

- > I'm developing a disease that makes me want to create something completely new, even though it's far easier to prepare a talk by cutting and pasting what I've already presented once.
- > I wish I could just make it, but it makes it harder to coordinate time.
- I've been thinking about the lecture material all day Saturday, and I'm getting the feeling that composing a new story line as is is not the best solution.
- It would be better to complete the English version and then use the slides for the Japanese version, which will be held a day earlier, and say, "These are the slides that I will talk about in English in tomorrow's session, and I will explain them in Japanese.
