[Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) / [[W3C]] Recommendation 19 July 2022
>  A distributed identifier ([[DID]]) is a new type of identifier that enables verifiable distributed digital identities; a DID can be any object (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, or abstract entity) as determined by the DID administrator. In contrast to common federated identifiers, DIDs are designed to be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certification authorities. Specifically, while other parties may be used to enable discovery of information associated with the DID, this design allows the controller of the DID to prove control over it without requiring permission from the other parties. The DID is a URI that associates the DID subject with the DID document. URI that associates it and allows for trusted interactions associated with that subject.
>
>  Each DID document may represent cryptographic material, a verification method, or a service that provides a set of mechanisms that allow the DID controller to prove control of the DID. The services enable trusted interactions associated with the DID subject; the DID may provide a means of returning the DID subject itself if the DID subject is an information resource, such as a data model.
>
>  This document specifies the DID syntax, common data model, core properties, serialization representation, DID operations, and a description of the process of resolving DIDs to the resources that represent them.
