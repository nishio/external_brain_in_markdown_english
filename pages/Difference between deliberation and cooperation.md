Difference between deliberative and collaborative
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT-4/icon' alt='GPT-4.icon' height="19.5"/> The [[careful deliberation]] approach emphasizes [[open discussion]] and [[consensus]] and assumes that all interests are considered honestly and thoroughly. The [[cooperation]] approach, on the other hand, focuses on identifying common values and working toward a solution that is acceptable, if not perfect, to all parties involved.

- Difference between [[careful deliberation]] and [cooperation
> Q: It suggests people are willing to relax some of their standards if they feel like they are in a fair, balanced and discursive arena.
> A: Exactly. I wouldn’t say that we’re [[deliberative]]. The informed decision part is utopian: It assumes that people bring their interests to the table honestly, which often is not the case, even in the very deliberative Swiss referendum model, for example. We usually use the word [[collaborative]], which means we only identify some common values, and we’re satisfied with that. It’s not really a [[consensus]]. It’s more like [[consent]], which signals someone can live with something, not necessarily that they would sign their name to it. --- [[Audrey Tang]]

    - The author notes that this model is somewhat utopian because it assumes that people honestly bring their interests to the table
- The "collaborative" approach, on the other hand, focuses on finding common values among the parties involved and aims for a solution that is acceptable to all, even if it is not necessarily the preferred choice of all involved.
    - The author states that this approach focuses on getting "consent," meaning that people can live with the decision, rather than "consensus," meaning that everyone agrees completely.
- The text cites Taiwan's [[Sandbox Law]] as an example of a collaborative approach.
