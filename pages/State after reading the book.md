- Forget about the book
    - Nothing changes in behavior before or after reading the book.
    - I remember the contents of a book right after I read it, but I forget it over time.
    - This is zero, same as not reading it.
    - "Behavioral change" and "forgetting" are related.
        - Memories are fixed by repeated use.
- There is one word or concept that I like from the book.
    - This is one.
    - If behavior doesn't change, it will eventually be forgotten and reduced to zero.
- 2, there are two ways.
    - 2a Two concepts in the book are connected
    - 2b Connecting concepts in the book to your own experiences and concepts already in your mind
    - Between the two, b is preferable.
        - Why?
        - 2a, because we haven't yet reached step 3 in the figure below.

                - [[Expression, coupling, and internalization]]
    - In 2a, it's still likely to collectively forget and zero out.
    - In 2b, being connected to one's own experience makes it harder to forget.

I think I wrote something similar before...
    - [[Results of reading]]
    - [[De-emphasizing the "extracted" theory]]
        - [[How to connect knowledge from reading a book]]
    - [[Hopefully the knowledge in the book will connect with your own experience.]]
