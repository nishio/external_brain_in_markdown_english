Song : [[MEGUMI HAYASHIBARA]] Lyrics: [[MEGUMI]] Music: Hidetoshi Sato

- [[Power is not strength.]]

- [[I believe in you, I believe in you, I believe in this road I'm about to walk.]]

- [[Rather than searching for the meaning of our birth, we should feel that we are alive right now, and find more important things than answers, one by one.]]

- [[I've always been afraid that if something didn't work out, I'd be left behind, but no, something can change a little bit every day.]]

- [[Seeking, being sought after, happiness must be there.]]

>  [[I want to protect you, but I'm protected by your warm eyes.]]
>  [[Let's not let strength be our strength, let's let it be in the back of our minds.]]

>  [[I'm protecting you, but you're protecting me, so let's support each other.]]
>  [[tear]] is not a weakness, I know that deep down.

>  "[[Proof of Myself]]" is [[Megumi Hayashibara's]] 21st single, released by Starchild on October 23, 1998 (KIDA-170).
> This is the eighth consecutive top 10 single chart entry since "[[Successful Mission]]" (ninth in the top 10 singles chart overall).
> Songs (all lyrics by [[MEGUMI]], music by Hidetoshi Sato)
> Proof of Myself Opening theme for TV Tokyo TV anime "Saber Marionette J to X
> Lively Motion TV Tokyo TV anime "Saber Marionette J to X" ending theme (Ver.1 - episodes 1-19, 21 / Ver.2 - episode 24)
