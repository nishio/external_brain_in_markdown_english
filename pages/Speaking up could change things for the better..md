title: "Speaking up could change things for the better."
---

- Why has [[public opinion]] changed so rapidly? I guess some people may wonder why, but what has changed is not public opinion, but perhaps the silent people who had given up and thought "nothing will change anyway even if I speak out" have changed to "speaking out may change things for the better.
I am sure that one of the reasons for the change in the world's mood from "things will never change anyway" to "speaking up might change things for the better" is that Minister Kono picked up voices on the Internet and Twitter and made "speaking up might change things" visible.
