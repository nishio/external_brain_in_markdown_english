- Various deadlines that were tightly packed together are all over and loosening up.
    - You could say it's a blur.
- I use the word "[[take it seriously]]" a lot, but it tends to get misinterpreted by iPhones.
    - something contradictory and different from what one expected
    - I mean, "take it personally" is dictionary-perfect.
    - If it's "receive at the hospital," it comes out correctly.
    - I don't want to change what's ringing in my brain, "I'll get it," for the sake of input.
    - Register the word or...
- Regain mental stability
- I'm tired.
- [I was going to buy it, but it was already there.
    - I read [[theory of the conquest of the earth]].

    - If you have an understanding of the meaning of an image, you mean that the image can become not only the object to be edited, but also the editing instructions themselves.
    - The use of numbers to indicate the order of frames and the use of different colors to distinguish between dialogue and instructions is a good example of ingenuity.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/cak/icon' alt='/villagepump/cak.icon' height="19.5"/>
