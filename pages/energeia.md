energeia
**energeia (Ἐνέργεια, energeia)** is an important concept in [[Aristotelian philosophy]], meaning [[activity]] or [[realization]]. It refers specifically to the manifestation of **[[potentiality]] ([[dunamis]], dynamis)** as an actual state or action.

Below is a brief description of the primary meaning and philosophical background of energeia.

1. basic meaning of energeia
Energeia is a Greek word combining "work (έργον, ergon)" and "internal state (ἐν, en)," meaning "internal work" or "activity."
This represents the state in which things are realized from their potential state, or **"actualized activity "**.
2. energeia in Aristotle
Aristotle discusses this concept in detail in his Metaphysics and Nicomachean Ethics.

(1) Contrast with Dunamis (possibility)
Dunamis: the state in which something has the "potential" to become something.
Example: possibility of a seed becoming a plant.
Energeia: a state in which that possibility is realized and something is "working in reality".
Example: A seed has sprouted and is growing as a plant.
(2) Dynamic activity, not a static state
Energeia is not just static completion, but sustained activity itself.
Example: The
The state in which the intellect is actually thinking.
The state in which a musician is performing.
3. integration of "completion" and "activity
Aristotle's energeia involves more than mere activity because it has the following characteristics

(1) Energeia as completion (τέλος, telos)
Energeia indicates a state in which things achieve their original purpose (telos).
Example: The
The activity of the human intellect in search of truth.
- [[happiness]] ([[eudaimonia]]) is considered the perfection of human energeia (virtue-based activity).

(2) Harmonization between stillness and motion
Aristotle believes that what is in activity (energeia) has a form of completion at the same time.
Example: The act of seeing simultaneously realizes the purpose of vision.

4. post-Aristotelian influences
The concept of energeia had a profound influence on later philosophy.

(1)  [[Thomas Aquinas]]
Thomas Aquinas applied Aristotle's energeia to Christian theology.
He defined God as "pure energeia (an active being).
(2)  [[Heidegger]]
In reinterpreting energeia and questioning the nature of existence, Heidegger referred to Aristotle's concept.
Energeia was viewed as "the dynamic self-development of existence in reality.

5. energeia in everyday examples
A simple example to understand the meaning of energeia is:

Dunamis: instruments not yet used have the potential to play it.
Energeia: The state in which the performer is actually playing the instrument and making music.
It is important to note that energeia is not merely the result, but the process itself, "actually being active.

6. conclusion
Energeia refers to the state in which potentiality (dunamis) is actually active, or the activity itself, which is dynamically unfolding while still achieving its goal. This concept was central to Aristotelian philosophy and influenced later developments in philosophy, science, and ethics.
