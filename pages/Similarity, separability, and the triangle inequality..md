Abstract
An alternative analysis of geometric models of proximity data, based on a feature-matching model, leads to the coincidence hypothesis that the dissimilarity between objects that differ on 2 separable dimensions is larger than predicted from their unidimensional differences on the basis of the triangle inequality and segmental additivity. A series of studies of 2-dimensional stimuli with separable attributes (including house plants, parallelograms, schematic faces, and histograms), using judgments of similarity and dissimilarity, classification, inference, and recognition errors, all support the coincidence hypothesis. The size of the effect is determined by the separability of the stimuli, the transparency of the dimensional structure, and the discriminability of the levels within each dimension. Applications of the coincidence effect to inductive inference are investigated, and its relations to selective attention and spatial density are discussed. It is concluded that the triangle inequality and segmental additivity cannot be jointly satisfied for separable attributes. The implications of this result for multidimensional scaling are discussed.

Key Points:.
- INCIDENCE HYPOTHESIS: The dissimilarity between objects that differ on two separable dimensions is greater than the value obtained by simply summing the differences one dimension at a time. This violates the triangular inequality and partial additivity assumed by simple distance models.

        - The opposite of what I was thinking.
- Empirical support: The phenomenon was extensively confirmed by using stimuli with two-dimensional, separable features, such as ornamental plants with leaf forms, parallelograms, schematic faces, and histograms, and by testing them through similarity/dissimilarity ratings, classification tasks, inference tasks, and memory illusions.
- Determinants of the effect: The degree of this coincidence effect depends on factors such as how "separable" the stimulus attributes are, how clear the dimensional structure is, and how discriminable the level differences are within each dimension.
- Theoretical implication: the two assumptions of trigonometric inequality and partial additivity cannot hold simultaneously, at least with respect to separable dimensional attributes. This has important implications for methods that reduce similarity judgments to geometric distance models, such as [[multidimensional scaling schemes]] ([[MDS]]).
- In short, it is difficult to treat similarity/dissimilarity between objects merely as dimensional "distance," indicating that human conceptual similarity judgments have a "structural distortion" that cannot be captured by simple distance models.
