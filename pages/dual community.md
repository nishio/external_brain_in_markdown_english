title: "dual community"
---

Notation distortion [[Duplex organization]].
The boundaries of some larger communities are twofold.
- A set of "participants" and a set of "operators"
- A place for "broad and shallow communication" and a place for "deep and narrow communication

Only a small enough community can produce anything beneficial from it.
- My skin feeling in Nishio is that only about 30 people can assemble for one event.
    - A "person you met only once at an event" does not function as a human network.
    - Once a year," "several times a year," "once a month," "once a week," and so on, gradually becoming a dense network.
    - Considering the case of the Unexplored Boost Conference, an annual camp with a common goal is an effective network builder.
- A similar concept is proposed by [[Number of Dunbars]].
