- Talking about what to do with access rights, depends on what kind of demonstration you want to do.
    - For example, if it is displayed at an event, it would be interesting to have a demo that "displays a QR code, and when you take a picture of it, it becomes a writing page and you can post a sticky note.
    - To do this, you need "anyone can write in".
- But, well, maybe we should use the YAGNI principle and leave it alone until we have a clear situation that we specifically want to demonstrate.
