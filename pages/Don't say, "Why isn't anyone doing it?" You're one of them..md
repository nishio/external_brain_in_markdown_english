> Rather than bemoaning why no one else is doing it, first acknowledge that you are "one of the ones no one else is doing it. p.91

    - Don't say, "Why doesn't anyone do it?" You are one of them.
        - I rounded it up because trying to translate "nobody" is a bit of a muddle.

The English notation seems to be shaky, so probably the original is in Chinese. not found yet.

    - There's one more thing in the second half.
        - I'll admit that you are 沒有人,沒有人, because you are all-powerful.
        - This is a good nuance that says "you can act too", why was this omitted from the English text, was it difficult to translate?

        - The phrase ""nobody" can do anything." implies that "anybody" can do anything. In particular, the word "nobody" usually refers to "no one" or an "unknown person," but here it is used paradoxically. Specifically, it means "I can take the initiative to do something about a problem or task that no one else is aware of.
        - g0v's motto, "Instead of asking 'why isn't anyone doing this,' recognize 'you are that nobody,'" carries the message that "everyone has the power to act to solve problems. In other words, it is an encouragement that if you start something as "nobody," that "nobody" can accomplish anything.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>From a Chinese grammatical point of view, it can be interpreted as follows.
        - Instead of asking why no one else does it, let's acknowledge that you are the "no one else."
            - This means acknowledging that 沒有人 (no one) is actually 你 (you). In other words, it emphasizes that if no one is taking action to solve the problem, then you should take that action yourself.
        - "Because '沒有人' is all-powerful." （"Because 'no one' is all-powerful.")
            - Here, "沒有人" (nobody) is used paradoxically. 沒有人" usually means "there is no one," but in this context it is turned to mean "anyone can do it. Grammatically speaking, the sentence "你就是沒有人" (you are that "nobody") is followed by "沒有人 "是万能的 (沒有人是万能的), which is a consistent logical construction.
        - Grammatically, the structure is that the subject "沒有人" is explained by the predicate "是萬能的". This expression emphasizes the message that everyone has the power to solve problems.

It came up in the context of "[[There is]] no single leader."
> g0v is a community, not an organization. There is no fixed territory, no members, no way to join, no spokesperson, no single leader. g0v began at an unexpected time in late 2012 with the slogan "Everyone can join, no one is 'all things to all people'".

This is a good Japanese translation.
- I don't see "[[Nobody.]]" in "Instead of lamenting why no one else is doing it, let's first admit that we are one of those "no one else is doing it.
- I'm trying to connect it to this translation.
    - Instead of saying, "Why is there no one" who can do this, let us first admit that we are one of the "no one. There is no one who is "all things to all people.
