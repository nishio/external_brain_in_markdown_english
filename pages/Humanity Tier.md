> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1884329737780355483) Without [[establishing the moral character of human nature]], bots will troll the site, but if you include proof of human nature, people who don't have "a way to prove electronically that they are human" (such as anti-[[my number card]] people) will be left behind. I've been thinking that [[nishio95]] [[establishing the moral character of human nature]] is necessary or bots will troll the site, but if we include proof of humanity, people who don't have "electronic proof of human nature" (such as anti-[[my number card]] people) will be left behind. I have a feeling that this is a good idea.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1884330577668759690) Technical laggards are low tier and can't hit the API with high frequency, but they don't try to hit it with high frequency in the first place, so no real harm is done. Normal users usually do humanity proof. Those who act in a way that is beneficial to the system will move up in Tier and have a higher Quota. Only bots that cannot prove their humanity but try to hit at high frequency are prevented.
- Sometimes it's "action beneficial to the system" billing, but not all the time.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1884401816869429497) Instead of "usable useless" being a binary step between 0 and 100, the system increases from a slightly usable state to a bang-up usable state (1 -> 100).
>  I was going to say "smoother" but it's not so smooth because it goes up in tiers. But it is getting closer to "smooth".


> [0xtkgshn](https://x.com/0xtkgshn/status/1884417834048184615) The word "humanity" is tied to [[virtue]] in Japanese, so a word like [[Proof of Humanity]] would be better!
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1884419020549677384) I'd say humanity, but that's certainly misleading and not good.
