- > The recent trend of "Let's all start our own businesses!" seems quite irresponsible. Just starting a business at a young age attracts attention. However, in a culture where people celebrate the start of a business and then drop it when it doesn't work out, the mental risk to the entrepreneur is probably quite high.
- > It's a world where you have to be willing to say, "I don't recommend you become an entrepreneur," but you have to be willing to do it to keep going.
    - So it's not a good idea to do it because everyone else is doing it, because "everyone else is starting a business!" So it's not a good idea to do it just because that's the atmosphere.
