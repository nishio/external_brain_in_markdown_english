title: "Execution of PaperScript"
---

It is possible to give the code of [[PaperScript]] in [[Paper.js]] directly and execute it.
[http://paperjs.org/reference/paperscript/](http://paperjs.org/reference/paperscript/)
The advantage is that operators are defined for vectors
The disadvantage is the loss of TypeScript protection.
Well, I guess I don't need PaperScript.
