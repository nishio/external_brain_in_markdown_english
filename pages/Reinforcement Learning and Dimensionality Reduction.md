title: "Reinforcement Learning and Dimensionality Reduction"
---

    - [[dimensional reduction]]
    - [[Dimensionality reduction is an abstraction]]
- There is no objective reason for choosing which axis to crush.
        - [[Abstraction is subjective]]
- Then it's not as if you randomly select an axis.
- If there is something to be gained as a result of choosing the appropriate axis of abstraction, then choosing that axis is reinforced.
    - That is, [[reinforcement learning]].
    - Which axis to choose [[multi-armed bandit]].
