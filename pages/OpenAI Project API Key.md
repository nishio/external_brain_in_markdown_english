[Managing your work in the API platform with Projects | OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9186755-managing-your-work-in-the-api-platform-with-projects)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This document describes how to manage projects in OpenAI's API platform. The main points are as follows
- Projects can be used to organize work within an organization. Access privileges and usage restrictions can be managed and usage can be tracked within a project.
- Only the owner of an organization can create a project. Each organization has a default project.
- A project has two roles, owner and member, with different privileges. Owners can change project settings and manage members, while members are limited to reasoning with the API.
- A service account is like a pseudo-user and is distinguished from a personal account. It is used for system access.
- Usage limits can be set at the organization and project levels. Project limits must be set below organizational limits.
- Users can belong to multiple projects. An API key is issued for each project and can only be used within that project.
- Currently, moving resources between projects is not supported. It is recommended that projects that are no longer in use be treated as obsolete by removing and renaming members.

As described above, OpenAI's API platform allows work to be managed on a project-by-project basis, with fine-grained access control and usage restrictions.
