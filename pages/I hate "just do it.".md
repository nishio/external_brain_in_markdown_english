title: 'I hate "just do it."'

    - [[spiritualism]] is nothing more than
- Is the person saying "[[Do it anyway.]]" actually executing "Do it anyway" at all times?
    - If it's not done, it's [[deceptive]].
- Without thinking about "Why can't we do it?", it may not be "sustainable" to do "whatever it takes" under external pressure.
- Why can't we do it?
    - Others can't solve it for you.
- Ability to solve one's [[internal challenge]] is more important in the long run than individual "just do it"
        - [[Internal Observation]] is an important preliminary step.
    - Ignoring the importance of "[[observation]]" and imposing the mentality of "just do it" is harmful to the subject.

    - [[Do it anyway" is not the last line.]]
