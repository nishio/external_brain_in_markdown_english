- I think it's good that Scrapbox is implemented the way it is now, because "running fast" is important for stationery, but if ChatGPT were 100 times faster, "links can only be made with exact string matches" is obviously inconvenient
    - What should Scrapbox look like in that era?
    - It's a nice feature that when you're typing in a link, an ambiguous search is done and a "similar string" comes up.
    - Whether to make the string identical to it or not is not clear.
        - If the same string is allowed
        - I want to keep the different strings, but I also want to link to them.
    - [[Helpfeel]]的な仕組みが良さそう<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/blu3mo/icon' alt='/villagepump/blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - For example, when there is a page called "What to do when you're feeling down.
        - A mechanism to have LLM generate variations of "things to do when (energy|energy|motivation) is (not|exhausted)" and have all of them be found by ambiguous searches, etc.
