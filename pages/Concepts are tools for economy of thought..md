## deep thinking
Concepts are tools that promote efficiency in thinking, not only for individuals but also for the organization as a whole. This is based on Ernst Mach's theory of the economy of thought. In addition, the efficiency of thinking can be improved by creating new word-meaning combinations. However, whether a concept is beneficial or not depends on its individual attributes. Therefore, it is important to take individual attributes into account in order to maximize the usefulness of a concept.
