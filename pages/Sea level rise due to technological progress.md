- Sea level rise due to technological progress
- The level of "readily available knowledge" (at sea level) has increased a lot over the past 10 years due to technological advances.
- You have to be above this sea level to participate in [[knowledge exchange]].
- That's why they say it's important to develop expertise.

    - [[Level of expertise]]
- But the term "[[expertise]]" is ambiguous and it is not clear to what extent it should be done.
- Need to have knowledge that is not available by Googling in order to face out of the sea surface.
- It's a much lower hurdle than the word "expertise" might suggest.
