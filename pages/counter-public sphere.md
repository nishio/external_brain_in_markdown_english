Destroying the myth of "the only public sphere" and affirming the counter-public sphere

In her 1990 article "[[Rethinking the Public Sphere]]," [[Fraser]] recritiqued the bourgeois public sphere model of [[Habermas.]] from a feminist, class, and race perspective. Her argument, in a nutshell, is that "even if status is formally bracketed and discussed, if substantive inequalities remain, the marginalized have no voice."

Fraser therefore proposed the concept of **[[subaltern counter-publics]]**. This is a circuit that creates autonomous discussion spaces outside of the dominant conversation, reconstructs experience and language within, and then intervenes in the mainstream public sphere. He argued that the juxtaposition and competition of multiple public spheres is what makes oppression visible and drives social change.

- > "The official public sphere presupposes a debate that shelves social inequalities, which in turn excludes the vulnerable" ([PDF](https://carbonfarm.us/amap/fraser_public.pdf)).

Fraser further proposes that publicness should be redefined in terms of "parity of participation" in an age of fluid state/economy/intimate sphere boundaries. This is an overarching criterion that extends to institutional design, media composition, and reevaluation of care work, and provides a theoretical platform for platform regulation and alternative media construction in the digital age.

If we counterpoint them, we can say that [[Bourdieu]] exposed [[the violence of statistical visualization]] and Fraser presented the strategy of [[countervisualization]].
