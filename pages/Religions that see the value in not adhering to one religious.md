This discussion offers multiple perspectives on the Japanese view of religion. First, iiduna_yutaka points out that Japanese people live by [[polytheistic]] principles and may seem like [[ancient Romans]] to followers of [[monotheism]] such as [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]]. This view suggests the idea that Japan's [[religious diversity]] may seem [[outdated]] from the outside.

KencKtok interprets [[Inazo Nitobe]]'s reason for writing "[[Bushido]]" as to let the world know that even though Japan is polytheistic, a certain [[moral code]] exists for the Japanese. This suggests that the Japanese religious outlook goes beyond simple polytheism.

menokuruma points out that Japan is a [[polyreligious society]] rather than a polytheistic one, and that people tend to avoid belonging to a particular religion. He also argues that Western and Middle Eastern perspectives on the difference between polytheism and monotheism are not necessarily universal, and further that Catholic religious practice includes polytheistic elements, arguing that there is not always a clear distinction between monotheism and polytheism. Finally, he states that a monotheistic view is not necessarily "progressive" and that such a view itself may be outdated.

> [iiduna_yutaka](https://twitter.com/iiduna_yutaka/status/1765213621590913157) To be honest, I think Japanese people are "quite polytheistic fundamentalists, although they don't realize it. I have a feeling that the Christians may think they are either "retarded" or "very dangerous people", as if they are playing the ancient Romans.

> [KencKtok](https://twitter.com/KencKtok/status/1765351259396341968) I think that's why Inazo Nitobe wrote Bushido, to let people know that although Japan is a polytheistic country, there are certain norms among the Japanese.

> I think it would be more accurate to say that there are many people who think it is good that the society is multi-religious and do not want to be pigeonholed as a "Fat Believer" by belonging to one religion. I think it would be more accurate to say that many people are extremely averse to being pigeonholed as "Fat believers" and belonging to one religion or another.

> [menokuruma](https://twitter.com/menokuruma/status/1765410185965924456) In the first place, you may have the feeling that "polytheism is lagging behind" because of the social change from polytheism to monotheism that happened in the Western and Middle Eastern world. However, compared to early Christianity, Catholicism's belief in Mary and patron saints/angels is quite polytheistic, and although it is hard to imagine from today's Buddhism, early Buddhism was completely monotheistic.

> [menokuruma](https://twitter.com/menokuruma/status/1765411191755801012) Some religions, like Hinduism, are a collection of monotheistic religions that appear to be polytheistic.
>  The theory that sees polytheism as "the process by which monotheism came into being" existed in the previous era, but has been rejected in modern times, so I don't think anyone who is a believer in monotheism and has knowledge of the area would consider polytheism "retarded", in fact, the idea is retarded.
