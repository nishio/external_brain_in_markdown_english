[[Intellectual Production]] as a changing [[flow]].
Evolving to incorporate technologies available at each point in time
The [[snapshot at a point in time]] in this flow is the [[KJ method]], and a little later the [[snapshot]] is the [[Fireworks to think about]].

### digest of notes
.
The KJ method is an evolving technique that will be recognized and disseminated as snapshots of it are recorded. However, dissemination requires education and training, and specific methods and programs are needed.

### Relation to Fragment
.
Fragments "Weekly Notes 2023-01-13" and "KJ Method Study Group @ Loftwork" are related to the notes." In "Weekly Notes 2023-01-13," it is shown that with the spread of the KJ method came the idea that "we must do it right" and "we must have formal training," leading to the need for education and training in the notes. It also states that the "KJ Method Study Group @ Loftwork" will provide an in-depth study of specific methods and ideas, which is relevant to providing the specific methods and programs required by the Note.

### Deep thoughts and opinions
Education and training are necessary to spread the KJ method, and specific methods and programs are needed to achieve this. However, it is difficult to define a "right way" in general, as each individual needs a method that fits his/her own personality and situation. Therefore, it is important for each individual to find a method that fits his or her own needs, and to share and exchange such methods.

### title of thought
.
"Diffusion and individual adaptability of the KJ method."
