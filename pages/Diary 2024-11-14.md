scheduled task

    - There's a lot to do, but we should finish with the easy stuff first.
        - [[2024-11-14-UMAP of public opinion map]]

    - 1:  [[A Review of the House of Representatives Election Analysis in Broad Listening]]
        - I wrote the code to download the transcript and live chat from YouTube ([[YouTube comment/transcript/live chat acquisition]]) and I thought I'd run it by Claude to make a list of questions, but Claude is also I think he's not feeling well...

    - 3: "A New Way of Doing Things" (A)
