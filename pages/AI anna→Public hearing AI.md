[Questions to AI Anno - Team Mirai](https://kouchou-ai.team-mir.ai/fc7b6c5e-ca79-4c3b-b281-3acc3d1a0cfb/)


from dd2030 slack
There was a problem with the default prompt to extract "opinion", which targeted the question text but extracted opinions.

I've got a more concrete example of the abstract "we need to change [[the prompt]] depending on the situation," so I'll put it in language.
- I want to extract only the "criticism" from X's post and observe
- I want to extract only the "sense of the problem" (what the proposer feels is the problem) from the policy pull requests.
- I want to extract only "questions" from the questions to AI Anne's ("Great! and so on are removed)

At the moment, I'm tweaking the prompts, but I think it would be better to have a support tool since it's quite a hassle to change the "fewshot example" to match the prompts.
Rather than having users directly use the support tool itself, it would be easier for them to select a few typical use cases as presets based on my trial-and-error experience.
