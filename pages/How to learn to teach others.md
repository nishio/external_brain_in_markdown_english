>  Teaching others is the most efficient way to learn.

As I wrote in "[[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]]", "teaching others is a more efficient way to learn" means "if you explain what you have learned with the intention of teaching others, your memory will be better retained", so there is no need to constrain the person who is teaching you.
- Intellectual Production of Engineers p.140 [[(4.5.3.3) Teaching others]] [[teach others]].
    - > Making materials to teach others also reinforces your own memory. After solving a puzzle, writing an explanation of how to solve it will ... There are experiments that show that test scores improve significantly. Just creating the material is effective without actually teaching it.
        - [[Creating materials to teach reinforces your own memory.]]
- An experiment that showed that taking the time to verbalize how to solve a problem, rather than simply solving it, improved subsequent performance.

Understanding
- I think "[[I'll do it when I understand it properly.]]" is not a good guideline, because a small-minded person will forever feel that he/she doesn't understand it properly no matter how much he/she studies, and a not-so-small-minded person will feel confident with not enough knowledge at all. I think it's not a good guideline.
        - [[Dunning-Kruger effect]]
- As I also wrote in "The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production," subjective feelings of "understanding" are often wrong, so "[[Understanding is a hypothesis]]" and without "an experiment to test the hypothesis," it is impossible to know if you really understand. Writing an explanation of what you think you understand is useful for this experiment.
- As a result of our experiments in trying to explain, we often find ourselves saying, "Huh? This is a bit fuzzy in my understanding. As we find and eliminate such vague points, a "dense network of interconnected information" is created in our brains. Once this is in place, it is useful to be able to trace the connections and pull them out as needed.
    - [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]]  p.44
    - > You may feel like you know something, but that is no guarantee that you really do. You have to verify that the model in your brain that you think is correct is really correct by actually using that brain model and observing the results.
