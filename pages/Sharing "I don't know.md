title: 'Sharing "I don''t know'
---

- How to [[share]] the feeling of "[I don't know.
- Often accompanied by [fear
    - → [[psychological safety]]
- Collaborative editing projects in [Scrapbox
    - It has been done that I make [[Words you don't understand]] into a link.
    - You seem to share the "I don't know what this word means."
    - I share, "I hope people who don't know this word can figure it out."
    - Because even people who know what they're doing sometimes make links to "I'll write an explanation later".
    - The act of linking is not a check on the actor's workmanship.
    - Able to take action in the direction of improved shared knowledge within the organization, regardless of knowledge
