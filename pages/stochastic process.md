### [[stochastic process]]
 is a concept that refers to a "collection of random variables" that vary with respect to some parameter (usually time), such as time or space. For example, it is used as a model for uncertain phenomena observed in a time series, such as stock price or weather fluctuations.

- Example.
    - [[Brownian motion]] (a process that describes the position of particles in continuous motion)
    - [[Markov chain]] (a discrete model in which the next state depends only on the current state)

- Features
1. each point in time is treated as a [random variable
2. time dependence and distribution structure of the entire process are important
3. properties such as Markovianity and stationarity are key to analysis

It is the basic framework used in the analysis of many physical phenomena and economic data, and is useful for future forecasting and risk assessment.
