title: "Objective and non-objective capabilities"
---

I think there is no such thing as competence objectively, but rather competence of a different objectivity.

For example, my ability to pick up sushi with chopsticks is highly objective because I can prove it as soon as you provide me with chopsticks and sushi.

I can also prove rather easily that I am capable of writing a Python script to convert numeric data in a CSV into a histogram image.

The ability to write a larger program is becoming increasingly difficult to verify.
- The larger the task, the higher the cost of verification.
- The word "program" has lost its resolution.
    - Is it Python, Haskell, or Clojure?

Whether the research is competent or not
- The word "research" is extremely low-resolution language.
- If you measure it by the KPI of "writing a paper," then you're not capable because you don't write one.
    - Current employers are not measured by that KPI.
- If I had to measure it by degrees, I'd say I got a doctorate and then a second master's degree as a working student.
- Personally, I don't think either is an appropriate KPI.
    - I understand there's a "community based on shared values" with the former as a KPI, but I'm not one of them.

If it can't be objectively verified, it's subjective.
- In other words, behavior that subjectively leads people to believe that they are "competent".
