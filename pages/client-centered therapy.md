client-centered therapy
from  [[Study Session 1 on "Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning]]
client-centered therapy
    - [[Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning]] Chapter II [[Examples of how felt meaning works in cognition]] > B. > 3. [[psychotherapy]] p.104
- > In client-centered therapy, the client's felt experience is specifically explored in his or her own words.
- > Other methods provide diagnostic concepts emanating from the theoretical collation framework of the therapist
    - > However, upon closer examination, we find that another school of therapy places the same emphasis on the client's own direct discovery of feelings and experiences within the client that are generally predicted by the diagnosis.
    - "[[Diagnosis is]] conceptual scaffolding" [Freud Sigmund Freud - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ジークムント,).
        - > Like scaffolding for a building under construction, it will be removed as useless when the actual building is completed.
        - > A diagnosis may be made in a day from the material of an interview or a projective test (<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> e.g. Rorschach test). However, it takes a long time for the client himself to discover and grasp his internal feelings and experiences, and it must be based on feelings, not on concepts.
        - > The treatment must be based on his own unique experience, not on conceptual generalizations. For this reason, every form of therapy consists of an individual's effort to experience more deeply and to grasp and symbolize his own felt experience.


> It takes a long time for the client to discover and grasp his internal feelings and experiences, and they must be founded on feelings, not on concepts.
