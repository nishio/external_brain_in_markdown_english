title: "Information is more important than people"
---

> Scrapbox was originally developed in a university laboratory where 1/3 of the workforce is replaced every year, so it is true that [[information is the main]] rather than people. [I want to leave my knowledge behind.

Certainly in this environment, the information "Mr. X, who graduated three years ago, wrote this text" isn't very useful.

On the other hand, in the context of [[groupware]], some people see a big difference between "a text written by the president" and "a text written by a new employee."
- Whether this is preferable or not.
    - I'd prefer to be clear for command and control, but there are a lot of situations where that's not the case.
    - The [[authoritarian gradient]] of position gets in the way when everyone is trying to think together in wisdom.
        - There was a story that "students who are used to [[Dr. Masui]] will start talking to [[Dr. Masui]] as if he were a tamale."
    - Is this concern the main reason why Scrapbox is taking the route of not explicitly indicating authorship?
    - A text is not "shared material" if it is "owned" by an individual author.
        - It is difficult to create a flow of improvement for others.
