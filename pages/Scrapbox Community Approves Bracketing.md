title: "Scrapbox Community Approves Bracketing"
---

In [[Scrapbox community]], [[bracketing]] functions as [[approval]] like a "like" button
- Interpretation of "Scrapbox has eliminated features that stimulate approval" as meaning "features that known social networking sites have adopted."
    - [[The opposite of love is not hate but indifference]]
    - The most negative thing about writing is that it sinks without any response.
- Making comments is a big positive.
- But the feedback from the bracketing also "acknowledges the existence of the text and that it could be useful in the future".
    - This is even stronger approval than a Twitter "like"
