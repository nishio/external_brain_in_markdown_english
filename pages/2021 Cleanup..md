Looking back after 3 years
- Paper document organizer] made of paper is good
    - The best part is that it can be folded and compacted when there is "free space" after rearranging or replacing the contents.
    - If a storage tool fails to "adapt" to changes in the quantity ratio of the items being stored, the tool itself becomes "bulky trash".
        - Occupies a large amount of space
        - It is important to be able to fold it up when it is no longer needed.
- Three can fit against a square box of [Muji pulp board boxes](https://www.muji.com/jp/ja/store/cmdty/section/S00809).
    - Not in the previous version, but now [drawer](https://www.muji.com/jp/ja/store/cmdty/detail/4548076249276) has been added.
- demerit
    - If you leave the top open for 3 years, dust will collect all over the place.

Fundamental.
- Operated for 3 years and eventually "left in place" because there was "no use" for most of them.
    - No need to keep it in the residence.
        - Send to [miniclass
        - You can keep a box of book kits for $275 a month.
            - If you "put it out" online, they'll get it the next day, and if you "take it with you," they'll bring it in the next day.
        - Last time I sent 3 boxes to Minicra 3 years ago and took them out once in 3 years.
        - I did +3 boxes of book kits this time and +2 boxes of normal
- If you make a box with miscellaneous items, it will be left untouched.

- Paper also has the "test of time."
- After three years, you may wonder why you kept this stuff, or conversely, you may say, "Oh, interesting that you kept this stuff, let's put it all in this box.
    - You should keep the year, month, and date on it.
        - Some of it was written right the first time, but some of it was cut out and not written.
        - When I made it, I thought, "You don't need it because you can tell by the title of the activity," but after three years, I don't know when that was.
            - Of course you can look it up, but it's too much trouble to look it up, so just write it down.
