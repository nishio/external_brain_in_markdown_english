>  The design life of the manned submersible "Shinkai 6500," which has been responsible for deep-sea exploration for more than 30 years, is approaching the end. Since the technology to build a successor manned vehicle has been lost, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) has decided to give priority to the development of an unmanned vehicle.

> The article carries a story about the National Science Museum's Tani Research Director, but he has not been interviewed. He also believes that the life of the product should be prolonged and continue to be used.

the person himself
> [kentani07](https://x.com/kentani07/status/1822854745087951267) I refrain from expressing my opinions and thoughts on social networking sites, but this article uses my name and I cannot overlook it.
>  First of all, I have not been interviewed by Asahi at all.
>  And (and this is important), I have never questioned the life extension of the Shinkai 6500. I believe that its life should be extended and continue to be used.

> [kentani07](https://x.com/kentani07/status/1822863078557634618) Even in the paid part, it says "Prof. Michibayashi of Nagoya University requested at an expert panel to develop a full-depth unmanned probe.
>  I am a member of this meeting, but there was no such statement, and it was requested that the next manned submersible does not have to be a full depth, that the current Shinkai 6500 be maintained and an upgrade considered.

> [kentani07](https://x.com/kentani07/status/1822864053431333208) All statements made by myself and Prof. Michibayashi of Nagoya University at the experts' meeting are available as minutes on the MEXT website.
>  My opinions and ideas are available in the minutes and handouts of the second meeting. Mr. Michibayashi's opinions are available in the third meeting.

> [kentani07](https://x.com/kentani07/status/1822868228139561167) My opinion,
>  Although both the vessel and probe are aging, we would like to maintain the means to observe the seafloor and collect samples at depths of up to 7,000 m, regardless of whether it is manned or unmanned.
>  The aging of the Shinkai 6500 mother ship is more serious, and even if the submersible can be maintained until the 2040s, the mother ship could be out of service (long before) that.
> .

> [kentani07](https://x.com/kentani07/status/1822870762229047478) At the 5th meeting of the committee, the draft report at that time was written in such a way that it could be interpreted that the life of both the submarine and the mother ship could be extended until 2040. The aging of the mother ship has reached a point where its safe operation is concerned, and even if the life of the "mother ship" is extended, it is not in a condition to be used for another ten years, which seems to be a common opinion in the field,

> [kentani07](https://x.com/kentani07/status/1822872121359687882) and expressed my opinion. If you read only my statement in the minutes, you may read that the aging of the "Shinkai 6500" is serious at the level of safety operation, but I added my comments about the serious aging of the mother ship by a JAMSTEC board member who had just returned from a research cruise as a person in the field. I have just returned from the research voyage.

> [kentani07](https://x.com/kentani07/status/1822873550497407386) I understand that the article in the first post was used in a completely different context by cutting out my above statement in the minutes.
>  As a museum employee and someone in the field of deep-sea research, I would like to give back to society as much as I can about the fascination of deep-sea exploration and the excitement and fun of conducting research aboard the manned submersible Shinkai 6500.

> [kentani07](https://x.com/kentani07/status/1822874065222434922) I am very sad that the exact opposite of what I am trying to convey every day (as my statement) is being reported. I wish they had at least covered it.
