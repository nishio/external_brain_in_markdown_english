<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>You are an expert researcher on the Japanese language. I am interested in the different nuances of the three words "[[independence]]", "[[autonomy (philosophy)]]" and "[[independence]]" in Japanese. Please explain.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Of course, the words "autonomy," "self-reliance," and "independence" in Japanese are similar, but each has its own particular nuances.
- Jishusei: This word emphasizes the ability to [[think and act on one's own]]. It refers to the ability to make one's own decisions, plans, and actions without waiting for instructions or orders.
- Autonomy: This one focuses on the ability to act and make decisions independently, without outside interference or control. Emphasis is placed on [[maintaining control over oneself]] without being dependent on society or others.
- Initiative: This word implies an attitude in which the individual sees himself or herself as the subject and actively engages in things. It emphasizes not only independence, but also a sense of awareness and responsibility [[that one is the subject of one's own actions]].
Although the scope and accent of each refers to different things, as a whole, they all share the same "think and act for yourself".

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Of course, we will create examples.
- Independence: Mr. Yamada did not wait for the company's instructions, but proposed his own measures to improve the project.
- Autonomy: Mr. Suzuki manages his own tasks and completes them on time without detailed instructions from his supervisor.
- Initiative: Mr. Tanaka worked on the project as a leader, not as a member of a team, and determined the overall direction of the project.
Do these examples give you a clear sense of the differences and characteristics of each word?

- I see what you mean... that makes sense.
- The degree to which this interpretation is generally accepted has not yet been verified, but it is very interesting as a point of view that "GPT4 feels this kind of nuance difference.
