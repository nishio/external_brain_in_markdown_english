> As they repeat "[[unimportant things]]", they accumulate know-how, which they use to begin working on "unimportant things". At this stage, it appears to observers to stop because it is transmitted in a different way from the "unimportant things. It emerges after a while, when it has reached a level of perfection. To the observer, it appears that a leap forward has occurred.

- As you repeat "[[unimportant things]]," you accumulate [[know-how]].
    - Abstraction is performed from the accumulation of know-how to obtain a [[mental model]].
        - This will allow you to solve "problems you weren't taught how to do".

Title: [[Accumulation of Know-How and Misperception of Observers]].

Summary: The
- Know-how is accumulated through repetition of "unimportant things," from which abstractions are made and mental models are acquired. This leads to literacy and the ability to solve "problems that one has not been taught how to do. Lack of literacy, however, does not allow for input of certain types of information.
- This process is the "abstracting, modeling, and finding patterns" stage in the learning cycle. For example, it is like developing from "collecting and arranging" to "stacking boxes on top of each other.
- Then, using the accumulated know-how, they begin to work on "unimportant things," but this process appears to observers to stop. This is because trial and error is difficult to see.
- After a while, when the results are achieved after a period of perfection, it appears to the observer that a leap forward has occurred. This is similar to the phenomenon of people shouting "genius" without seeing the "effort behind the scenes.
