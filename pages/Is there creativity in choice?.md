- [[selection]] に [[creativity]] はあるのか<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/biwa/icon' alt='/villagepump/biwa.icon' height="19.5"/>
- I don't think that one or so [[selections]] will create uniqueness, but multiple [[selections]] will create uniqueness.
    - But [[originality]] and [[creativity]] seem to be slightly different.
        - I feel that a series of choices creates uniqueness, but not creativity.
            - What is originality? What is creativity?
        - If life is a series of choices, maybe there is no creativity in life<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/cFQ2f7LRuLYP/icon' alt='/villagepump/cFQ2f7LRuLYP.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Some people don't have "create" as an option and some do.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - What options you can choose from is determined by your past choices.
            - Most web apps only allow you to choose from a selection of options when it comes to design themes
                - Scrapbox gives users the option to "create" with UserCSS, awesome!
                - Even if you don't know CSS at all, you can tweak the design as you see fit.
                - But there are "people who don't want to make those choices."
            - People who chose Google Docs instead of Scrapbox do not have this option = what options you can choose from depends on your past choices
