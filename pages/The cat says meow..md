title: "The cat says meow."

- State, "I have a [[requirement]] to do."
- I don't know what they are asking for.
- It seems that they learn that "just say meow and the humans will take care of it" by humans taking care of them and dealing with them.
    - Meow when humans are near the cat toilet -> clean up the toilet.
    - Meow when humans are in the kitchen → serve food.
- There are no clear rules, but rather a fuzzy correspondence.
- More clarity in this correspondence would create [[Language]].
