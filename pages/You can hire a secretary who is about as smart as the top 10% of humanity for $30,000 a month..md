> [rootport](https://x.com/rootport/status/1891439883908010144) If you think of it as "hiring a secretary who is about as smart as the top 10% of the human race for 30,000 yen a month," it might be cheap. Moreover, while in the case of the human race, the person would be an elementary school level idiot outside of his/her field of expertise, o1-kun is about as accurate as the top 10% of the human race in any field. Strong.

- This is the kind of composition that makes AI inferior in comparison in my field of expertise.

After having touched o1 pro and DeepResearch, I can't say that anymore.

Well, "I'm probably speaking from the impression I had when I was a little touched by GPT-3.5" is an unfounded speculation, so I think it's better to say, "Oh yeah! would be a good thing to say.
- When did you try it?" and it will only make the relationship worse, so I ask.

I tried a few questions in my area of expertise (what I might call it) right after I paid the bill, and there was zero. I got the impression that the frequency of halcination is about the same or a little less ...... than "the smartest of my acquaintances and friends".
