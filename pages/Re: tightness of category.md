- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamedcamp/rashita/icon' alt='/unnamedcamp/rashita.icon' height="19.5"/>I expect that when we "conform" to those who look at us from the outside, it becomes difficult to develop free discussion from the inside.
    - People looking from outside = public nature -> library-like classification needed
- I feel that we need two places, a "closed" (not meaning closed) place to expand the discussion and a place to prepare it for delivery to the public, and if we "directly connect" them, we probably won't be able to make both work.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamedcamp/rashita/icon' alt='/unnamedcamp/rashita.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Where to Expand the Discussion."[[Close does not mean closed.]] 」であるという場合の、この「クローズ」は、なんらかの場の属性でありかつ議論を広げるために必要な属性であると思うが、それはなんだろうか？？<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamedcamp/nishio/icon' alt='/unnamedcamp/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
