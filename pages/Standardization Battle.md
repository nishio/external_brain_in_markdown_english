title: "Standardization Battle"

> [copinemickmack](https://x.com/copinemickmack/status/1831937869868626113) Regardless of the genre of technical books, if you are only thinking about money, the safest thing to do is to write introductory books. That's why publishers always say, "Let's write an introductory book," and that's necessary, but I think the field in which I have to compete most is intermediate and advanced books. So please give me a hand.


> [mizchi](https://x.com/mizchi/status/1832048993536540858) Beginners have the widest pie and loosest wallet. But this is not what I really want to write about! Or so you think, or you've made a specialty of it.

> [h1nase](https://x.com/h1nase/status/1832412889464164610) The React community developed largely because high quality documentation is available on the internet for free, but I don't like the attitude that we have the best tool, the internet, and we have to write our findings in a paper I don't like the attitude that we should write our findings in a book when we have the best tool of the Internet.
>  I was just wondering if you don't think you wouldn't be making a living at this job if you were putting the author's interests ahead of the readers' interests.

> [mizchi](https://x.com/mizchi/status/1832414089756471773) However, I don't think the situation is healthy either, where good documents are not paid for because they are driven too much by good intentions only.
>  Paper publishing is the existing capital of the non-Internet, from which authors with the know-how are forced to write documents, and there must be many books that would not have been written without that capital.

> [h1nase](https://x.com/h1nase/status/1832416495454056673) I don't think SW freedom is threatened by the publication of a personal book, but knowing the days when SW development knowledge was monopolized, I feel more disgusted than necessary. I know the time when the knowledge of SW development was monopolized, I feel disgusted more than necessary.
>  Asking for compensation for the act of disseminating publicly available information in the form of educational materials is not in itself a monopoly...

> [mizchi](https://x.com/mizchi/status/1832417261954724093) I think monopoly is not a tasty strategy for authors today. It's more like a very short-term burnout. I get the impression that it's like a big version of the one where professors turn their books into textbooks for students to buy...


> [mizchi](https://x.com/mizchi/status/1832415270524350593) For those who "get it", a request to write a book for beginners is an opportunity to think "this is a good opportunity, let's organize it for beginners and dump their brains", but if they don't get paid for it Explaining things to beginners is usually not a high-cost thing to do. And unfortunately, the compensation for Japanese publishers is so dreary that it's basically founded on good will.

> [h1nase](https://x.com/h1nase/status/1832417863413727371) I am wondering why such a large amount of high quality SW-related documents are available in the US for free, and what the difference is between the US and Japan.
>
>  Is it a difference in the depth of human resources?
>  The barriers to entry into the job market are supposed to be getting lower with so many high quality documents available for free, but the salaries for SW jobs in the US are the highest in the world, and

> [mizchi](https://x.com/mizchi/status/1832419319126618473) Probably for two reasons, in the early days there was a strong influence of [[hippie culture]], and [[primitive communism]] or [[benevolent mutual aid]] was "a [[Monastery and Bazaar]]." It became a reason for something like that.
>  It's something else now, it's a standards battle, pretending to be OSS and free documentation. Ultimately leading us to the cloud and SaaS peripheral ecosystems.

> [h1nase](https://x.com/h1nase/status/1832421522524533132) standardization battle, that's certainly a big one!
>  The winning camp can make the other camp's library and tool chain obsolete, reduce the other camp's SW development jobs and bring them to their own camp, and


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1832450924864008423) I like the term "standardization battle". Furthermore, there are those who benefit and those who are forced to pay transition costs by setting up a new standard with a negative impression of [[FUD]] against [[de facto standard]], such as "[[old-fashioned]]" or "If you use this, you can't keep up [[with the changing times]]".

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1832567001304461354) It may look like a free activity, but in fact the "[[reputation]]" gained in the process is a stronger capital than money, and in units of 10 years or so, it's a financial gain. There are times when this is the case
>  >mizchi: I was writing a lot of React introductory articles around 2015 because I knew that if I didn't, I would be crushed under the weight of jQuery and die career-wise and mentally no matter what company I moved to...
    - [[Cash is weak capital]]

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1832567510702682184) The other day, "[[being free has a cost]], [[who benefits from freedom and who pays the cost]]": [[OSS and Small Government]]

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1832568342663852423)  [[There is self-sacrificing altruism and self-serving altruism.]]
>  If you don't distinguish between the two, you end up with self-sacrifice. From the beneficiary's point of view, the gain is the same in both altruism, but in the case of self-sacrifice, there is difficulty in continuity
