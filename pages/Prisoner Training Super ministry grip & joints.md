- Prisoner training for the most powerful body weight muscle training to get eternal strength in the grip & joints section of the super ministry.
- [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2JnpMwB)

    - Sequel to [Prisoner Training
- The second part, "joint training," is training related to joint mobility.
    - To put it simply, for a 38 year old like me, training for "40 shoulder prevention".
    - Flexible muscular strength = "flexibility in the presence of muscle tension."
    - Mobility and flexibility are two different things.
        - Soft, unexerted muscles do not contribute to better body control.
    - Stretching is classified into two types
        - Passive stretching: stretching muscles and soft tissues in a relaxed state using an external force.
        - Active Stretching

- In the second part, three training programs are presented
    - bridge hold
    - L hold
    - twist hold
    - [[twist hold]] is that thing you see so often where the macho guy twists.
- As of May 9, 2019
    - Bridge hold is not difficult in any way, STEP2
    - I haven't tried the L hold because I don't have a chair with the proper handles.
        - Maybe STEP 1 can.
        - Good if you progress to STEP 3, you don't need a chair and can do it at home.
        - Abdominal and core muscle strength is underwhelming.
    - Twist hold clockwise is STEP 3, counterclockwise is STEP 2
        - Distortion of the body is evident.
        - My wife could easily do STEP 4.
