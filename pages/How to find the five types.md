The Five Kinds of Seeking is one of the logical analytical methods of [[Chukan sect (of Shin Buddhism)]] and is used in the search for the essence or reality of a thing. The analysis is conducted from the following five perspectives
- Soku Ungo: Is the ego identical with the five skandhas (color, perception, thought, action, and awareness)?
- Riunga: Does the ego exist apart from the five skandhas?
- Souzai: Are the ego and the five skandhas inherent in each other?
- Shoei: Is the ego dependent on the five skandhas?
- Possession: Does the ego possess the five skandhas?

By analyzing from these perspectives and finding contradictions and problems in each case, we deny the fixed reality of the ego.
Both methods are used as logical tools to deepen the understanding of emptiness, which is at the core of Chukan thought. Through these analyses, we seek to understand the interdependence and non-self-sufficiency of things and to free ourselves from attachments and fixed ideas.
