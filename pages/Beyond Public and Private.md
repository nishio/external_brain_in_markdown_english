Talking about how the dichotomy in the public goods debate is actually a [[false dichotomy]] with no clear boundaries
> The classic 2x2 classification of goods, pioneered by [[Paul Samuelson]] and extended by [[Vincent]] and [[Elinor Ostrom]] ... It assumes two classifications: excludability (can an individual be prevented from consuming it) and competitiveness (does consumption by one individual reduce the opportunities available to other individuals). ...
>  Most resources go from private to public. Even private goods may be shared with family and friends or have small [[positive externalities]] (e.g., furniture in a communal house). Most [[public goods (i.e. goods or services such as parks or highways)]] are [[semi-excludable]] due to geographic conditions or access (e.g. lighthouses, fire stations, parks). These, along with most [[club goods]], are also [[semi-competitive]] through depletion, congestion, and exhaustion (e.g., roads, trails, library books, golf courses).
>  A more realistic concept would be to imagine [[contestability]] and [[excludability]] not as discrete measures, but as [[continuous measures]].

It came up in this discussion.
