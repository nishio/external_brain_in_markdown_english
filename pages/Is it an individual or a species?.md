title: "Is it an individual or a species?"
---

> If the definition of "[[(computer) bug]]" in the case of "[[human bug]]" is "[[Deviation from the preferred state]]", then the "preferred state" can vary from subject to subject. For example, if it is very painful and unfortunate for an individual, but it is more beneficial for the species to have someone who suffers that way, the question of whether it is a bug or not was interesting!
- The question was asked by [[Tomoya Tachikawa]].
- Is it an individual or a species?
    - I thought this question was [[false dichotomy]].
    - The "individual or species?" seems like the right dichotomy, but I can't give you an answer.
    - That's because the boundaries are drawn the wrong way.
    - The resulting answer: "[[Self or others]]" instead of "[[Individuals or species]]".
    - As for the individual you are, it is preferable that the individual is not in pain.
    - On the other hand, as for individuals other than myself, I am agnostic as to whether they are in pain or not, and it does not matter whether they are in pain to me or not, unless they are close to me.
    - In other words, "self > species > individuals other than self".
