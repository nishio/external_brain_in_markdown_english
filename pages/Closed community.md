title: "Closed community"
---

- I guess if you assume "[[open community]]" implicit in the term [[Community]], you'd be resistant to closed ones,
- And the [[company]] community is not an open one to join,
- The [[open source community]] also accepts [[pull requests]] openly from anyone, but the committers authorized to merge them are not "openly participating organizations.

The higher the [[hurdle for participation]], the easier it is to keep [[the concentration of people]] inside.
On the other hand, it is one case where an organization that has tried to make an unspecified [[decision by vote]] gets stuck and dies.
