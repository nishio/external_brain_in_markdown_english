Difference in nuance
- [[no one left behind]]
    - A way of saying active/promise. A nuance in which the actor (government, society, us) pledges not to take any action that will be left undone. It is suitable for slogans and clarifies responsibility.
    - [[No one gets left behind.]]
    - A passive/consequence way of speaking. The "result" of not being left behind is described, and the actor is not indicated. It is suitable for explaining a philosophy or a vision of achievement.
        - Note that "[[none]]" is a stronger emphasis than "none" ("not a single person, zero") and increases sloganeering.

Official" notation in Japan
- The Japanese government (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Cabinet Office, etc.) consistently uses the motto "[No one is left behind. ([Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/gaiko/oda/SDGs/about/index.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Chiebukuro [https://www.chisou.go.jp/tiiki/](https://www.chisou.go.jp/tiiki/) kankyo/index.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com])
- In the Japanese version of the 2030 Agenda, the phrase "No one is left behind." is translated as "I pledge that I will not be left behind. However, the former (no one gets left behind) is the established motto. ([Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/gaiko/oda/sdgs/pdf/000101402.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Guideline for differentiation of use
- Measures, declarations and slogans → No one is left behind (showing responsibility and commitment) ([Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/gaiko/oda/SDGs/about/index.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Explanation of the vision of society → A society where no one is left behind (state the state of achievement)

In short, the "official" translation in Japan is "no one will be left behind" (active), and the passive form is sometimes used in the explanatory context of the text. ([Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan](https://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/gaiko/oda/SDGs/about/index.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

[["not left behind" and "not left behind"]].
- No one gets left behind." and "[[No one]] gets left behind."
