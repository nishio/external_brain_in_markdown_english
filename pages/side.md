I often use the nuance of [[Eugene Gendlin.]]'s [[Aspects of Experience]] ([[aspect of experience]]) rather than aspects in the general sense

### The multi-layered meaning of the word "aspect": a discussion of Nishio in context
.

The word "aspect" in Nishio's Scrapbox goes beyond the everyday connotations of "part of a thing" or "perspective," and is used with rich, multi-layered connotations that are deeply rooted in Eugene Gendlin's concept of "aspect of experience," in particular The term "aspect of experience" is used in the following way.

### 1. as a basis for diversity and multifacetedness
.
- First, in its basic meaning, "aspect" indicates that any object (concept, person, experience, truth, data point, etc.) has not a single but multiple characteristics, aspects, and features.
    - [A single concept or thing has different aspects depending on the angle of view and context ([[There are a number of interpretations.]], [[I'm confused because I seem to be in more than one group.]]).
    - People: People have diverse aspects, and it is not enough to look at one part and think that you understand the whole ([[People have diverse aspects.]]).
    - Truth: Even a single "truth" has multiple aspects ([[Aspects of the truth]]).

### 2. as found and generated in a relationship
.
- Aspects are not merely inherent static attributes, but have a dynamic nature that can be "discovered" or "generated" through relationships, comparisons, and interactions with other things.
    - trigger for joining:
        - When two different things (experiences, concepts) meet, they are "connected" by finding a common "aspect" between them ([[spread and connect]], [[equivalence transformation theory]]).
        - This common aspect is the basis for similarity and equivalence.
    - Emergence by relationship:
        - The relationship between A and B can newly shape the "aspects" of A in B, and vice versa (figure from [[Nodal Point of Thought 2023-08-08]]).
        - New aspects can be found through abstraction ([[Finding sides by abstracting one from the other.]]).
    - Relation to the KJ method: Even among seemingly unrelated information cards (data), relationships can be found and grouped by focusing on specific "aspects" ([[High-dimensional data analysis study group]]).

### 3. as a key to deeper interpretation and understanding
.
- Depending on which "aspect" you shed light on, the way you interpret and understand the subject will change.
    - Enhance resolution: Recognizing different aspects of a concept (e.g., positive/negative) increases one's understanding of that concept and increases one's "resolution" ([[Enhance resolution]]).
    - Subjectivity and context-dependent: Which aspects appear important depends on the observer's intentions, context, and questions ([[Words uttered by association feel shallow.]]).
    - cognitive barrier: It can be difficult to communicate about "aspects" that others are not aware of ([[Recognition of cognitive omissions]]).

### 4. Gendlin, "Aspects of Experience," nu.
- Nishio's primary emphasis is on Gendlin's "aspects of experience." This is not a mere logical attributional classification, but involves deeper, experiential, nuances often associated with "felt meaning" (felt sense) prior to verbalization.
    - Pre-conceptual: "Aspects" emerge from an experiential "feeling" before any strict concepts or logical relationships are established ([[Study Session 2 on "Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning"]]).
    - Creativity: Metaphors work to link two different domains of experience and creatively generate new "aspects" of each ([[Eugene Gendlin's Metaphor Concept]], [[Study Session 2 on "Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning"]]). Processes and the Creation of Meaning]).
    - innumerable: Experience (felt sense) itself has no clear boundaries ([[innumerable feature (e.g. in a programming language)]]), and through symbolization (e.g. linguistic) certain "aspects" are cut out and recognized as a single unit.

### In conclusion
.
- Aspects" as used by Nishio refers to elements that are based on the multifacetedness of things, but are dynamically discovered and generated in relationships, and are essential for interpretation and deepening understanding (improving resolution).
- And underlying it all is Gendlin's philosophy, which goes beyond mere analytical classification and is colored with experiential and creative nuances. It is a concept that is key to a richer and deeper understanding of the world and experience.
