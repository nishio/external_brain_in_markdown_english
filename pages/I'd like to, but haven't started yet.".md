title: 'I''d like to, but haven''t started yet."'
---

- When you say, "I want to do it, but I'm stuck because I don't know what the next step is," the next step is basically to "gather information to be able to know what the next step is.
- There are "people with zero choices," "people with one choice," and "people with many choices." People with zero choices don't know what their next step should be; people with one choice may not be the right choice, but there is only one path, so they go ahead without hesitation. When there are many choices, there are those who stop and say, "Which is the best choice?" and there are those who choose the one that looks good and go on.
- 0 people should gather information. Specifically, for example, if you want to make a game, you should find out what the kind of game you want to make is made of. Those who are confused because they have many choices should understand that "I don't have the knowledge to choose the best option right now. You should roll the dice and make a decision because you are wasting your time worrying about it.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I got a question about what to say when someone says, "I want to do it, but I haven't started yet," so I want to think about that.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "unexecuted" is this "unexecuted"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>A state in which someone "wants" to do something, but hasn't done it yet.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is its "condition"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Why they are not doing it is either "they say they want to do it, but they really don't want to do it that much" or "they really want to do it, but they are stuck because they don't know the next step".
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that "condition"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Let's delve into the latter this time. When you don't know what the next step is, the next step is basically to "gather information to be able to know what the next step is," but maybe this isn't quite right.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "step is understood" is this "step is understood"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>For example, if the other person says, "I want to make a game," if you know what you're talking about, you can come up with several options: "Do I use Siv3D, Unity? Or HackforPlay or Scratch?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "HackforPlay? Scratch" is that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>NGKW HackforPlay？Scratch
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "person" is this "person"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>There are "people with zero choices," "people with one choice," and "people with many choices." People with zero choices don't know what their next step should be; people with one choice may not be the right choice, but there is only one path, so they go ahead without hesitation. When there are many choices, there are those who stop and say, "Which is the best choice?" and there are those who choose the one that looks good and go on.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Well, I hope this exchange will be a catalyst for those who are stuck at this point to start making progress.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about this "person"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>0 people should gather information. Specifically, for example, if you want to make a game, you should find out what the kind of game you want to make is made of. Those who are confused because they have many choices should understand that "I don't have the knowledge to choose the best option right now. You should roll the dice and make a decision because you are wasting your time worrying about it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is this "person" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Well, I am speaking from my imagination since I am in a place where I cannot observe directly.

- Where is this "person"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I don't know. It's not in my observation range.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "understanding" is that "understanding"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>For example, if you ask a question or apply to the Unexplored Junior's Question Box, you will be in my observation range. Then I can give you better quality advice.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "I" is that "I"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>People who like to see people who have stopped moving by giving advice.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen regarding this "person"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>What, me? Well, I'd be very happy if you could say, "That advice you gave me at that time motivated me! I'd be happy if they say, "Your advice motivated me!
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to the "person" for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to me? I should simply increase the amount of advice I give. Subsequent development is a stochastic event, so if you want to increase it, you should increase the number of times you go to bat.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Can you do that with respect to "people"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>In the meantime, maybe we should work on feedback for the next [[unexplored junior]] application?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "unexplored junior" is this "unexplored junior"?
