title: "AI and Technical Debt"
---

Whoever says "AI increases technical debt" is probably using the term [[technical debt]] in a different sense than it was originally intended.
- Technical debt is something that increases over time, even if implemented ideally.

Technical debt is a problem because the code written is used for a long period of time.
- Why use it for a long period of time? Because the cost of writing code is high.
- AI lowers the cost of writing code, which works to hold down the head of technical debt.

Regarding the speed of repayment after technical debt has been accumulated.
- AI speeds up repayment

There is a lot of code that was never written because the cost of writing it in the first place was so high that it was doubtful that it could be recovered.
- AI lowers the cost of writing code in the area.
- You can write messy code and then convert it to clean code once you know you can recoup your costs.

It's a division of labor with people who are supposed to have done the work by implementing features that aren't used.
- Someone writes miscellaneous code in AI to discover features that are used fast.
- After confirming that it will be used (= customer presence), they will try to write it properly.
- The job will then go to someone with a conventional work style or an AI.
    - AI will not fully replace this place yet.
