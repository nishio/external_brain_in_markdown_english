title: "Reset device zoom"
---

- Double-tap with three fingers to return to the original screen size
- user-scalable=no is disabled since iOS 10
- [ios10 - disable viewport zooming iOS 10+ safari? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37808180/disable-viewport-zooming-ios-10-safari)

- I want to reset the zoom on reload.

- `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`
    - This is already on.

- Phenomenon of eduda shifting & not receiving events

- I'm not sure if it's necessary, so I'm holding off.
