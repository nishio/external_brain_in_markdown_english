title: "Close browser tabs"
---

- Tends to have a large number of browser tabs
    - [[I'm not good at cleaning up.]]
- What is the purpose of having browser tabs open?
- Temporary storage of information and other items of interest
- If it's the very tab you're using to work on right now, that's fine.
- Tabs that have been left unattended for a time
    - It would just consume [[futility]] of space on the screen.
- There is no significant [[information volume]] just the title of the tab
    - More tabs further reduce the amount of information.
- Then just post it to Scrapbox and close it.
- Fight the desire to keep it where you can see it.
    - [[put away]]
