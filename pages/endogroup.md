title: "endogroup"
---

> A pair of concepts created by focusing on the tendency toward [[group closure]] and [[exclusiveness]]. A term used by the American sociologist [[W. G. Sumner]]. The in-group is the group with which an individual identifies himself/herself and feels a sense of [[belonging]], whereas the out-group is the group to which one feels "[[others]]" and to which one is subject to [[competitiveness]], [[conflict]], [[hostility]], and the like. In general, it is known that when the sense of belonging and [[attachment]] to the inner group increases and its [[cohesiveness]] increases, the [[rivalry]] and hostility toward the outer group tends to increase correspondingly.
