Finished reading [[HUNTER x HUNTER]].

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1900921868347208087) I have finished reading all the existing color editions of HUNTER x HUNTER and the condition for activating the "curse of wondering about the rest of HUNTER x HUNTER" has been established. Are you okay? Will I be able to finish it? Isn't it "a thought that grows stronger after death"? At any rate, there's a black-and-white edition that precedes the first book, so I'll read that, and then I'll find a way to read the ones that haven't been published in book form yet...

> [heat_1nt](https://x.com/heat_1nt/status/1900926737405669469) I don't know why I'm glad that Nishio-san is so firmly in the HUNTER x HUNTER swamp!

> [0xikkun](https://x.com/0xikkun/status/1900940365664055688) Reading HUNTER x HUNTER has become an industry standard because Mr. Nishio read it!

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1900946159272874370) I've recently verbalized the reason for this change in my value judgment as to why I've suddenly started watching [[Gundam]] and reading HUNTER x HUNTER, In short, the value of "[[acquisition of skills]]" that I've been focusing on is decreasing due to advances in AI, and the value of "[[common story]]" is increasing instead.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1900949732564103458) "Skill acquisition" is "[[a resource accumulation within oneself]]" and is more valuable when others don't have the same thing, whereas "common story" is "[a It is a "resource that is accumulated between people". And at the moment AI is not good at the latter; even if AI could tell a synopsis, people would not have positive feelings.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1901080905453818278) The composition is similar to the Plurality book "[[Trade-off between depth and breadth of cooperation]]", for example, playing [[ Madamis (Japanese brand of haloperidol)]] together is a narrow and deep experience sharing, while reading a widely read story is a shallow and wide experience sharing.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1901081628132446618) I thought the story was connected to this: [[Two forms of connection]].



> [nagise](https://x.com/nagise/status/1901053090402627724) I wonder if personalized, accumulated conversation records could easily make AI a psychological "companion" for people.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1901086976507600996) When I wrote "at the moment" I meant "AI will probably replace it within a few years" Once a "shared story" is built between AI and humans, the composition will be the same.
>  And there will come a time when it will be easier for humans to work with AI than to build relationships with other humans.
