title: "Waiting for the test of time will not give you first-mover advantage."

- [[New things become obsolete faster than old things.]]
I reread the "first-mover advantage" and thought that this is one aspect, but on the other hand, if you wait for the [[Test of Time]], you will not get the [[first-mover advantage]].

Those who wait for the test of time become [[laggard]].
- Shouldn't we wait?
