<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I want to talk and organize because I realized that I have a blurred vision of what I want Kozaneba to be by creating it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "Kozaneba" is this "Kozaneba"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Digital stationery for organizing your thoughts, sequel to what you've been reading about Regroup and Movidea
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "Movidea" is this "Movidea"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Regroup's trial-and-error approach made it so complicated that it had to be rebuilt from scratch.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "Regroup" is this "Regroup"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Created to electronically support the process of organizing your mind as you move information fragments around.

- Is there anything else about this "Regroup"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It was difficult to add functions when it reached a certain scale because there was no test code, it was not designed to be easy to test, and it was quite difficult to test it after it reached a certain state. It was difficult to do so, so we reworked the code while conducting thorough testing.

- How do you know this "Regroup"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I'm preparing an interim presentation and I've already told you about Regroup, and I don't think you need to know about it in the future.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is this "Regroup" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>👎Regroup
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "preparing" is that "preparing"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Think about the content of your presentation. The above is why I reworked it, but when I tried to write an explanation of why I created Kozaneba in the first place, I realized that this was a blur in my mind
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about this "Kozaneba"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>He thought, "I'm going to make a tool that I want to use," but that is not consistent with the idea that "the flow is difficult for new users to understand, so let's rework it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "flow" is this "flow"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I wanted to make sure that new visitors to the website could understand how to use the site without me standing next to them explaining it, so I decided to include a tutorial.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "tutorial" is this "tutorial"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>A step-by-step explanation of what Kozaneba is for and how to use it
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is this "Kozaneba" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Released for test users now, accessible but not widely announced.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "announcement" is that "announcement"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Trigger for unspecified people to use it where I'm not looking, so I'll have to install Sentry or something by then, which I haven't done yet.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "Sentry" is this "Sentry"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Tools to help me know when an error occurs at the user's end that I did not anticipate.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>That's the point, isn't it? I initially developed Regroup with the idea of "making a tool that is easy for me to use," and when I tried to tell people how to use it, I thought, "No, it's too hard to tell people how to use it with the current system," so I redeveloped it. Obviously, what people find valuable has changed since the beginning. I haven't been able to dig deeper into that, but if I put it into words for now, it seems that they feel value in "being used by many people.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "tool" is this "tool"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Oh, well, I've gone from doing it on paper myself to doing it on Regroup, and I think it's a useful tool, but maybe I want to make sure it's not a "self-serving assumption" that it's being used by a lot of people.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that "tool"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>When people other than myself start using it, they use it in ways I did not expect, and my thinking can develop from that stimulus. For example, running Keicho on Scrapbox. I see, the buds that are born can grow by the hands of others, and you want to create opportunities for growth for Kozaneba.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "I" is that "I"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The entity that created the tool
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where are these "tools" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's with you while you're using it alone, but when it's in a form that others can use, it leaves your hands and moves in many different places and in many different situations.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  The entity that created the tool
Where is this "tool" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I have it in hand now.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What does that "tool" look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I realized from talking to you that this is a metaphor for "children". The more you travel, the more you grow.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "do" is that "do"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>👎.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  Where can I find this "tool"?
How do you know about this "tool"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>We are the creators, but we don't know all of its possibilities. Others will use it in unexpected ways that will lead to knowing it better.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen with respect to that "tool"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It is good when it is used by others to make it better. This is also good for my own use. Two blurred stories have come together!
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to the "tool" for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It needs to be publicly available, it needs to be used by a variety of people with different background knowledge, and the information associated with its use needs to be fed back to the author
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>As for the "tool," can it do it?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>We will proceed with that policy!
