- [Introduction to Graphic Recording for Tomorrow](https://www.slideshare.net/ssuser2c01a3/schoo-graphic-recording-5204843)
    - Slides summarizing Mr. Wanami's [https://schoo.jp/class/2393](https://schoo.jp/class/2393) classes at the school
        - Ability to listen, express and structure
        - listening comprehension
            - Ability to memorize information
            - Ability to divide the story into episodes and background
            - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I guess I'll have to separate the specific information from the meta information.
        - Ability to express
            - Human Illustration
                - Tilt of a face [[How to draw a face]] [[How to draw a stick figure]].
                    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>They don't recognize the association between "okay" and the direction of the face in the first place.
                - icon
        - Ability to structure
            - connect and separate
            - Comparison, Process, and Essence
            - Cluster, Triangulation, LINER (arrange processes along the line of sight), PATH (lay out processes using arrows), RADIAL, MODULAR, POPCORN
- I have a few references, but this is the type of skill you have to actually use and train, not "read".
