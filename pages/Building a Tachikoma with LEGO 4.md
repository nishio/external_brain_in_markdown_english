title: "Building a Tachikoma with LEGO 4"
---

- I tried to make again what I made in [[Building a Tachikoma with LEGO 1]] for relaxation because it was too difficult to make the eyeballs of Tachikoma in [[Building a Tachikoma with LEGO 3]].
Last time the carrier was just a rectangle, but I bought a lot of curved slopes, so I tried a round carrier.
I made it haphazardly and ended up with a gimmick that wasn't in the original work lol.

- It was found that if the [[slope curve]] and [[side stud]] are sufficient, it will look okay even if it is made appropriately.
Before purchasing the parts, it was impossible because there were only paraphernalia of mixed colors.

- Mechanism to support [[slope curve]] with [side stud block
