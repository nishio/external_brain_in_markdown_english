- Ability to vote on short sentences submitted
    - Let's actually vote!
    - Q: What are the criteria for voting on short texts submitted in Polis?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Don't think too long and answer more and more by feel. This is a tool to collect "how people feel.

Participants themselves can contribute short sentences.
- It is important for participants to be able to create their own voting targets by submitting short statements, rather than just voting for a target that someone else has decided.
- This workshop is set up to allow anonymous voting and posting, and the management doesn't even know.
    - Submissions are shared instantly without filters or moderation
    - You voted in favor of what you posted, so please be honest and write your opinion!

Specific Application Examples
- In Taiwan, for example, the Polis system is used in the policy-making process. For example, when Uber entered Taiwan, the vTaiwan system was used to discuss the issue with a large number of people, and although there was an initial conflict, later opinions were generated that were supported by both sides, which were then implemented by the Taiwanese government.

    - Please feel like a sticky note for brainstorming and vote on the discussion as Polis' opinion as you go along!
