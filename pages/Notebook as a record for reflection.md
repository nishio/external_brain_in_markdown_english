title: "Notebook as a record for reflection"

Response to the statement, "I don't need to use [[certificate]] for the work I'm doing now."
This statement sees the notebook as a tool for task management.
So if task management can be done in a way that does not require a notebook
On the other hand, the notebook also has an aspect as [Records to look back on
- Means of [life logging
Irrelevant whether the nature of the work requires task management in a notebook
Record that such a state of affairs exists.
