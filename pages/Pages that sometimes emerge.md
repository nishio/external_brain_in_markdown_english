Sometimes [[stand out (e.g. against a dark background)]] page
There's "what I want to see develop when I wake up tomorrow morning," and then there's "sometimes it floats away," and then there's "it doesn't have to float away anymore."

Would you reduce the probability of occurrence of "Sometimes they come up to the surface?" I was thinking that we could simply use "the oldest".

On the expression "no more need to emerge."
Right now, not all the pages are coming up.
What if all pages were subject to emerge?
A little funny.

Scrapbox design [[links connect]] to [opportunities for buried things to emerge
This is "[[relevance]]"
