> The biggest problem for the expert is to connect his/her knowledge and ability to the overall outcome. Communication is a problem for experts. As long as one's output does not become the input of others, no results can be achieved. The output of experts is knowledge and information. Those who are to use the output of the experts must understand what they are trying to say and do. Experts tend to use jargon. They cannot speak without jargon. However, they are effective only when they are understood. They must supply what their customers, their colleagues in the organization, need.
>  It is the manager's job to make professionals aware of this.
