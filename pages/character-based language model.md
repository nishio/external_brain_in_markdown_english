Creating a character-based [[language model]] is useful in many ways
I wonder if anyone has published the models they made because it's a pain in the ass to make them...

- [How to create a character-based language model - Ahogrammer](http://hironsan.hatenablog.com/entry/how-to-develop-character-based-neural-language-model)
    - Using the Wikipedia corpus [en.text8
    - 50 dimensional embedding and then 75 dimensional [[LSTM]].
    - Use for Elmo and others [ELMo to acquire context-sensitive word representations - Technical Hedgehog](https://kamujun.hatenablog.com/entry/2018/07/06/173931)
