PhantomJS
- [Command Line Interface | PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/api/command-line.html)
    - > The script code will be executed as if it running in a web browser with an empty page. Since PhantomJS is headless, there will not be anything visible shown up on the screen.
    - > If PhantomJS is invoked without any argument, it will enter the interactive mode (REPL).


Headless Chrome
- [Headless Chrome Introduction | Web | Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome?hl=ja)
    - > Headless Chrome will be included in Chrome 59! This is a means to run Chrome in a headless environment.
    - > Headless Chrome is similar to PhantomJS. Both are used for automated testing in a headless environment. The main difference is that PhantomJS uses the older WebKit, while headless Chrome uses the latest version of Blink.
    - > At this time, PhantomJS offers a higher level API than the DevTools Protocol.
