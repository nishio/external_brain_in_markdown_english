Mathematical consideration of what conditions will "go far if we all go together" when they are met.
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1657177239912341508) After mathematically considering what conditions are met when "we can go farther if we all go together," I realized that if the amount of food one person can carry is 100 days' worth of food, if one person If one person carries 100 days worth of food, one person can only go 100 days, but if 10 people go together and one person is dismissed on the 10th day, they can go 110 days. We can certainly go farther.

This is certainly not possible when one is going it alone.

Maybe their livelihood is protected by being connected to the public welfare. I think they are living a minimum healthy and cultural life. In the middle of the desert.

White!

For the first section, have 10 people go 45 days with 1000 food. At this point, you will have 550 food left, so you can use 450 to get back to where you started, while leaving 100 to one person. This method can be recursive.

It's like a team of teammates taking turns being the "fastest" to carry the ace to the finish line, taking turns being the windshield. The winner is an individual, but it is overwhelmingly a team game.
> I actually like the scene where the riders who have run out of legs and have done their part fall out of the group, it's cool.

> [@sjkimura](https://twitter.com/sjkimura/status/1657207889986220032?s=20): this reminds me of Operation Black Buck from the Falklands conflict. (A very complicated operation that used multiple combinations of aerial refueling aircraft to get bombers farther away).
