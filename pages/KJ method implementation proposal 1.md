title: "KJ method implementation proposal 1"
---

- Allow some form of movement to the left or right.
    - When viewed from a distance, a number of round rooms are lined up on a flat surface.
    - If we could add "[[doorplate]]" to this room, it would be a natural [[KJ method]].
            - [[grouping]] is still a very important concept
        - It's lame to assume that they line up on a flat surface.
    - A sphere encompassing a room
        - The slide closest to the Z+ direction of the room is temporarily used as the nameplate.
        - mind-mapping
        - A central concept is placed at the center
    - Grab the sphere and drag-drop to move.
    - If the sphere moves to any desired position, the challenge is how to move between them.
