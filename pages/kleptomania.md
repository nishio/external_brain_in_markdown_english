Keremmi ([[sotorenmi]])" explained in a simple way

## 1. Roots
.
- In the Edo period (1603-1867), the actors would surprise the audience with a bizarre performance called "sotoren" ("outer ren").
- The word is derived from "[[flamboyance]]" like a quick change or a somersault.

## 2. Contemporary meaning
.
- It refers to "an attitude of charm through conspicuous tricks and bluffing" rather than the original content.
- In English, flashiness, gimmickry, show-boating is a close image.

## 3. Breadth of nuance
.
1.### Positive
: "serviceable and poignant," "chic and cool flair."
2.### Negative
: "cheating with flamboyance when there is little substance," and "being fanciful.
- → Depending on the context, it can be either complimentary or sarcastic.

## 4. actual usage
.
- For the film: "The visuals are full of kelence, and they never get boring."
- In critique: "It's all Kerenmi and the story is shallow."
- The same is said of live staging and social networking thumbnails.

## 5. Difference from similar words
.
- [[iki]]: [modest and refined beauty.
- [[bluff]]: to show more than one is capable of "[[bluff]]".
