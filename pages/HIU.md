title: "HIU"

- Horie, Takafumi] mentioned HIU in post [[Teamwork Management Symposium]] on 2018-03-30
- I've never heard of HIU, but it sounds like it could be useful for [[network formation system]].
- When I heard "[[multi-power]]" and "[[more stupid hyperactivity than petty cleverness.]]", I reflected that I am indeed stuck in petty cleverness.
- And [[Ridiculous hyperactivity]], after thinking about what I would do, I would say, "I was moved by Mr. Horie's lecture," and I would go into the salon.
- So I went in.
    - DMM Online Salon will charge a monthly fee from credit card and will operate in a Facebook group
    - 10,000 yen per month
- Membership approved as of 4/1 (1st of each month?)
- There are many interesting things, but of course I can't write about them here because I can't disclose information in the salon without permission.
