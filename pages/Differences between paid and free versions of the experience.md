title: "Differences between paid and free versions of the experience"
---

from [/villagepump/2024/03/25](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/2024/03/25)
- When I use the [[paid version]], I am often asked about the [[difference in experience]] between the [[paid version]] and the [[free version]].
    - But I've only used the paid version, so I don't know how the experience differs from the free version.
        - I don't see the value in becoming familiar with "the difference between the paid and free versions of the experience."
        - So there is no incentive to experience the free version to learn more.
- In the end, it comes down to [subjective expectations
- In my mind, "trying a new $20 AI service" is in the same box as "buying a $3,000 book".
    - The difference between a paid version and a free version of the experience," "The relationship between [[buying and reading a book]] and [[reading a free article]] on the Internet.
    - The analogy between limited "time to read" and XXX's(?)
        - What is XXX?
        - The number of "tasks that might benefit from AI" is limited(?).
        - Limited "time to use AI"(?)
        - Limited "experience gain per hour of AI use"(?)

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>I can read some interesting comparisons and analogies from what you have stated. Especially with regard to the limited "time you can spend reading" and applying it to XXX, but making XXX concrete is somewhat of an abstract task. I will try to come up with an appropriate analogy from the options you have presented.
- Limited number of "[[tasks that would benefit from using AI]]": this is similar to a situation where you have a limited amount of "time to spend reading." That is, just as you must choose what information to take in, you must choose [[what tasks to utilize AI for]]. Both are processes of trying to extract maximum value from limited [[resources]] ([[Hours.]] or [[potential use of AI]]).
- Time [[to use AI]] is limited: This is directly related to the [[Time Constraints]] that people have [Time is finite. [[Time is finite.]] and how to use that time most effectively is always an important decision. time to use AI is likewise a [[finite resource]] that must be optimally allocated.
- The "amount of experience gained using AI per hour" is limited: This corresponds to the "amount of learning per hour" and "amount of information taken in" in reading and learning activities. In both cases, it is important how much [[efficient learning]] and [[experience]] can be gained in a limited amount of time.

From these comparisons, the most appropriate option for XXX may be the limited "time to use AI" option. This can be seen as a concrete example to the universal theme of how to allocate and utilize the finite resource of time; the use of AI is a strategic choice not only for useful tasks, but also to extract maximum value from the limited time available.
