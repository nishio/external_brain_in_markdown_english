Proposal to allow minors to participate in politics
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1809732941712617748) Some minors are lamenting the fact that they can't participate in election activities because they are not adults. The conditions are the same today because on voting day, even if you are an adult, you can't participate in election activities. So I think about what should happen in the future. I would like to bypass the high wall of revision of the Public Offices Election Law without bodily harm and aim for a quick win.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1809733905781780584) Prevent people from creating multiple accounts and watering down their opinions by verifying them with their own numbers, make it a vote for an issue rather than a candidate, exempt them from [[the Public Offices Election Law]], and open up voting to minors. and freeing minors to vote.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1809734289363464534) Then, when the election for public office approaches, the approval or disapproval of each issue for each generation will be made visible. As a meta-mechanism, it is left to the will of individual people to decide "how much weight to give to the opinions of the visualized minors in voting. This can be regarded as the voting participation of minors appropriately weighted by the will of the people.
