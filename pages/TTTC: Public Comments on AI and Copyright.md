> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1796394634446586276) Audrey Tang and Glen Weyl's recent book "⿻數位Plurality: The Future of Collaborative Technology and Democracy" #pluralitybook by Audrey Tang and Glen Weyl. In other words, it is not only important to "broadcast" information widely to people, but also to gather information from people.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1796395791596355715) Although the media calls itself "mass *communication*," it often tends to do only one-way "broadcasting" and neglects the opposite direction of "[[broad listening]]" in the opposite direction is often neglected. Communication requires listening as well as speaking; AI (LLM) technology can assist with this.

> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1796370976730722377) Broad listening by LLM is very good for [[extracting the full sense]] of a discussion from a large amount of text, so it should be used more for [[visualizing pubic comments]] and other purposes. I think it would be good if it were used more in such applications as [[visualization of pubic commentary]].
