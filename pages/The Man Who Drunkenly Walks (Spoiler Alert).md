title: "The Man Who Drunkenly Walks (Spoiler Alert)"
---

Drunken Walking Man" is a short story by Taizo Kobayashi. It is included in the short story collection "[[toy repairer]]".



(Spoiler below)

[[Time perception]] is one of [[brain functions]], and time does not actually flow in one dimension, but only as if the brain were one-dimensional.

Just as the semicircular canals sense the direction of gravity, the time sense organs sense the direction of time.
- Break it, and you lose all sense of time.
- While conscious, the time connection is determined by total mobilization of vision, etc.; when unconscious, the time sense organs determine the time connection.
- Therefore, when the time sense organ is destroyed, time appears to flow in a linear fashion while awake, but when you lose consciousness, for example by going to sleep, you feel as if you woke up on a random day
- Sometimes they come back on the same day.
    - The wave function re-diverges as many times as you want.

Not determined until observed.
- Observations cause convergence of the wave function
- Convergence is unidirectional.
- Observation may be creating a time asymmetry.

Convergence of [[wave functions]] through observation and the "ability" to advance consciousness in one dimension "from the past to the future".
- The destruction of the time sense organ causes it to be lost.
- Nothing is definite because we can go back to the pre-convergence state as many times as we want.
    - You work hard and achieve something, but it never happened.
    - Effort in objective time $T_i$ will increase the probability of success in objective time $T_{i+1}$, but even if success in $T_{i+1}$ is observed in subjective time $t_j$, it may appear in $t_{j+1}$ in the state before effort in $T_i$.
    - [It's like a river of rice paddies.

Do causes precede results?
- To begin with, the concept of "cause precedes effect" is also a concept built on the premise that time flows in one dimension.
        - [[Causality is an empirical habit]]

Wife: "We too may be reincarnated at a random point in time when we die."
- Wow, [[reincarnation]] became a day unit in this novel?
- I can't wait to [[moksha]].


- [[Hours.]]
[[one-dimensional time]].
[[linear time]]
[[linear time line]].
