title: "Nodes of Thought 20181129"
---

A Facebook post from 2018-11-29 would definitely make a page named "[[Nodes of Thought]]" now, but it was not made at the time because the concept was not yet familiar to the public at hand. [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/nishiohirokazu/posts/10216931441134811)

- The concept of "[[making a house into a garbage dump]]" that makes programmatic mechanical contributions to Scrapbox uncomfortable.
- On the other hand, it is difficult to perceive the value of linkage bonding without a certain amount of information [[cold start]] problem
- Case study of [[unexplored list of names]], which started after mechanically plugging in auto-generated content with a fairly high degree of garbage.
- Mental model of human "[[tidying up]]" against a pile of machine-generated garbage
- I exported the originally separate projects and merged them into one.
    - The original creation date and time are preserved.
    - If I merge the data after some time has elapsed since it was generated, it could be poured over as historical data without [[tarnish the new arrival]].
- If past blog posts are merged with the actual date and time they were written, they will not appear in the updated list.
    - It appears in [[search (e.g. for someone using a search engine)]] and [[Random display]]. etc.?
- Mechanically generated is created separately from the main project
- The concept of "[[rot]]" [[humus]]ization in a positive sense
- Past output to [[compost]].
    - Concept of [Tsuji Bracketing
- Composting even other people's work
- Related articles by word frequency and other factors [[recommendation]] are not good because the words to be selected are not good.
    - Manually [[bracketing]] is a "good keyword."
    - Annotation of human hands saying "I would be happy if articles in which the word appears are recomended in the future.
- If you're going to stream someone else's work in relation to copyright law, it has to be private.
    - But for the social trigger, I want to make the main output destination a public project.
    - the dilemma of "what if?
- The Everything and Everything in the Composter PRIVATE Project."
- [Composter - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%9D%E3%82%B9%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC)
        - We need a mechanism for proper merging and updating using [[composter]] as a hub.
- What should be avoided is "overwritten when a page with the same title happens to exist".
    - Just do a preliminary check and merge the content or put it on a separate page.
    - [[Most food scraps are water]]
    - [[walk]] is a mess, not necessarily a solution to the problem you want to solve.
