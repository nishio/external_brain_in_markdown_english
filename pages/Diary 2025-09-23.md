    - Red dragonflies with no sense of caution
    - After this, it perched on my shin.
        - You're too careful. You'll die.
- I brought paper books, but I'm reading comics on my iPad.
    - I'm rereading [[Fushinokami: The Rebirth of Civilization Starting at the Frontier]] from volume 1.
        - I have volume 9 and still haven't gotten to it.
- Grass park is too therapeutic.
    - I was a green mana monster.
    - I'm not sure if it's the high oxygen levels or something coming from the plants.
    - No, it wasn't this soothing when I tried oxygen capsules, so I knew it was a plant.
    - Can't live without green mana-rich land.
    - Judging by the time stamp on the lawn photo, you've been here about two hours already.
- Such an abundance of greenery, yet just a short walk away is a convenience store and a civilized restroom.
    - I got a coffee and an Essel Supercup.
    - The biggest hurdle at the moment is that the iPad has 10% battery left.
    - But I wonder if these comfortable temperatures will only last for a short period of time...
- I'm relaxed and sleepy.
- The wind is getting colder, and the strings are getting colder.
- There is no crow and w
    - I think I'll go home.
- I've read the current nine volumes of [[Fushinokami: A Chronicle of the Rebirth of Civilization Starting at the Frontier]].
    - Half [[Dr.STONE]].
    - I still can't verbalize what the other half is.
        - [[Half of Buffalo is made of gentleness]].
    - I got my tear gland loose about four times.
        - Dr.STONE was not like that.
            - Never been there? (You just forget)
            - Like the scene where that little girl was growing up.
                - [[ひとりぼっちのサイエンティスト]]<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/meganii/icon' alt='/villagepump/meganii.icon' height="19.5"/>
