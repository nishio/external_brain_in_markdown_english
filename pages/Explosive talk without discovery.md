title: "Explosive talk without discovery"

- I was thinking about the response to [[o3 No discovery mode for human kind]].

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1915759134479446116) [[surmise (about somebody's feelings)]] None [[explosive talk]] is [[interesting content]] that is generated only when [[smart people]] think "the listener is smart enough to accept it at this speed. Interesting content] is generated only when [[smart people]] think "the listener is smart enough to take it at this speed," and people who like that kind of content are starving because it doesn't flow to the [[majority media]] because the people who think it's interesting content are in the minority.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1915759763369124297) Of course, there are times when a person who does not have the skills to take into account the listener's level of comprehension talks bombast. For those whose interests match what the person is talking about, it's interesting. Most people don't find it interesting and read it as "[[fast-talking nerd]]" or something similar and look down on it. Because they don't have the ability to generate it at the rate they do, and they don't want to value it.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1915762164859654211) Those who "[[adapt to society]]" learn that "there are many devices in society that cannot receive your default [[baud rate]] when you transmit" and start transmitting at a limited rate. This will result in a loss of opportunity to produce interesting content.
