title: "I'd like to talk and sort out whether to write an explanation at this point or implement new features first."
---

I consulted with him because I wasn't sure whether to write a software description or add a new feature.
- I realized that some of the new features I had imagined were clearly important and some were not.
- The vague "new feature" was split into two parts.
- As a result, we concluded, "Let's implement the important ones before writing the explanation.
    - Breaking away from [choosing the wrong two options

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I'd like to talk about it and sort it out because at this point I'm thinking about whether to write an explanation or implement the [[Feedback button]] first.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of feedback button is that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>There are a few commands such as NGKW now, but now that we have changed from text-based chat to a web UI, I think it would be better to make the commands easier to understand with more buttons and such (more like command buttons than feedback buttons).
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Anything else about that feedback button?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Some types of feedback are used for training data. For example, NGKW would reduce the probability of selecting it as a keyword.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of NGKW is that NGKW?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It can be said to be a command that provides feedback that the keyword used in the previous question is not appropriate, and immediately removes that keyword from the keyword list for that session
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of command is that command?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The chat system has keywords and their "appropriateness score". Being selected for a question means that your score is high, but if it is not appropriate, you can delete it and your score will be zero.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of chat system is that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Find key words in human statements and ask probing questions about them
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of keywords are those?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Concepts that seem appropriate for the subject to delve into. So when they choose something that isn't appropriate, we want to stop them promptly.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of concept is that concept?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Often vague and fuzzy when first uttered, the form gradually becomes clearer as questions are asked and attempts are made to answer them.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Vague and fuzzy concepts are brought into clear form through questions asked by the chat system.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that chat system?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Promptly stopping digging into concepts that aren't appropriate plays an important role in getting value out of this chat system.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is that chat system?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Aside from this question, the conclusion is that at least the NGKW button is a high priority for implementation? Other buttons aside.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of question is that?
