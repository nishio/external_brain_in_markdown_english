> Marebito (visitor from afar) or marebito ([[guest]]) is a term used in Origuchi studies to define a spiritual or divine entity of essence that comes from another world at a certain time. It is one of the most important key concepts in the thought system of [[Nobuo Origuchi]], and is emphasized in [[folkloristics (formal study of folklore)]] as a clue to explore Japanese beliefs and [[die]] conceptions.
