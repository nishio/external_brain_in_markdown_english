> Motivated reasoning: the unconscious tendency to use one's mind only when the conclusion is consistent with one's preconceived goals. May include [[confirmation bias]] or [[my side bias]] (preferentially seeking and remembering information that is consistent with one's goals) and [[non-confirmation bias]] (a tendency to be particularly skeptical of evidence that is not consistent with one's goals).
