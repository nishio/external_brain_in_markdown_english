context

> [Jin_AnityA](https://x.com/Jin_AnityA/status/1892186380555673665) When management started using the word "productivity",
>
>  "Isn't it possible that people are dabbling and labor costs aren't at an appropriate level?
>  ・ "I want to reduce fixed costs because the outlook for the economy and business performance is still unclear.
>
>  I think it's easier to be passive if you understand that this is when you become aware of the problem.

> [Jin_AnityA](https://x.com/Jin_AnityA/status/1892189343785398323) In the past, when I talked at work about "raising productivity and doing what the system can do, while people do what only people can do," I got all kinds of reactions. I got a lot of reactions to that, didn't I?
>
>  I was talking about slides like this.
>  We all wanted to do creative or problem-solving work that only people can do, right? We want to move forward in our career paths through more value-added work, don't we? and

> [Jin_AnityA](https://x.com/Jin_AnityA/status/1892190394324250988) You didn't quite realize that you are a rather special type of person who thinks that work is everything and problem solving is your job.
>  I didn't understand, nor did I intend to, that while it's great for people who can be creative and problem-solve, there are many who don't want that. I thought it was normal for a full time employee. If you want to do operations, don't you have to be a full-time employee? I thought.
>  But I later learned that there are quite a few people who would rather do the same job steadily, get paid a certain amount, work a certain amount, go home early and rest.


> [Jin_AnityA](https://x.com/Jin_AnityA/status/1892194511817953532) "Productivity" is a measure for management, not for workers.
>
>  Of course, higher productivity -> higher profit margins -> higher salary levels (sometimes), so it goes around and affects the workers, but directly it is an important concept for management!

> [Jin_AnityA](https://x.com/Jin_AnityA/status/1892195363236585981) "Shifting to higher value-added jobs with AI" is also good for workers who aspire to higher value-added jobs, right? Good for those who want to do more interesting work in their careers.
>  But there are a lot of people who aren't so sure, aren't there? I didn't understand that very well (or didn't want to), so a lot of stones were flying. I miss it...


> [Jin_AnityA](https://x.com/Jin_AnityA/status/1892196703971037687) When management makes "productivity" a strong message, it's a statement of its will to complete it, and it's about "who to throw under the bus and who to throw under the bus. That's what we're talking about, isn't it?
>  Same as the remote work release, including a declaration of intent that is not explicitly stated.
>  I think it is a bit more mature to understand the message as "We don't value people who are not interested in the company's profit, value-added or problem-solving" (soft expression).


> [Jin_AnityA](https://x.com/Jin_AnityA/status/1892210016137945387) This story...
>  >[Jin_AnityA](https://x.com/Jin_AnityA/status/1867906076160750076) Tweets are flowing in that are raging about full remote stops, but if you really don't like it, you can change jobs, go independent, or FIRE any option you want because the company is your employment contract. You have the right x.com/Jin_AnityA/sta...


> [Jin_AnityA](https://x.com/Jin_AnityA/status/1892354358240502042) "We're going to be a little bit selective from now on! So, you put out a message with a positive flavor, or by modifying the system without saying it directly, etc.
>
>  It is kind of them to give us mild notice in advance...

> [Jin_AnityA](https://x.com/Jin_AnityA/status/1892357430094549301) Reducing labor costs and benefits is an action that reduces benefits on the employee side, so management has to decide. It's never proactively offered by the employee side.
>  I'm just saying that employees don't voluntarily lay off or demote co-workers and cause resentment, or give up the right to be comfortable and fully remote.
>  The fundamental incompatibility of the labor-management relationship becomes clear during economic and performance recessions. It is good when there is lots of money to allocate.
>  The reason it is difficult to increase "productivity" through generative AI unless management first takes the initiative and is prepared to do so is because to increase productivity, you have to go into head count/labor costs.
>  Productivity is defined in different ways depending on the industry and type of work,
>  Productivity = operating income / number of employees
>  Productivity = Business Benefits / Number of Members
>  If it's like that, it's either
>  ・Reduce the number of employees
>  ・Increase profit
>  We would say that the number of employees has to be adjusted if there is a glut, but this can only be done by management.
>  At least it's based on a small team (employees) creating more profitable jobs, right?

> [Jin_AnityA](https://x.com/Jin_AnityA/status/1892359542198968647) I think this is also something you can understand if you observe a few people who are players in the capitalist game of management. When you run a company with your own money, you get the blow-by-blow understanding.
>
>  You try to hide your bare economic rationality from your employees as much as possible. It's a disadvantage because it creates unnecessary conflict.

> [Jin_AnityA](https://x.com/Jin_AnityA/status/1892557977636294688) For example, the hiring of engineers, which could be called an engineering boom, is also being reviewed for compensation, i.e., results relative to labor costs.
>
>  Whether it contributes to productivity. In fact, there are quite a few cases where it doesn't, aren't there? And then there are questions like.

> [Jin_AnityA](https://x.com/Jin_AnityA/status/1892558448438776048) If you are not interested in your own business or the value you provide to your customers, what are you going to justify your labor costs? Do you need to be an employee? The very basic question is asked

> [Jin_AnityA](https://x.com/Jin_AnityA/status/1892559545483804683) as the capitalist game tends to be,
>  When the economy and business performance is good, the labor side is strong (seller's market),
>  Conversely, the worse it gets, the stronger the management side becomes (buyer's market).
>
>  Simply because supply and demand can move things around, if you overestimate your ability or assume that the status quo will continue forever, you may find yourself in a situation where you are not able to be passive.

> [Jin_AnityA](https://x.com/Jin_AnityA/status/1892560481417675034) If you look back a little, systems like family-based and lifetime employment have been overturned, and I think it's fair to say that benefits that were put in place for full remotes and hiring are more easily overturned. I think it's fair to say that the benefits that we've put in place for full remotes and hiring are more easily overturned.
>
>  I find it quite interesting that we can so easily forget something that happened a mere 20 years ago or less...

> [Jin_AnityA](https://x.com/Jin_AnityA/status/1892561942339801484) The term productivity has many definitions,
>
>  "We say that actions that move us closer to our goals are productive and actions that move us further away from them are not.
>
>  I also rather like the definition of "a".
>  If you don't know where you want to go, then you can't talk about productivity.

> [Jin_AnityA](https://x.com/Jin_AnityA/status/1892562168648024305) I think productivity is meaningless to those who have no purpose or ToBe.
