title: "Ising Programming Club"
---

- Call for Participants
- Context: [[Programming Quantum Computers]].
- References: [Ising formulations of many NP problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.5843)
- Memo [[Ising formulations of many NP problems]].
- I won't read it without a deadline, so if you get a few people interested, we'll set up a date and I'll present one chapter per person, so how about that?
- Create chat (Slack), Scrapbox
- Let's recruit participants for a winter Prosin or something like that.
- I think it would be better to start with a few people who know each other, because it is difficult to manage a group of people properly.
    - No matter how big we get, we don't want to exceed 30 people.
