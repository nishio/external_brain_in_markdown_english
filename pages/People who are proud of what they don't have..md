Throw it away."
- [[Zen (Buddhism)]]

Throw it away" is a famous Zen phrase "[[authored by a free hand]] (hogejaku)." A typical episode is the following [[koan]].

Itum-yang-sonja asks Zhaoju: "What should I do if I have nothing in my life?
ZHAO ZHOU: "Let go and write (throw away)."
The Venerable One: "What do you throw away when you have nothing more?"
Zhaozhou: "If you can't throw it away, carry it with you" - there the Venerable One realized. ([ddc.shengyen.org](https://ddc.shengyen.org/?doc=04-12-037&utm_source=chatgpt.com))

What to "throw away"?
- We discard the "grasping mind" instead of the object.
- The key is the fall that we must let go of even the notion of "having nothing." It removes the attachment to the throw away/not throw away dichotomy in one stroke. ([ddc.shengyen.org](https://ddc.shengyen.org/?doc=04-12-037&utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Practical implications
- Dogen defines the essentials of zazen as "letting go of all worldly desires, resting and doing all things, and not thinking about good and evil. In other words, the idea is to put aside the evaluation of good and evil, and to simply sit and learn through experience to "detach oneself from body and mind.

Sister Arc of the "Throw Away" Motif (Ref.)
- Tanxia Yakibutsu: An anecdote about a wooden Buddha image that was burned to keep it warm. It is told as a poignant metaphor for burning away attachment to idols (forms) and returning to the essence. ([engakuji.or.jp](https://www.engakuji.or.jp/blog/37324/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Monk carrying a woman on his back by the river: An older monk carries a woman on his back, and when the younger monk later blames him, he responds, "I have already taken her down. When the young monk later blames the elder monk for carrying the woman, the elder monk responds, "I have already let her down, and you are still carrying her on your back. The story is about a young monk who is blamed by an older monk for carrying a woman and later responds, "I have already carried the woman on my back.

Tips on how to use (very practical)
1. name the evaluation, anxiety, and conclusion you are grasping now in your mind in one word (e.g., "anxiety").
2. chant in your mind, "Houkaishaku," and then relax with a "huff" in time with your exhalation.
3. if it still does not leave, just be aware that you are "carrying it" (because resistance = reattachment).
-- This "awareness, loosening, and awareness of adherence" is itself a daily repetition of the three lines of the koan.
