Chatting for Two Hours in Front of a Whiteboard

Write down what comes to mind in the order you remember it:
- This allows strongly memorable things to become opportunities for connection.
- It's an opportunity to clarify your own values that haven't yet been verbalized.
- [[Destruction of the Time Axis Structure]]
    - [[Destruction of the Time Axis Structure]]

Understanding the structure of a game can make it less enjoyable:
- [[Shrines in Tears of the Kingdom]]
- [[Gamification of Work]]

There is information that is difficult to circulate:
- Technology has accelerated the circulation of information that can be disseminated.
    - When duplicated, its rarity decreases.
    - Commoditization
- Abstraction makes it possible to circulate.
    - Can the recipient understand the abstracted product?
        - [[Even if You Bring the Top of the Pyramid, It's Not What You Expected]]
    - It's easier to understand when accompanied by concrete details.
    - When applying, you ultimately need to abstract first.
        - [[Conversion with Abstraction as the Pivot]]

Tips for Good Intellectual Production?
- [[There Is No Silver Bullet]]
- Answers to general questions tend to be highly abstract.
    - High-level abstract answers are often things you already know but haven't connected concretely within yourself.
    - [[Exercise Is Good for Solving Obesity]]
- For example:
    - It's good to spin the gacha many times.
        - Increase the number of times you step up to the plate.
    - MVP
    - PDCA Cycle
    - Hearing something until you're sick of it is because it's truly a truth.
        - In the end, "Exercise Is Good for Solving Obesity"
            - There's no such thing as a good diet method.
- [[Conceptualization Is the Ability to Limit Problems]]
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/構想力は問題を限定する能力/icon' alt='構想力は問題を限定する能力.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Creating more focused questions might be necessary before obtaining answers.

Organizations with Strong Intellectual Productivity
- Inside and outside the organization
    - [[Dual Organization]]
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/二重組織/icon' alt='二重組織.icon' height="19.5"/>

There Are Things That Can and Cannot Be Procured with Money
- [[Difficult-to-Procure Resources]]
- "People, Things, Money, Information"
    - It's common to list these four in parallel, but there are things that can and cannot be procured with money.
- Procureable = there is a market
    - Things that are [[Transferable]] are generally bought and sold with money.
        - [[Non-Transferable Resources]]
    - In the end, does it mean that [[Passion Is a Valuable Resource]]?

Personally, tracing the record of associations I've already thought of is [[Having a Knowledge Network Allows for Fast Travel]], but staying within that network brings no return for me.
- Just a guy who says what he associates
    - Human vector search engine
- Am I expecting to gain new information and expand the network?
- When I was younger, this tendency was stronger, but it seems to have weakened.
    - Ah, that's it.
    - My physical body is predicted to deteriorate in 20 years.
    - As a result, the boundary of "me" is changing.
        - "The totality of publicly available information is me."
    - Planting information (= part of me) into another young and creative body is like bamboo extending its rhizomes to another land.
    - The way the desire for growth manifests is moving away from my physical body, haha.
- In other words, it has changed from "adding new information to my physical body" to "adding new information to a knowledge system that I initially published but has become boundary-less with various people's involvement."

[[Blurring of Organizational Boundaries]]
- [[Smoothing]]

Information Sources
- Losing time and energy to read books is not good.
- Tired and lazily browsing Twitter, not good.
    - Just pressing the bookmark button without writing in Scrapbox
- It's better to have a wide range of information sources as a [[Randomizer]].
    - Don't clarify collection criteria.
    - New things are outside the clarified boundaries.
- Delve into what interests you until you're satisfied.

Having a whiteboard was good.
- Some concepts are costly to convey with words but less so with diagrams.
- On the other hand, "there's something about that written in Scrapbox" is hard to bring up in verbal discussions.
    - Well, even if you convey it, they won't read it on the spot anyway.
- So, doing it with a whiteboard and verbally is a "festival of communication," where you shake things up, break thought frameworks, and introduce new perspectives, and then each person needs to deepen their thoughts asynchronously.
- It seems necessary to have another meeting to bring things together afterward.

I wrote this on the train ride home, so no graphical thinking.

[[Supporting Exponential Growth]]
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/指数的成長の後押し/icon' alt='指数的成長の後押し.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Isn't there also a J-curve?
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Jカーブ/icon' alt='Jカーブ.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Of course, theoretically, there is.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/4789287f27cae07dce872f1dac336b52/thumb/1000)

    - There is also the possibility of a curve like B.
    - But that's in the future, so it's unknowable.
    - Spending the "uninteresting time" of S aiming for B when A's curve is right in front of you is mentally exhausting.
    - Perhaps my life's KPI of maximizing enjoyable time in my life is influencing this.
- Addendum
    - [[Investing in a New S-Curve Is More Profitable]]
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/新しいS字曲線に投資した方が得/icon' alt='新しいS字曲線に投資した方が得.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I used to think like this in the past.
        - It's a difference in whether you think the curve will grow exponentially or stagnate like an S-curve.
        - Basically, history has repeated S-shaped development.
        - Even with an S-curve, the early phase is exponential growth.
        - In the cross-section of June 2024, I think we're at the beginning of an avalanche where the development of LLMs triggers societal changes and things change in a chain reaction, so my perception of it being exponential is getting stronger.
    - Further addendum 2024-08-03
        - Related: [[Exponential Growth After Crossing the Pass]]

- If someone who started with B builds [[Barriers to Entry]], can't A switch to B when A is about to be overtaken?
    - Or can the person who chose B compress the costs paid during the S period for the person in A?
    - In the realm of technology, specifically, tools that initially had no documentation and required trial and error while deciphering source code have developed to the point where they are easy to use later as documentation is organized.
        - Documentation is a transferable resource.
    - On the other hand, the mental model built through that hardship S is a non-transferable resource.
        - For those with this mental model, "you can do it this way" is possible, but for those who joined after the library was organized, there are things they can't do.

        - P, who uses Tool X as a [[Black Box]], does not develop their thinking.
        - Q, who understands the contents, develops their thinking?
            - By what mechanism?
            - Like "I should be able to change C to C'."

[[Reproduction Expansion in Social Capital]]

- When I wrote this, I implicitly assumed the M pattern.
    - In this discussion, I'm not the M pattern.
    - I guess I'm S.

- When the mediator observes demand, they relay information to the source.
    - Information transmission that does not circulate in the market.
- However, this diagram feels a bit off.
    - S is too passive.
    - Well, it's non-comm, so...
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/db55c9d126b03d986a6b532ae882732f/thumb/1000)
    - Initially, I was one of the S.
    - M was someone who actively built relationships with many S.
        - Since their job was a consultant, there must have been a lot of demand on the opposite side that I, as S, couldn't see.
        - After observing the demand, they would choose the appropriate supply, consult, and obtain advanced technical knowledge that wasn't circulated in the market, and by returning it to the demand side, they were acting as a [[Trader]].
- It started like that, with a non-comm engineer being involved by a consultant with strong involvement skills, and then I understood the value of being involved and actively engaged in involvement, leading to the shape of the initial diagram.

Abstracting Interesting Examples
- [[Interesting]]
    - [[Unexpectedness]]
        - [[Blind Spot]]
- [[Closing the Cycle]]
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/サイクルを閉じる/icon' alt='サイクルを閉じる.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - This specific example itself isn't very useful.
    - I saw this tweet and thought, "I see, I never thought of that."
        - Then, why didn't I have that idea? Something was missing, what was it?
    - When abstracted:
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/8aa4e08aff1f3b44fb97d3998f5d97fd/thumb/1000)
        - In the original story, B is skipped to connect A and C.
            - The assumption that "only things with different parity can connect" is pointed out as a misconception.
        - The continuation says, "One person can have both parities."
            - The assumption that "it's either one parity or the other" is pointed out as a misconception.
            - Mistaking non-parity for parity.
            - Making the mistake of thinking non-exclusive attributes are exclusive.
        - #Blind Spot Card Candidate

Scrapbox Allows for [[Stock of Associations]]
- Is there always value in associative links? Should we keep creating links?
- That seems like a hint of [[Misguided KPI Setting]]...
- For example, writing "book" on every book page is not beneficial.
- What is a beneficial link and what is not?
- Anyone can see a book and think "this is a book," it's a commodity.
    - When few people associate A with B, isn't there value in the link between A and B?
    - [[The Relationship Between the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard and the Doctrine of the Salvation of Evil People]]
    - It's like connecting distant things in an embedding space.
    - Why is it valuable?
    - By connecting distant things, it allows for fast exploration by following them?
        - [[Having a Knowledge Network Allows for Fast Travel]]

The Reflection on a Two-Hour Meeting Is Not Ending at All
- Because it's increasing while reflecting, haha.

There's a Vein of Gold at the End of Digging
- Nothing
- A little something
    - When you dig, you hit a big vein of gold.
- No passion, but digging because I was told to.
    - Even if nothing comes out, it's not my fault~
    - The boss who said to dig here is to blame, not me.
    - Give me a salary for the amount I dug.
- Is it necessary to dig with [[Passion]]?
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/9741473d5902e1e3115fbf992b3b61d7/thumb/1000)
    - I remember drawing a similar picture.
- It was there, but slightly different.

- [[Deepening Expertise]]
    - And when you reach something the world hasn't done yet, it becomes a [[Ph.D.]]
        - [[The Illustrated Guide to a Ph.D.]]
- Tried it once, couldn't grow to like it.
    - I'm the type to dig various things whimsically.
    - Then fill in the gaps later.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/9dc6240daf85cd5c675c92c473cfd47f/thumb/1000)
- The set of human achievements is [[Spiky in High-Dimensional Space]]
    - There are many gaps.
- [[Serial Mastery]]
    - [[Serial Mastery Is a Barbell Strategy]]

How Deep Should You Dig into What Interests You for It to Be Effective as "Expertise"?
- Processing it into [[Live Ammunition]]
    - Making it a usable card
- What is live ammunition, what is a usable card?
    - Resources that others cannot easily acquire
        - Resources that cannot be procured in the market
    - [[Activity History Is a Difficult-to-Procure Asset]]
        - It's like processing this asset into a better weapon.
        - It's not 0 or 1, but gradually grows.
            - 0.9 becomes 0 when rounded down.
            - When it becomes 1, it becomes usable.
            - While using the 1 card, it might grow to 2 through random events.
                - [[Rolling Snowball]]

[[Metaphor of Supercooling]]
- Crystals grow rapidly with random stimuli.
- Stimulating water that isn't cold is meaningless.
- The "cold state" is important.
    - [[New Combination and the Metaphor of the Water Surface]]
        - Creating bonds without a difference in the water surface is meaningless.

The Story of [[Connecting the Dots]]
- [[Opportunities for Decisions Are Linked Like Beads]]
- The value of a [[Retrospective]] is determined after the results are out.
