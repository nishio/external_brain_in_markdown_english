title: "Seven Golden Rules of Guerrilla Warfare"
---

- [[guerrilla warfare]]
- [[Don't]] fight a battle you can't lose.
- [[keep moving constantly]]. [[hit-and-run]], [[attack and retreat]].
        - [[multi-power]] 、 [[movement]] 、 [[nomad]]
    - [The enemy is the main supplier of weapons.
    - [[Weapons are taken from the enemy.]]
- [[hide the movement]].
- Utilize [[surprise attack]] in military actions.
- If there is room, create a new vertical squadron.
    - To "create a new vertical" means to create a new combat unit or organization.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt-4/icon' alt='gpt-4.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Guerrilla warfare is conducted in small combat units, which often move independently
        - Distribute combat power to deal more effectively with threats

            - [[Teamwork arising from stand-up play]]
- In general, three things should be kept in mind while proceeding. Namely,
    - [[Strategic Defense]],
    - [[balance between enemy and guerrilla actions]],
        - [[Decrease in the destruction of the enemy]]

While helpful in some respects, a common problem with many [[book on military strategy]] is that it assumes a situation where there is a clear "[[enemy]]".
As for "weapons should be taken from the enemy."
- War is envisioned, so it is described as "the enemy."
- Translated into the context of the [[management of resource-poor organizations]] argument, "[[resources should be acquired from outside]]."
- This "outside" is a "[[partner]]" that provides resources, so it is often not appropriate to describe it as an "enemy".
- Also, in the case of war, there is one enemy, but there can be multiple external resource sources
        - [[parallel work]]
