title: "subject omission"
---

There is an implicit assumption in the expression "the subject is omitted" that it exists but is not expressed by omission, but this is an interpretation from the cultural perspective of a language with a subject.

Claims written in the language of mathematics
$\forall x(P(x)→Q(x))$
means "for all $𝑥$, if $P(x)$ then $Q(x)$".
The $x$ in this claim is just a variable and has no deeper meaning.

In Japanese, this is often expressed as [$ P(\cdot) → Q(\cdot)
- There is no rose without a thorn
- more haste, less speed



- [[Subject omission and machine translation failures]]
[[Japanese subject omitted]]
[[subject omitted]].

Subject omission in imperative sentences
- Could it be that the English language expresses commands by subject omission, and therefore subject omission is not possible because of the fact that the variable is a temporary variable?
- In Japanese, you can use the imperative form at the end of a word.
- It's not unlike [Use "we" because "you" has an imperative nuance.


- [[Omitted when the subject is obvious from the context]]
