- relevance
        - [[Observations on the Publishing Industry]]
        - [[People who think for themselves want a list of facts and information.]]
- > [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1638516208789262336) I'm sure books will be personalized and summarized by an AI that estimates the knowledge network model in my brain!
- >  I think amazon is going to create an AI or something that will search for appropriate knowledge from the library.
- >  This will increase the number of people buying books.
- > [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1638516658204704769) I guess the next step will be the age of buying books to make personalized AI smarter...

- > [hrjn](https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1638515949270876160) It won't change in terms of producing books, but it will change the way people read them. After all, we can't handle information that doesn't exist in this world in any way, so we have to write it.
- >  Or maybe you could just write the facts as you see fit and it would autoplay the intro (or a summary of related research) and a summary or so.
- > [hrjn](https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1638516184818782208) In other words, there is one chance that the act of writing a book will be reduced to "[[novelty (patentability)]]" only and incidental information will be fleshed out as appropriate. It may be.

- > [yhara](https://twitter.com/yhara/status/1638514754938638342) Ah, so it could be something like "a book with the same content, but with varying degrees of annotation depending on the reader's [[prior knowledge]]"?

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1638517667102597122) Many people may think of writing a book as writing, but I checked today and my Scrapbox is 58 times larger than the "technology behind coding" It's a lot of volume, and in the writing process, I output more and then cut it down to complete it.
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1638519577490657280) Essentially, it's a question of "what order to put the knowledge that's on the grid in a single stroke", "B should be first to explain A", "But because of its relationship to other things... Then B should be first...", "It would be more efficient to repeat a detailed loop, but the whole thing would have to be divided into a dozen or more chapters...", "The depth limit of the heading..."...
    - [[Knowledge Network]]
    - [[Books are a tool for finitization]]
    - [[Books are already a product of abstraction]]
> The hard part is to "put yourself in the shoes of readers who don't know the details" and "format it in a way that makes it easy for them to read," something you already know "in detail enough to write a book," and LLM can play the reader's role.
    - [[It's hard for one person to play two roles.]]
- [[LLM will play the role of reader.]]

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1638532912533606401) I'm a little fuzzy on whether [[classic]] and [[preprint]] are two ends of a [[barbell]] if we limit it to the activity of "reading". Old enough sentences are swallowed as LLM training data via the Gutenberg project, etc. The edge of [[copyright]], "a system whereby old humans get in the way of AI to protect their vested interests," may be the edge of the barbell.
