title: "Generate flow"
---

- On the metaphor of "creating [[flow]]"
- A lot of people seem to think of something that is already flowing and think of it as a strong flow that is aligned in one direction.
- however
    - Basic premise: It's stopped at this point.
    - When something that is stopped begins to flow, it cannot begin as a "strong flow aligned in one direction".
    - All the water suddenly moves in one direction at once."
        - In an organization, everyone moves in one direction at once.
    - That's impossible.
- First, stir in the proper direction.
    - Create a state of "not standing still."
    - This "creates flow."
- It grows into a "big flow" after the fact.

Another metaphor: [[Even if it makes a hole in the levee.]]
    - Small hole in [[levee]].
- Nearby water begins to trickle down.
- That flow causes the hole to gradually enlarge.
- Water flow becomes progressively stronger.
    - [[Positive feedback]] occurs and the levee breaks
- Water flows out all at once.
