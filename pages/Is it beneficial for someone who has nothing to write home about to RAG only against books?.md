Is it beneficial to [[RAG]] only against [[BOOK]] if one does not have [[written material]]?

I have about 60 books worth of my own writing, I have experienced RAG for this, I have cut and scanned books, I have experienced RAG for that as well.
Q: Is it beneficial for someone who has no written work to RAG only against books?

A: It's beneficial, but I don't think its form of usefulness is what you're expecting.
- You don't get the same knowledge without reading a book as you do when you read a book.
    - It's more of a painful reading than a normal reading.
- usefulness
        - [[rhetorical afterimage]] in [[The Serendipity of Random Reading]].
        - [[syntopic reading]]
            - [[Read three books in the same field and you'll become an expert.]]
    - These effects are beneficial
    - concrete example
            - [[Insights from inner experience are key to approaching more responsive governance]]
        - Issuing the appropriate query yielded five relevant document fragments.
        - This is a state of binge reading of 5 books in parallel, and luckily, serendipity drew "encountering related fragments".
        - If you build on this over time, you can create a network of knowledge that crosses multiple books.
- Reading a book from the beginning is usually an easy read because it is designed to flow smoothly
    - In contrast, this reading ignores context and jumps to the most relevant part.
    - Read back and forth from there.
        - As I was writing this, I was thinking that it might be assumed that books can be read in reverse order in the first place.
            - Well, but if you chop it up a little and read it, even someone who can only read from the front can probably do it...
    - I thought that [[Reading]] in an era with LLM] would be different from what it had been, but one of those "different forms" is now a reality at my fingertips!
