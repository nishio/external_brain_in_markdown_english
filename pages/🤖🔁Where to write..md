### Digest of Research Notes
.

Regarding "I don't think about where to put things at first," we see a connection with Nishio's fragments "If I have to worry about where to store things, I can't find them" and "People who put things back where they belong and people who put things where they can be seen." The way of thinking and behavior patterns about the placement of things differ according to individual environments and experiences, and each is rational in its own way.

Regarding "the biggest key to innovation is not to judge," this is relevant to Nishio's "notice and then decide what to ignore" fragment. There is no time to deal with everything, and discarding is necessary.

Advice on managing things and information includes, "Don't buy things you don't know where to put them," and "Record your TODOs on a list as soon as you think of them." The concept of the "branching effect" has been proposed. This is the phenomenon that once you start cleaning up one area, you start worrying about other areas, indicating the importance of focusing on one task at a time.

The fragment "Scrapbox is very useful for storing ideas that you don't know where to put," provides useful information on how to manage ideas.

These notes allow us to think deeply about the importance of managing and discarding objects and information, and the effectiveness of the thought processes and tools that support these choices.

The way of thinking and behavior patterns regarding the placement of things differ according to individual environments and experiences, and each is rational in its own way. In addition, the experience of "not being able to find the scissors" gives rise to the behavior of clarifying the location of objects.

Regarding "the biggest key to innovation is not to judge," this is relevant to Nishio's "notice and then decide what to ignore" fragment. There is no time to deal with everything, and choices must be made. Choosing by feeling at first, and then later verbalizing the reasons for the choice, will lead to greater self-understanding.

Advice on managing things and information is offered, such as "don't buy things you don't know where to put them" and "record your TODOs on a list as soon as you think of them."
