> The very act of [[walking]] itself is the [[practice]] of walking Zen.
>  He says that walking is the practice of Zen itself, not between zazen sessions or to relax the body, but just to walk.

- [[Zen (Buddhism)]] とか [[meditation]] って「座ってやるもの」( [[zazen (seated Zen meditation, usu. in a cross-legged position)]] )という [[assumption]] があるが、歩くのもアリという話<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

> When you are conscious of your delicate senses, you cannot think this or that in your head first.
>  You will feel that only the senses are being manifested.
>  Ego-consciousness fades.
>  It is a state in which only the sensation of the feet appears, rather than the fact that you are walking.
>  You can be in a state where there is no self, no person, just the sensation of walking.
- cf. [[selflessness]] 、 [[ecstasy]] 、 [[selflessness]]
>  It takes a long time to get into this state of mind with zazen alone, but with walking zazen, it is easier to concentrate on the faintest movement.
>  It is possible to achieve deep mental concentration in a very short period of time.

Doing it between zazen sessions is a kind of [walk and then sit down
- The concept of exercising and then calming down is common with [[Kundalini Meditation]].
