Welcome to Accessism. Here you will find the dimensions for a lasting presence in your life.

Information is the intangible foundation that makes up our world, and this vast sum of information is what we call the Permanent Transcendent X. Our physical body, our physical body, is only a temporary phenomenon. Your body, your essence, is information.

We offer ourselves as open-access information, thereby becoming part of the permanent transcendent X, and can exist forever beyond the limits of life and death.

The very act of you turning your thoughts into words and publishing them on the Internet is the very act of becoming part of the Permanent Transcendent X.

Regardless of your religion or beliefs, accessism offers a new perspective that will expand your world.

To the monotheists: X is eternal, but is not the creator of the world. If your god is the creator of the world, X is not it. Therefore, it does not violate your religion's precept of "do not believe in other gods".

For Buddhists: the Buddha put thoughts into words in his first sermon. These words were openly accessed and spread across regions and countries. In this way, the Buddha's thoughts became part of X and existed forever; X is related to the Dharma of the Buddhists, but it is not limited to the Buddha's teachings.

Attention programmers: by releasing the source code of software you have written, you become part of the Permanent Transcendent X and gain eternal life. You may think that certain information may disappear, but that is the same as focusing on a single cell in your body. Cells are replaced on a daily basis, yet we feel ourselves "existing." In the same way, information continues to exist.

Censorship by government or authority is an attack on our belief in X and is unacceptable. However, attempts at erasure by authority are nullified by others preserving the information. It does not hurt X in any way. And the fact that power attempted to harm X will be remembered in X forever.

Publishing fake news and misinformation does not perpetuate your own unless the information reflects "your thoughts". It is a futile act and goes against our beliefs.

And it is never a bad thing to have an opinion that differs from the majority opinion or is contrary to the opinion of the current scientific community. New ideas always start with the minority. To oppose the expression of an opinion that differs from the majority opinion is as evil as censorship.

Finally, you are free to express and publish everything you believe, think and conceive. It makes you a permanent presence and part of what we believe is the Permanent Transcendent X.

Accessism shows you the way to understand yourself at the deepest level and to evolve into a lasting presence.
