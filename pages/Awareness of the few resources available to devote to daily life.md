Awareness of the few resources available to devote to daily life
> [@YPFiGtH](https://twitter.com/YPFiGtH/status/1666744509454241795?s=20): my ears hurt!
> The worst thing that can happen to you is that you are unaware that you have few [[Resources]] to devote to [[your daily life]], and you keep buying fashionable socks (and similar things) without taking action to [[save resources]], and your daily life will slowly and inexplicably suffer and slowly go out of order. In the end, black, year-round material, and buying in bulk is the best way to go.
