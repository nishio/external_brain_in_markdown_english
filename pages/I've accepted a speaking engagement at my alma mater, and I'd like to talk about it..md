title: "I've accepted a speaking engagement at my alma mater, and I'd like to talk about it."
---

summary
- I felt bewildered about a project with a long-overdue deadline.
- This is the anxiety of being in a fog where you can't see what's ahead.
- When you talk to the chatbot about your state of confusion, it becomes text, and by looking at it, you can deepen your understanding of the current situation.
- Once you realize that you are in a fog, you can talk to the chatbot about what you need to do next to get out of it

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "talk" is that "talk"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The lecture itself is still a long way off, but I want to take a step forward by giving it anyway, because I'll be slammed if the deadline approaches without doing anything, and above all, doing nothing is also a waste of time [[Zeigarnik effect]].
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "waste" is this "waste"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>When I have something on my mind, I keep remembering it over and over, time and concentration are taken up by it, but I get nothing out of it because I'm not doing anything.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "how many degrees" is that "how many degrees"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>When you get into a state of mind and remember, you stay in the same state unless you do something to get out of it, so "Oh, I have to do something" is repeated.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>NGKW Same condition as far as
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is its "condition"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I want to move forward with the project, but have not verbalized a specific way to proceed. So we're talking about just making a plan to alleviate this.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that "condition"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Staying in this state is a loss and I want to get out of it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is this "state" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>There is a blur in my head. Ah, well, "write it down anyway" is one of the beneficial options to change the state.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>How do you know its "condition"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I can tell by the bewildered mood.

- What does this "state" look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Fog, maybe. I think they are anxious because they can't see what's ahead.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "fog" is that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Something that prevents us from seeing what lies ahead. The opposite condition is a scene where it's clear and crisp, you can see the path you need to take, and you can even see what's ahead of you on the road.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is the "state" of the art?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Mind. After all, it's me that's creating that state of mind.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "myself" is this "myself"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>People who procrastinate and get impatient when the deadline approaches.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "giggle" is that "giggle"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Procrastinate without action.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the "destination" of this "destination"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I'll do it later, not now, and I don't decide when exactly I'm going to do it. Then, the next time they remember, the state of the situation hasn't changed, so they procrastinate in the same way.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>If you have a vague, foggy feeling about a task that makes you want to procrastinate, talking to a chatbot can clear the fog, help you see the path forward, and get you out of your dithering state.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen with respect to that "condition"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I hope the fog clears.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to the "state" for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I think it would be good if the state of being bewildered could be put into text through chat, etc., so that we could see it, understand it better, and come up with more concrete tasks.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Can you do that with respect to the "state of the art?"
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>So this chat helped me realize that I am in a fog, but it is not a concrete task to proceed with the lecture project. It would be good to discuss next time "what exactly we are going to do about this project".

- Where does this "state" come from?
