I see, you don't distinguish between words. Makes sense.

When I was talking about "[[Self-Management Strategies]]" and "I, the manager, am responsible for the management of my economic entity," some people started talking about capitalists and wealthy people, and I wondered what they were talking about. I wondered.

When a stranger suddenly started throwing out a barrage of stories about disparities, I responded, "It's subjective to you, so I don't disagree," to which he replied, "You probably grew up in a bong anyway, didn't you?" I replied, "It's your subjective opinion, so I don't disagree with it.
