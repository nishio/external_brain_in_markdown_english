title: "A free society is a society of inequality"
---

A [[free society]] is a [[disparate society]].
    - [[freedom]]  /  [[disparity]]

> [daijapan](https://twitter.com/daijapan/status/1726167856596029493) A free society is a society of inequality. Those [[who can raise themselves]] will be able to push through, and those who can't will be left behind.

    - [[spontaneity]]  /  [[A person who learns from his or her own experience]]

> [daijapan](https://twitter.com/daijapan/status/1726168768290951625) If you give individuals freedom, geniuses will break through and ordinary people will fail to grow.

> [daijapan](https://twitter.com/daijapan/status/1726170237119398055) I still think it is better to have a system that encourages learning with a bit of coercion rather than complete freedom and not too dependent on the individual's motivation.
