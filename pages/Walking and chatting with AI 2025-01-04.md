Walking and chatting with AI 2025-01-04
- Vague as to whether "with AI" is over "walk" or "chatting" or "chatting while walking."

The following is a summary of the main points of the conversation so far, with modifications and supplements, mainly from human (you) statements.

1. review of July and August and the "pinning" issue
- I left it "pinned" for about 6 months and have not been able to organize or look back on the information.
    - We are halfway through the process, not knowing where to start.
    - We need to take time to reflect and organize the information.

2. management and systems for public and private information
- I was using Scrapbox, but it is inconvenient because there is no API for AI to write automatically.
- He thinks it would be good to create a management system in which AI can also write," but has not yet decided on a specific method.
    - There is an idea to combine GitHub + [[Obsidian]] + Markdown.
    - We are also building a system of [[Devin.ai]] + Slack + GitHub, but it is too much work for a human to write out.
    - It is also worth considering the method of having a conversation using ChatGPT + [[Advanced Voice]] and exporting it as is, as in this case.
    - As the concept of [[Inbox]] in [[GTD]], the essence is to "put in whatever comes to mind," and it is not necessary to be concerned with human keyboard input.
- Use of public information and hidden cards (non-public information)
    - A "[[hidden card]]" is information or an event that is likely to occur at some point in the future but has not yet been made public.
    - It is important to formulate strategies based not only on public information, but also on this "lying-down card".
    - In order to use the face-down cards effectively, it is necessary to build a system that appropriately manages non-public information while linking it to public information.

(3) Transmission in English and utilization of existing systems
- Rather than creating a new system, it is important to first restore and maintain the existing system.
- We have a system that puts translations in Scrapbox and we want to move it because it has stopped updating.
- We also have a static distribution system called "[[mem]]" and would like to update this as well since people are watching.

4. reflection and thinking
- We do a text-based weekly review in public, but we also need a private review.
    - Methods such as "[[Fireworks to think about]]" are required to think deeply in a two-dimensional KJ-legal arrangement.
    - Mixed talk of "private reflection is necessary" and "how to place two dimensions KJ-legally," but both important realizations.
- Because the electronic KJ method does not disappear but accumulates more and more information, it is easy to overload information without preparing a digest.
    - A system of periodic summaries and digests is required.

summary
- subject
    - Need to review the information that has accumulated (especially for July and August).
    - We would like to find a system that can manage public and private information well while also allowing the AI to write to the system.
    - We would like to restore and utilize existing mechanisms such as English-language transmission.
- issue
    - How do we organize and reflect on information that has been left "pinned"?
    - Establish tools/workflow that both AI and humans can write easily.
    - How to manage and operate public and private information separately.
    - Digestion of large amounts of accumulated information and the use of KJ-legal approaches.
- Future Direction
    - Consider using ChatGPT + voice input, etc. as a means of consolidating into GTD's Inbox.
    - For English dissemination, two existing systems, Scrapbox and MEM, were updated and maintained.
    - To solve the problem of "information overload" that the electronic KJ method suffers from, a system of periodic summarization will be created.
    - We will look to develop a strategy that utilizes both public and hidden cards (non-public information).
These are the main topics addressed in this conversation.
