> [realNuun](https://x.com/realNuun/status/1833760823468327401) I've been thinking a lot lately that humans feel secure and happy to be included in a hierarchy, even if they are on the inferior side.
>  When you are integrated into a hierarchy, you only have to think near your status, so you can belong to a large community with a low cognitive load
>
>  I've been <guessing life> on a v-liver delivery app, and it felt like a device for <me> to gain a place in the hierarchy by throwing money at it.
>  Throwing money at a guesser raises my position in the fan ranking. The guesser who is thrown money gets a higher position in the Liver Ranking. And I get a clear identity to say "I am the fan ranking M of the Nth-ranked Riber in the Riber Ranking".
>  I still feel like it's important to make up a status game to lose comfortably because everyone wants to lose to a stronger entity than they are.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1841373313089864095) I was thinking of the story that "[bonds (between people)" originally meant a string to tie a horse or dog to.
>  When ties become too few, people want ties more than freedom, so they go and tie themselves to something.

> [realNuun](https://x.com/realNuun/status/1841373867757248739) I see. 〜〜〜〜
>  Like going out of your way to play games and follow the rules, there is "going to be tied down for the sake of being tied down".
>  BeReal and others, I feel like I'm going to be tied down.

> [MalionDiaz](https://x.com/MalionDiaz/status/1833768049570467864) It was like "I want to clarify and recognize my social position, status, and location" instead of wanting to lose.

> [realNuun](https://x.com/realNuun/status/1833768919422943519) "Clarify the position" is the goal and "lose" is the means, but there is a section of the brain that is no longer under the illusion that losing feels good.
>  I'm a bit off, but I also think that when a slightly better-educated person praises a Tokyo University graduate and "loses", it makes him feel good because his academic status game is solidified and he is "winning" against someone less educated than himself.

The point that "[[people]] feel secure in being included in a hierarchy" refers to the concepts of "[[social solidarity]]" and "[[anomie]]" discussed by the French sociologist [Emile Durkheim. [[Durkheim]] argued that people locate themselves in social connections in order to locate themselves and gain psychological stability. On the other hand, he stated that when those connections are lost, anomie (lack of norms) arises and people fall into a state of instability. This suggestion that participation in the hierarchy creates a sense of security is exactly in line with Durkheim's need for social solidarity.

The point about "wanting ties and going to be bound themselves" is also reminiscent of [[Erich Fromm.]]'s "[[Escape from Freedom]]". Fromm points out the contradiction in modern society, where individuals seek freedom while choosing to subordinate themselves to authority and groups to escape loneliness and anxiety. In this discussion, Fromm's ideas are also connected to the point that people seek bonds and feel secure by placing themselves in hierarchies such as game rules or "guessing games".

Finally, the point about "rejoicing in losing in order to clarify one's position" is [[Friedrich Nietzsche's]] "[[Sklavenmoral (slave morality, as a philosophical concept of Nietzsche)]]" and "[[will to power]]" related to. [[Nietzsche]] argues that people define their position by recognizing the strength and authority of others and may rejoice in that position as "[[a]] virtue of the weak." This tendency to find one's position through participation in the hierarchy and to view the act of "[[losing]]" as positive in itself can be found in common with Nietzsche's argument.

Thus, the contemporary argument against "[[searching for a]] suitable candidate (e.g., for a job)" or [[positioning the self within a hierarchy]] is also closely related to classical sociological and philosophical concepts.

When I saw "I want to be tied up, so I go and get tied up myself", I thought of "[[Escape from Freedom]]", and I wondered if AI could replace the intellectual production of associating with it [[associative conjunctive prompt]], and this is what I found.
