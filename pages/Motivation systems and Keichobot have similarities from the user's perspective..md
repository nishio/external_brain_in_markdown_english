Motivation systems and Keichobot have similarities from the user's perspective.
> [@yuya_takeyama](https://twitter.com/yuya_takeyama/status/1567020206425534464): I think it's a web service created by NISHIO Hirokazu that helps me organize my mind when it's all over the place. I think it's a web service created by NISHIO Hirokazu, but I don't know the URL of it.
> [@mactkg](https://twitter.com/mactkg/status/1567030685801787393): @yuya_takeyama Is it around here?

> [@yuya_takeyama](https://twitter.com/yuya_takeyama/status/1567031835481489414): @mactkg It wasn't this one. It's not a chat UI, but rather a screen transition based on the answer to a question. How many things do you have to do? -> "How many things do you have to do?" -> "Multiple" -> "Let's narrow it down to one thing first".
> [@mactkg](https://twitter.com/mactkg/status/1567033743239712768): @yuya_takeyama I guess the rest is this!

> [@yuya_takeyama](https://twitter.com/yuya_takeyama/status/1567034428064669696): @mactkg This was it! I bookmarked it. Thank you for your help!
