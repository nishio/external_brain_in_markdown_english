title: "Double coincidence of desires"
---

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The term "double coincidence of desire" refers to the situation in [[barter]] where both parties want what the other has at the same time. For example, if you want the other party's apple and the other party wants your orange, an exchange can only take place. If these conditions are not met, the transaction will be difficult and economic activity will be inefficient. [[currency]] functions effectively as a mediating instrument that does not require a "double coincidence of desires."
