I had [[Devin]] draft the lecture material.
    - [[Digital Democracy 2030 Study Group]]
- [https://app.devin.ai/sessions/5c763dd8eaba42efb3757b15087dc0a8](https://app.devin.ai/sessions/5c763dd8eaba42efb3757b15087dc0a8)
- I don't know if I'll ever edit in Devin after the big picture of the stones is done.

The repository will delete the data files and publish them after the various things are done.

Today's TODO
- Week 4 Summary of Digital Democracy 2030
    - Political funds are empty for Issue and PR, being generated by Devin.
    - Website is not on GitHub for discussion, take it from Slack
