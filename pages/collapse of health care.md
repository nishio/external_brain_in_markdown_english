title: "collapse of health care"

I guess medical collapse doesn't "collapse" from "not collapsing" to "collapsing" with a simple "bang, boom, poof". It's more like a gradual increase in the frequency of dysfunction.
> Until a few months ago, a patient with a sudden change could access any of the core hospitals by pressing the "call an ambulance" option. In the past few weeks, we have been getting a lot of calls with the option, "The ambulance is here, but we can't find a place to receive it. What should we do?" and there have been rare occasions when I have been called back and I honestly wondered what I was going to do.
