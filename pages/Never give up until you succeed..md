- It is often said that "I'm not giving up until I succeed" is a necessary condition for [[success]], but the necessary condition for that is "to be convinced of the correctness of the theme so that you can continue even if you don't succeed immediately". If you say "just keep going" to someone who lacks this, it will only be hard for them.
    - [[Kohei Okubo]] Hmmm, that's a tough one.
    - I don't think the certainty of rightness has much to do with it. People who are not convinced of the correctness will continue to do so, and even those who are convinced of the correctness are quick to give up.
    - It seems to me that there are those who are good at trial and error and those who are bad at it.
    - A person who comes up with only three solutions to a problem will give up after three attempts, but a person who comes up with twenty will try twenty times.
    - Also, similar to above.
    - I feel that there are so many patterns where the procedure or logic is a->b->c, and when c is not good enough, people try to go through the b branch and fix a.
- [[Izumi Kawashima]] It must take time and effort to make a theme that has fallen from the heavens come to you, but for some reason, I sometimes feel that many people don't put emphasis on that.
    - [[Shinichi Kato]] One diabetes doctor said in an interview, "[Gumption doesn't last. We all know that it is right to cut back on sweets and exercise.
    - [[Michinobu Uda]] I generally agree with you. However, I think that if there is some kind of driving force to keep going, even if it is not right or certain, people will continue to do so. And if he can create that drive, he will continue to do so for a long time.
- nishio> Indeed. In my post, I wrote "certainty," but even if you are not certain, you can still say, "This won't work..." or "This will work..." or "This will work... But if I can come up with solution after solution, I'd like to try it. If I can come up with solution after solution, I will continue to try them without "[[tolerance]]" in a desire-driven manner, and that will be the "[[driving force]]"?
    - [[Haruyuki Seki]] Even if you are not convinced from the beginning, if you keep trying, your knowledge will increase and it may become more and more interesting. I, too, think that the ability to continue with a moderate amount of trial and error is important.
