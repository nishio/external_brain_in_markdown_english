> Jodo Shinshu is one of the sects of [[Mahayana Buddhism]], a Japanese Buddhist sect based on [[Pure Land Buddhism]] and one of the Kamakura Buddhism. Shinran (third highest of the eight hereditary titles), a monk of the early Kamakura period, inherited and developed the true teaching of Pure Land Buddhism, which was revealed by his teacher [[Honen]]. After Shinran's death, his students and disciples developed it into a religious order.

> The biggest difference between Jodo Shinshu and other Buddhist sects is that monks are allowed to have carnal relations with their wives, and there are no precepts (until the Meiji era, Shinshu was the only Buddhist sect that outwardly allowed wives).... Shinran... Shinran was the first monk to officially marry and have a child.

I was invited to [[enter priesthood]] and asked for more details (to be precise [[entering priesthood]]).
- It's relatively easy to become one if you want to be.
- But the problem is that I don't share the Mahayana Buddhist philosophy at all.
    - Quicksilver's "I don't sympathize with you at all, but I'm ordained in form only" is disrespectful to the master.
- It seems that "people in academia tend to go to [[Zen (Buddhism)]] and [[Shingon Buddhism]]."
