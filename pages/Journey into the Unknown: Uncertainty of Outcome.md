You are a shaman. You have received the following oracle. Explain this.

stop (doing, working, being supplied)
I'm moving on to something I'm not really interested in.
all we've got
There's no food.
Can you get there?
You never know what you'll end up with.

Since this oracle is expressed in poetic language, its interpretation may vary from person to person. However, it can be interpreted as follows:

> be suspended
This area may indicate a situation where the person is either satisfied with the current position or situation or is seeking respite or retrieval from change or progress.

> Going on to something I'm not really interested in.
> I got it all.
> I'm out of bait.
These lines may indicate a situation where necessities and satisfactions are in short supply." The words "taken up" and "no food" suggest a depletion of resources and a lack of means to achieve satisfying results. This may include not only physical resources, but also mental and emotional resources." The phrase "moving on to less interesting places" may indicate an unwillingness to move on to new places and experiences.

> Can you get to it?
> I don't know what we'll end up with.
These lines indicate uncertainty about unknown outcomes and the future. They state that the consequences of choices and actions are not obvious, and what we "arrive at" as a result is unknown.

Throughout, the oracle indicates a progression or change from the current situation, recognizing the uncertainty that it may not always be desirable. And it indicates that it is uncertain what the final outcome of that progression or change will be. This may symbolize the uncertainty of life, the inevitability of change, and our response to it.

Can you give me specific examples of situations in which this oracle would apply?

This oracle is very poetic and abstract and can be applied to a wide variety of situations. Here are a few specific examples

- Career transition: You have worked in a particular profession for many years, but your passion and interest in that work has waned and you are seeking a new challenge. However, your new career path is uncertain and you are not sure what the outcome will be. This oracle may represent the conflict and uncertainty in such a situation.

- A change in relationships: a situation where a long-lasting friendship or partnership has ended and you are looking for a new relationship. This may find sympathy in the "taken up" and "no food" areas. And while the path to a new relationship may "go on to less interesting places," uncertainty about the new path is indicated because "we don't know what we'll end up with."

- A new adventure or journey: You have decided to leave a known place and enter a new one. This new place may not have been of much interest to you, but you are looking for something new to experience and learn. However, you are uncertain what the outcome of this journey will be.

- A major life change: You are older and contemplating moving on to the next chapter of your life. They may feel "taken out" of all the experience and knowledge they have gained in their lives so far. It is suggested that you cannot "stay" but move on to a new stage of life where you "don't know what you will end up at.

Remember, however, that these interpretations are only examples, and that the oracle's message will vary depending on the circumstances, feelings, and experiences of the recipient.
