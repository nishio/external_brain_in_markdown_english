Starting this week, the operation will be "The most current weekly journal will be titled 'Weekly Journal'".
- Until now, the date has been included in the title, but there is a high cognitive cost in determining which is the newest by looking at the date on the title.
- When I started, I pinned it to the top page, but I changed it to pin only the `Links for me` page.
    - As a result, update the link on that page and forget about it.
- The last day is a guideline. I'll rename it anyway depending on the situation.

Phenomena that had occurred
- A link will be placed in the weekly journal to "Things to reflect on over the weekend".
    - It was usually a process of organizing on Saturdays and Sundays.
    - [[Weekly journal 2023-02-12~2023-02-21]] was created and the link was placed in the same way.
- However, this past weekend [[Unexplored Results Report Meeting 2022]], there was no time on Saturday and Sunday.
- Immediately after that, there was also a huge secret information input, etc. that could not be looked back on: [[secret meeting 2023-02-21]].
    - This bore the "feeling of not being completed" and the link was left unupdated.

It is beneficial to look back at the past, but it is a mistake to spend too much time looking back and not enough time moving forward into the future.
- Life is not always a "regular flow of time".
- So temporarily overflowing or depleting a buffer somewhere happens.

    - Which is more appropriate, Plan A or B?
    - If what you're processing is old and you need to process it all, that would be a B.
        - In that case, you'll keep processing the old one that's long overdue until you have more time to make up for the delay.
    - Do we really need a B?" We need to ask, "Do we really need B?

People, is it possible to build a system that doesn't forget too easily and use it where forgetting is not necessary and the system is suffering?
- TODO list to note tasks that should not be forgotten
- If the "list of tasks that need to be remembered and completed today" cannot be completed today, then the top priority task would be to identify tasks whose deadlines could be changed and negotiate a change in deadline.
- If the "list of tasks I have to remember to finish this week" is not going to get done this week, but tasks are going to be added, I should say, "This week is full, can we do it next week?" you should say, "This week is full, can I do it next week?
- Both have a clear upper limit and a decision is made on whether or not to overflow the limit.
- Adding to the list at a faster rate than consumption would cause it to bloat.
    - [[make a list of things to do that day from /villagepump/next action#63f9a920aff09e0000ff1ba9]]
        - The number of items on the nextaction list is 100 or 200.
            - Too funny.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - You have no estimate at all of how long it would take to do that...
                - It's not estimated, so it adds to the list at a faster rate than it consumes, and it gets inflated.
            - Indeed it is,[[List of items you have thought about doing]] になってそう<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - If it's something like that, I treat it as [[howm reminder pending tasks]].
    - [/villagepump/howm reminder symbol#61f1d09b6eb4060000b59687](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/howm reminder symbol#61f1d09b6eb4060000b59687)
        - Pending (~)
            - From the designated date, ups and downs are repeated
            - Hiding at the bottom until the designated date.
            - The number of days to cycle is specified by the number of days (default 30 days).
            - This is useful for hobby tasks that do not have clear deadlines.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - It looks kind of good to disappear and come up.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - I'm thinking that if you leave something that you're not motivated to do for some reason on the list all the time unless you explicitly delete it, you don't want to see it on the list all the time, so you want it to sink on its own, and since you don't want it to sink all the time, it will come back up when the waters have cooled off.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Speaking of things that usually sink in and sometimes float away...[[step-by-step procedure]] だな<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - It floats in the air with the sensation of getting wider and wider.
        - Mechanisms for sinking without explicit removal

It took me weeks to recover from the chaos of losing my rhythm at the Unexplored Results Briefing!"
- How many weeks, three, four?
- It was two weeks.
- (You're confused.)

Now Saturday 3/4
- I'm resting.
- I got up in the morning, properly in the morning, walked moderately and ate curry from a curry festival at Seven.

Feeling a little sleepy.

- They tell me to sleep 15 hours...

What did you do last week?
- Kozaneba Update
- [[Kozaneba Development Diary 2023-02-27~2023-02-28]]
