title: "paradox of cost-effectiveness"

> The more you can't do something, the more you care about the [[cost effectiveness]] of doing it. If you do something that is so obvious that you can determine at this point that it is cost-effective, everyone is doing it. What everyone else is doing is the least cost-effective. It's better to get the ball rolling and take another step forward.
