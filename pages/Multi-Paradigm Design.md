Paradigm p.17
- > We use these foundations of commonality and variation to formalize the concept of paradigm. A paradigm, as the term is popularly used in contemporary software design, is a way of organizing system abstractions around properties of common- ality and variation. The object paradigm organizes systems around abstractions based on commonality in structure and behavior and variation in structure and algorithm. The template paradigm is based on structural commonality across family members, with variations explicitly factored out into template parameters. Overloaded functions form families whose members share the same name and semantics, and in which each family member is differentiated by its formal param- eter types.
    - I see... C++ has other means besides object-oriented methods, such as templates and function overloading, which are clearly not object-oriented methods, and strong C++ers use each of these methods differently, but at what point do you know which one to use? Which one is better to use at what point in time?

1.3.4 Domains p.33
- > A domain is an area of specialization or interest. We talk about the application domain—the body of knowledge that is of interest to users. Because it is of interest to users, it is hopefully of interest to us. We break down application domains into application subdomains—we divide and conquer. We talk about the solution domain, which is of central interest to the implementors but of only superficial interest to system users. Any given design may deal with multiple solution domains at once, for example, C++ constructs, patterns, and maybe state machines and parser-generators.
    - The application domain is a collection of knowledge about what the user is interested in
    - Solution domain is a collection of knowledge about what the implementer is interested in

:
| Data  | a mechanism to group families of related values |
| -- | -- |
| Overloading | a mechanism to group families of related functions |
| Templates | which group related algorithms or gross data structures |
| Inheritance | which groups classes that behave the same *** |
| * | which also groups classes that behave the same but with later binding than inheritance alone provides |
| **  | typically used for fine-grain variations in code and data |
        - *: Inheritance with virtual functions
        - **: Preprocessor constructs, such as `#ifdef`
        - ***:  (usually public inheritance; we treat private inheritance separately in Section 6.11)
