title: "liberal arts and sciences"

- The words [[science]] / [[liberal arts]] mean so many different things to different people that it's hard to use them.

→ [[law-abiding]] / [[individual descriptive]]  ( [[vindelbund]] )

---Record of Processes

- [[natural history]].
Activities to collect, categorize, and organize facts.
I started writing a page called "Science and Humanities -> Experimental Science and Natural History."

> Attempts to collect and classify things that exist in nature

> Francis Bacon contrasted natural history with natural philosophy, defining natural history as the field of description by memory, whereas natural philosophy is the field of inquiry into causes by reason (The Progress of Learning).

I see, there was also a term for natural history.

Read Kitaro Nishida's Introduction to Philosophy, Chapter 3, Classification of Studies.

Plato's classification of disciplines, dialectics, physics, ethics
- Classification by Human Ability

Bacon placed historiography as the study of memory, divided into memory, imagination, and enlightenment!

In other words, historically, Plato first classified studies according to human capacity, and Bacon, drawing on this, created "classification by subject" by treating human history and natural history separately.

Later, Winderbund and others developed a classification by method rather than subject.

Winderbund makes a distinction between law-establishing and personality-descriptive.
