- No [[solid basis]] of knowledge, logic, etc. can be obtained
- German philosopher [[Hans Albert.]].
- [[A Critical Theory of Reason]]" (1967)
- Modern epistemology [[fundamentalism]] assumes [[justification]] by [[principle of sufficient reason (logic)]], but it develops [[critical rationalism]] as only a kind of [[dogmatism]]. rationalism] as it is only a kind of [[dogmatism]].

- In order for ground B to be correct for A, we need ground C for B, and so on ad infinitum ([[infinite regress]]).
- If you use "[[axiom]]" that does not provide a basis for correctness somewhere, there is no basis for its correctness ([[Aporia of Axiom Setting]]).
- If the chain A -> B -> C -> D -> ... comes back to A somewhere [[circular reasoning]].

- Sometimes it was written as [[infinite regress]], but [[infinite regress]], [[infinite regress]], and [[going backwards without stopping]] are correct.
