title: "Agree with the comments you agree with and pass over the ones you don't."

> >I have been omitting comments of mere affirmation or agreement because they are not informative, but then I would have to mention them in case of denial or disagreement. Do I need to comment in agreement to [[through]] disagreement? Wouldn't it be [[zero information]] if I rephrased what I understood in my own words, instead of mere agreement?
>  The least expensive way to deal with comments is to "let it all go by," but I am not good enough at letting comments I disagree with go by, so I can't put them on the same level as comments I agree with, and I end up going right into them. As a result, I end up having a lot of discussions with the person who wrote the comment I disagree with.
> I guess the correct response is to agree when the comments are agreeable and go through the motions when the comments are disagreeable. It seems obvious when you think about it.

- I realized that this is the equivalent of "[[Not defensive in online discussions]]" in Paul Graham's "Life is Short".
- I think it would be a little more resolved if we followed "[[Mechanism to prevent direct replies]]".
- In other words, when people are "replying" to an opposing opinion to their own, they tend to perceive it as an "attack" and respond to it as a "defense"
    - At this time, you feel that you are "defending yourself because you have been attacked," but the other party feels that the act of defense is an "attack," so escalation occurs
- So you can reply to opinions that you agree with or that you would like to develop, but you shouldn't reply to counter-arguments or defensive arguments against them.
    - Unless it is at least possible to have a calm and constructive discussion.
        - And social networking sites such as X (Twitter) are usually not "[[a]] place for calm and constructive discussion.
    - Go through it, or anonymize or abstract it and write about it in a place like Cosense.
        - Related: [[Not an air rip, but a general statement...]].
