- Lower eyelid of right eye twitching, note
- I consulted with ChatGPT and they told me to pay attention to the following
    - Avoid caffeine and alcohol
        - Well, I drank alcohol yesterday.
    - Warm your eyes with a steamed towel.
    - Look far away for 15 minutes every hour.
    - Sleep a lot (6-8 hours).

I was worried for a while about how it would turn out after the board switch, but I am relieved to know that I can continue to use it.
We need to decide what to do with Devin and move forward with the volunteer group.
