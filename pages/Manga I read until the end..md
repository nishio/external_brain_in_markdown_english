title: "Manga I read until the end."

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1893078002113880489) I said, "Yesterday I was asked, 'Nishio-san, what is the last manga you read?' but I couldn't remember anything."
>  wife "[[dungeon food]] and stuff."
>  I "Oh, sure!"
> I've read all of [[Ryoko Kui]]'s short stories, including [[Terrarium in a drawer]] and others before she became famous for her dungeon food.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1893078736343572709) "And if it's something old and complete, maybe you read [[Yu Yu Hakusho]]?" [[nishio]] "Sure."

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1893081291324797179) Fundamentally, I'm not very good at grasping "whether it's famous or unknown in the eyes of others" for a work, or I'm not very aware of it, which is the implicit assumption when I get questions like this. I have difficulty filtering out "among the famous."

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1893083507293130965) I read the unfinished works whenever a new one comes along, such as "[[Heterogenia Linguistico]]" and "[[Otherworldly Apocalypse Minogura]]".
