title: "Subjectivism doesn't force anyone to move."
---

- [[subjectivism]] does not [[enforce]] [[movement]] on anyone.
- > No one is [[enforced]] to accept a situation that is not the way they want it.
But that doesn't mean "[[No one is]] left behind.
- > If you have unpopular policy preferences, you will end up with folks who have few others to interact with you.
    - Do you think this is a good thing or a bad thing?
    - They're exercising their "freedom to be left behind."
        - If you allow yourself the freedom not to be forced, you can choose to be left behind.
        - To say "I won't be left behind" to those who choose to be left behind is a violation of freedom.
