title: "Four Axes of Resolution"

> [DSyana1003](https://x.com/DSyana1003/status/1839947513245380741) "Resolution" is a word that we have heard many times in the past few years like a buzzword, but by far I really can't tell you how many times I have looked back at Mr. Mada's slides. I can't tell you how many times I've looked at his slides. I think it is super important to understand this (what Mr. Mada writes in general) anyway in order to improve resolution (structuring ability).

> [DSyana1003](https://x.com/DSyana1003/status/1839947909942653416) Here is a slide that I have looked at over and over again. I hope you will watch them dozens of times. I can only be thankful for the modern age where information like this can be found in open source. *Naturally, this is not PR at all.
- [Increase Resolution üî¨ - Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/tumada/jie-xiang-du-wogao-meru) [[Takaaki Mada]] (2021, updated 2023)
    - [[increase resolution (e.g. of a file)]]

In my words, "[[too]] abstract" and "not [[delving into]] [[concrete]]" are "[[not]] deep enough."
As for the size, [[humans are]] full of blind spots, so even if you think you've covered everything, you're usually missing something.
- Structure may help, but conversely it can cause you to discard important things that don't fit into [Existing Structure
        - [[Advantages and disadvantages of the framework]]
    - 'It is either X or not X' is a harmful thought: [[False dichotomy]].
The time change reminded me of "[[wise men learn from history]]" or "[[future that has already happened]]."

Three areas
- [[Customer Resolution]] / [[Planning Resolution]] / [[Industry Resolution]]

- Good story.
- [[client's physician]] / [[isolate symptoms and etiology]].

- Oh, I like this check.
- They may think they are [[unique]], but...
    - [[I don't know myself if it's unique or not]]?
- That's usually what's interesting about reading and listening to project proposals.
    - It's unique to me, and that's why I want to hear more about it, and why I want to support it.
    - Why invest limited resources in that project instead of many other projects, because it is unique
