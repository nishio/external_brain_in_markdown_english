>  Synthetic Technocracy
>  Neutral. Ethnocentrism, even if defensive, can lead to division and impede the global cooperation necessary for technological advancements. It's important to remember that shared know-how and diverse perspectives can significantly contribute to the rapid development of technology. While cultural uniqueness must be respected, an ideal society should aim for global understanding and unity. Ethnocentrism could conflict with this vision by promoting an "us" versus "them" mentality that doesn't value sharing and cooperation.

Nevertheless, it runs the risk of promoting an "us versus them" mentality, potentially leading to exclusionary practices or discrimination against those outside the group. Thus, while ethnocentrism might bolster internal solidarity, it could harm external relations and inhibit mutual understanding among diverse groups. Therefore, it is crucial to balance respect for one's own culture with an understanding and appreciation for other cultures.
