title: '"stuck" is not "safe center" but "edge left behind."'

from  [[Nodal Point of Thought 2023-12-04]]
"stuck" is not "[[safe center]]" but "[[edge left behind]]."
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1731491445050392933) [[who does not move]] thinks he is [[central]]. And he thinks that the center is [[safety]]. However, this is a mental model of the old days when "[[search]]" was a two-dimensional movement, and in reality, the space to be searched is of a higher dimension.

Exploration on the physical surface was two-dimensional, so we're dragging our senses from that era.

They become the edge with the belief that "we are not the edge, we are the center, therefore we are safe."
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1731497929188499491) "Here [[search space]] is" type thinking as opposed to "high risk low risk" type thinking. People who don't move are perceived as "people who don't search" and are "outside the space" and "not particularly worthy of attention."

The fact that space is of a higher dimension allows this perception to be established.

Problems caused by lack of general awareness of [higher dimensional space
