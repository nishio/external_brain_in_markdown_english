It can be said that we infer the unseen areas based on the observations from the visible areas (illustration 2).

However, occasionally, something appears that contradicts those predictions (illustration 3).

This is akin to a temporary easing of the "[[Fragmentation of the World]]" or the "blockage of information transmission in the [[Formation of Early Adopter Groups]]."

At such times, there are those who approach to take a closer look, thinking "Is there something there?" and others who dismiss or attack it.
