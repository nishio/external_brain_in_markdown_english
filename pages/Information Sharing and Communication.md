Whether it is clear "who should read the information."

- [[information transmission]] is clear who should read it, but [[information sharing]] is not.

And what is the benefit of writing and sharing information in groupware that is not clear to the people who should read it?
- What you write can be mentioned later (using [[Permalink.]] etc.)
- What you wrote can [search (e.g. for someone using a search engine)
This is because we can benefit from the advances in information processing technology that have made it possible for us to do so.
