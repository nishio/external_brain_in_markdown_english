> Joint attention refers to the behavior of understanding where another person's attention is located and sharing that person's attitude toward that object, or making others understand where one's attention is located and having others share one's attitude toward that object. --- [joint attention - Dictionary of Brain Science](https://bsd.neuroinf.jp/wiki/%E5%85%B1%E5%90%8C%E6%B3%A8%E6%84%8F)


- > Pointing at something the infant wants to see when an adult is present ([[pointing at]] behavior)
- > The adult sees an object and the infant sees it too ([[Eye Tracking]]).
- > Infants' evaluation of an object by looking at an adult's facial expressions ([[social reference]]).

The fact that the activity of pushing a pointer is [[pointing at]] was previously described in [[Notification points to]].

This Scrapbox edit diffs going to Slack and the bot using it as an input source is similar to [[Eye Tracking]] because it will see what I am editing on the Scrapbox.
Automatic sharing of what you are looking at with a [[waybe.me]]-like service is also similar to [[Eye Tracking]].

Services such as [[Favstar]], which take as input the emotions expressed by humans in Likes and Emoticon, are close to [[social reference]]. Related to [[principle of social proof]].
