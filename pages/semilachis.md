- If the set is as shown in the upper left diagram, drawing a line through the inclusion relation such as "A encompasses B" will result in the upper right diagram. [[(Christmas) tree]].
- In reality, however, there are relationships where "one does not encompass the other, but neither is it unrelated," as in B and C in the figure below left.
- If we draw this in a diagram with inclusions, we get the lower right figure. In this figure, B and C meet at E.
- This is not a tree. Such a structure is called [[semilachis]].

- That is, [Inclusion" and "irrelevance" are not two choices.
