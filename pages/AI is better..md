> Homo sapiens "AI is better than most homo sapiens."
- > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1605105611716571139?s=20&t=2y31SZaaoTwkt4v6_x5Kuw): I saw this in one of your retweets, but this kind of near-future sci-fi is also possible:...
- > People "would rather have an AI than most politicians"
- > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1605106545226051584?s=20&t=2y31SZaaoTwkt4v6_x5Kuw): A future where the will of the people chooses "[[democratic system]] by stupid homo sapiens" Dictatorship by smart AI" rather than "[[democratic system]] by stupid homo sapiens"!
- > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1605106817599963136?s=20&t=2y31SZaaoTwkt4v6_x5Kuw): before we move to a clear [[dictatorship]], I think we'll see a time when "humans are politicians. But they're all consulting with AI behind the scenes" before we move to explicit [[dictatorship]].
