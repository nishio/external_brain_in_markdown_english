At the beginning of his visit, I was honored to receive his words of appreciation for my policy initiatives in Taiwan. Topics of discussion included protecting democracy, SNS user autonomy, countering fake information, tiktok acquisition plan, AI and democracy, etc. Japan-Taiwan cooperation in cyberspace is a must. Mutual follow-up with selfies at the end.
