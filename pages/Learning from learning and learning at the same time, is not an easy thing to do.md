title: "Learning from learning and learning at the same time, is not an easy thing to do"
---

According to the child,
    - [[Learning from learning and learning at the same time, is not an easy thing to do]] 、
    - [[A friend comes to you from afar, and you are not at ease.]] 、
    - [[A man does not know, nor does he care, nor is he a sovereign]]

The beginning of the Analects (學而第一)
- The first two are well-known, but seem to be perceived as disjointed, not as one continuous thing.
- The very first of the Analects, "According to the Son"
- I thought of course there must be a connection since it is written in one lump instead of "according to the child" in pieces, but I could not find any relationship in <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>.
    - Read "[[commentaries on treatises]]" by [[Shu Xi]].
    - When you learn something and review it over and over again, what you've learned becomes your own. That's where the joy comes in.
    - Fun to have friends from far away.
        - Cheng said, "[[If]] goodness is exerted on people, those who believe and follow will increase in number and therefore be able to enjoy it."
        - [I don't get angry when people don't know about it.
        - Yun: "[Learning is in you, knowing or not knowing is in others, how can you be angry?"
        - Mr. Cheng: "Even though [[you enjoy influencing others]], [[you are a sovereign only if you do not agonize when others do not approve of you]]."
        - Zhu Xi: "It is easy to influence people and have fun because it happens naturally, but it is difficult not to agonize when people don't approve of you, which is why only those whose virtue is complete can do this."
        - Cheng: "Only after there is the joy of repeated learning is there the enjoyment of influencing others, and without that enjoyment it is insufficient to speak of a sovereign."
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I felt convinced. To put it in my expression:.
    - If you read a text that you cannot understand just by reading it once, you will make connections between your stored memories and say, "I see. I see.
        - This moment is joyful.
            - [[interesting]]
    - The reason why person Y comes all the way from afar to visit person X is that person X produces wisdom that is not found in books.
        - The reason why Y is visiting from afar is because he has already learned what he can obtain from books at low cost and is looking for more.
        - It is fun to talk with these people Y.
    - But if people don't show up, they don't complain, and that's what a sovereign is.
        - [Learning is about you, so it doesn't matter who else is involved.

orthographical variants
    - [[Learn this when you learn it]]
