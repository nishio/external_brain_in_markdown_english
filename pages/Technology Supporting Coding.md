> There are many [[programming languages]] in the world. There are also many programming concepts such as functions, types, scopes, classes, inheritance, and so on. Some concepts are common to many languages, while others are used only in a few languages. Why were these concepts created? The theme of this book is to understand the "why.
> To that end, this book takes the perspective of the language designer, compares multiple languages, and then explains how languages have changed over time. By understanding "why" various concepts came into being, you will be able to determine why you should use them, when you should use them, and how you should use them. It will also make it easier to understand new concepts that will emerge in the future.
