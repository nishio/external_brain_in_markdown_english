This is my diary, a place to write down my daily thoughts.
- I don't see it as a place to communicate in real time to a large, broad audience.
    - That's the role of Twitter
- The reason I've been talking so much about the gubernatorial race lately is because most of what I'm thinking about is the gubernatorial race.
- On Twitter, he's been modest in his criticism of other candidates.
    - Scrapbox doesn't particularly care.

I'm trying to figure out how to make it better known.
- After all, it's a very effective means that other candidates are doing and that our camp is avoiding because they think it's unethical.
    - [[Public Office Election Law]] Article 142 [Public Office Election Law | e-Gov Laws and Regulations Search](https://elaws.e-gov.go.jp/document?lawid=325AC1000000100_20240401_504AC0100000052)
    - >  (Distribution of documents and drawings)
    - >  Article 142 In elections other than elections for members of the House of Representatives (proportional representation), no documents or drawings used for campaigning may be distributed except for ordinary postcards and leaflets as provided for in the following items. In this case, leaflets may not be scattered....
    - >  > (iii) For the election of prefectural governors,...
        - Attach a certificate to this limited number of leaflets to prove the number of sheets.

        - You can only hand them out on the street at the right time, and there is a time limit of 8:00 to 20:00 for street speeches.
    - However, if you use only a silhouette without a name and without a photo, you can get out of this restriction.
        - Is that okay? I think that's against the spirit of the law, and that's what Renho and Ishimaru are doing.

> [maaco3](https://x.com/maaco3/status/1806507535433859192) Silhouette flyers were posted, with the candidate's name and the colors of the local soccer team, and they don't say "vote" but "vote before the deadline. It says, "Please vote before the deadline. Even if it is not illegal, it is unfair. I've heard the theory that they are being carried by rich horse owners to gain name recognition in the Tokyo election, with the goal of running for governor in their hometown.

The flyer is as if it was distributed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government (Tokyo Metropolitan Governor's Election...Committee?).

> [nasitaro](https://x.com/nasitaro/status/1807254530796798383) Easy to understand that Tamesue Dai and Takamatsu Nana started their campaign not wanting to go to the election at the same time.

>  >yeuxqui: So that's why Nana Takamatsu says don't vote before the deadline, and the old hurdler is starting to talk about track and field rather than elections.
> [yanahiko02](https://x.com/yanahiko02/status/1807259033545634209) I hate Nana Takamatsu, but I also wonder what the rip-off is for not understanding the purpose of this post. If she finally decides who to put in on election day, she would want people to be able to vote even if they are on the road at the time.

I have a feeling that this was just something I said inadvertently because I was having fun.

We are the ones who are trapped in the composition of the two choices, and we are the ones who are reproducing the composition of the two choices. Why don't they just read the manifestos of the 6 main candidates and choose the one they think is the best?
I felt like this was self-reinforcing feedback.

> [NaitoShiomi](https://x.com/NaitoShiomi/status/1807373313045594269) I joined Yahoo in the Miyasaka generation in my previous job, and they were pushing forward a lot of things at a blazing speed after I became Lieutenant Governor, and I remember the atmosphere at Yahoo back then. I remember.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1807706896759234593) I was thinking about this when I saw a person who described #Takahiro Yasuno as "someone who is only interested in IT" and another person who responded, "If he was only interested in IT, he wouldn't be running for governor of Tokyo," which is exactly right. I thought that the real "people who are only interested in IT" had not voted so far, so I thought, "Finally, I have a candidate I can push for! I voted at ......

Therefore, "Phone AI Anon", "Poster Map", and "Advance Voting Map", which were not planned to be created at the beginning, were created based on the situation, which is a bottom-up business improvement.

In other words, it is estimated that 60~70% of social security expenditures are for the elderly. On the other hand, only 7.5% of the budget is for children.

Since there are so many media outlets, it would be impossible to appear in all of them, but we thought it would be a factor for the voters to know who the media offered to debate and what the results were. If your strategy is to go to the media that favors you and refrain from exposure to debates and interviews, I think that attitude is one important piece of information.
