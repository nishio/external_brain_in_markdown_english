Copy and paste from Regroup doesn't work due to stricter type checking on Kozaneba's part.

If there is too much text, the font size is stuck at 0 and does not enlarge when the kozane is enlarged

I'm usually fine with the rectangular selection, but sometimes there are situations where I want a lasso.

- Hey, the group I dragged disappeared.
    - The "somehow uncomfortable" block.
- Either it's gone, hidden, or the coordinates are undefined...
    - Ummm, the data is not lost, it is somehow missing from the list of targets to be displayed, and since I am using the release version, I can't directly modify the list of targets to be displayed.
    - I'll start up a development version later and play around with it.
