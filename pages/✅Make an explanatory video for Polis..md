- The ability to vote on short sentences submitted.
    - Let's actually vote!

    - Don't think too long and answer more and more by feel. This is a tool to collect "how people feel.
- Examples of actual comments that have attracted sympathy and divided opinion in the past are presented.
    - Can you give us some specific examples of how sympathetic or divided comments have been in the past in Polis' introduction to the demo?"

3. features of Polis (2.5 min)
- The fact that participants can not only vote, but can also submit their own short text.
- This workshop is set up to allow anonymous voting and posting, and the management doesn't even know.
    - Submissions are shared instantly without filters or moderation
    - You voted in favor of what you posted, so please be honest and write your opinion!

Specific Application Examples
- In Taiwan, for example, the Polis system is used in the policy-making process. For example, when Uber entered Taiwan, the vTaiwan system was used to discuss the issue with a large number of people, and although there was an initial conflict, later opinions were generated that were supported by both sides, which were then implemented by the Taiwanese government.

- How to use Polis in this workshop
    - After this, you let ChatGPT create stories of bright and dark futures!
    - You look at the stories you've created and make a post to Polis that says, "The problem that needs to be solved is...".
    - In the group work that follows, everyone in the group will read the stories they have created.
    - Then vote in Polis!
    - At this stage you will see a "distribution of emotions" throughout the room regarding "what you feel are the issues that need to be resolved"!
    - Then, as a group, discuss "What action should I take?" Let's discuss about
    - Please feel like a sticky note for brainstorming and vote on the discussion as Polis' opinion as you go along!
    - Finally, everyone will vote again. What will be created is unknown, but we will see the visualization that comes out of everyone's discussions here!

summary
- Polis is a tool that helps you understand "the opinions and feelings of many people" to aid in consensus building and decision making
- Used around the world as a tool in democratic decision-making and finding community consensus
- Experience it!

Are there any instances of utilization that were particularly successful or yielded surprising results?"
- I'll put this up in the reference space.
