> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1815094905829786013) I was thinking about Yukito Emaya's exchange style theory, but I think exchange style C has different layers.

- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1815097119860248653) When food was not preservable, it was more rational to share more than one person could eat with everyone than to let the uneaten amount rot. Now that food can be preserved, there is no longer any rationale for sharing.
- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1815097576221507845) The hungry want food, so they must offer something in exchange. At this time, what "those who have no assets" could offer was their life time. Thus occurred the "subordination to others" of selling off time. This developed into an army not engaged in productive activities.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1815098903919996929) The introduction of a token that can be stored eliminates the need to synchronize the timing of exchanges. Military forces increased the reliability of this token, and conversely, a synergistic effect occurred in which this token increased the stability of asset accumulation

- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1815099473221267931) However, as the market for token exchange grew, geographically segmented nations became a hindrance. The more connected they were, the more profitable they were. The demand for open trade from nations became stronger and stronger, and eventually a global market was established.
- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1815192918451503168) I should make up a bit more here, the state as a mechanism that tries to protect its "friends" inside by eliminating external enemies with military force tries to strengthen its borders, but trade attempts to weaken them.



> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1815100826928689599) Humanity is now in the first 100 years of computers. What can be duplicated is more beneficial to duplicate and share with everyone. However, software and pictures cannot be eaten directly. We need a means to exchange this for food.

- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1815101896597860619) So how to do this is Funding the Commons: if we don't fund it, the creators will starve and die. Since they don't want to die, it is technically possible to have them widely used for free, which is more optimal for society as a whole, but it is necessary to prevent distribution and charge a price for the sake of individual survival.
