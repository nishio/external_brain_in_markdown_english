Unified organizational culture lowers transaction costs in the organizational marketplace.

Unifying culture within an organization lowers [[Transaction costs]] in [[Internal Market]].
That makes it more efficient than trading on the market outside the organization.
This is why the organization exists.

Lower [[decision-making costs]] and [communication costs

Short fact check.
- It is generally true that "an organization is established when it can coordinate at "lower transaction costs" than the market. Kors (1937) explained that markets, which use the price mechanism, have transaction costs such as contracting, searching, and bargaining, and that firms expand to the extent that the coordination costs of internal organizations are lower than these costs. Williamson extended the choice of "market, hierarchy (internal), and intermediate forms" according to the attributes of the transaction (asset specificity, uncertainty, and frequency). ([Wiley Online Library](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Consistent with the main theory, "culture unification lowers transaction costs in the internal "market. Ouchi argued that "clan governance," or shared values and norms, can reduce valuation ambiguity and goal discrepancies, and save on supervision and contracting costs. ([JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2392231?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- There is theoretical support for "decision-making costs and communication costs will also go down." Arrow points out that organizations have channels for communication and decision-making that reduce the cost of cooperation without relying solely on price. Furthermore, Kogut & Zander's theory of the knowledge-based firm (Kogut & Zander), that "firms share and transfer knowledge better than markets," is compatible with the mechanism by which a common language, routines, and norms (culture) reduce communication costs. ([Google Books](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Limits_of_Organization.html?id=55eDQgAACAAJ&utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- However, it is an oversimplification to go as far as "this is the entire reason for the organization's existence". The rationale of companies has developed in a multilinear way, including the integration of capabilities and knowledge (capability perspective), in addition to transaction costs. In some situations, markets and hybrid contracts are more efficient. ([IDEAS/RePEc](https://ideas.repec.org/a/inm/ororsc/v3y1992i3p383-397.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Practical note: Culture is a double-edged sword: excessive homogeneity can lead to rigidity, false consensus (groupthink), and reduced adaptability, and in turn, increased decision-making and information acquisition costs - some empirical and field suggestions.

summary
The arguments you present are consistent with (1) Coase/Williamson's transaction cost theory, (2) Ouchi's "clan governance" = governance by culture, and (3) the knowledge-based view of the firm, and are generally correct in their direction. However, it is appropriate to strike a balance that includes factors such as transaction attributes and capabilities, and the possibility of selecting hybrid forms, rather than assuming that they are the "sole reason for existence.
