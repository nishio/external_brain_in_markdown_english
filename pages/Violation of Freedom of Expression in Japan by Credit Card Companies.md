background
- [[Credit card companies]] and [[payment processors]] can put economic pressure on these content providers by refusing to process payments for certain content and industries. In Japan, there have been reported cases of such pressure affecting [[freedom of expression]].

Main Issues
- Adult content
    - The Japanese adult content industry sometimes faces refusals by credit card companies to process payments. This is when these companies, based on policy or social pressure, refrain from providing services for content they deem ethically problematic.
    - This situation means that content providers are restricted in their means of earning revenue, which in turn restricts their freedom of expression.
- Political and social content
    - Content containing politically sensitive or socially controversial content may also be targeted by credit card companies and payment processors.
    - Economic constraints on content providers who support a particular ideology or opinion may undermine diversity of expression.

Examples of Discussion
- The case for DMM in 2019:
    - In 2019, DMM, one of Japan's leading adult content providers, had to stop offering certain content due to pressure from credit card companies. This case has triggered a debate about stricter regulation of adult content and the consequent restrictions on freedom of expression.
- The Case of PayPal and MangaGamer:
    - In one case, MangaGamer, an international erotic content distribution site, was denied payment processing by PayPal. This is just one example of how international payment processors affect Japanese content providers.

Impact on Freedom of Expression
- Promoting self-censorship:
    - Increases the likelihood that content providers will self-censor to avoid economic pressures. This carries the risk that certain content and opinions will no longer be published.
- Economic barriers:
    - Restrictions on payment methods may make it more difficult for certain content to be marketed and may result in the loss of diverse expression.

Conclusion.
The refusal of credit card companies and payment processors to process payments is recognized as a potential violation of freedom of expression in Japan. In particular, it has a significant impact on adult-oriented content and politically and socially sensitive content, which risks undermining the diversity of expression.


relevance
- The case of [[Skeb]]:
    - Skeb is a platform that connects creators and clients. In response to restrictions on expression from major credit card companies, we have decided to introduce a new payment method called "[[Skeb Coin]]", a blockchain-based [[utility token]]. By doing so, we aim to circumvent the restrictions imposed by credit card companies and create an environment in which creators can freely express themselves!
