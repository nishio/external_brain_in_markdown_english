[Japan is "more likely to be deceived by false information" than the U.S. and South Korea, with many not checking facts...Yomiuri 3,000 people surveyed (Yomiuri Shimbun Online) - Yahoo! News [https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/462a1bd776fd11cba](https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/462a1bd776fd11cba) 3902e74342638ea1168fcbd]
> When contacted with information, 73% of respondents in the U.S. and 57% in South Korea said they "look up the primary source [[sources]]," compared to 41% in Japan.

> Those who were less likely to be deceived were "newspaper readers" and "those who obtain diverse information from multiple media. Those who read newspapers were 5% more likely than those who did not to be aware of false information.

I was going to look at the [[primary source]], suspecting that the description of the article by this [[newspaper]] might be a "convenient interpretation [[for the newspaper]]," but the [[source]] is not clearly stated. Is it [[disinformation]]?
