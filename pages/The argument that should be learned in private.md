title: "The argument that should be learned in private"
---

As a general rule, "should" claims tend to be made without evidence.
    - [[Should→why?]]

I'm curious about the motives of people who make [[coherent]] statements when it should be none of their business whether others learn in private or not.
    - [[I have to → I want to]]

Employers are easy to understand because they are stakeholders. What motivates people to tell others that they should learn in private, even though they have nothing to do with it?
