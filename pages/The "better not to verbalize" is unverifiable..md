title: 'The "better not to verbalize" is unverifiable.'
---

"[[It's better not to]] verbalize" is [[unverifiable]].
    - Because [[verbalizing]] and non-verbalizing cases cannot be [[comparative experiments]].

There are a few cases where things can go wrong after language
- By forcing [[foggy]] that cannot be well verbalized into language, the parts that were not verbalized are truncated.
- Forgetting that "provisional language" was "provisional" in the past, we misinterpret it as if it were a universal truth.
    - [[adverse consistency]].
