The expression "[[personal desires]] clinging to [[seemingly objective assertions]]" points to an extremely common phenomenon in human communication and social interaction. This phenomenon indicates a situation in which individuals present their opinions and claims as objective facts, but actually have personal motives and desires hidden behind them. Analyzing this phenomenon from the perspective of social psychology and communication theory provides the following insights.

## Social Psychological Perspectives
.
    - [[cognitive dissonance]] : People want their actions and beliefs to be consistent. In order to justify their desires and motivations, they try to resolve internal inconsistencies by making claims that appear to be objective facts.
- [Self-presentation theory: Individuals seek to present a desirable image of themselves in social situations. Therefore, they may seek to enhance their credibility and authority by making their claims appear objective and reasonable.

## Perspectives on Communication Theory
.
- Linguistic strategy: a strategy that [[attempts to]] impart objectivity and universality to claims through language and expression. This leads the listener to focus on the content of the information provided rather than on the personal aspects of the speaker.
- [Perspective-Taking: During the communication process, the speaker constructs the message with the listener's point of view in mind. This allows the speaker to develop an argument that incorporates personal desires in a way that is acceptable to the listener.

## influence of personal desires
.
- Pursuit of Power and Influence: Individuals often desire to enhance their [[social status]] or to influence [[others]]. To this end, presenting one's opinions as objective truths may be strategically used.
    - [[self-justification]] : You may cite objective facts or data to justify your choices or actions, but your choices are often actually based on your personal desires.

Such analysis underscores the importance of critically evaluating the information and claims we see in our daily lives. Understanding how an individual's desires and motivations influence his or her communication and claims is essential in the process of interpreting information and making decisions in interpersonal relationships.
