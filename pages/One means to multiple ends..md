title: "One means to multiple ends."
---

One means can have multiple purposes.
It's the kind of thing that says, "If you make this part, you can use it for this and that.
The state of multiple objectives is "[[killing two birds with one stone]]," and I think it is a good state to aim for, because it is an efficient use of time.
However, a situation may arise during the process of making a part that says, "If we use policy A for this part, it will fulfill objective X, and if we use policy B, it will fulfill objective Y, but there is no way to fulfill both objectives.
So it would be counterproductive to melt large amounts of time looking for a way to satisfy both.
