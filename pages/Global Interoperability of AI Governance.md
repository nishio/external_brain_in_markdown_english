1. we resolve to support the role of interoperable tools for trusted AI to promote human-centered and trusted AI, and recognize our role in building trust in AI and the data-driven economy to create an open and enabling environment for responsible AI innovation
We support inclusive stakeholder participation in the development of international standards in Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) to promote interoperability beyond the AI governance framework. To enhance G7 cooperation on international AI technology standards, we resolve to
- Raise stakeholder awareness of efforts to develop international AI technology standards.
- Build stakeholder capacity on how to actively participate in the development of international AI technology standards.
- Encourage the adoption of international AI standards as a tool for advancing responsible AI.
3. we will facilitate dialogue through G7 workshops/roundtables on tools for credible AI, including interoperability among governance frameworks, risk assessment and management frameworks, auditing, and potential certification schemes, and bring together experts and innovators from G7 members to endeavor to discuss the following matters.
Challenges and Opportunities for Adoption of Reliable AI Systems
Proposals to support SMEs, start-ups, and other stakeholders operating internationally
Opportunities and challenges for cross-border cooperation on the development and deployment of reliable AI
Regulatory and non-regulatory frameworks, as well as the benefits of international technical standards and certification schemes developed by SDOs
4. we welcome collaboration with international organizations and initiatives, including the OECD, GPAI, UNESC, etc., on developing indicators and tools for credible AI to promote [[interoperability across governance frameworks]]. We also strengthen cooperation with all relevant stakeholders on future policy and societal needs regarding future opportunities and challenges for AI, including generative AI, within the G7 and at the OECD and other fora.
5. we call for increased engagement with developing and emerging countries to adopt and implement the OECD AI Principles, supporting an enabling environment for AI innovation globally, while strengthening respect for democratic values, human rights and fundamental freedoms, and promoting interoperability among AI governance frameworks worldwide Welcomes collective efforts to
