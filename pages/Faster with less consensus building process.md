- Japanese companies are good at optimizing within given constraints, and this is contributed by the small number of "[[consensus building processes]].
    - While [[new business]] development requires [[consensus building across departments]], [[technical problem solving]] is a fast process, with decision-making centered within the technical department.
    - [Dejima Strategy" and "spin-out" are effective from the viewpoint of reducing "consensus building costs across divisions.

## context
.
[Popular Japanese sake is in danger of being "banned" in the EU....The government is on a diplomatic offensive to exempt sake bottles that will be required to be reused after 30 years : Yomiuri Shimbun](https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/world/20240223-OYT1T50112/)

>  Japan has a weapon in the form of paper-packaged sake.
>  That's not a problem at all, since it's highly light-shielding and resistant to transportation.

>  Nevertheless, once the goal is in sight, Japanese companies are good at doing something about it, so it's manageable

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1761406074954076558) I think the game of "make this happen, but the means used so far are no longer available" is more Japanese than the game of "you can do whatever you want, just find a customer". I wonder where the difference between the two comes from.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1761406650471285225) I don't know if it's a culture of harmony or an educational process, but when people are told that they can do whatever they want, they choose to look around and do the same thing. I guess a lot of people end up doing that.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1761410613455298868) I was keenly aware of Fujitsu's complete copy of Amazon Go and how good copying is when given a goal.
>  I think it's because copying can greatly reduce the consensus building process...

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1761411648529842366) I see "consensus building process", that makes sense.
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1761412562468663773) When a "new business" is tried and tested, consensus building across departments is necessary, whereas when a "technical problem-solving" is tried and tested, decision-making is faster because the technical department is the only one making decisions. decision-making in the technical department alone.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1761417991609294911) I see, so the Dejima strategy and spin-outs are "reducing the cost of consensus building across departments".
