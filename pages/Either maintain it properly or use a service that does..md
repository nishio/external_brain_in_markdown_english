Either maintain it properly or use a service that does.

Why is there a conflict between "Wordpress is safe if you maintain it properly!" and "I couldn't maintain Wordpress properly, so I moved to another service that does maintenance for me" are compatible, so why are they at odds?
    - It appears to me that people who claim the former don't accept the latter.

The former group believes that they have the ability to solve problems on their own. The latter group, on the other hand, feels that they either do not have the necessary skills or time to solve the problem, or they prefer to direct their efforts to other more important matters. This reflects the fact that each user makes different choices depending on their needs and abilities, rather than which is right.
    - Entity A: Independent Software Developer
        - Safety: Entity A can ensure safety through their own efforts and expertise.
        - Time: They are willing to spend time on maintaining and updating their system.
        - Money: They may save money by not needing to pay for professional maintenance services, but this assumes their time investment doesn't represent a significant opportunity cost.
        - Skill: They possess the necessary technical skills to handle system maintenance.
    - Entity B: Small Business Owner
        - Safety: Entity B relies on a professional service to ensure safety, as they may lack the technical skills to do it themselves.
        - Time: They prefer to spend their time on business-related activities, rather than system maintenance.
        - Money: They are willing to spend money on a professional service to save time and ensure system safety.
        - Skill: They may lack the necessary technical skills for system maintenance, hence the reliance on a professional service.
