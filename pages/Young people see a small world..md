title: "Young people see a small world."

Regarding the claim that "the world as seen by young people" is small
- As far as the total amount of worlds we've seen, well, it tends to increase the longer you've been alive.
- However, I studied for entrance exams in high school and entered a Japanese university, but today's 20-year-olds are working in companies or going to universities overseas while still in high school, so I feel that I am seeing a world that I have never seen before.
- What, you say you've never seen such a young man? That's just a small world you're looking at.
