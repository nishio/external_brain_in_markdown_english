[[information-gathering tools]] for [[happy governance]].
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1748738553763471767/quick_promote_web/intro) Today's event helped me to understand the language a little better. The difficulty level of the "if the same input is given" part depends on the problem to be solved. The "translate the given sentence" is an easy problem. The "Make [[governing]] people [[happiness]]" is a difficult problem.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1748739316074021189) To solve this problem, we need to collect information on "what state of mind, what experiences, and what feelings each of a large number of people had. In collecting this information, the means of collection, "writing the name of a politician on a piece of paper and putting it in a box," is too narrow [[bandwidth]]. A better way to collect information is needed.

This is a poor algorithm. One of the goals of [[mechanism design]] is to replace this with something better, and [[Quadratic Voting]] is a successful example.
