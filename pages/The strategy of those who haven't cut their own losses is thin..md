title: "The strategy of those who haven't cut their own losses is thin."

from [[OpenAI Deep Research]]
The strategy of [[those who haven't cut themselves]] is thin.
> [ai_syacho](https://x.com/ai_syacho/status/1886798067850207530) I don't see anything wrong with Deep Research,
>  When I asked about the future strategy of the Divinity, I felt like [[the strategic consultant]] had written a report,
>  No,
>  It's something different.
>  I felt like a "I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.
>  What is this feeling?
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1887156212271374379) "AIs who have never taken risks and activities by themselves" are just talking about "empty theories on the table" based on "information they found on the internet".
>  So in the end, the opinions of those who are not active with their own money (or their own time) are only treated as adequate?
    - [[use one's own money]]

Why it's so thin is because [[cost effectiveness]] is often misplaced.
- For example, only "monetary costs that could be found by searching the Internet" are included in the comparison report, or
    - [[time cost]], [[cost of knowledge]] to begin with, [[cost of recruiting]] people with knowledge, not taken into account.
- There's no way you could actually do it and consider that a zero cost.
