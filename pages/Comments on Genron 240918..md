> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1836800004885029016) In my own way, I draw a picture from what Katsura said in #Genron240918: (A) In the first place, humans input information and output information, but (B) due to physical limitations, the amount of information available has exceeded the amount of information that can be processed. However, the amount of information available has exceeded the amount of information that can be processed due to advances in information and communication technology over the past several decades,

This is the "comfort zone". In this way, the boundary between the "comfortable inside" and the "uncomfortable outside" became clearer, (D) and then AI tried to compress the information.

Confusing this difference, some people asked the question, "Is broad listening about more sensors?" Some people were asking the question.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1836804657450303992) And the so-called "broad listening" represented in this figure (D) is still a "component" and does not include "how society makes decisions collectively and intelligently". It does not include "how society makes decisions collectively and intelligently. It is merely an "enhancement of an individual's cognitive abilities" and does not define how the enhanced individuals deliberate.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1836805816890101809) (D) is a picture of an individual, but if we equate this with society, it becomes a system where one individual makes social decisions on behalf of another. You could say, "that's what a governor is," or you could say, "that's a dictatorship," or you could say, "it's important for the CEO of a venture to show strong leadership."

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1836810086964154867) Mr. Anno is aware that this "deliberation system is not yet well designed" and will eventually produce something good. I understand that he used GitHub, which is already socially implemented and utilized by OSS, because it is impossible to create and socially implement a new concept of deliberation under the limited time constraints of the Tokyo gubernatorial election.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1836810676108677363) In that sense, AI Ano is interesting in that it takes the communication style of VTubers, which is already socially implemented and functioning, and applies it to town meetings. If people don't understand how interesting it is, they will try to imitate it and end up creating one-on-one chatbots that are not imitations at all.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1836815257173696703) Also, "Isn't there arbitrariness in the choice of a summary algorithm?" (D) of Yasuno-type is based on the premise that a human being is present in the latter stage, so it may be said that "arbitrariness? Of course there is. (Since the latter is also arbitrary, isn't the existence of arbitrariness unimportant? This is a big difference from Narita type (E).

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1836816766384886164) Aside from whether or not to do (E) (whether or not to affirm "If AI is smarter than humans, then AI should govern, not humans"), if we do, we need to "govern people happily In order to do this, we need a measure of "people's happiness," and it's not appropriate for AI engineers to define it, so it needs to be decided through deliberation and democracy.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1836818275298357357) So I personally think that "whether or not we will reach (E) in the future, (D) and the mechanism of deliberation will be necessary first". And since the data source for summary visualization is not restricted to "people's opinions", I think the first step of deliberation might be "summarizing and visualizing the proceedings of the congress" instead of "collecting people's opinions".
