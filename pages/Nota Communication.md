- Gyazo is GitHub Issues as much as possible.
- Helpfeel manages tasks with Scrapbox
    - [[There are two types of task management]]
- You can use pictograms in the title of the Scrapbox to indicate the situation.
    - Put task status in [/takker/page title](https://scrapbox.io/takker/page title).
    - If you put the pictogram at the top, it is nice to have the task status aligned to the left most!<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/akix/icon' alt='akix.icon' height="19.5"/>
:

```
[‚úÖ Attach feature A to Helpfeel].
[üìù Add feature B to Helpfeel].
[‚¨úÔ∏è Helpfeel with feature C]
[Unbreakable link function] allows you to change the status at once.
```


- Slack for instructions, server reboots, and other announcements
- I do consult with them on Slack.
- Move to Scrapbox when things get complicated.
    - Especially the discussion of specifications is impossible without writing it down and looking at it because so many things are involved.
