summary
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The main points of moderation in Polis are as follows
- Moderation is done by the owner of each conversation. Comments can be approved, rejected, or left unprocessed.
- There are two methods: strict moderation (whitelist) and permissive moderation (blacklist).
- Spam, duplicates, and [[comments containing multiple ideas]] should be excluded.
- After the conversation is over, the full data should be released as [[open data]].
- If comments begin to duplicate, you may close the comment acceptance after a certain period of time.
- Rejected comments cannot be approved again, but the text can be copied and pasted back in as seed comments.

Moderation saves participants time and energy and allows them to focus on meaningful issues. It is recommended that a basic [[rubric]] be prepared and set forth expectations for participants.


For comments containing multiple ideas:.
- When a single comment contains multiple ideas, it is difficult to determine which parts of the comment the participant agrees or disagrees with.
- To clarify the analysis, it is preferable to exclude comments that contain more than one idea.
- Excluded comments may be split and copied per idea and resubmitted as seed comments.


Release of full data as open data after the end of the conversation:.
- Once the conversation is over, an export of all data should be made available as open data.
- The data export will include all comments, including those excluded by moderation.
- It is recommended that participants be informed in advance that their data will be made public after the conversation is over.
- Open data will ensure transparency and promote the use of data.


Duplicate Comments and Acceptance Deadline:.
- If a conversation is published for several weeks, eventually comments begin to duplicate.
- At this point, it is a good idea to close the comment acceptance from the administration settings.
- Participants will be notified in advance of the deadline for accepting comments.
- This gives participants the opportunity to vote on all comments and reduces the burden on the moderators.
- After the comment period is closed, participants can concentrate on voting.
