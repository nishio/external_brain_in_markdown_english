> That feeling, that "people who had only Method A as an option implicitly considered Method A as normal and lived without a word to refer to Method A, but when Method B was created, the need for distinction arose and a word X was created to refer to Method A after the fact" and that "X and 'Method A without a word' feel different". That's right.
