- I'm curious about this place.
        - The question of whether Twitter/X, which is a private company and not cheap to collect data, is the right place to receive [[broad listening]].
    - News services do broad listening things?
        - Mr. Anno's broad listening in the [[2024]] gubernatorial election was of value to citizens in that the gubernatorial candidates listened to him.
        - If a private company did broad listening, would citizens find it worthwhile?
    - I think [[a government-run social networking site]] is the proper form.
        - That social networking site will be very different from the world people see on Twitter today.
        - The Plurality book talked about [[groupware becoming a medium]].
            - [[Groupware as a medium]].
    - relevance
            - [[Social media should be maintained by taxpayers because communication is social infrastructure.]]
