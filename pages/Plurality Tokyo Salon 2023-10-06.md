I will be there but not planning to talk (due to lack of time to prepare).

Interesting discussion

Q: Are religious organizations that deceive their followers and sell them worthless items at high prices producing intellectual production?
A: (Aside from the fact that both the questioner and I personally dislike that business model) Since you are producing value for the customer, the believer, and it is not physical production, you would have to admit that you are doing intellectual production.
- Gacha, a social game, also makes people find value in digital data and make them pay for it.
- Advertising also makes people find value and pay for it.
- It is up to each individual to decide which of those businesses is evil.

Q: In a case where something is harmful to society but the customer sees value in it, is that a positive or negative production?
A: Each person has a different idea of what value they place on a product, so whether it is a positive or negative production will depend on the observer.

Q: Then what defines the productivity of intellectual production?
A: To use an analogy to physical production, if you go from being able to make 1 bomb an hour to being able to make 10 bombs an hour, that is an increase in productivity
- Whether it is good or evil is a matter of human subjectivity.

He called himself "I'm an idiot, I don't know," but I think that was the smartest question he's asked since the release of The Engineer's Guide to Intellectual Production.
