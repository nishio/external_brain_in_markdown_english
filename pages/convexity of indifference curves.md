- There is a misconception that the nondiscrimination curve is convex to origin, but this is only true when assuming the model of "[[law of diminishing marginal utility]]" at the time the nondiscrimination curve was proposed, and there are known experimental cases in which this is not true.
- Nobel economist Samuelson already wrote about concave indifference curves in 1956
