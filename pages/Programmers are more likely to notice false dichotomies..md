title: "Programmers are more likely to notice false dichotomies."
---

Programmers tend to notice [[False dichotomy]] because they repeatedly experience that a model designed with Boolean based on a false dichotomy is changed to Boolean when they learn the details of [[Specific Needs]] and [[use case]] and it becomes clear that they made a mistake. The theory is that we have repeatedly been forced to change the design when we learned the details of [[Specific Needs]] and [[use case]].

It is easy to understand the harm of the "false dichotomy" because of the specific experience of having to pay additional costs due to the false dichotomy.
