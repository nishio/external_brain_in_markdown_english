`You are a shaman. I received the following oracle. Explain this ... `
This oracle foresees a qualitative change in the basic learning processes of reading, writing, and thinking. Each of these elements will be discussed.

Reading: Although the oracle does not specifically address changes in reading, it predicts that a qualitative change will occur. This may suggest the emergence of new reading technologies or the development of new methods for digesting and analyzing information. Also, with advances in AI and AR/VR, the reading experience itself may become more interactive and in-depth.

Writing: the oracle is more specific about the writing process. It states that it enables "the output of ideas by scraping rather than writing. This seems to indicate the idea that in an age of information overload, writing will include not only the generation of information, but also the process of scraping and refining what is necessary from existing information. In other words, the ability to extract only the essential parts from the sea of information and express them in one's own words will become important.

Thinking: The relationship between thinking and writing is discussed. It expresses the idea that writing is important not just as a means of communicating information, but as part of deeper thinking and as a means of shaping and sharpening that thinking. In other words, writing can be an important tool for clarifying ideas and sharing them with others.

Overall, the oracle foresees significant changes in the way we understand, generate, and share information. This may suggest the impact of technological advances, particularly AI and information technology.

The oracle seems to refer to the acquisition of knowledge and how to share it with others in an age of information overload. Each of these elements is explained below.
- Sculpture: This could refer to the process of painstakingly building up, understanding, and shaping each piece of information.
- Sharing with others: shows the importance of sharing knowledge and understanding with others. Information and understanding can not only be retained by one person, but can be further deepened by sharing it with others.
- Means to sharpen: This indicates the importance of developing and researching methods and techniques to effectively understand and digest information.
- Expressing in one's own words: It is important to be able to express information in one's own words in order to clarify one's own understanding. This allows us to build and deepen our thinking.
- [Refinement: This indicates the importance of extracting relevant information from a large amount of information and then refining and organizing that information.
- Interactive: [[Learning is a]] two-way process, and it is important to not only passively receive information, but also to react and interact with it.
- Information overload, oceans of information: these illustrate the problem of information overload we face in today's society. They underscore the difficulty of properly processing large amounts of information and converting it into useful knowledge.
- The process of learning, digesting information: these show that learning and understanding is not simply a collection of information, but a process of digesting it and making it one's own.
- Clarify your thoughts: To clarify your thoughts, it is important to examine information, interpret it from your own perspective, and put it into words.
- Deep, deep thinking, part of deep thinking, forming thoughts: these indicate that deep thinking is important and that it is important to not just understand information superficially, but to pursue it deeply and form it as one's own thoughts.
