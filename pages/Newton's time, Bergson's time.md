In the first chapter of [[Norbert Wiener]], "[[Cybernetics]]", "[[Newton's time]]", which deals with the mechanical and physical world, is contrasted with "[[Bergson's time]]", which deals with biological and conscious phenomena. [[Newton (Sir Isaac)]]'s time is uniform and objective "[[absolute time]]" and is characterized by the absence of a time arrow (time reversible) in the equations of classical physics. On the other hand, [[Bergson.]] time is seen as a continuous and irreversible flow, with an emphasis on subjective [[sense of succession]] or [[duration]] (Dulay).

Wiener believes that life and communicative systems contain "irreversibility," where the exchange of information, entropy increase, and so on, exhibit the irreversible nature of time. In other words, in cybernetics, it is necessary to consider not just physical laws (Newtonian time) but also the dynamic aspects of living organisms and consciousness (Bergsonian time). This extends cybernetics as a framework for understanding control and information transfer to a discipline that encompasses both machines and organisms/humans.
