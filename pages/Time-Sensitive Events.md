> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1661359632307347457) Hey? I just realized that the event starting at 12:00 on the 25th of [[UTC]]-4 is the 26th in [[JST]] (I was mentally preparing myself for it to start in 3 hours).
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1661361171772084225) Anyone familiar with time differences, please give me a second opinion...

> [blu3mo](https://twitter.com/blu3mo/status/1661366213665083393) If you enter an appointment in Google Calendar with an overseas [[time zone]], it will be displayed on the calendar on a Japanese time basis, making it hard to make a mistake. It's hard to make a mistake.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1661375178364841991) I see!
