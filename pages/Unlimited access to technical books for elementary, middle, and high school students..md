title: "Unlimited access to technical books for elementary, middle, and high school students."
---

- Searching on the Internet provides technical knowledge, but I don't know "what keywords to search for".
- If you're a student in the city, you can go to a bookstore with a good collection of technical books and browse the shelves or pick one up and look inside.
- Can we give elementary, middle and high school students an all-you-can-read technical book plan?
