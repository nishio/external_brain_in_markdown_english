Increased [[machine translation]] efficiency from the development of [[LLM]] will move the [[bottleneck]] of [[intellectual production]] to [[output efficiency]] in [[native language]].

- > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1651081835714326528): Actually, even at the stage of [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]], I am not a [[Japanese speaker]]. I've seen footnotes here and there that assume the possibility of readers who are not [[Japanese speakers]], and the number of drawings in Scrapbox that don't include Japanese has been gradually increasing recently.

- [[word production efficiency]].
