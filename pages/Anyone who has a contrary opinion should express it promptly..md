<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The idea that those with opposing views should express them promptly may have a specific generic name, but is often associated with "[[open discussion]]," "[[transparency]]," "[[direct feedback]], [[direct feedback]], and [[constructive criticism]]. These are values that are particularly important in business and organizational contexts. Recent management theories such as [[Radical Cander]], which encourages candid and constructive feedback, may be one of the ideas you are referring to.
