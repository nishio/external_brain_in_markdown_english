after ChatGPT's Age of Technology Blog
- Before ChatGPT (= the age of Google), I searched, looked at a number of articles I found, tried them out, and put together a list of what worked!
- This means that
    - Collection of information
    - verification
    - summary
- With ChatGPT, collection and summarization are done.
    - Is verification all that's left?
- I haven't tested it yet." "When and under what circumstances did you test it?"
- concrete example
    - If you try to use firestore, samples are written in the old format by default.
        - I know about the new format, so I can write it if you explicitly tell me to write it that way.
        - If you ask me to convert it, I can do that too.
    - When writing a private key for a server-side connection to Firestore in the NextJS env, the current GPT4 says to replace line breaks, but the current NextJS does not have to do that.
    - I've experienced both cases multiple times, but I just did a quick search and it didn't seem to be in Scrapbox.
    - This means that "records are leaking due to changes in the normal work flow.
        - Up to now: research, collect fragmentary descriptions, note them down, try them, write down the results, summarize if there is room
        - Now: look it up, the procedure comes up, try it, ...
            - The "to do list" is already organized in one place and in one row, so the preliminary organization of "trying" is no longer necessary
            - So there is nothing "written" at this point.
            - Now that the logs can be shared, it's even more of a "later" thing.
                - But the logs are not searchable.
                - Need assistance with summarizing logs and putting them on Scrapbox.
