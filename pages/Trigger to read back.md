title: "Trigger to read back"
---

It is beneficial to read something once and then reread it over time. What [[triggers]] that [[rereading]]?
- [/intellitech-en/4.5.3.2 Incremental Reading](https://scrapbox.io/intellitech-en/4.5.3.2 Incremental Reading)
    - This is triggered by Spaced Repetition
    - [[Social Triggers]]
    - [/intellitech-en/4.5.3.3 Make teaching materials](https://scrapbox.io/intellitech-en/4.5.3.3 Make teaching materials)
- To teach it to others, hitting the original source causes a rereading.

I didn't realize it when I was writing this, but [[Scrapbox]] is "a system that triggers a read-back by merging links."
