title: "Centralism to diversity"
---

> The English philosopher and historian [[Isaiah Berlin]] pursued [[pluralism]] in contrast to monism, which emphasizes a single value, and made it his position. However, if we take it a step further, isn't pluralism actually a kind of monism ("[[pluralism as monism]]") in that it is a monolithic commitment to a plurality of values? Isn't pluralism founded in the fact that pluralism itself is not to be doubted? It is also noteworthy that Berlin places freedom at a higher level, as a value that guarantees the possibility of choosing among a variety of values.
>  Similarly, is it not [[monism]] toward [[diversity]], rather than a desire for diversity in society, which means that any way of life is fine, even a way of life that denies diversity? If we can think of it that way, then there is no contradiction in the criticism of racist claims.
