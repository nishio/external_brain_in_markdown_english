> [hegemony_fyp](https://x.com/hegemony_fyp/status/1921405052003987696) It sounds nice to have someone who can show us a hopeful future, but I think the way of plurality is not to seek such a messiah, but to create the future through the collaboration of everyone. I think it is the way of plurality #plurality

>  Q: If the problem to decide is binary, isn't it still binary after all even if you enrich the front?
>  A: In the past and due to poor aggregation techniques, only simple questions could be asked in collective decision making, which led to many such problems.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1921840246720798966) Q: Wouldn't that also result in a convergence to a single value as long as we decide on a single value or aggregation?
>  A: If diverse communities coexist, community members can choose different values and people can move to the community they prefer
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1921840697306431692) Q: Isn't that a division of the community?
>  A: We must keep it easy to move between communities. As Audrey explained with the highway transit parallels and mobile number portability, we need to make sure that we keep the state of being able to transfer at any time.


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1921844138539905168) #TokyoPluralityWeek While watching this slide and listening to the English, it suddenly became clear to me that it is important to actually take action, as Audrey embodies, and that if you lack action, you will not become Plurality. I realized that it is important to actually take action, as Audrey embodies, and if action is lacking, there is no Plurality, which is why she travels around the world every minute.

> [hiratakuchan](https://x.com/hiratakuchan/status/1921838368352346288) 2nd PMT Study Group. Audrey Tang, Taiwan's first Minister of Digital Development, and Glenn Weil, Microsoft Chief Scientist and economist, visited Japan today to celebrate the publication of their new book, PLURALITY. At the workshop, they gave a proposal-oriented lecture on the future digital democracy driven by Japan, focusing on PLURALITY. Afterwards, it was an excellent opportunity to deepen understanding through a question-and-answer session with the participating Diet members. A summary of today's proceedings will be made available immediately after the meeting, with the aim of improving the policy-making process and reducing the administrative workload. #Takuya Hirai #PMT Study Group #audreytang #glenweyl #audreytang #glenweyl

> [9PAczNdpH0BrikD](https://x.com/9PAczNdpH0BrikD/status/1921875179635880149) Plurality, I finished reading it!
>  The obi of "All possible futures examined" is not an exaggeration (lol). I read the English version last year, and I thought it would have been easier to read if I had Ken Suzuki's commentary at that time. If you think "Plurality is difficult...", I recommend you to read the Japanese version first.
