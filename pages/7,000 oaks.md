The idea of "[[social sculpture]] ([[Soziale Plastik]])" [[advocated by Joseph Beuys]] is the starting point of the idea of turning process into artwork. Beuys declared, "[[Every human being is an artist]]," and aimed to creatively transform society as a whole by using it as sculptural material. In his signature project, "### 7000 Oaks
," he planted 7000 oak trees in the city of Kassel with citizen volunteers at the Documenta exhibition in 1982, adding a 1.2 meter high basalt stone pillar to each tree. This was an example of environmental art as well as an example of the urban greening movement itself presented as art through [[citizen participation]]. Beuys believed that "in order to change the gigantic form of society, we must use not only pictures and sculptures, but also human social activities in general as materials," and was actually involved in the formation of a political organization (Green Party) and the establishment of a free school. He stated that "true [[Gesamtkunstwerk]] is only possible in the context of society as a whole, and we will never reach the ideal democracy as long as no one is able to participate. These words would embody precisely the ideology that regards the democratic process as a work of art. Beuys' ideological legacy has had a profound influence on subsequent participatory and community art. In fact, "7000 Oaks" visualizes the way street trees grew and lined up over a period of five years, symbolizing social sculpture in which art takes time to remake the social environment.
