title: "reward and punishment for one's past performance"
---

- Mr. A provides value X to Mr. B
- Mr. B provides consideration Y to Mr. A
- Mr. A finds this activity rewarding.

Under the circumstances.
- Third party C felt that "consideration Y is less than value X".
case, Mr. C may refer to this as "rewarding exploitation".

The term "rewarding exploitation" unnecessarily provokes strong emotions.
- The "consideration Y is less than the value X" is subjective to the third party C.
    - It's just a "lose-lose deal" based on subjectivity.
- Labeling it "rewarding exploitation" creates the misperception that objective facts exist.
    - Creates a bias as if "Mr. B is evil" is a fact.

- [[Inappropriate abstraction]] I think it's better to delve into "what exactly is the problem".
