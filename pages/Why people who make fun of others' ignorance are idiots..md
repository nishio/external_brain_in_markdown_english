title: "Why people who make fun of others' ignorance are idiots."
---

To make fun of others' ignorance is to consider "having little knowledge" to be stupid, but Homo sapiens is also making fun of itself because it is a poor storage that cannot even put away the whole of Wikipedia in its brain. Those who don't realize this are not only lacking in knowledge, but also in insight.
