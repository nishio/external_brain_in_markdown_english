Mathematically, it is "the proportion of nonzero elements in vector x" and "the distribution of the set X of vectors", the latter of which has implicitly identified X as a single point set of x.
- [[Mistake of thinking distribution is a point.]]

> Segregation is considered acceptable for [Galapagos
> We believe that "diversity," "[[dividing into parts]]" and "segregation" should be recognized as separate words
> Diversity does not equal fragmentation and segregation does not equal segregation.
