<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The expression "geek on the wrong side of (e.g., an attack)" refers to a person who dares to assert a different opinion, going against the prevailing opinion or trend. The term "[being on the wrong side of (e.g. an attack)" is a market or betting term that refers to the act of choosing the opposite direction of what others are going, but here the emphasis is on the opposite attitude. The term "[[geek]]" refers to a person who is deeply devoted to a subject, and together they refer to a person who adheres to his or her own ideas contrary to mainstream opinion.

The term often carries the nuance of being "[[cynical]]" or "[[arguing]] for the sake of arguing."

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The term "Gyakkari Otaku" is a piece of Japanese Internet slang. To understand this, we will first explain the two words "gyakkai" and "otaku.

Gyakuhari" means to move in the opposite direction of what the majority chooses, such as in the stock market. It has come to mean "to deliberately take a position [[that]] is opposed to the prevailing opinion or trend.

An "otaku" is a person who is extremely knowledgeable about a particular hobby or field. In Japan, the term is often used to refer to people who are devoted to hobbies such as anime and video games, but people who delve deeply into any field and pursue it are sometimes referred to as "xxx-otaku.

A "contrarian geek" is someone who goes against mainstream opinion and trends and [[dares to continue to advocate a different opinion]]. These people tend to question prevailing opinions and sometimes appear to be cynical or [[are]] against it for the sake of being against it. The term also has a slightly critical nuance to it and is often seen as "just saying the opposite on purpose."

For example, when everyone is raving about a popular movie, a person who not only criticizes that movie but also dares to lift up another movie is sometimes called a "contrarian nerd.
