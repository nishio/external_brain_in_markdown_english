title: "There are two types of code documentation"
---

The need for "the person who wrote the code to document and communicate abstract concepts to others," and the need for "the person who wrote the code to document and communicate abstract concepts to others.
There's a subtle difference in the need for "people who aren't writing code to read and understand other people's code."

The former is more of a hurdle.
- The former has an accumulation of past development experience among those who developed it and a complex structure that has not been translated into language.
    - I'd like to verbalize this and transfer it to others.
    - If an AI that reads the source code can't reconstruct it from the source code, then "it's likely not [[externalized]] in the first place".
    - For these situations, you need to ask questions and draw out [[what has not yet been verbalized]].
        - [[KeichoBot]]-like role
- The latter is a situation of "I'm not acquiring it now, if I read a lot of source code I might be able to acquire it, but I haven't done it".
    - When 100 source codes can be read in 100 hours and 10 knowledge can be gained, if an AI reads 100 source codes in 1 hour and generates a document that can be read by an AI in 10 hours and 3 knowledge can be gained, that creates a positive value.
- So the former people have something big inside them that hasn't been verbalized yet, and when they see some of that output, they feel "smaller" or "not enough."
    - 10 feels like 3.
    - The latter starts with a zero, so a zero turned into a three is a plus.

Given that, if you want less interaction, you'd have to target the latter.
