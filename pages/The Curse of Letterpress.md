---

2018-09-10
- In the days when people drew by hand, there was no significant cost difference between letters and diagrams.
- At one point in human history, only letters could be replicated at low cost ([[printing]]).
- As a result, the letters were used exclusively for [[knowledge representation]] and distribution
- Surrounded by [[book]] written in letters, learning from textbooks written in letters, expressing and presenting in letters
- As a result, the effects of the temporarily low cost of letter distribution are still being felt
    - [[Assumption that it must be expressed in writing]].
- Looking back on this era from the future, it appears to be a time cursed with letterpress printing.
