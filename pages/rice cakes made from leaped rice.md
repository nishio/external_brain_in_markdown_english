title: "rice cakes made from leaped rice"
---

Ddeokbokki, which I recently fell in love with, is "made mainly from kaletteok (가래떡), a stick-shaped fresh rice cake made from leaped rice."
Suama, which I have always liked, is "made by kneading top-grade rice flour made from non-glutinous rice, steaming it in hot water, adding sugar, and then pounding it while it is still hot.
I realized that the mochi I like is not actually sticky glutinous rice.

Ddeokbokki Karetteok
- Wash, pre-cook in boiling water for 2 minutes and fry
- Boiled in boiling water for 3 minutes and it was ready.
- I want to make it easily in the microwave.
    - Put in deep water and microwave for 2-3 minutes
    - If I made a mistake and did it just enough to soak it, I lost water and it became harder instead.
    - Tends to harden when time is short
    - I thought I would be able to make my own tteokbokki in ozoni, so I put it in water at random and microwaved it, but the water was too little and I got inedible hard sticks. The ones boiled in boiling water for 3 minutes could be eaten normally, but the ones that turned into hard sticks after one failed attempt could not be eaten even after boiling.
