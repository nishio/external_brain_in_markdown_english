title: "Pizza with no filling"
---

When everyone is coming up with different ideas and they are not in unison, I make a pizza without any ingredients, claiming that "we need to make [[the pizza base]] first before thinking about [[the pizza toppings]]".

It looks like you are very enthusiastic about making a [[pizza]] without any ingredients, but it's not that I like a pizza without any ingredients. Once the base of the pizza is made and you decide to bake the pizza, you can finally put your favorite [[toppings]] on it.
