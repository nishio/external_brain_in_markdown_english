- Are you working in a team?
    - Are the results of that task dependent on others?
    - Is there anything that would be a problem for others if not done quickly?
- Highly stressed?
    - Do you feel angry about your situation?
    - Take a step back and observe your perceptions and feelings.
    - Calmly assess your situation.
- Unmotivated to work on changing something?
    - Vague on how to determine if the change results in a good or bad outcome
    - Cannot refactor without testing.
    - I don't know if the change will improve things.
    - I'm not sure if I'm getting what I want to get.
    - Difficult to undo if changes are not successful
        - That's why I hesitate to make changes.
        - Cannot refactor without version control
- Is that "doing" action?
    - Deciding" and "thinking" are not actions.

        - → YES → Can we proceed partially without an Internet connection?
            - Can we prepare using an internet connection now so that we can proceed with some of the
            - Example: For example, if you need to do some research and work on the Internet, why not finish the research first so you can work offline the rest of the time?
- Let's divide the task
    - I'll just do the preparation first.
    - Write down anything that might be relevant to the task
    - What is missing to do the task?
- Isn't this a task that no longer makes sense to do?
