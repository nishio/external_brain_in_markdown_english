title: "The Parable of the Too Many Seedlings"
---

Even if you have a lot [[sprout]], the amount you can plant in a field is limited.
- [[sacrilegious]] and cram them in, they all wither away.
- Because [[seedling]] needs a reasonable spacing to grow.


Why is a reasonable spacing necessary? Will it lose light? Will it reduce ventilation and become infested with disease?

- [[Sprouting is unmanageable.]]

image distortion
- overgrown field

What I thought was different
    - Fields where [[weed]] grows
    - Weeds are unnecessary and there is no hesitation in pulling them out.
    - All of them are "seedlings that would be reasonably fruitful if planted and grown in a field," which is the essence of this problem.

relevance
    - [[Quiet room metaphor]]
