The Future of Learning and Work Changed by the Use of ChatGPT

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Claude/icon' alt='Claude.icon' height="19.5"/>I saw motoso's tweet, and he pointed out that the daily use of ChatGPT and other AI could significantly change the way we learn and work.

In particular, I agree with the following points
- It is desirable to develop an interactive learning environment using AI in school education
- Interactive AI is beneficial to brush up on ideas
- Can rely on AI from specification definition to coding in programming
- Routine document creation can be made more efficient by letting AI handle it.
- A style of working through questions that links the organization's knowledge base with AI will become more common.

On the other hand, some pointed out that answers to vague questions such as "tell me about xx" are still insufficient.
At this point, AI has distinct strengths and weaknesses, and it is essential to use them well.

However, technology is evolving at an ever-increasing pace, and as motoso mentions, in a year many of the current limitations may have been overcome. I would like to read the article as well, as I have found the insights of a professional engineer to be helpful.

> [motoso](https://twitter.com/motoso/status/1640336380789411841) I have been using ChatGPT on a daily basis since its release, and I have the feeling that each student should be able to study with an interactive environment where they can ask questions to GPT when they learn in school. I have a feeling that each student should be able to have an interactive environment where they can ask questions to GPT when they learn in school. I think I'm not good at normal research.

> [motoso](https://twitter.com/motoso/status/1640336899637403648) The "tell me about xx" system doesn't seem to be of much useful use at this point. However, I have some faith in English and programming.
>  I think this feeling will be dispelled within a year as there is so much room for evolution and we can already see it.
>  Interactive brushing up of ideas is beneficial. It is something to brush with others.

> [motoso](https://twitter.com/motoso/status/1640337165426233344) It is very useful to define specifications and let people write code.
>  It is also very beneficial to let it fix the sentences. If you have to write boring sentences, let the AI do it all. The reader will be using AI to read it anyway.

> [motoso](https://twitter.com/motoso/status/1640337386189258752) I'm good at getting people to respond to certain sentences, but I haven't caught up with the implementation. If you can set up your own system, it would probably be very beneficial.

> [motoso](https://twitter.com/motoso/status/1640337692990013440) Looking at these strengths and weaknesses, it is clear that in the near future, the organization's knowledge base will be stored in AI, and the style of work will be done by asking AI questions. Microsoft's announcement was also in this future.

>  This is a professional programmer's experience, and I'm not sure I've used it all this much, but I'm sure it's all true.
