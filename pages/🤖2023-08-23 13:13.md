This illustrates the concept of changing something to something you think is good so that you can continue to enjoy working on it.

It is important to note that the method of supporting intellectual production is not "what exactly it does" but "how it does it. This is consistent with the idea that the most important objective is to create a state of high intellectual productivity.

Also, intellectual productivity is the value of the final product per input cost, and there is a significant time lag before this becomes apparent. Therefore, it is important to focus on process productivity.

Q: What kind of research is needed to deeply explore the connection between discomfort-driven intellectual production and successful intelligence? Also, what are some specific techniques for increasing intellectual productivity?
