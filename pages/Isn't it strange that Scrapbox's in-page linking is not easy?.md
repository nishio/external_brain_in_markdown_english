title: "Isn't it strange that Scrapbox's in-page linking is not easy?"

As the title says.
- Bracketing the same keywords has the advantage of connecting different pages.
- If you grow a tree with bullet points on a page, the same keywords may appear in multiple branches
    - There are advantages to having this connected.
        - But linking to different places on the same page is not easy
        - Link by specifying "rows" instead of keywords
            - Even though the line might be edited.
            - Implicitly assumes that the link target is dead text
        - Shouldn't it be linked to within the page just by enclosing the keyword?
            - In that case, the advantage is that the "linked state" is preserved when the larger page is later split
                - A line link would destroy it, right?
