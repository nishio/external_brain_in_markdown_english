The people who spread the most lies are those with a strong sense of justice who can't tolerate lies.
> [@philosopium](https://twitter.com/philosopium/status/1653700935334633477?s=46&t=gkSZtjGEtUZPO0JCzBxCBw): A social networking fishing redneck who came to buy me a drink the other day said, "The people who spread the most lies are not 'those who spread lies,' but 'those with a strong sense of justice who cannot tolerate lies. The people who spread the most lies are not those who spread lies, but those who have a strong sense of justice and cannot tolerate lies. That's why we tweet tweets that make people with a strong sense of justice want to mention them." He was talking about plants that let bees carry pollen and bees.
