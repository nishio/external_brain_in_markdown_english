from  [[Toward Relative Art & Technology]]
Are humans the only actors of resistance?
The "subject of resistance" refers to any entity that takes a critical stance or action toward digitization and technological evolution. Whether this subject is limited to humans alone or includes non-human entities (nature, animals, technology itself, etc.) depends on philosophical perspectives and ethical arguments.

Below, we examine this question from the perspectives of "[[anthropocentrism]]" and "[[extended subjectivity]]."

1. the human being as a subject of resistance
(1) Human subjectivity
In the traditional philosophical position, man has been viewed as a subject of resistance, as a being who makes ethical judgments and conscious acts.
Examples: critical thinking on technology, leading social movements, ethical design.
In resisting digitization, human agency plays the following roles
Critical thinking: evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of digital technology.
Action: campaign for privacy protection and algorithmic transparency.
Creation: redesigning the use of technology and proposing ethically appropriate alternatives.

(2) Human Limitations
The speed and scale of digital technology is surpassing the scope of human cognitive abilities and behavior.
Example: Algorithms and decision processes in advanced AI systems are beyond human comprehension.
For this reason, [[resistance by humans alone may not be sufficient]].

2. "Non-human" as a subject of resistance
(1) [[The subjectivity of non-human existence]].
Contemporary philosophy and environmental ethics have focused on the perspective of non-human entities (nature, animals, and even technology itself) as subjects.
Although nature and animals do not act directly, they can be seen as subjects of resistance as entities that demand a "response" from humans.
(2) Resistance of nature and animals
The natural environment and animals are affected by digital technology and modern industry.
Example: Climate change and ecological collapse are associated with increased energy consumption and e-waste from digital technologies.
When this is interpreted as "resistance," it serves as a "wake-up call" to humans.
(3) Resistance of the technology itself
It is also possible to interpret the technology itself as having "[[independence]].
Example: When an artificial intelligence or algorithm behaves unexpectedly, the technology itself can be seen as "resisting" human-centered intent and control.
As Yuk Hui points out, [[technology should be seen as]] not just a tool, but an entity with its own logic and evolution.

3. the "collective" as an extended subject
In contemporary philosophy, there is an approach that views the subject of resistance as a "collective being" that includes both humans and non-humans.

(1) Human-technology-nature continuum
Rather than considering technology, nature, and people in isolation, we view them as an integral part of a mutual influence.
Example: cyborg theory (Donna Haraway) proposes a new subject image in which humans, machines, and nature are united.

(2) [[Distributed resistance]].
The subject of resistance is not a single entity, but exists in a networked, decentralized form.
Example: environmental movements and citizen science projects form resistance in collaboration with technology (sensors, data analysis) and nature (ecological change) as well as individual humans.

4. philosophical background
(1) Martin Heidegger
Heidegger pointed out the danger of technology viewing existence as a mere "resource" and argued that humans should resist it.
However, it has been suggested that the subject of resistance may be included in the "disclosure of existence" itself.

(2) Bruno Latour
Latour's "actor-network theory" blurs the distinction between human and non-human and considers non-human entities (technology, nature) as actors as well.
Resistance occurs within a network that includes not only human beings but also non-human entities.


5. practical implications
(1) Human-centered resistance
Propose ethical regulations and policies for digital technology.
The technical design emphasizes privacy protection and social equity.
(2) Resistance involving non-human
A system that gives voice to the voice of nature while utilizing technology to protect the natural environment and ecosystems.
Understand the autonomy of the technology itself and embrace the new possibilities it brings.
(3) Resistance as a collective subject
Digital technology, nature, and humans collaborate to explore new and ethical ways of technology.
Examples: developing sustainable technologies and designing smart infrastructure that works with nature.


6. conclusion
The subject of resistance is not simply limited to humans, but can also be considered as nature, animals, technology itself, and even as an aggregate that includes all of these. Resistance in contemporary digitalization should not be viewed as a stand-alone entity, but as a networked collaboration of diverse actors. This expanded perspective will allow us to pursue more inclusive and sustainable solutions to the problems created by digital technologies.
