Discomfort-driven intellectual production is problem-oriented and aims to improve processes.
- If they are not aware of the problem, they will just trace the method and get the job done.
- However, in the way they work, they are just selling off their life time and turning it into money.
- It is important to make sure that the time spent doing the same work is an investment in oneself.
- The goal is to maintain enjoyment and keep intellectual productivity high.
    - Enjoyment is associated with proactive activity

Discomfort-driven intellectual production increases the value of ideas by verbalizing what is not verbalized.
- Ideas are replicable resources, and ideas that are identical to existing ideas or that do not generate enthusiasm themselves are of little value. Ideas need to be generated according to the situation.
- Ideas are valuable when they are nurtured and refined by putting effort into them.
- It is important to create and sustain a "good state."
    - (The connection here is not clear, so explain more)

Discomfort-driven intellectual production increases the value of ideas by being aware of the problem, keeping them fun and productive. Ideas are a replicable resource, and ideas that do not generate enthusiasm themselves are of low value. It is important to invest the effort to resolve discomfort when it is felt. Utilizing these ideas can increase intellectual productivity.

According to Nishio's "[[Nodal Point of Thought2021-08-06]]", enjoyment may be related to proactive activity. This is consistent with discomfort-driven intellectual production. The "LINKLET" study also suggests a new device that improves communication with remote workers when performing physical tasks. This is a new method for resolving discomfort when it is felt.

However, we need to think more deeply about how these ideas relate specifically to each other and how they can be used to enhance intellectual productivity.
