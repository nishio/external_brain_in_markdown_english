title: "Skills acquired non-verbally from experience"
---

- [[skill]] acquired from [[experience]] to [[non-verbal]]

Even [[people who can ride a bicycle]] can't teach people how to ride a bicycle with words.
- [[I wasn't taught how to ride a bike by words]].
- I recommend [[action]] for those who "[[want to acquire]]" skills, [[learn from experience and observation]].
- Those who say, "Teach me with words," [[through]] do.
- Some people have managed to work up the enthusiasm to verbalize this without going through the motions.
- The result is, for example, [U Theory as a Pattern Language of Change
- After seeing what has become words, [[words are assigned]] to what I was [[judging non-verbally]], and [[Concept Handles]] are attached.
    - [[effectuation]] and so on.
    - It's not [[coming from the outside as a new concept]], it's more like [[a label is added to something that was already inside]].
- [[Easy to understand]] because there are a lot of [[concrete examples]] in [[my past experiences]].
- I feel that [[Plurality]] is in this group.

I had created a page in the past with a very similar title, "[[Non-verbally acquired skills]]."
