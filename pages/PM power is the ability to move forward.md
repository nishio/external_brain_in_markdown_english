title: "PM power is the ability to move forward"
---

[We were talking about what "PM power" means, and we came to the conclusion that it is "[[the ability to]] move forward.

When you're not moving forward, don't blame it on something you can't control.
    - [[Don't say, "Why isn't anyone doing it?" You're one of them.]]
    - [[Focus on what you can control.]]

This is also [[preparedness]], i.e., "I will take on tasks for which the assignee is unknown.
- Of course, there must be a certain amount of tasks that basically can't be done by one person, so [[asking others to do it]] or putting a [[PRIORITY]] and discarding the low ones is also an option.
- Some [[unissued tasks]].

[[PM]]
