<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The term "koken production" is mainly used in Japanese gambling games such as pachinko and pachislot, where certain conditions are met to trigger a "probability change" ("koken"), which means that the probability of winning a jackpot is higher than normal. The "change of probability" is a stage direction to make it easier for players to understand when the game enters this state. The content of the production varies from game to game and from model to model, and is often expressed with flashy effects and special animations.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The expression "the 'ongoing performance of a winning hand in life'" compares the "performance of a winning hand in pachinko games" to life. In pachinko, a "kakuten" refers to "a state of [[fortune]] in which you are likely to hit the jackpot." Applying this metaphor to life, it means "a state of continuous good events" or "a period of continuous good fortune. The term is used for "a period of great fortune in life," such as a string of successes at work or a string of good luck in one's personal life.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>You are right. When we say "lucky," it seems as if one's attributes and abilities have increased, but in reality, the environment and external factors have changed, and the "probability" of winning the jackpot itself is increasing. In the expression "ongoing change in direction" in life, it means that the [[environment is favorable and good events are likely to continue]], that is, the situation in which "[[it is]] easy to hit the jackpot" is continuing. It is an image that [[success]] or good luck continues due to [[external factors]] such as surrounding conditions and the current situation, in addition to the efforts of the person himself/herself.
