There is no need to align dimensions for association. The flexibility of the KJ method allows, for example, to relate only islands of the same dimensional height to each other.
It is the absence of such tightness that must be connected by a line. The entire island of the highest dimension and a single ex-labe in the island next to it.
It is not at all inappropriate to connect the two with a single line of relationship. Similarly, it is not at all inappropriate to draw an ordinary birdcage and then add
