I felt a strong sense of discomfort when someone who had experienced VR said, "Now I can place information in 360 degrees, not just in front of my eyes!" I felt a strong sense of discomfort when I heard these words.
I wondered if I was bound by the metaphor of sitting down to work with such a free tool.

When I explained to him that since he could move his viewpoint, there was no need to place information 360 degrees around him, he said, "It's hard to walk around.
I wondered if the means of transportation is tied to the current metaphor of movement in the physical body, even though it is such a free tool.

Let's free ourselves from physics. Then we can go in any direction and at any speed, like a muscular cloud, or possess another person and see from their point of view, or see from a different point of view without changing location, like a clairvoyant, or teleport to a different place in an instant.

The absence of position tracking means freedom from physical viewpoint movement.
