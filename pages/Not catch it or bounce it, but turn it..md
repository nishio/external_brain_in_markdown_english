Decent [[accept]] and painful when something flies at high speed

- [[bounce back]] and sounds good, but bouncing back is the act of catching it once and then throwing it back, inflating it with super recovery, so it's twice as hard as catching it.

If you can avoid it, that's the least burdensome way to go.
But my load is only small, and the bullets that go flying may hit someone else.

If you avoid it just in time and pull it toward you, it will spin around. If you do it right, it will gradually lose speed and stop. However, it takes time and effort. #Turning

I came up with [[Mounting is born of insecurity.]] while petting a cat.
#Parable
#Dodging the Contradiction
#Aikido
#Juice makes the best of soft things

[[turn and stop]]
- [[through power]]
- [[rotate]]
