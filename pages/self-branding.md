> I am often told by people I meet for the first time, "You are very good at self-branding, Mr. Ochiai.
>  This is rather the opposite, implying that "as a result of allowing the public to do as they please as they wish to see, only superficial information is conveyed, and the extreme state of Ayou is observable every time we interact with the public".
>  "I am failing at self-branding when you think I am good at self-branding . A good example is your existence" ....
