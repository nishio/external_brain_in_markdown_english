I noticed that the default background image on my MacBook cut off a lot of the top and bottom.

I thought it would be better for the eyes to feel as if they were looking into the distance, but the distant view is cut off.

I tried to get o3 to make it, but surprisingly, it doesn't seem to be able to make an image with this aspect ratio.

He said there's plenty of them even if you don't make them.
