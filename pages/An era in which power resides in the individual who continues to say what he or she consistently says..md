>  >t_wada: Not only TDD, but "refactoring" is also highly diluted in meaning, so telling an AI to "refactor" often doesn't work very well. It would be interesting to bound the context by giving a person's name for this as well. Fowler's" or "Kent Beck's Tidyings." x.com/t_wada/status/...


> [t_wada](https://x.com/t_wada/status/1938493335293055045) I thought that chant breaking was done by short jargon, but I didn't expect that the jargon would be diluted in meaning and people's names would be used for chant breaking instead. I didn't think it would happen.
>  >mizchi: Prediction that prompting will evolve in the direction of increased text density and chant destruction is coming true.
