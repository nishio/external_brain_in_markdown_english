title: "Family togetherness"
---

If you want to create a sense of family unity through surnames, you have to make sure everyone has the same surname.
- Family sets are overlapping and connected, so the only way to achieve "families have the same last name" without tearing down some family member is to make them all have the same last name.

- If the Emperor creates a new family name, and we all receive it, and change our current family name to Middle Nail, you can establish both "a common family name" and "no name is changed against one's will by marriage"!
- "Mandatory same surname for all + selective same middle name for married couples."
    - Middle names may or may not be changed to the partner's at the time of marriage. The family name will be the same for everyone at the time the law takes effect, regardless of marriage. In social life, everyone's common last name is often omitted, so it is like a separate surname for married couples.
- Oh, why don't we just give them the empty string that is currently adopted by the Imperial Family as their new family name?
    - No one would ever say something as disrespectful as "an empty string is inappropriate as a last name." w
