- If you could describe in one language something that is hard to put into words...[[One way to look at it]] しかできなくなるのでは？<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/Mijinko_SD/icon' alt='/villagepump/Mijinko_SD.icon' height="19.5"/>
- The mulling thing X is called "[[provisional verbalization]] 」Aして、それからその言語化が「 [[get on well with (someone)]] 」かどうかを再確認する<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - If it fits, I can point to it in words, since no difference between X and A has been found at this point.
    - If it doesn't feel right, we can ask, "What's the difference?" and then you can separate the "part of X that is included in A" from the "part of X that is not included in A." This is a change in the direction of increasing [Cognitive Resolution
    - We don't know in advance which way it will be [[Beneficial either way.]].
    - Does it feel right?" question must be repeated from time to time, or you will stay with the first answer.
        - I think this is what they mean by "if you put it in one language, you can only see it in one way."
        - This is not a problem of having verbalized, but of not [questioning again

Fits well: [[direct comparison]].
Question again: [[double-loop learning]].

- [[verbalizing]]
