title: "Mathematical multidimensional spiky spikes"
---

A structure we conceptually called "[[Spiny spikes in higher dimensional space]]".
    - This is the reason for the [[110,000 UMAP]] here.

- This means that in this of [Public Opinion Map 3970 UMAP

- Mathematically.
    - $N((0, ...) , \sigma)$ and a small number of $N((4\sigma, 0, ...) , \sigma)$ and a small number of data (representation of one spike).
    - $4\sigma$ means "far enough away".
    - Since this is tedious, we will write this as 1 (just make $\sigma$ that much smaller).
    - K spikes are (1, 0, 0, 0, ...) , (0, 1, 0, 0, ...) , (0, 0, 1, 0, ...) , ... like this

experiment
SD=0.1

SD=0.2

SD=0.3

When it's clearly separated, it's an enclave like UMAP with SD=0.1.
If it's too mixed, you can't tell the boundary, like SD=0.3.
It becomes spiky at its boundaries.
