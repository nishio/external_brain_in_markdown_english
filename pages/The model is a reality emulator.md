title: "The model is a reality emulator"
---

    - [[model]] is the reality [[emulator]].
- Instead of experimenting in reality, we can experiment with models
- Lower cost than experiments in reality
- If the model successfully mimics reality, then the results of experiments using the model are the same as the results of reality
- Model is wrong and sometimes returns incorrect results
