I was looking at this and thinking.
- [[There are two kinds of novelty.]]
    - [[novelty created as a side effect of trying to create something useful]].
    - [[Novelty created in an attempt to create novelty]].
        - Notation shaking [[Novelty for novelty's sake]].
- The former is a good one, but when we created a system that included it in the evaluation criteria, [[Incorrect KPI setting]] caused it to run amok!
    - [[If you set a strict numerical standard for evaluation, all researchers are smart enough to optimize their behavior accordingly.]]
- This argument is that [[Usefulness to me]] should be a top priority.
        - [[Novelty and usefulness]]
