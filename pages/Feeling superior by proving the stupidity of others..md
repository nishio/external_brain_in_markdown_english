>  Everyone in society uses resources to elevate self to bring down a certain few. Everyone in society uses resources to elevate self.

>  So... I find myself being left behind by those around me on the rise. To feel safe, you lower your surroundings even more, but you waste even more of your own rising resources... and you are getting overtaken socially and sinking lower and lower.

- [[elevated resource]].
    - [[Growth Resources]]
    - [[Wasting resources]].

>  ・ 100 people are running the marathon.
>  ・Each athlete runs at a speed of 8 km/h.
>  ・ You can slow down your run and get in the way of another few people.

>  In this environment, the only way to beat a few specific people in the rankings is to hinder them, but the more resources you spend on hindering them, the lower your overall ranking will be.
