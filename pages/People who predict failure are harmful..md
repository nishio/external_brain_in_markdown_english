title: "People who predict failure are harmful."

> We do not deserve to trust those who look at others' challenges and lightly say, "This will fail.
>  Because a significant portion of success/failure is determined by luck, and the rest is a complex mix of factors that cannot be read without very careful analysis.
>  It is a liar to say as if you can read what you cannot read.

In addition to that, once a person predicts that "this will fail," they don't want to admit that they lied, so they pick at the details and make a fuss about "see, it failed," and try to get in the way and make it fail. They are harmful to society.

- [[prophecy of failure]]
- Those who [[prediction]] [[failure]] are [[harmfulness]].
