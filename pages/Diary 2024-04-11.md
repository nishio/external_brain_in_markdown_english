<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The main flow from April 11 to April 12, 2024 is as follows
- nishio published a sample view of the index on GitHub and submitted a pull request for the final version.
- Jason Entenmann confirmed with nishio that it is possible to load the index into the docx file. He also consulted with Glen Weyl and informed him that the final locked-down version of the text will be provided to nishio.
- nishio tried to correct the order of last names in the index, but found it difficult.
- nishio tried to paste the index at the end of the docx file, but ran into some problems.
- Jason Entenmann gave nishio access to the final docx file, but nishio did not think he should have editing privileges.
- nishio provided the latest index as a markdown file on GitHub. However, Jason Entenmann wanted an index with page numbers for the final docx file.
- Ultimately, nishio did the indexing work using the correct pagination PDFs, and Jason Entenmann received the keyword list and investigated the automatic indexing capabilities within Microsoft Word.
