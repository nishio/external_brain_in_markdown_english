title: "Remove the particle"
---

Scrapbox links are useful, but there are some problems due to the fact that they are string-perfect merges

The problem that "information sharing," "information sharing," and "information sharing (to do)" are not connected.
- If we limit it to this, "removing the particle" will solve the problem.

The "singular or plural" problem in English

- [[verb]] is a conjugation change issue.
- Unconsciously, only nouns are subject to bracketing.

When we think about solving these problems, it may not be appropriate to store them in the first place as sentences in a form with particles supplemented to make them easier for homo sapiens to read
