title: "Copyright is a product of past negotiations"

"[[Rules are a product of past negotiations.]]" combined with "copyright is a concept created by the invention of Gutenberg letterpress printing."
- I haven't backed up whether the latter is the correct claim.
        - [[Early history of copyright]]

And, as a result of the collective intelligence, it has been confirmed once again that an image-generating AI can acquire the style that humans perceive as a "pattern" or "style. And again, it is important to confirm that Sakura's image is not a creative expression of thought or emotion, and therefore, "copyrightability is not recognized". This is what is bugging many people's brains right now.

I'm not sure if this is the original image or not, so I was wondering if there are any CC Sakura experts out there who can tell me if there is an original image of this image.

This is because it is significantly different from intuition. At least, if this picture of Sakura was drawn by a human, it was unthinkable that it would be denied from the point of copyrightability.

> [mishiki](https://twitter.com/mishiki/status/1644356068225724416) that if a human draws an image, it is recognized as a creative expression of thought and emotion, but if an image of the same level of complexity is generated by an image-generating AI, it is not recognized as copyrightable. This is a definite conclusion. If this is the case, the importance of how much "thought and emotion" can be expressed, i.e., abstract rather than concrete expression of emotion, will increase for those who want to draw pictures in the future.

> [mishiki](https://twitter.com/mishiki/status/1644357290970202113) Abstract expression of emotion can be expressed in terms of "narrative," "worldview," and "depth. In addition to "beautiful," "cool," and "cute," it is required to have a quirk or two that appeals to the emotions.

> [mishiki](https://twitter.com/mishiki/status/1644358547046793223) It seems that even in the age of image-generating AI assumptions, the steps that can be taken by artists who want to paint will be "to be aware of the abstract nature of expression and to be more emotionally charged". But is that effort any different from what has been explored for hundreds of years in conventional pictorial expression? I mean,

It has a destiny, doesn't it? Generative AI is a frighteningly clear demonstration of such a structure > RT

> [tanji_y](https://twitter.com/tanji_y/status/1644529575932870659) With Gutenberg's invention of letterpress technology and the development of the publishing industry derived from it, an industry to "make money by mass distribution of books reproduced on a large scale" was was born.

> [tanji_y](https://twitter.com/tanji_y/status/1644535403146534912) Such "consumers who buy mass-produced books" also arose from the industrial revolution derived from printing technology (the so-called middle class).

>  In addition, I understand that the Industrial Revolution's multiple layers of innovations since Gutenberg, such as the powering of printing presses and the development of high-speed transportation networks, have transformed the world of creation.

> [tanji_y](https://twitter.com/tanji_y/status/1644536937754296321) "Before the invention of copyright", creators were mainly nourished by the royal nobility and religious communities, right? Or some kind of hobby for unknown people.

>  The middle class (masses) that supported "mass production and mass consumption" itself originated from the industrial revolution (printing technology). It is very multilayered.
