title: "equality"
---

> The Japanese idea of equality is that people are born with no great differences in ability, so everyone should work hard and grow into a [[standard]]. In the U.S., there are children who are born with different abilities from the beginning, so equality is to be able to receive an education suited to each individual. Without changing the way of thinking, [[gifted education]] is not possible.
> >I see. The "principle of equality" that "there should be no difference in natural ability" attributes differences in performance to "[[effort]]" and instead makes children [[non-favourable]] and negative about [[redistribution policy]], which in turn makes children [[non-favourable]] and negative toward [[redistribution policy]].

[Does anti-competitive education reduce helping each other?　Fumio Otake's Training the Economic Brain Japan Center for Economic Research](https://www.jcer.or.jp/column/otake/index666.html)
> The most extreme form of education that emphasizes cooperation rather than competition would be to not assign rankings to various grades. In Japan, there were elementary schools that did not include a race in athletic meets, or even if they did have a race, they did not assign a rank, or in extreme cases, they held hands and let everyone finish the race together. The results of Ito, Kubota and Ohtake's (2014) analysis are shocking. Those who received an anti-competitive education were less [[altruistic]], more negative toward cooperation, more likely to have a less reciprocal [[you get beat up, you beat back]] value system, and more likely to be negative toward redistributive policies. Perhaps the exact opposite of what education was intended to achieve.
