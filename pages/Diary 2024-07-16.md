> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1812741703545307369) Some people say that "most voters don't have the ability to think about policy," but if the process of thinking about policy and the information and budgetary constraints that provide the material for thinking about policy are not made public, then no matter how capable the voter is, he or she will not be able to think about policy. However, if the process of thinking about policy and the information and budget constraints that are the materials for thinking about policy are not made public, no matter how capable the voters are, they will not be able to think about it.

> [hazuma](https://x.com/hazuma/status/1813103699327349166) University students are very authoritarian, and when I was a graduate student, I was laughed at for reading Emory Gyosei and Žižek. Nowadays, both Emorya and Žižek are world-renowned intellectuals, and professors at the University of Tokyo are quoting them all the time. But that just means that they have become authorities, and the essence has not changed. It is important to judge with your own eyes.
