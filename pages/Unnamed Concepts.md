title: "Unnamed Concepts"
---

- There is a [[CONCEPT]] for [[ANONYMOUS]].
This concept of "anonymous concept" is not outlandish; it is the same as having an [[anonymous function]] in programming.
First, there is a concept, and then "[[Name]]" as [[handle]] is attached to the concept that needs to be used elsewhere.

Such is the case with the text on the [[Scrapbox]] page.
It expresses a mass of meaning, but that mass of meaning has no particular name.
When you decide to mention it from another page, it would be "more convenient if it were cut out on another page.
- When [[cutting]], "I have to give it a title," he says.
Thus, the unnamed concept is given a title as a handle.

The same goes for [[refactoring]] in the source code. We say, "Let's cut out this range into a separate method."

- [[Fragments that are easy to name are good fragments]] 。
