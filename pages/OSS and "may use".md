title: 'OSS and "may use"'
---

Reading "[[You may read it, but you don't have to.]]" and "[[You can read it and you can use it.]]" clarified my stance on [[OSS]] a little.
Essentially, you're saying, "You can use it, but you don't have to.

For those who do "activities to get people to use it," I say "if you want to do it, do it," because that's one way to use it, but I don't believe you need to do it.

Basically, OSS is software that is written for a certain purpose, and after that purpose is achieved, if there is no need to keep the software proprietary, it is "free to use" by releasing it to the public.
- This perspective does not match those who say, "The goal is for this OSS to be used by many people.
- If what I want to do next can be achieved efficiently by "modifying this OSS", I will do so, and if it can be achieved efficiently by "using or creating another OSS", I will do so.
