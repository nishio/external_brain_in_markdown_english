> Petitions are a right of the people guaranteed by the Constitution. A person who wishes to petition submits a petition to the chairman of each House of the Diet through an introduction by a member of the Diet. The House Committee examines the submitted petitions, and if the content of the petition is deemed appropriate, it is adopted at a plenary session, and if the Cabinet deems it appropriate to take action, it is sent to the Cabinet. The Cabinet reports annually to the Houses on the progress of the petitions sent to it.
