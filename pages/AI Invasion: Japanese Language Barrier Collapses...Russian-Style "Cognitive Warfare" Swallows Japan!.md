Mr. Yasuno's argument (timed and to the point only)
- 2 : 30–3 : 07
    - Generative AI reduces the time required for policy research "not by a factor of 10, but by a factor of 100 or more.
- 3 : 12–6 : 04
    - Perplexity's "Deep Research" feature allows you to create a 30,000-word report in about 10 minutes, with source links for easy halcyonation verification.
    - → From the survey, "selection and decision-making of large amounts of information" is the bottleneck.
- 6 : 44–7 : 20
    - AI will change the way politicians work itself, as it allows them to gain basic knowledge in a short time, even in fields outside their expertise.
- 8 : 45–9 : 07
    - AI capabilities are bumpy and unaccountable. Human politicians" are essential for making final decisions and building diverse trust.
- 9 : 47–11 : 05
    - Politicians who can use "broad listening" - a method of evolving policies and manifestos by listening broadly to the entire electorate - will win in the age of AI and social networking.
- 11 : 36–14 : 19
    - Political finance issues can be solved through IT and transparency. Example: Sweden has secured trust by disclosing the details of public credit cards of cabinet ministers.
    - → Developing an open source fund management tool that can be used across parties (free of charge and operated as OSS since it is not dependent on funders).
- 15 : 24–15 : 42
    - AI x Democracy x Broad Listening" is having a revolutionary impact on Japanese politics.
- 16 : 06–17 : 30
    - Cognitive warfare in the use of AI is already a reality: an example is the alleged Russian funding of TikTok influencers in the Romanian presidential election.
    - → A similar intervention could occur in Japan.
- 18 : 13–18 : 40
    - The war in Ukraine actually involved information manipulation through deep fakes and mass bots.
- 19 : 04–21 : 17
    - Until now, the Japanese language has been a barrier to cyber attacks, but the barrier has disappeared with high-performance translation. Japan's infrastructure is becoming "vulnerable and naked.
- 21 : 40–23 : 08
    - There are examples of mass submissions by generated AIs in the pubic commentary on the Basic Energy Plan, and the danger of distorting the democratic process.
    - → We should counter with "AI against AI" to detect unnatural concentrated submissions and conduct qualitative analysis with broad listening.
