title: "Rorty's irony."
---

I don't think it's a good idea to abbreviate "irony" unless it's obvious from the context.
    - [[resolution (e.g., display, dpi)]] goes down [[blurry words]].

Rorty's irony is not "[[irony]]" as a so-called generic term, nor is its dictionary translation "[[irony]]".
Rorty's ironist also does not mean "cynic."

Rorty's irony's target of critical action is "my vocabulary."

- Doubts about the vocabulary of the endpoint: For Rorty, ironists have deep doubts about the vocabulary they use, especially the "[[vocabulary of the endpoint]]" by which they capture and describe the world and phenomena. They do not believe that this vocabulary represents absolute truth and are constantly questioning its appropriateness and validity.
- Awareness of the limits of vocabulary: Ironists understand that arguments and discussions formed by the vocabulary they use cannot resolve this fundamental question. In other words, they are aware of the limitations of their language and thinking and act accordingly.
- denial of absolute superiority: ironists do not believe that their vocabulary or views are closer to reality than any other vocabulary or views. This indicates a [[relativistic]] approach to knowledge and truth, accepting that many other views and interpretations can exist.
Rorty's irony refers to a constant questioning of one's vocabulary and thought systems, an awareness of one's limitations, and a refusal to claim absolute truth or superiority. In this way, Rorty encourages deep reflection and self-criticism of the way we understand and speak about the world.
