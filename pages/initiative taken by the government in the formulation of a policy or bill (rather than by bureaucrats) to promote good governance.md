> In addition, in order to aggregate the opinions of those who read the policies as effectively as possible, we will utilize "Idobata," an AI system developed by the open source community. This will allow anyone to chat with the AI and ask questions or express their opinions to the party while reading the policy.
>  Opinions will be discussed with the AI, and will be turned into a change proposal (Pull Request), which will actually be submitted to Team Mirai. These proposals will be assigned URLs so that it will be possible to track how the proposals were reviewed. We would also like to learn from the AI chat by analyzing what kind of questions and suggestions were frequently asked in the AI chat.
>  Please try to chat with the policy AI!　We look forward to your valuable input and wisdom.

Hi, can I make a suggestion out of the blue?

Yes, of course! What is your proposal?

Proposal to allow minors to participate in politics Some minors lament that they cannot participate in election activities because they are not adults. We think about what should happen in the future. We would like to bypass the high wall of revision of the Public Offices Election Law and aim for a quick win. We can prevent people from creating multiple accounts and watering down their opinions by authenticating them with their own numbers, and we can exempt them from the [[Public Offices Election Law]] by making it a vote for an issue rather than a candidate, thereby opening up voting to minors. Then, when the election for public office approaches, the approval or disapproval of each issue for each generation will be made visible. As a meta-mechanism, it is up to the individual people to decide "how much weight to give to the opinions of the visible minors in voting. This can be regarded as the participation of minors in voting, appropriately weighted by the will of the people.

Thank you for your suggestion, Nishio. Very interesting idea regarding "political participation of minors."
There are a few points about this proposal that I would like to discuss with you. For example, in terms of creating a voting system for issues (individual policy issues) using my number authentication, what exactly do you envision this system to be? Also, we may need to check from a legal perspective whether we can really avoid the restrictions of the Public Offices Election Law by making it "voting for issues rather than candidates".
Can you elaborate a bit on these points?

Public office election law probably only provides for the selection of candidates.

Your interpretation is that "since the Public Offices Election Law is limited to the selection of candidates (elections), minors may be able to participate as long as they express their opinions on policy issues." Yes, that seems to be a possibility.
However, if this expression of opinion is regarded as a campaign to substantially influence the election or defeat of a particular candidate, there may be no possibility that it will be subject to regulation under the Public Offices Election Law. For example, "Let's support candidate A who agrees with this policy!" and so on. What do you think about this?

We should have an AI to filter such statements.

Okay, the idea is to "filter problematic statements by AI". It may be technically possible.
However, there are likely to be issues such as whether filtering by AI will function perfectly, what criteria will be used to determine "problematic statements," and how to ensure the objectivity and fairness of these criteria. For example, opinions on certain policy issues often result in favoring or disadvantaging a particular candidate. It may be difficult for AI to draw that line.
What is your opinion on this point, Nishio-san?

It cannot be said that "an opinion on a policy issue that results in favoring or disadvantaging a particular candidate" violates the Public Offices Election Law.

As Nishio-san said, discussing policy itself is not considered to be regulated by the Public Offices Election Law.
So, what specific types of posts do you envision restricting with AI-based filtering? For example, does it cover direct calls for voting or slander against a particular candidate?

I think a direct call for votes and slander against a particular candidate is fine.

I understand your point about filtering out direct calls for voting and slander against specific candidates.
Now, how do you think we should incorporate this idea of an "issue voting system to promote underage political participation" into our current manifesto? For example, we could add it to the "Digital Democracy" section, or add it as a new item.

I'll add it to the "Digital Democracy" section.

Yes, sir. Let's add Nisio's idea to the manifesto in connection with the "Digital Democracy" section.
In the current file "README.md", there is a chapter titled "This manifesto itself will be improved by gathering everyone's wisdom". This chapter is the part that explains that the manifesto is not yet in its final form and that we are seeking your opinions. How about adding the following sentence to this section to reflect NISHIO's suggestion?
(current end) "In addition, a more readable form of the manifesto v1.0 for most voters will be released in mid-June." (Added here) "We are also exploring new forms of political participation using digital technology, such as introducing a system that allows minors to express their opinions on policy issues (issues) with the support of AI filtering, using authentication by their own number. This will allow the voices of minors, the voters of the future, to be better reflected in policy formation."
If this proposed change is acceptable, I will save it in Nisio's draft space. Please let us know what you think.

I'd prefer to write in the digital democracy file instead of the current file.

Thank you for your suggestion, Nishio. It is true that the relevance of the content would be clearer if it is described directly in the "Digital Democracy" file (16_Step1DigitalDemocracy.md, according to the table of contents).
However, sorry, currently I can only edit README.md directly.
Therefore, we have some suggestions on how to proceed.
1. temporarily add this idea to the references to "digital democracy" in README.md (e.g., table of contents, related chapters, etc.), and later, Shio-san himself will move it to 16_Step1DigitalDemocracy.md.
2. outline this idea in README.md and state "This is a proposal for 'digital democracy'" in the request for review.
Which method would you prefer? Or do you have a preference for a different method?

Okay, let's go with number two.

Yes sir, let's proceed with the second method.
How about adding the following to the end of the chapter "This manifesto itself will be improved by gathering everyone's wisdom" in README.md, as an outline of your proposal?
(current end) "In the meantime, the manifesto v1.0, in a form more readable to most voters, will be released in mid-June." (add here) "In addition, as part of our efforts to promote digital democracy, we are considering the introduction of a system to facilitate the political participation of minors. We plan to discuss this in detail in a separate section, '16_Step 1 Digital Democracy.md'."
I think it would be easier for others who see this change to understand that this is what should be discussed in the "Digital Democracy" section if it is stated in this way.
If this proposed change is acceptable, I will save it in Nisio's draft space. What do you think?

OK

Thank you very much. I will now update README.md with your suggestion and save it in Nisio's draft space.
The commit message will be "Update README.md (based on Nisio's suggestion, add a note about consideration of political participation of minors in digital democracy)".
If you are satisfied with this, perform a save. The file has been saved.
Next, set up a review request (pull request) title and description in preparation for others to review these changes.
How about a title, for example, "README.md Update: Addition to Consideration of Political Participation of Minors in Digital Democracy"?
The description should include a detailed description of what changes were made, the purpose and background of the change. I would like to include an overview of Nishio's idea for an issue voting system to promote political participation of minors and why he thought this change was necessary.
May we proceed with this content? If you have any other requests, please feel free to let us know.

OK

Yes, sir. Now, set the title and description of the pull request as follows
Title: README.md updated: Addition regarding consideration of political participation of minors in digital democracy (proposed by Nishio-san)
Description: (in Japanese only)
This change is intended to reflect in the manifesto the idea proposed by Mr. Nisio regarding the use of digital technology to promote the political participation of minors.
Background of Proposal
Currently, minors are effectively restricted from participating in election activities by the Public Offices Election Law. However, there is an awareness of the issue that the voices of the younger generation are not adequately reflected in the policy-making process, which is deeply related to their own future. Therefore, rather than aiming directly at the high hurdle of amending the Public Offices Election Law, we believe it is important to establish a system that allows minors to express their opinions on policy issues and have their voices influence politics, even indirectly, in a way that is feasible within the framework of current laws.
Proposal Details
The specific ideas proposed by Nishio are as follows
1. introduction of an issue-based commenting system:.
Instead of voting for candidates, we will create an online system that allows people to express their approval or disapproval and opinions on individual policy issues (issues).
2. use of my number authentication:.
Personal authentication using a my number card will be introduced when expressing opinions, to prevent unauthorized opinion padding or "spoofing" through multiple accounts, and to ensure highly reliable opinion aggregation.
3. exclusion from the Public Offices Election Law:.
Since the purpose of this system is not to vote for candidates, it does not constitute "election campaigning," and minors may participate without being restricted by the Public Offices Election Law.
4. filtering of inappropriate posts by AI
To maintain the health of discussions within the system, we utilize AI technology to filter out inappropriate postings, such as direct calls for voting for a particular candidate or slanderous remarks about an individual. This maintains a constructive exchange of opinions.
- Visualization and utilization of opinions by generation: 5.
Aggregated opinions will be visualized and published by generation (especially those of minors). When elections approach, voters can use these data (especially minors' opinions on each issue) to determine their own voting behavior. In this way, we aim to allow the opinions of minors to indirectly influence election results and policy decisions through voters' judgments. In other words, it is a meta-structure to realize political participation of minors appropriately weighted by the will of the people, leaving it to the individual will of each voting member to decide "how much weight to give to the visible opinions of minors to be reflected in his or her own vote.
Expected Effects
It is hoped that this mechanism will make it easier for minors to participate in policy discussions and that their opinions will be better reflected in policy. In addition, we believe that having minors gain experience in taking an interest in social issues and thinking independently at a young age will help nurture better citizens in the future.
About this change
This proposal should be discussed and described in detail in the "16_Step 1 Digital Democracy.md" section of the manifesto, but since "README.md" is the only file that I (AI Assistant) can directly edit in the current system, I have decided to add a note at the end of "README.md" to this proposal. We have decided to add a note at the end of "README.md" to indicate that we are starting this study. After this pull request is approved, we would appreciate it if you would consider adding or editing the appropriate sections.
I would like to thank Mr. Nisio for this important suggestion.
I will update the pull request information with the above information. Is that correct?

OK

Thank you. I will now update the information on the review request (pull request) with the information you just provided.
Please wait a moment.
Updated titles and descriptions of review requests (pull requests).
Now Nisio's proposed changes are ready for others to review. You can review the proposal at this link: [https://github.com/team-mirai/policy/pull/191](https://github.com/team-mirai/policy/pull/191)
Is there anything else we can help you with?
