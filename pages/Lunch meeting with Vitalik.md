> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1818517641893757304) I've been asked about this by someone who didn't understand why Vitalik was talking about a governing system, and I've explained a lot about it, so I'll put it here as well. A "general-purpose computer that can compute common content while being globally distributed," conceived in 2013 and realized in 2016, which makes private contracts possible through technology rather than law and enforcement.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1819168756280840274) "Contracts written and enforced in a common language regardless of country" realized in this way is a service that until now has been realized and provided by the state, and taxes are collected to pay for the maintenance of that service. Ethereum also automatically collects taxes in the form of "fees" for each transaction, which, if considered as tax revenue, would make the Ethereum country about the size of two Sakai cities.

    - [/tkgshn/public chain that is an automatic tax collection machine is almost government](https://scrapbox.io/tkgshn/public chain that is an automatic tax collection machine is almost government).
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1819171093368000561) And out of that tax revenue and corporate earnings, investments are made in public goods to enrich the Ethereum ecosystem, which is the same "public works" as the government pulling a road or bullet train. This is the same "public works" as the government pulling roads and bullet trains. Less than $1 billion has been distributed so far.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1819173016552853582) If we consider the release in 2016 as the founding of the country, it is an emerging country that has grown to this scale in just 8 years, and the smart founding leader who designed the country and made it successful is Vitalik. And since the country has no land or natural resources, the engine of growth is technology, which leads to the key phrase "[[governing technology]]".
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1819174109936603177) Assuming that you are a university student majoring in political science who is not familiar with technology, I wrote this explanation focusing on what seems interesting from your point of view. I am also an amateur who has only studied [[web3]] as an adjacent area of [[Plurality]] for the past year on a whim, so I welcome comments from those who are familiar with the subject.

> [0xtkgshn](https://x.com/0xtkgshn/status/1819168657567896046) I guess it's possible that the word "governance" in Japanese is a bad word lol
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1819178323811225816) Whatever the word, people who want to think they are superior by criticizing the rulers turn that word into a bad word.
