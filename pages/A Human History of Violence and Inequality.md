    - Human history of [[violence]] and [inequality
- Japan used to be a society with a lot of [[disparity]], but the disparity has decreased. The story goes that this is because Japan fought an all-out war that mobilized the entire population and the entire economy, and lost (though not exclusively).
- If you give this book to someone who thinks "[[equality]] is good and [[disparity]] is bad" or "[[peace]] is good and [[war]] is bad," you're likely to get cognitive dissonance and go crazy.


    - [[violence]]
