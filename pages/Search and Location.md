- [[search (e.g. for someone using a search engine)]] and [[Location]].
    - [[Hearing of dissatisfaction with Scrapbox]]
    - Use search and [[Follow the link]] instead of prior "[[location]]" as a means of narrowing scope
    - Search results are in miscellaneous columns
        - Breaking location information
    - Search results display highlighting pre-positioned items
        - It appears that Scrapbox's philosophy is concerned that "pre-positioning leads to unmaintainability."
- synthesis (in semiconductor technology)
        - The [[snippet]] column in [[search results]] has a [[context]] for the keywords, so it can be vector [[embedding]] in a [[skip-gram]] fashion.
    - Ad hoc location generation and presentation for those who have not been previously positioned
    - For those who have pre-positioned, show respect for that positioning.
