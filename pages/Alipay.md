- Train fare can be paid with Suica (done)
- Suica can be used to pay at convenience stores (done)
- Suica can be used to pay for daily necessities supermarkets
- Mobile Suica application allows for person-to-person money transfers for splitting a drinking party.
    - No need to register as a friend to send money.
- Payments and remittances are recorded and can be allocated and observed by expense category.
    - So to speak, "All payments made with Suica go into MoneyForward without any settings."
