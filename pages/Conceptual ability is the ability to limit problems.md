- [[conceptual ability]] is [[Ability to limit the problem]].
A is "a study I wish I could do, but probably can't."
B is for "small but focused study."
C is for "research that looks good but is ultimately useless."
D is for "pointless research."


- Ideas like, "[[It]] can do everything," "[[It]] makes everyone happy," or "[[It]] can be used in a wide range of applications," are not great ideas, but rather, they are not able to "narrow down the problem.
