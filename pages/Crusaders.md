These expeditions were a series of [[religious wars]] between the Christian and Muslim worlds, and there is much historical debate as to their motives, objectives, and results.

### Results and Impact
.
- Cultural Exchange: The Crusades are credited with promoting cultural exchange between Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean region, paving the way for the later Renaissance.
- Interreligious conflict: On the one hand, it has given rise to serious interreligious conflicts, such as the split between Christians and Muslims, and even between Christians in the East and West churches.
- Political Impact: The Crusades also brought about changes in the European feudal system, contributing to the strengthening of centralized royal power.

Nishio's use of the term "crusade" can be interpreted as a reference to the phenomenon that exists in modern society where a group of people who strongly believe in a particular belief or ideology may eliminate or attack those who do not share that belief. It uses the historical event of the Crusades, a religious war in the past, as a metaphor, suggesting that similar mechanisms may occur in different contemporary contexts.

### A discussion of the modern "crusade" phenomenon
.
- Information Fragmentation and Echo Chambers: The Internet and social networking sites have made it easier for people to be exposed only to information they believe. This tends to reduce tolerance for differing opinions and intensify conflict.
- The rise of [[identity politics]]: individual and group [[identity]] often becomes a political point of contention, which can lead to a strong [[sense of community]] but also to the exclusion of others.
- The [[populist]] wave: Populism, which offers simple solutions against a backdrop of social and economic discontent, is on the rise worldwide. This movement often fuels [[the "us versus them" conflict.]] and deepens social divisions.
- [Digital vigilantism: Online vigilantism is on the rise, with certain individuals and groups attacking others in the name of "[[right]]". This can be seen as a modern form of "crusading" behavior.
