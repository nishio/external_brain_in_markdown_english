    - Let T be the [[Technology Portfolio]] vector of [[specialist]].
- Customers cannot directly observe t
    - Comprehension issues
    - Differences in values
- Customer observes O = f(T) multiplied by the [[Presentation]] function f
- The inner product of this observation and the customer's [[values]] vector V is the customer's perceived value C
    - $C = f(T) \cdot V$
- f can be changed to suit the customer.
    - This [[translation]] capability raises the expectation of value perceived by the customer.
