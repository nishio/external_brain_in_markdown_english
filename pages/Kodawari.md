<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/> " [[fastidiousness]] " (Kodawari) is a Japanese term that doesn't have a direct equivalent in English, but it roughly translates to a deep commitment, dedication, or particular attention to detail. It's a concept that is deeply ingrained in many aspects of Japanese culture and society. Here’s an explanation for those unfamiliar with Japanese culture:

- Pursuit of Perfection: Kodawari reflects a mindset of striving for excellence and perfection in a specific area or activity. This could be in crafting, cooking, service, or even everyday tasks.

- Attention to Detail: It involves paying close attention to every aspect of a process or product, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant. The idea is that every detail contributes to the overall quality or experience.

- Passion and Pride: Kodawari often indicates a strong personal passion or pride in one's work or hobby. It's about taking great care and putting one's heart and soul into an activity.

- Quality and Craftsmanship: In Japan, kodawari is often associated with high-quality products and superior craftsmanship. It's a philosophy that underlies the creation of many traditional Japanese crafts and modern products.

- Customer Experience: In business and service industries, kodawari can manifest as a commitment to providing customers with the best possible experience, often going above and beyond standard expectations.

This shop truly has ‘kodawari’ even from a Japanese perspective. On the other hand, there were another ramen shop featured in the video, that had Japanese language mistakes that native Japanese wouldn’t make.

- Cultural Significance: The concept is reflective of a broader cultural appreciation for diligence, meticulousness, and the mastery of skills. It's seen in everything from the preparation of sushi to the design of electronics.

- Individual and Societal Impact: While kodawari can lead to exceptional outcomes and is often celebrated, it can also create high expectations and pressures for individuals, especially in professional contexts.

In essence, kodawari is a term that encapsulates a part of the Japanese ethos - the devotion to and relentless pursuit of excellence in one’s craft or area of interest, with a deep respect for the details and process involved.
