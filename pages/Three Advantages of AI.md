Three Advantages of AI
Q: From your perspective, what are the three biggest benefits that AI technology brings to society?
- Strengthening Listening Skills
    - LLM increases human productivity. Increased output productivity requires an equally or greater increase in input efficiency. This is both a problem and an opportunity to enhance the human "capacity to understand the opinions of many," thereby enabling each of us to make better decisions.
        - [[broad listening]]
- Improved communication
        - The elimination of the [[language barrier]], which prevents cross-cultural understanding. In LLM-mediated asynchronous communication, individual humans can speak synchronously with AI in their own preferred language, and AI knows what speakers of various languages around the world feel.
            - [[LLM-mediated communication]]
        - [[Bridging synchronous and asynchronous communication]]. People are elicited and helped to formulate their opinions through conversation and chat. On the other hand, synchronous communication between people is expensive and does not scale. Therefore, AI and humans communicate synchronously, and the essence drawn from the conversation is used for asynchronous communication between humans. This has been made possible by the creation of fluent LLMs.
