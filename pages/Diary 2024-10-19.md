The result of actually collecting and visualizing the opinions of 113 people reveals that public opinion is not a dichotomy between the ruling and opposition parties of "abolish policy activity fees immediately" v.s. "do not abolish", but a third group of "let's strengthen third-party monitoring". The "public opinion map" is functioning properly as a map that gives a bird's-eye view of the whole picture!

Such visualization helps prevent political debates from falling into a false dichotomy.

For example, in this case, we can see that in addition to the opinion groups included by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and those included by the opposition parties, there is a third opinion group. This kind of visualization discourages political discussion from becoming a false dichotomy.
