#Blind spot card, save for later
If that's not a coincidence, what is?

The energy to move a continent was unknown at the time, and criticism was made that something as large as a continent could not move, and if it did, what would move it?

Whether or not you can explain why a phenomenon occurs is irrelevant to the discussion of whether or not the phenomenon is occurring.
