title: "Smartness does not correlate with rationality."
---

> IQ-like [[intelligence]] has little correlation with the ability to make rational decisions, and in fact, the smarter a person is, the more likely he or she is to fall into the "intelligence trap" of disastrous irrationality in order to better gather evidence to justify himself or herself. I thought this was a very important lesson: smartness is not the same as the ability to make the right decision.
> I am just trying to give you an idea, but "[[reasonableness]]" is instantaneous and fast thinking with arithmetical processing power. On the other hand, "[[reasonableness]]" is slow thinking, looking at things from various directions, without bias, and with a high level of imagination. In this light, it is not surprising that the two do not correlate. Fortunately, the latter ability can be acquired with training.
