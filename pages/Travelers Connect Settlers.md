The concept I've been intrigued by recently was referred to as "[[Nomads]]", but the boundary was slightly off. The appropriate name for the concept I was seeking is "[[Travelers]]".
- The antonym is "[[Settlers]]"
- Travelers do not necessarily [[nomadize]]. [[Caravans]] are also an option.
    - They do not necessarily move on land. [[Merchants]] trading by ship are also travelers.
        - [[(7.2.5) Knowledge Trading Strategy Across Organizational Boundaries]]
    - [[Travel Expands the Observation Range]]
        - Settlers have a narrow [[observation range]]
- Travelers connect and [[network]] settlers, who would otherwise become [[isolated]]


[[Travel]] and [[Settlement]]

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1639251123222745089) @0xtkgshn The story of "travelers" from two years ago and the recent thoughts on nomads have connected!
> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1639251273777049600) Isn't this about how to know the [[choices in life]]?
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1639255655969341440) Exactly. Travelers expand their observation range and learn about [[choices]], while settlers have a narrow view. This connects with the idea of creating value by [[carrying knowledge]], and the recent thoughts on "nomads" being abstracted to "travelers", including [[caravans]].
> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1639266613085044740) By moving across physical spaces, communities, currencies, and languages, one can see their original place or subject relatively (objectively), so the concept of travel is highly valuable! This insight came from a previous job at @hassyadai, where I was constantly asked about [[cognitive and choice disparities]].

> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1639255086797922306) It's important to value those doing "strange" things
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1639256422197383168) Because from the perspective of settlers, [[visitors]] appear as "[[strange people]]".

> 0xtkgshn Yes, it means that meaning only resides in differences
> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1639267004967165952) Applying this to consensus systems and decision-making, the challenge of @[[DeCartography]] was to propose that "things supported by various entities are good". Simply put, it involved identifying identities in the Ethereum ecosystem and making decisions on "which public goods to support" in collaboration with @[[Gitcoin]].
> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1639268164692328450) Cartography is a Greek term meaning the technique of map-making.
>  Mapping these identities is similar in thought to Hiroki Azuma's [[Visualization of the General Will]] and Yusuke Narita's [[Algorithmic Democracy]].
>  Behavior history on Ethereum is on-chain and [[Permissionless]], which serves as a basis for adjusting voting power in Gitcoin's [[Quadratic Funding]].
