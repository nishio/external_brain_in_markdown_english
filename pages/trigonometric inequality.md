$d(x, y) + d(y, z) \ge d(x, z)$

- Condition that the distance between x and z is less than or equal to "the sum of the distance between x and y and the distance between y and z".
- That "going directly from x to z is a shorter distance than going after a detour to y."
- It is valid with respect to physical distance.
- There are often cases where it is not possible to establish a relationship between the words "[[distant]] and [[close]]" in terms of Metaphors of Distance.
        - [[semantic similarity]]
