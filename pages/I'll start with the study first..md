title: "I'll start with the study first."

> [yuseiito_](https://twitter.com/yuseiito_/status/1755202111300854091) There was a tweet that said, "You have to study to know what you can make, so it's good to start programming from study first. Well, it may be "good", but in the end, it is "what you can make" that you make. It would be a waste to skip the period when you can truly think about "what you want to make" and think like a human being after studying.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1755218724699910617) The person who made the original statement didn't understand that "the time has come for someone with a few years of study to know how to make something that can be made without studying it, just ask GPT4". Ugh. People who say that we should think about what to make after studying are the same as those who say that we should draw manga after we become good at drawing.

>  > People who have never made anything they wanted to make or researched anything they wanted to research are just longing for "evaluation of results and self-realization" and are not interested in or fond of experimental results, implementation itself, or its process.
    - [[People who have never wanted to make it and have never made it.]]

Sooner or later, the "devilishness" will increase, so it would be good if we can try to create something with a high "angelic" level at the beginning.
