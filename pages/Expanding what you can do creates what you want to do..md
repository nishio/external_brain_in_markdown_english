- I can't do it now, but I want to.
- Wanting to do" is not necessarily part of "being made" at this point in time.
- Doing something expands what you "can do".
- There's an X in that widened range.
- Sometimes, after realizing this, they say, "I want to do X."

concrete example
- I was shown cutting a tree with a band saw.
- I thought it was only big factories or something that could curve wood.
- I never thought I would be allowed to use such a community center.
- If wood can be cut in curves, can't you make something like this? I want to make it!
