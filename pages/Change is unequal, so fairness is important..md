- It occurred to me that the principles of [[information sharing]] and open discussion, which are called [[fairness]] in Cybozu's philosophy, may be causing synergy with the high groupware utilization rate.
- In the world, there is an idea that "people should be equal," which is called "[[equality]]" in good terms and "[[peer pressure]]" in bad terms. Under this "people should be equal" philosophy, the act of "creating a new system to solve someone's dissatisfaction" is negatively evaluated as "only that person benefits and it is unfair, it is not equal.
- Cybozu, which operates [[100 Personnel Systems for 100 People in 100 Different Ways]], does not have this "equal" philosophy. On the contrary, it is the idea that "each person is different. Under this premise, what kind of "[[The Concept of Good]]" Cybozu has instead is "fairness". #100 people, 100 different ways.
- When creating a new system, the timing of verbalizing a need that has not been verbalized before, the assumed user is just you or a few people, but in the process of examining it, information is shared according to the principles of "fairness" and "publicly and obviously saying out loud that it is right," and when people see it, they say "I wanted it, too. It snowballs and expands.
- On the other hand, in an environment where one has to say, "This system will make this many people happy," when introducing a new system, it is difficult to create a climate that encourages more and more suggestions from the bottom. This is because high costs are imposed on the proposer. If the cost of "putting up with it or quitting" and "proposing and changing the system" is lower in the latter case, then proposals will be made; otherwise, they will not.
- And then I was writing and the articles started flowing.

    - Workplace Reform that Enables "100 People, 100 Different Styles" is Born from Understanding and Sympathy | Mirai Works, Ltd.
- >  This is the starting point of Cybozu's work style reform. We continue to change our internal systems based on the idea that "this system is designed for person A" and "this part of the system will be changed so that person B's wishes can be realized.
- This is exactly what it is.
- Some companies have a culture of inequality, and in those companies, the "Definition of Good" needs to be changed first, but I guess that will be difficult.
- If we want to do a personnel system that looks at each individual, the burden will be much greater than it is now, so we will either need to reduce the number of employees or increase the number of personnel.

- [[Change is unequal]] So fairness is important.
