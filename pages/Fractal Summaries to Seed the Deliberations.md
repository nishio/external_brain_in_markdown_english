title: "Fractal Summaries to Seed the Deliberations"

from  [[Applying TalkToTheCity to Books]]
- [[Fractal Summary]] to [Seed for deliberation
This might be a bit related to fractal summarization, or in the context of digital democracy, the theme of how to efficiently input knowledge from where it's needed in a situation where a lot of knowledge is needed.
The fractal summarization was especially good in that it allowed me to summarize what was said in the conversation later, in a hierarchical manner, while grounding it in the original speech.
So I think it would be useful to put the results of the fractal reservation of the conversation into TalkToTheCity, or some other digital democratic tool.

When I was using fractal summarization, I felt comfortable summarizing from videoconference discussions, probably because the amount of information in the "so-called summary" is too thin, with only "this topic was discussed", and the level of transcription is distracted by the mess caused by mistakes. I think there's value in a "summary that can be drilled down to the details as needed".
This is used for inputting information to people in the deliberation system, for example, a video of a dialogue between Mr. Yasuno and an expert is fractally summarized with "a slightly adjusted prompt for later use in the deliberation system," and the [[seed comments]] are then fed into Polis or some other platform where users can express their opinions and are seeded. The user's opinion and the opinion connected to the video are placed on the same two-dimensional map (in the same way that [[public opinion map]] places users and political parties in the same space).

I was just sorting through it, and it doesn't really need to be a fractal summary.
- Summary of the entire video
- Detailed summary
    - TTTC's EXTRACTION to extract detailed opinions
I felt that two of the following were enough
