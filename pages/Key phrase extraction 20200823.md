title: "Key phrase extraction 20200823"
---

- I wonder if [[keyphrase extraction]] by [[RAKE]] and [[short sentence extraction]] are related.
- Key phrase extraction can be divided into two phases
    - Creating keyphrase candidates
    - Scoring key phrase candidates
- I think [[concentration (of one's attention)]] could be used for scoring.

- When RAKE is compared to [[CRF]], the "two or more occurrences" feature is different from a simple CRF [Global Features

- Order by set size of candidate key phrases
    - explicit human-powered set
    - noun phrase
    - stop-word increment
    - RAKE-like coupling
    - substring
- Order by length of key phrase candidates
    - character
    - word
    - stop-word increment
    - RAKE-like coupling
    - punctuation marks
    - short piece of writing (e.g. passage, article, composition)
