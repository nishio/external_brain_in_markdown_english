title: "Frameworks shift and change, just like fashion trends."

Modifying an existing [[framework]] is less costly to society as a whole, including the users of that framework, though,
The gain for the individual engineer who implements it is
- It costs more to fix a large one.
- It is easier to earn returns if you are involved in something new.
    - Higher than the return from "maintaining the old."
So it's more profitable to do the new one.
As a result, new frameworks are being created in rapid succession, and society is forced to pay the costs of framework transition
When you act on [[individual economic rationality]], you're acting against [[society's economic rationality]].
