title: "Unexplored Junior Anonymous Question Box"
---

I created "[Unexplored Junior Anonymous Question Box](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIRkBQEOh7OUjlvPD7IZDDVwPlms2rcXBPSpib0w25WRLWnQ/viewform)".
This page will show you how this was created.
This is because the main project of Junior Unexplored takes nearly six months to complete, making it difficult to grasp the big picture, but this project is compact and integrates all the important elements.

point worthy of note
- Explain what you want to make and why
    - Information is gathered from people who share the same interests.
        - Policy on using Google Forms
- Discussion of whether or not to notify the questioner by email
    - No notification & no mail address collection policy
    - Policy on using unexplored junior hashtags
- mounting
- Miscellaneous Releases
    - I see it working and have a plan to improve it.
        - Correction.
