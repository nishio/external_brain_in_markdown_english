title: "Related pages in vector search"

from [[pVectorSearch2023-06-05]]
- [[related page]] in [[vector search]]
Technically, if I throw in a Scrapbox URL, I can grab the content, embed it, and return search results.
- So a vector search will bring up related pages.
- What kind of UI is good is subtle.
    - If it doesn't cost anything, I'd just put it on the list of related pages.
    - If you don't have a cache or something, the money melts away as it gets banged up mechanically...
    - Well, anyway, if I put it out there in UserScript, I'm the only one who can see it.
