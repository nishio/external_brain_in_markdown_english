Thoughts on using a private OMNI
- I see the value in being able to search by link rather than keyword, but I have more situations where I want to search for a multi-line "paragraph" than I do when I search for my Scrapbox.
    - I have a feeling that the current UI of "placing a link to a specific page makes it a target for AI generation" is not appropriate.
    - That's because I'm searching more and more for "paragraphs that haven't been put together yet and don't have titles."
- There are situations where you explicitly want to search from your Scrapbox.
    - Why not search from someone else's description?
    - An implicit sense of the ratio of divergence to convergence?
    - Vector search is equivalent to "put something that seems relevant nearby" in the early stages of the KJ method.
