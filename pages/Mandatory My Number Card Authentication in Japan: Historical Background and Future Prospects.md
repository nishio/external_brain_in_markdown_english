Mandatory [[My Number Card Authentication]] in Japan: Historical Background and Future Prospects

# 1. Past technological transition and user response
.

## Internet Explorer (IE) no longer supported
.
Major transitions in web technology tend to be met with resistance at first, but eventually adapted as new solutions emerge.
- For example, the end of support for Internet Explorer (IE) caused great concern in Japan, with Microsoft officially ending support for IE in June 2022, bringing "fear" to the hearts of many Japanese companies that were unable to let go of their old browsers
- Despite years of warnings, as of May 2022, only 14% of Japanese companies had fully migrated to the latest browser, and another 15% had not even begun updating, leaving hundreds of sites "tied" to IE (1).
- Users and developers faced confusion, but workarounds, such as IE compatibility mode in Edge, contributed to a quick resolution
- Ultimately, the transition was inevitable, and by late 2022, companies rushed to take measures to free themselves from IE's shackles, and Japanese netizens bid farewell to IE with humor and memes on social networking sites!

A similar pattern was seen with older versions of Firefox and other browsers, where web services gradually discontinued support for older versions, requiring users to upgrade or switch to a different browser to continue accessing the site. These examples show that while some users initially resist change, most eventually adapt once the old technology is no longer effective and a better alternative is presented.

[[**Decline of Adobe Flash]].

Another historical change is the decline of ### Adobe Flash
 on mobile devices.
- Apple's Mobile Safari did not support Flash content from the beginning, which was a deliberate and initially controversial decision.
- In 2010, Steve Jobs firmly rejected the use of Flash on the iPhone and iPad, prompting web developers to move to HTML5 technology (2)
- At the time, Flash was still dominant in the web video and gaming space, and iPhone users were initially unable to access some content.
- However, the market responded quickly, and major websites began adopting HTML5 for video playback, with alternatives such as native apps and new standards filling the void.
- In 2011, the popularity of the iPhone, which became one of the best-selling smartphones in the world, forced content providers to move away from Flash
- Adobe eventually discontinued Flash for mobile browsers in 2011, effectively acknowledging the new reality of Apple's policies and evolving web standards (3).
- As the alternative technology, HTML5, improved and became more widely used, the reaction of users changed from frustration to acceptance.
- In Japan, the old cell phones used to have a "[[Flash Lite]] ecosystem" for games and apps, and the transition to smartphones has forced the restructuring or elimination of Flash-based services
- The emergence of new apps and HTML5 content has demonstrated that users adapt quickly, and the speed of adaptation accelerates as better or easier-to-use technologies emerge.

These examples illustrate a common theme in technology transitions, such as the termination of support for IE and older browsers or the discontinuation of Flash, where initial user resistance gradually gives way to acceptance as the technology industry offers practical alternatives and clear benefits. This historical perspective is also useful when considering contemporary changes such as, for example, mandatory my number card authentication, suggesting that initial resistance may eventually lead to acceptance.

# 2. Implications and impact of mandatory number card authentication
.

Making the My Number Card (Japan's national ID card) a mandatory means of login for domestic web services represents a significant change. This section examines the prevalence of the My Number Card and user awareness.

My number card (personal number card) contains a digital certificate for ### [[Public Personal Certification Service]] ([[JPKI]])
, which enables secure online identity authentication.
- In recent years, the Japanese government has actively promoted the use of this card. Initial penetration was sluggish, and despite incentive programs such as point rewards, only about 40% of citizens had acquired the card by the end of 2021 (4)
- Many people, it is said, "resisted riding the wave of my number."
- In one survey, privacy concerns and the inability to see a clear benefit were cited as the main barriers, with reasons such as "I already have a driver's license or other ID," "I'm worried about personal information leakage," and "I don't need it" being cited as reasons
- There is also a "deep-rooted distrust" of government-managed ID systems due to data leaks and legal problems in the past [[Basic Resident Registration System]].

- (4): [Why Is Japan's My Number System Flailing? - Unseen Japan](https://unseen-japan.com/japan-my-number-slow-adoption/)


However, the situation is changing rapidly. The authorities have used both incentives and regulations to dramatically increase penetration.
- The government has linked the My Number Card to the necessities of daily life and promoted measures to make the card virtually indispensable, for example, by integrating it with health insurance (the traditional insurance card will be abolished by 2024) and planning to integrate it with the driver's license by 2025.
- As a result, people who had been reluctant to obtain a card were forced to register, and as of October 2023, more than 97 million cards had been issued, covering 77.4% of the population.

The government is also working to improve convenience, and is promoting measures that allow users to use their my number card via smartphone (for example, integration with Apple Wallet after Apple's privacy concerns are resolved).(7) This will allow users to use the card without the need for a dedicated card reader (7) This will allow users to authenticate simply by tapping their smartphones, without the need for a dedicated card reader, thereby lowering the barrier to use.

Private web services are also gradually beginning to adopt my number authentication in situations where it adds value.
- For example, the popular mobile payment app PayPay has introduced an identity verification option using JPKI on the My Number Card
- This allows users to complete the eKYC (customer verification procedure) by simply scanning the card with NFC on their smartphone and entering the PIN, instead of uploading a photo or selfie of their ID card(8).
- Such integration contributes to improved security and user experience and reduces the "complexity" of identity verification
- Furthermore, other financial services, such as SMBC's V-Point application, have also adopted JPKI authentication through providers such as Polarify, and the convenience and reliability of my number card authentication is beginning to be recognized throughout the industry(9).

- (9): [V Point Pay app introduces authentication using My Number card](https://medium.com/tokyo-fintech/v-point-pay-app-introduces-authentication-using-my-number-card-f06775bcb2f2)

User acceptance and resistance remain important factors. On the one hand, some appreciate the convenience and security benefits of using the My Number Card as a single, secure means of login, eliminating the need to remember multiple passwords and provide documentation. The card provides the service provider with a "reliable means of identification" that can reliably verify the identity of the user
- However, some users have expressed discomfort with being forced to use a government-issued ID for all logins, and privacy concerns have been raised that the personal information recorded on the chip in the card, such as name, address, and photo, may lead to excessive provision of information.
- Recognizing these concerns, the government is also considering limiting the scope of data passed to private services during authentication.
- Users' sentiments are not uniform, with some seeing this as an inevitable modernization, while others see it as excessive government intervention.

It should be noted that as of 2019, the ownership rate of my number card among the elderly was very low, with only about 22% of those in their 70s, and the smartphone ownership rate among the elderly was also less than 20%, suggesting that a rapid mandate risks further widening the digital divide (10).
- (10): [No. 568 〖What is the smartphone ownership rate among Japanese people? What is the rate of my number card ownership?〗〗.](https://www.kk2.ne.jp/kk2/ezine?no=568)

In short, while making my number card authentication mandatory for web services has the potential to significantly improve security and streamline identification procedures, it must be done with caution. As past technology transitions have shown, it takes time and clear benefits for users to accept the change, and governments and companies are working toward eventual acceptance by taking measures to increase the value and ease of use of my number authentication.

# 3. Challenges of CAPTCHA and the Rise of eKYC
.

The demand for stronger authentication methods is driven by the current declining reliability of traditional CAPTCHAs and passwords in the face of advanced threats. CAPTCHA tests such as "I am not a robot" have long been used in web services to distinguish humans from bots.

However, advances in artificial intelligence are allowing CAPTCHAs to be deciphered at an alarming rate. Recent studies have shown that machine learning models can break through widely used CAPTCHAs with nearly 100% success. For example, one 2024 study reported that an AI model using the YOLO object recognition algorithm cracked Google's reCAPTCHA v2 traffic image challenge with a 100% success rate, effectively rendering the method obsolete (11)
- The authors state that "we have entered an era beyond CAPTCHAs" as even the most complex image authentication can be reliably broken through by modern AI!
- In short, the security value of CAPTCHAs is rapidly declining, and trust in simple login barriers is being eroded as automated bots are able to mimic humans.
- (11): [AI researchers demonstrate 100% success rate in bypassing online CAPTCHAs | Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/ai-researchers-demonstrate-100-success-rate-in-bypassing-online-captchas)

At the same time, cybersecurity and regulatory pressures are shifting web services toward more robust identity verification.
In the financial sector and elsewhere, governments around the world have tightened AML (anti-money laundering) and KYC (customer verification) requirements to combat fraud and abuse.
- Japan is no exception, following the recommendations of the international FATF and revising its guidelines between 2018 and 2020 to require stricter customer identification (12)
- Traditionally, identity verification was done by simply checking copies of ID documents, but this method was deemed inadequate due to the ease of making counterfeit copies, prompting regulators to demand more reliable methods.
- In response, Japan legalized electronic KYC (eKYC) in November 2018, enabling secure remote identity verification
- This legal reform paved the way for the introduction of technologies such as biometrics and ID card chip reading as an alternative or complement to traditional paper-based identity verification, and it was expected that companies would adopt eKYC by 2020 to comply with the new strict AML regulations

- (12): [JAPAN: An Introduction Law | Chambers and Partners](https://chambers.com/content/item/3553)

In this environment, eKYC solutions have developed rapidly. Many companies now use AI to perform facial recognition, liveliness detection, and document verification to verify identity online.
- However, eKYC using only images also has vulnerabilities. In fact, there have been reported cases where criminals have bypassed the eKYC process using a photo of a personal number card and deep-fake video to trick the system into authenticating a false identity, and it has also been shown that online identity verification can be breached using only high-quality photos and AI-generated facial movements

- Such incidents (and, moreover, the actual SIM swap scam using stolen card images) have alerted authorities and service providers to the need for vigilance and highlighted the need for strong cryptographic authentication, not just visual checks.
    - [Why Sim Swapping Scams are on the Rise and How You Can Stay Safe](https://www.investopedia.com/protect-yourself-from-sim-swapping-8756219)

Here, the ### JPKI authentication
 built into the My Number Card is a major advantage. The card contains a secure microchip with an X.509 digital certificate and requires a PIN or password for use. When used for login or eKYC, the card digitally proves the owner's identity through cryptographic signatures and other means, making it extremely difficult to forge or fool. Whereas CAPTCHA and facial recognition are easily breached by bots and deep fakes, the cryptographic mechanism of the My Number Card assures the service that the user is the true cardholder. For these reasons, the government is actively promoting eKYC using JPKI

Thus, adopting my number card authentication for web services may solve the following two problems at the same time.

- bot measures.
    - Making actual government-issued IDs mandatory for account creation and important transactions will greatly reduce automated bot and spam activity that CAPTCHAs and SMS codes cannot possibly prevent. Bots must possess a physical card and PIN, which is a very high hurdle.

- Regulatory Compliance.
    - Especially for fintech, banking, insurance, or age-restricted services, KYC/AML obligations can be more easily met by utilizing a reliable national ID. In addition to verified identity information, the My Number system provides attributes such as legal name and address in a single package, greatly simplifying compliance checks. In fact, private eKYC providers in Japan (e.g. Polarify and Liquid) have integrated My Number card reading into their solutions, indicating that they recognize its value.

Thus, the interaction between the declining reliability of CAPTCHAs and the proliferation of eKYC makes my number card authentication a very attractive option. Weaknesses in traditional means of identification are driving the move away from CAPTCHAs and passwords, while strong digital ID infrastructures such as JPKI are encouraging the transition to a new authentication paradigm. This technological backdrop is a rationale for Japanese web services to make my number card authentication mandatory, not only because of government mandates, but also because the evolving threat environment and regulatory requirements require strong authentication.

# 4. Future Prospects: Scenarios of Resistance and Acceptance
.

Going forward, the mandatory use of my number card authentication for web services in Japan could have mixed results based on user response, how the transition is managed, and even past patterns of technology adoption.

## (1) Scenario of continued resistance
.

If the majority of users continue to reject the adoption and use of the number card, the following problems may arise

- Widening digital divide.
    - Younger generations, urban dwellers, and tech-savvy individuals who are familiar with their digital identities have smooth access to online services, while older and privacy-sensitive individuals may be left behind. In fact, Japan's elderly have been slow to adopt new digital tools, with only 18.8% of those in their 70s owning a smartphone as of 2019, and only 6.1% of those in their 80s and older.2 If these groups are reluctant to use their my number card online, they may be locked out of essential digital-only services. If these demographics are reluctant to use their my number card online, they may be locked out of required digital-only services.

- Need for alternative means.
    - As a result, some users will rely on proxy services, such as family members or local authorities, or will be excluded from certain services, forcing service providers to offer alternative login methods and in-person options. This could undermine the efficiency-enhancing benefits of a full transition to my number card authentication.

- public outcry.
    - There is also a risk of protests and protests against the government's mandatory policy, as was the case in the early 2000s when activists filed a lawsuit against the Basic Resident Registration Net ID system due to privacy concerns, and there is a risk of petitions and legal action by those who feel that the mandatory system violates their rights and freedoms. There is also a risk of petitions or legal action by those who feel that the mandatory system violates their rights and freedoms. Politically, if there is significant opposition, governments may be forced to slow the pace of deployment or make use optional. In addition, media coverage of problems such as the erroneous data linkage in 2023 could foster distrust, resulting in low utilization rates that avoid online use even if the card is held, unequal access to services, and the need for costly alternative measures to deal with resisters, The original effectiveness of digital ID promotion may be diminished.

## (2) Extensive acceptance scenario
.

On the other hand, if users accept and actively utilize my number card authentication, the effect could bring revolutionary changes to Japan's digital society.

- With more than 77% of citizens having cards as of late 2023, and more users becoming accustomed to using them, a unified login system will be implemented across public and private services.
- This will accelerate the government's vision of becoming "the world's most advanced digital nation" where administrative procedures are completely online, paperless, and one-stop!
- In fact, in everyday life, it is expected that people will be able to seamlessly log in to any service, including e-Gov, banking, insurance, healthcare, education, and even e-commerce, using their my number card or a linked smartphone app. This eliminates the need to manage multiple accounts and separate means of identification, with the card acting as a universal digital key.
- The complexity of document procedures will be greatly reduced, so that, for example, opening a bank account or signing a cell phone contract can be accomplished completely online, with only instant identification by card.
- Financial institutions and insurance companies will increasingly incorporate my number authentication not only for onboarding, but also for high-risk transactions such as large transfers and contract changes, providing an additional layer of security. In fact, banks are collecting my number for tax purposes and are also exploring its use as a customer login and digital signature.
- As the service expands, a network effect is expected to occur, and as more users experience its convenience on a daily basis, the segment of the population that has not yet adopted the service will naturally join.
- Over time, online authentication with a my number card will become as routine as using an ATM card or credit card, and related discussions will shift to the next major evolution in Japan's digital society.
- In the public sector, traditional means of identification such as paper health insurance cards, driver's licenses, and in some cases seal culture will be phased out to streamline services. In particular, the plan to integrate driver's licenses into my number card by 2025 means that one card will serve multiple roles, greatly simplifying the management of identity verification
- With such widespread acceptance, my number card authentication will greatly facilitate Japan's digital transformation, not only dramatically improving the security and convenience of transactions, but also becoming a leading example that will influence other countries.

In past cases of smartphone diffusion, younger generations adopted smartphones at an early stage, while older generations stuck to feature phones, resulting in a temporary disparity, but eventually latecomers also adopted feature phones sequentially and diffusion progressed. In the case of my number card authentication, it is expected that initial resistance will gradually give way to acceptance. On the other hand, if the system is hit by scandal or fails to prove its value sufficiently, there is a risk that it will stagnate, as was the case with the former attempt to introduce a national ID card. The key to the speed of adaptation will be how seamlessly users incorporate my number authentication into their everyday web services and how much trust is built between the government and each service. Providing clear information, strong privacy protections, and demonstrating tangible benefits such as rapid service delivery and cost reductions will be critical to driving acceptance.

# 5. Conclusion
.

The push for mandatory My Number Card authentication for Japanese web services is an important initiative at the intersection of both technical necessity and social acceptance. Past experiences, such as the elimination of old browsers and plug-ins and the adoption of new security paradigms, show that Japanese users and companies have adapted to major changes over time (sometimes with protest). Historical perspective tells us that while technology itself evolves rapidly, user trust and habits change slowly. In the case of my number card authentication, this is a fundamental issue for national infrastructure, personal data, and how citizens interact with online services, and carries more weight than a normal technology upgrade.

The benefits of a unified and secure digital identity system are enormous in today's world of cyber threats and diverse digital services, and efforts by the Japanese government and businesses to improve convenience, integrate services, and enhance security aim to provide benefits that outweigh the inconveniences and concerns associated with the change. If successful, these efforts will help banks to become more efficient, efficient, and secure. If successful, these efforts will show the world that Japan is a leading example of a digital society where seamless identification, from bank logins to tax returns, can be accomplished with a single card. On the other hand, there is a risk that it will fail in the same way that technologies that have failed to gain sufficient support in the past have, by alienating users and widening the gap between them, if not managed properly.

Ultimately, the future impact of mandatory My Number Card authentication on Japanese web services will depend on how smoothly the transition is implemented and how the public reacts. By learning from the past, acknowledging user concerns, providing alternatives during the transition period, and highlighting real improvements, stakeholders can lead to widespread acceptance of this change. As with previous technological transformations, if the new system proves its worth, initial resistance may eventually give way to routine use, and in a few years, online authentication with a personal number card may become as natural as the use of PIN codes today. The important thing is that this digitalization path be inclusive and secure, in a way that responds to the lessons of history and the needs of the future.
