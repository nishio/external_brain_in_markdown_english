    - Hmmm, is there some kind of greedy way of deciding?
    - If there is no overlap, does it make a difference which way you do it from?
        - Still, 33 overlaps at worst; you can't do 33 factorials.
    - I wonder if a non-decisional automaton could handle this in a nice way.
    - hold (e.g. telephone button)
- Official Explanation
        - [[Interval DP]]
    - How do we realize that this issue is section DP...
        - [[Value determined for column]]
            - [[Value determined for column â†’ DP in section of column]]
