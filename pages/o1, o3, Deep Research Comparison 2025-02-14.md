"[[Looking back soothes my anxiety.]]" "Isn't there a name for this kind of composition?" I heard that
What names might be attached to these compositions?" Compare what replies you get to the question "What is the name of this composition?

# QUESTION
.
1: Person A's mental state deteriorates when faced with a rapidly changing environment.
2: A's mental state improves by seeing person B, who is unaware of the intensity of the change.

Is there any word related in the past about the structure of the relationship between the two?

# o3-mini
This relationship has aspects analogous to "[[social reference]]" or "[[downward social comparison]]" in psychology.
- Social referencing: is the phenomenon of judging one's own feelings and actions based on the reactions of others in an uncertain situation.
- Downward comparison: This is the effect of gaining a sense of security by comparing oneself with others who are in a worse condition than oneself. In this case, B's indifference (i.e., oblivious to changes in the environment) is characterized by the fact that it makes A feel secure.
The idea that "[[ignorance is happiness]]" may also help explain this phenomenon.

This phenomenon is similar to what is called "[[downward]] comparison" in psychology.
Downward comparison refers to a psychological mechanism whereby one feels one's own condition is relatively better by comparing oneself with others whose conditions are worse than one's own, thereby stabilizing and improving one's mental state. For example, it is thought that downward comparison works in the sense that person A, who is in a rapidly changing environment, gains a sense of security by looking at person B, who is insensitive to change, and feeling that "I am still better off.

Although there is no clear technical term for this, the following concepts are often mentioned as being close in psychological and sociological terms.

- Ignorance Is Bliss
    - The term refers to the state of being unaware of a change or crisis so that the person in question is not anxious. The expression was popularized from a poem by Thomas Gray, and has some overlap with the structure of "A feels more comfortable when B is oblivious to change.

- Social Referencing（ [[social reference]] ）
    - A psychological effect of gaining reassurance from the appearance of those around you (especially those who are calm) when you are anxious. Typical examples are those of small children judging whether they are safe or not from the facial expressions of their parents, but it can also be taken as "A is influenced and reassured by the calmness of B, who is oblivious to changes.

- Pollyanna Principle
    - It is the tendency to gain mental stability by seeing only the positive side of things, an aspect similar to the part where A feels "it might be okay" due to B's optimism to downplay or ignore change.

- Pluralistic Ignorance
    - This is a phenomenon in which people misunderstand each other, saying that the problem is probably not a big deal when those around them do not seem to treat it seriously. However, the nuance here is somewhat different from the case in question, as there is a strong aspect of "B himself does not know how he really feels, but they are pretending to each other that they do not feel threatened.

In summary, the structure of "A, who suffers from the perception of change, is conversely relieved when he sees B, who is not aware of change," is thought to involve mainly the elements of "Ignorance Is Bliss" and "Social Referencing," in the sense that "ignorance creates innocent calmness, which is then transmitted to those around them. Bliss" and "Social Referencing" elements are thought to be involved.

- incredible completeness
- I have a feeling that if you want to do some research on this matter, you should read this first without googling yourself.
- Like a tutorial or quick start page in the documentation of a programming language or web framework.
    - By internalizing this, you acquire a map within yourself.
    - More details can be researched individually and in depth later if you're interested.
- In addition, I usually do Deep Research on what I am interested in, but when I did Deep Research on other people's stories, I was like, "Upppp, there's a lot of stuff.
    - Maybe I feel over-informed because I'm basically doing what I'm interested in, and I'm not that interested in seeing what other people have done.
    - I asked a question with a messy prompt this time, but since the system is basically valuable in generating tutorials tailored to individual interests, I think it would be better to give more verbalization of individual interests, like having them interact with o3 first and organize what they want to know.
    - I wonder if ChatGPT[['s Memory]] is reading it? If so, maybe we'll gradually learn the user's interests.
