Given a sequence of static values of length N, a data structure where the preprocessing O(NlogN) allows operations on the upper interval of the sequence to be computed in O(1)

Conditions required for operation
    - [[associative law]] : $(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)$
- Unit and inverse yuan are not required.

There is no need to use this for operations with inverse roots, such as addition.
    - Because we can do the same thing with construction O(N) using [[cumulative sum]], we can do the same thing with construction O(N).

Cumulative product from left to right" can be used to achieve [[obsolete rule prohibiting match-ups between wrestlers from the same group of stables]], e.g., by multiplying without inverses.
- The Disjoint Sparse Table allows the user to compute the product of arbitrary intervals by combining a large number of cumulative products.
