    - Perfection is not something you can achieve on your own, it is something that can be achieved with "[[Massive feedback]]".
    - Yet, you are delaying the release of your work by insisting on "short-sighted perfection" by "yourself alone," and you are forcing your work into a state where you cannot get "feedback from the masses.
    - They say they are "striving for perfection," but they are far from perfect.

- [[Bad Perfectionism]]
