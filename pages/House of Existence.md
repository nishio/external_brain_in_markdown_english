<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/> [[Martin Heidegger]] was one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century, and language occupies a central place in his thought. From the reflections found in his work "Being and Time" and other works comes the expression "language is the house of being." This metaphor implies that language is more than just a means of communication; it is the foundation of our very existence.

Language and Existence
- For [[Heidegger]], language is an essential aspect of human existence (Dasein, [[Dasein]]). Dasein refers to "being itself," and one of the characteristics that distinguishes humans from other beings is their awareness of their own existence and their ability to think about it. Heidegger believed that the primary way humans engage with the world is through language, and that language provides the framework within which we interpret, assign meaning to, and understand the world.

Language as "House of Being
In this metaphor, "[[home]]" means the place where we live, are protected, and huddle. Likewise, language is the place where we exist, think, feel, and relate to others, forming the basis of our entire experience. Without language, our understanding of the world and our relationships with others would be radically different.

[[Disclosure of the world through language]].
Heidegger also emphasized the notion that language "discloses the world. Language does not merely describe things, but makes things visible for the first time in their existence. Poetry and literary works, for example, bring to light aspects of things that are not captured by everyday perspectives, making new understandings possible.

The Role of Language in Modern Society
Heidegger's view of language provides insight into language use in the digital age. As technology continues to change the form and use of language, it is important to question how language continues to shape our mode of existence and how these changes affect our perception of the world.

Heidegger's ideas about language offer profound insight into how language is the fundamental means by which we construct our world and through which we continue to understand ourselves and our world.
