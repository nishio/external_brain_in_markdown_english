The word "create" is simple, but it means different things to different people.
It can be an emotional exchange involving the person's pride and other factors.

Questions that tend to divide opinion
- Q1: Is thinking and piecing together sentences included in "making"?
- Q2: Is the process of manufacturing products according to a set standard in the same way day after day included in "making"?
