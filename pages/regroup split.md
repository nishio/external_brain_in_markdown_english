Support tool for inscribing text into Regroup sticky note units

There's some code in the repositories that miscellaneously removes unnecessary information from Facebook and Twitter discussions.
- You should put it in an independent repository or release it to work with TS.

The key sticky note division algorithm
- Parsing with Cabocha
- next link joins tokens that are next to each other
    - Exceptions, punctuation, etc. are included in tokens
- Then, scrape off unnecessary tokens.
- I'd really like to rewrite it, but that's not implemented yet.
    - Convert "do" in front of "do, do" to "do," etc.
