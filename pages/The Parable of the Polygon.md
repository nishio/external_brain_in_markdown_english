[Parable of the Polygons](http://ncase.me/polygons-ja/)
Thomas Schelling [Dynamic Models of Segregation](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/Schelling_Seg_Models.pdf)
- There are two races.
- If the percentage of shapes that are the same as yours in the 8 squares around you do not fall within a certain range above and below a certain level, you become dissatisfied and move out randomly
    - [[apartheid]] state occurs
- Surprisingly low thresholds occur, even when moving with less than 33% homogeneity.
    - It turns out that "I want to be in the majority" is pretty strong.
- Even if there were no discrimination at all, the current segregation would be maintained.
- Conversely, if you set an "attitude of actively seeking [[diversity]]" by moving out with a homogeneity ratio of 80% or higher, segregation decreases

- It's involved in [[Knowledge Acquisition Strategies]] in the form of more and more separation as people from the same company get together.
