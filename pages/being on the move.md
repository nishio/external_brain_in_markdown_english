At the [[CUMOT2018]] reception, the question was asked, "You seem to be in a hurry to live, how did that happen?" The question was asked.

- The concept of "[He's on the run.
    - What is "in a hurry to live"? I do not intend to be in a hurry to live, but a third party seems to think I am in a hurry to live, why is that? (Added on 2022-09-19)
    - What others see as "rushing to live" is often at odds with the person's own sense of "rushing to live.
    - I sometimes feel that people who run a business for six months and take it easy for six months are in a hurry to live.
    - [[Amount of episodes]].
    - When the "amount of episodes during the year" is high, others perceive that one is "rushing to live."
        - However, [[Amount of episodes]] does not correlate well with [[(degree of) busyness]] of the job.
    - If you are in a large company and have only the same experiences as the people around you, you don't have many episodes to tell.
        - This makes even those who run their business in a leisurely manner seem to be in a hurry to survive by comparison.
    - On the other hand, there are those who are in large companies but have lots of episodes.
        - There are people who talk amusingly about these terrible events and incidents.
    - Conversations such as "Chief A is terrible, isn't he?" and "Hey," are not spoken because they are not understood by people at other companies.
        - On the other hand, if you can talk about it as an event rather than a specific personal criticism, you are in an "episodic" state.
        - [[Small men talk about people]]
    - In other words, it affects their ability to communicate their experiences to others who are in a different position.
        - Ability to abstract the experience. The specific name of the individual or the name of the company with whom you are in dispute is not important.
        - It is necessary to extract the universal structure in the experience.
    - You mean "Amount of experience that differs from others" and "Ability to translate experience into a form that can be communicated to others"?
- Three hours later, I changed my mind.
    - No. The concept of "the amount of [[experiences that are different from others]]" is wrong. [Experiences are inherently different from one person to another.
        - Some people [[differ from one another]] [[experience]], but [[abandoning oneself to the world]] and interpret it as "everyone is the same" or "[[conventional]]".
        - Some people can colorfully say, "I felt this way," even though they experienced the same thing.
    - Each person's perception is different. Can you express your experience if you are different from others and where it is perceived as positive?
- The kicker is clear.
    - So, while I was sorting out the concept of haste to live, the topic changed, and the first question I was asked was, "How did you come to be in a hurry to live?" It was.
        - After thinking about it for a while, I arrived at a surprisingly clear kicker. It is [[contemporary art]].
    - According to Amazon I bought "[[Contemporary Art Business]]" in March 2009.
    - I don't remember how it is written, but I understood from this book that "[Contemporary art is the work of making history.
        - The word "[[History]]" can be interpreted differently, so I will add that there are two types of history: abstract history that is not tied to a specific person, as we learn in school, and "[[personal history]]" history that is tied to an individual.
        - It is not just a list of facts, but a connection between this happened because this happened.
        - In that sense, "[[Weaving a Story]]" might be more appropriate than "making history.
            - But what makes it different from a mere story is that you can't make it up as you go along.
        - It is important to note that the story is only on top of the "actual events" lined up on the time line.
                - [[Stories rooted in fact]]
    - Before I read this book, I was living quite [[ephemerally]], now that I look back on it.
        - They did what they thought was fun, and when they finished or stopped having fun, they stopped and did the next thing.
    - The fact that he began to think, "I have to record the fact that I did what I did and make history," led to his subsequent "[[accumulate]]" actions.
    - Another would be "[[Leveraged Reading]]," which I bought in September 2007.
        - The book says something to the effect that "when you read a book, you should make notes extracting the best parts of the book and read it over and over again to enrich it.
        - This also led me to think, "It is not good to read a book you find interesting and finish it when you are done. It is important to accumulate notes.
        - And in that state I read the above contemporary art business.
    - So there must have been a note written at that time, I checked and found it.
        - > Creating an archive Working to historicize art Making history by documenting Making history by documenting Making history by documenting Making history by documenting Making history by documenting history Practicing Historicism Consciously
        - After 9 years of consciously practicing "[[Making History by Recording]]", I am where I am today.

    - [[2025 is a rush.]]
