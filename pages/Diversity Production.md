[Yoichi Ochiai advocates "diversity production" Solve the problems of the irresponsible previous generation with technology - Log Me Biz](https://logmi.jp/business/articles/238589)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>Yoichi Ochiai's argument for diversity production can be summarized as follows.
1. the 20th century will move from the era of "mass production" to the 21st century of "diversity production" (i.e., "responding to individual problems"). Software will be able to [[solve problems on an issue-by-issue basis]].
2. [[Hybridize human intelligence and machine intelligence]] and combine hardware to create [[diversity]]. [Shift from standardization to diversification is important.
3. think in [[a worldview of parameters]]. [[a society based on differences in individual parameters]], such as the number of arms.
4. maximize individual capacities and strive for a world where everyone leans on each other [[co-dependence]]. Use computers to support people.
- 5.[[Balance between rationality and emotion]] is important. Understand the difference between the two through the pursuit of irrational art, etc.
- Re-imagine [[aging society]] as [[diversity]], rather than negatively. [Complement it with technology, and it can grow even in a declining population.
7. to use technology to solve the problems of the irresponsible previous generation and to create a world where everyone [[merges with machines]] and [[no one has to work]].
In short, it can be understood as an assertion that the future demands the creation of a flexible society that can respond to the diversity of each individual by utilizing technology, rather than uniform mass production and mass consumption.
