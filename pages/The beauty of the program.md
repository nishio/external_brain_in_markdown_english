<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I want to think about the beauty of the program
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "program" is this "program"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>A program that I write alone. The story started when I was asked the question, "Should I use object orientation or something else to clean up the code?" and I am not comfortable with that question.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that "program"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I don't think it's going to be pretty just because you use object oriented, I think.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "object-oriented" is this "object-oriented"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I asked that question too, but I didn't get a very clear answer. I think the nuance of the question was "Should I organize it using classes or something?

- Where is this "program" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>There are several programs in the questioner's hands, and he probably feels that they are "dirty".

- Where is this "program" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's like a program that was written in the past, saved on disk, and when you read it back at some point, it was difficult to understand.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>How do you know its "program"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Uh, sure. If I read that "program he thinks is dirty" I could give you more pertinent advice.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What does that "program" look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>A program made with the top priority of fulfilling its purpose lacks the axis of "easy to understand when you read it back later," so it's like a memo written in dirty handwriting.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "dirty handwriting" is that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Characters written with priority given to writing speed over legibility
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is its "speed"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>So when you have a feature you want to build, you want to shorten the time it takes to get it done.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What "function" is that "function"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>"Wouldn't it be nice to be able to do something like this?" "Wouldn't it be interesting to do something like this? and "Wouldn't it be interesting if we could do something like this? The focus is on speed because we want to see the results as soon as possible.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "speed focus" is that "speed focus"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It leaves out the work to make it more readable for your future self.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "future" is that "future"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Yes, that's the important part. If you never have to read it again in the future, you don't need to take care of readability. In fact, you may be surprised to find yourself having to read it again, and the future may be closer than you think. You may not be able to read the code you wrote last week.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Readability for our future selves is important. Without it, your future self will not be able to understand and reuse the artifacts that consumed part of your life in the past. Since time in life is limited, it is preferable that what you have created continues to create value for as long as possible.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that "future"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I can't predict the future, so I don't know if I'll ever read the program I created again or not, but I feel like I'm prepared in case I do.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where does this "program" come from?
