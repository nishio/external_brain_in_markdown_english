I think there's an ambiguity in the original "men are taller".<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- A: If "men are on average taller than women" is an observed fact and True
- B: If "All men are taller than women," then False because it is a strange assertion that contradicts the observed facts.
    - This [[the subject is large]].
