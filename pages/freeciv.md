>  >tenohito: On this sudden giant spring break, let's teach the kids a bad game. It's called "Civilization" and it's a bad game that has robbed many college students of their credits. Let's start without mom's knowledge.


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1233344824402530304) You can't search for freeciv or [[simtrans]] or [[lincity]]! You're even worse off buying [[factorio]] or [[oxygen not included]] with your New Year's money!

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1233350415971835904) Oh, you can't have a paid closed source game that somehow has a thriving mod making community and you can easily modify the game yourself if you read the open source mods! You can't do that, because it's even more evil than just an open source game!
