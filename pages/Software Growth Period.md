- In humans, size increases during growth and does not change much thereafter
- After the growth spurt, work hard to control your physical condition and size to live a long, healthy life, not to get bigger.
- Isn't there a similar growth period in software?
- Shouldn't a program that has passed its growth phase be refactored or its functionality gradually ported to a new system to maintain a "functional and flexible body" and live longer, rather than "fattening up" the code by adding new features?
