summary
    - The line of [[Buddha]] who opened [[enlightenment]].
    - This law is hard to understand.
    - It is impossible for the greedy to understand.
    - If I preach the Dharma and others do not understand, it is fatigue and anguish for me!
    - So instead of willingly preaching, we retreat and remain silent.
    - [[Brahma]] lines.
    - Oh, the world is dying.
    - Preach the Law.
    - Some people's eyes are not yet stained with dust.
- Buddha
    - I heard Brahma's plea and observed the world.
        - Some have the eyes of wisdom untainted by the dust of vexation, others are terribly stained
        - Some are born with superior qualities, others with inferior ones.
    - The gate to immortality has been opened.
    - He who has ears to hear, let him hear and cast away his own blind faith
    - O Brahma, I did not preach the Law because I feared it would harm people.

explanation
- Some people find this story offensive or inconvenient, but the fact remains that this was written
    - What the actual exchange took place is, of course, unknown.
- First, the Buddha thought that "it is impossible for a greedy person to understand the laws that he [[understood]]."
    - And I thought, "[Trying to make those who don't understand understand create suffering."
    - The idea that suffering arises from trying to control the uncontrollable is a fundamental law of Buddhism.
            - [[Focus on what you can control and don't worry about what you can't control.]]
    - So Buddha thought, "Let's not preach."
    - At this point, Buddha thinks everyone but himself is incapable of understanding.
- Brahma begs to be preached to because some people can understand him.
- At Brahma's suggestion, Buddha wonders if there might be someone other than himself who might understand.
    - I would even go so far as to say that there is a difference in "innate qualities," which is a horrible expression from my perspective in 2018.
- He who has ears, listen."
    - So you believe that there are those who do not have ears.
    - The idea that "trying to make those who don't understand understand create suffering" hasn't changed.
    - We are free from suffering by not trying to force the unheard to listen.
- I'm not sure what the last line is for.
    - That preaching the law to someone who does not have the capacity to understand it hurts that person?

A story about changing your mind when you are told that if you are trying to avoid your own suffering, it is not good for the world.
- Very human.
- Not a good story for those who want to make Buddha an infallible deity.
- Furthermore, the Buddha does not believe that all sentient beings can be saved, and worse, he even refers to "those born with inferior qualities," which is very inconvenient for a religion for the general public.
