title: "Keep a large network and cut out as needed"
---

Long-term [[intellectual production]] policy
    - I think keeping a [[Large Network]] and [[as necessary]] [[start a fire (with flint, by rubbing sticks together, etc.)]] is intellectually productive in the long run.
    - First, create a [[knowledge network]] with [integrity
        - I'm going to add a little more and accumulate a little more.
                - [[Image of water falling and pooling from stalactites]]
        - It is important to [[maintain consistency]] rather than accumulate random information
                - [[Grounded in consistency]]
        - After [[Specific Needs]] are identified, take out [[Just where you need it.]] for that [[need]].
        - It's easier to decide whether to cut the edge of the network or not if you can see a specific need.
            - We can decide if we need it or not."
                - If [[Objective is clear]], then you can use [Is it useful for the purpose?
                    - [[Clarification of objectives]]
                    - [[pragmatism]]

- There was a "potentially useful concept" that was very exciting and [[overgrowth]] in one project.
- The members of that project had a desire to organize things in a clean way, not in a messy way.
    - But no one could do it.
- After a need arose to mention it in another project, a smooth restructuring took place
    - The concept was [[Rooted.]] "The [[birthplace]]" was separated from and organized at the time of [[transplantation]] to another location.

from [/villagepump/how about notation](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/how about notation).
- One person brought up the topic and a lot of people thought it was interesting and got excited.
- To compare it to a plant, if you plant a seed, it grew.
- The seeds are.
    - Instead of growing up "neatly behaved and ready to ship."
        - [[Branches grow from here and there, overgrowing into a mess.]]
            - [[Branches grow from here and there.]]  /  [[soppy]]  /  [[grow thickly]]
- I find this overgrowth beneficial.
        - [You can do the harvesting and clean and polish later.
            - [[harvest]] or clean and polish [[we can do it later.]]

from [/villagepump/how about notation "enables the description of knowledge that can be easily reused"?](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/how about notation "enables the description of knowledge that can be easily reused"?)
- It was argued that "removing context from knowledge makes it more reusable."
- Seems to me there are two opinions on what knowledge reuse is
    - A
        - To cut out what is written here and take it elsewhere.
            - There is a sense that "[[First timer]]" is close to being read as it is placed here.
                - [[scene (of a play, movie, etc.)]] and [[context]] are close in meaning; for the first time, "[People who don't know the context.
    - B
        - That what is written here, here, is developed by others who mention it and so on.
        - To be a material for a developing future.
    - The act of trying to do A in this situation seems to me to be interfering from B's point of view.
        - To use a plant analogy, [[Cutting and arranging the roots of the growing flowers to make them distributable as a commodity goes against the grain of maintaining a place where miscellaneous plants can thrive.]]
            - To [[take root]] of a growing flower and put it in [[Tradable form]] as a commodity goes against the grain of maintaining [A place where miscellaneous plants grow.
            - Information [package
                - [[Books are already a product of abstraction]]

Thoughts divorced from concrete context
- It tends to be this.
        - [[Taking the top of the pyramid is not what I expected.]]
- It's [[Rootless Knowledge]].
