title: "Don't go down noisy streets."
---

- When you feel overwhelmed by a project, you begin to avoid looking at the information about that project, and as a result, the contextual information that was in your brain is forgotten over time, making you feel even more overwhelmed.
- Watch 5 minutes
- I didn't see it, I didn't respond back to the email, I saw the contest information and wrote an email asking for a substitute contestant.
- The reason why I responded to the email in less than five minutes is because the project page wasn't logged and I was trying to find it in my mailbox.
- Why haven't you bookmarked it?
- Don't go through noisy streets like mailboxes.
