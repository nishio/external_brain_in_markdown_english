black and white isn't clear
I'm not clear on that.
go
What is clear is when the game is over.
If some area becomes black and white in the middle of the game, you can't get that area back.
The side with the advantage should be in black and white.
When two people with different strengths play against each other, they have the handicap of a stone in the ground.
Weak side has advantage, strong side disadvantage
The weaker side tries to make it black and white to make the advantage board.
The stronger side tries not to be clear on the reversal.
