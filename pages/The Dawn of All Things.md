The main points are as follows
- This book will be the foundation for discussions on [[human history]] for decades to come.
- Contrary to conventional views of human history, archaeological evidence suggests that [[prehistoric]] human societies were more complex and diverse.
- In the past, there were [[principle of equality]] societies and notions of [[equal rights for men and women]] that are unthinkable today.
- The "technological innovations" that have been considered history-making are not mutational, but have been advanced by many people over a long period of time.
- Human history is not a history of development or linear evolution, and a world dominated by modern [[a modern state or nation]] or [[capitalism]] has lost its diversity.
- Human history is full of clues that can unshackle our thinking.

Thus, it is stated that this book is an important book that provides an opportunity to rethink human history from a different perspective than the traditional Big History and to question the state of contemporary society.

>  This book will be the foundation for discussions of human history for decades to come. Big History is popular with all. The Complete History of Sapiens" is a precedent, but Harari is not an expert. On the other hand, this book is a review and sketch of human history by an expert. This book will help you understand how bad "The Complete History of Sapiens" is. →

There was a long prehistoric period, followed by various technological innovations such as the agrarian and settlement revolutions, and then the birth of cities and nations, and the emergence of the current global society as communities grew to enormous size. Harari, Jared Diamond, and Steven Pinker all basically follow this line of thinking.

However, too many historical sites of archaeological "exceptions" have been discovered today to be summed up in this way. For example - prehistoric mankind's way of thinking was sufficiently complex, good quality, and not naive, even compared to modern man. Nor was it barbaric. It was less violent than the "struggle of all against all."

And in the past, many communities adopted and changed a wide variety of social systems and structures, repeating trial and error and "competing" to build a better society in a sense. In addition, the 21st century can be said to be an era of accelerated pursuit of egalitarianism, but in the past, human beings ran cities without hierarchy →.

Gigantic ruins have often been seen as evidence of the "overuse" of people by the class system and hierarchy, but this was never the case. There is also a great deal of evidence to suggest such a past. But that is not all. Equal rights and progressive gender ideals have also been

Even communities have existed as huge organizations beyond our imagination long before the birth of the modern state. In addition, "technological innovation," which has been regarded as a milestone in history, has been gradually, rather than mutinously, progressing.

> [nobushiromasaki](https://twitter.com/nobushiromasaki/status/1785241231506964625) Archaeological findings and other evidence show that it has happened. For example, the agrarian revolution was not carried out by a special genius, but by "everyone" through a process of trial and error and innovation, large and small, over a period of several thousand years. Moreover, it was actually "women" who exerted the power in this process. Human history has never been a history of development, nor has it been a history of

> [nobushiromasaki](https://twitter.com/nobushiromasaki/status/1785241484331262020) Nor is it a linear evolutionary history. Rather, this book sounds an alarm. Compared to human history, which is filled with such diversity, the world today is dominated by unified or very close approximations such as the modern state and capitalism. Therefore, we are left to wonder about "how the world should be other than capitalism," "other than the state, a social system without a state," and so on.

> [nobushiromasaki](https://twitter.com/nobushiromasaki/status/1785242109731303688) I can hardly imagine. Can we say that this is a state of being "deprived" of the freedom of thought - or is it? Human history is full of hooks that can free us from the shackles of our thinking. We may have to let go of the easy big history for once.
