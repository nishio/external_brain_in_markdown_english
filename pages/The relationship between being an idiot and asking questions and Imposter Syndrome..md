- The relationship between being an idiot and asking questions and Imposter Syndrome.
        - [[imposter syndrome]] : He thinks he is held in high esteem.
    - People who can't be assholes and ask questions: afraid of being devalued.
    - If people with Imposter Syndrome really think that the problem is that they are held in high regard, then they can be assholes and ask questions to solve the problem.
    - Why not?
    - Is there another problem that is not visible on the surface?
    - Example
        - You think less of yourself.
        - But he fears that those around him will think less of him.
        - So do your best and do activities that will get you praise.
        - People around you praise and appreciate you.
        - However, he/she feels that it is not his/her true self.
            - I worked hard to create [[masks]], [[paper tigers]], that kind of thing.
            - Getting praise for it doesn't relieve my anxiety.
                - I'm afraid [[masking one's true character]] will come off and I'll be disillusioned, I'll be thought of as a [[cheater]].
        - Convincing,[[過度に謙遜]]してしまうことに関係ありそう<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/yosider/icon' alt='/villagepump/yosider.icon' height="19.5"/>というのも同じようなニュアンスかも<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>

    - I saw the term [[Expected value control]] somewhere.
    - [/nishio/expectation-control](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/expectation-control).
        - [/nishio/not to raise exaggerated expectations](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/not to raise exaggerated expectations).
            - If your expectations are higher, you may be disillusioned later.
    - seem relevant
        - [/nishio/ You don't have to use your power in front of all people](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/ You don't have to use your power in front of all people).
            - Conceal the limits of your abilities
            - I realize I'm doing this strategically, but I feel guilty inside.
        - [/nishio/never exaggerate](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/never exaggerate).
            - I'm afraid of losing credibility with stupid questions.
- I sometimes think of [[Broaden the range of characters]], which is [[Expectation Axis Control]]?
- [[I'm not sure where I stand in the community#6375b129774b1700006e5097]]
    - >  I feel like I'm changing my behavior based on my own deviation in the field in the community.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Oh, I'm going in circles if [[I'm going to ask a lot of stupid questions.]] in this vein.
- Imposter Syndrome is the feeling that the other person's evaluation of you is off on the right track with respect to expectations and axes of expectation.
    - To solve this problem, perform [[Expected value control]] and [[Expectation Axis Control]].
        - Rarely a match, so must be meticulously maintained.
        - If you try to control it but can't control it as intended, this becomes a problem.
        - Do you feel like you want to lower your expectations, but not too low?
            - A sudden drop would be shocking and scary, so there may be a desire for a gradual drop.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/yosider/icon' alt='/villagepump/yosider.icon' height="19.5"/>
                    - [[Downward load of evaluation]]
            - [[betrayal of expectations]] りたくない<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/yosider/icon' alt='/villagepump/yosider.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - Expected value control] because higher expectations increase the risk of betrayal.
            - I think there is a difference here.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - phenomenon
                - Assume a situation where Mr. A expects Mr. B to
                - 'Mr. A subjectively expected Mr. B to perform.'
                - Mr. B's actual performance was smaller than that."
            - I don't feel this phenomenon is a "betrayal" in the first place.
                - Mr. B need not be responsible for Mr. A's subjectivity.
            - If Mr. B intentionally gives out information in a way that misleads Mr. A's judgment, Mr. B will be held responsible.
                - So, "[The list of things I did as an observation fact is this. Whether you rate it high or low is your business, not mine.
            - If Mr. A had verbalized his performance expectations to Mr. B in advance and Mr. B had informed Mr. A that he could achieve them
                - I think this case is the equivalent of "betrayal."
