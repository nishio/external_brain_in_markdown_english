title: "I can't connect scrapbox projects to each other."
---

from [/villagepump/scrapbox projects cannot be connected to each other](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/scrapbox projects cannot be connected to each other).
Phenomenon caused by the breakup of page connections for each [[scrapbox project]].

What kind of problem
- You will need to think about where to put the OUTPUT.
        - [[Elements that block thinking]].
        - [[private/public division]]
        - I'd like to see this written either way, and I'd like to see a positive connection between the two.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I don't want to be divided in my thinking only by whether it is public or private.
        - Either in [[Multiplayer Project]] or in [[Personal Project]].
            - [[Quiet room metaphor]]
- Cannot use [2 hop link
    - Cannot use [reverse link
- Or, to avoid having to separate projects.
        - If the issue of [[Words used as different meanings in multiple contexts]] could be resolved, it would be unnecessary to separate projects unless they need to be public or private.
        - [[Handle multiple PROJECTS transparently]] scriptを開発すれば、ほぼ解決する<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>

solution
    - Put everything in [[Private single project]] and make [Only a portion of the private project is open to the public.

    - There are only <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/> users, but it is stable and usable with few problems.

        - An example of a 2 hop link out of another project starts at about 01:00.
    - The input completion is still harried. Fixes will have to wait a bit longer.
