Rational pluralism is a concept proposed by [[John Rawls]] that plays a key role in his extensive theory of justice regarding how to maintain justice and stability in a democratic society where people with different religious, moral, and philosophical beliefs coexist. The main points of this concept are as follows.

### Human nature and rationality
Rawls challenges the view that humans are inherently self-centered or driven by the pursuit of power, arguing instead that they are capable of tolerance and mutual respect. This view of humanity raises the hope that it is possible for democratic societies to foster a "rational pluralism" that holds diverse worldviews but shares the principles of tolerance and democracy.

### Definition and examples of rational pluralism
.
Rational pluralism implies that the diversity of religious, moral, and philosophical doctrines within a society favors tolerance and rejects the use of political power to enforce religious or moral unity. Examples include rational Catholicism, Islam, and atheism.

- Another expression
    - The religious, moral, and philosophical doctrines that citizens embrace are themselves expected to support [[tolerance]] and embrace the essentials of a democratic system. For example, in the realm of religion, rational pluralism might include rational Catholicism, rational interpretations of Islam, rational atheism, etc. Being rational, none of these doctrines would advocate the use of coercive political power to impose religious conformity on citizens of different beliefs.

        - "You say diversity is important, but then you accept the opinion that 'diversity should be eliminated'? Paradox!" Arguments like
        - At that time, we were told that diversity does not mean "tolerating all opinions."
            - It does not interfere with an individual's freedom of choice."
        - relevance
                - [[The right to restrain intolerant people]]
                - [[Centralism to diversity]]
            - There it is.
                    - [[Those who seek diversity do not respect the values of those who do not seek diversity.]]

### Issues of orthodoxy and inclusive doctrine
.
Rational pluralism mitigates, but does not solve, the legitimacy challenge of legitimately applying one law to citizens with different beliefs. For example, we cannot expect all citizens to endorse rational Catholicism as a basic condition of social life.

### Public political culture as a basis for law
.
Rawls proposes to develop a political conception of justice that all reasonable citizens can agree upon from the shared basic tenets of the public political culture of a democratic society: the Constitution, the judicial tradition, and important historical documents.

### Justice as fairness in a rational pluralistic society
.
In developing his theory of "[[justice as]] fairness," Rawls posits a free society under the conditions described above, where rational pluralism exists and [[there are]] sufficient resources to meet basic needs. He primarily considers justice under these ideal circumstances, leaving non-ideal theories such as criminal justice out of his primary focus.

In short, rational pluralism is a central concept in Rawls' philosophy that provides a framework for diverse societies to achieve stability and justice through shared values and institutions, despite profound differences in individual beliefs and doctrines.
