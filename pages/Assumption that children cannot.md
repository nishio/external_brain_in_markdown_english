title: "Assumption that children cannot"
---

> [@abee2](https://twitter.com/abee2/status/1250427222382374912?s=21): one of the obstacles to programming education is adults who think kids can't do it. I have heard many people say that they can't do it because they haven't learned minus, they can't do it because they don't know about outside angles, and there is no way they can understand such an abstract thing. If we let children do this instead of teaching them, we will see that these are wrong.

Turns "I can't do it" into "everyone else can't do it" [[overgeneralization]],
Converting "I've never done it" into "I can't do it" [[disliking a certain food without having tried it]],
It's likely to involve false beliefs such as "children are all-around inferior to me."
    - [[Assumption that adults are superior to children]]
