title: "Confusion between customer and provider"
---

When you are writing software and you feel a need N, "I don't want to do this kind of work X, I wish middleware would do it better," and you start building middleware to satisfy that need N, you will be doing a lot of work X that you don't want to do

You want to be the [[client]] of that middleware, but somehow you end up being the [[provider]].
- [If you don't have it, make it.
- The seriousness of this "I want there to be" is "Do you want there to be even if you have to pay the cost of making it yourself?" The problem is that you don't make it clear whether you want it or not.
- [[We want our needs met, not to be met]].

[[who keeps building game engines and never completes the game]].
