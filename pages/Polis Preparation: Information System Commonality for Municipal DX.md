The following list of short statements has been prepared for the deliberation on the commonization of information systems in the Municipal DX. These statements are designed to allow you to express your approval or disapproval of various points of view:

Commonization of information systems leads to cost reduction
Common system undermines the uniqueness of each municipality
Standardization of information systems improves operational efficiency
Common information systems facilitate data integration and analysis
Inability to meet the different needs of each municipality
Information system commonality is technically possible through the use of cloud services.
Difficult to integrate with existing systems
Adoption of open source software to keep costs down
Operating open source software requires advanced technical skills
Use of a system integrator (SIer) improves reliability.
Dependence on system integrators (SIer) with risk of vendor lock-in
A large initial investment is required to implement a common system
Common information systems will promote collaboration among municipalities
Common information systems may concentrate security risks
Specialized personnel are needed to operate the common system.
Common information systems will strengthen backup systems in the event of a disaster.
System updates and renovations affect all municipalities
Commonality improves the quality of resident services.
Large common systems are inflexible.
Common information systems will reduce disparities among municipalities.

Discuss the commonization of information systems for municipal DX from the perspectives of beneficial/non-beneficial, possible/impossible, OSS and SIer, etc.
ChatGPT
Common information systems in the digital transformation (DX) of municipalities will be discussed from the following angles

beneficial and of no use
Beneficial points:.

Cost Reduction: Using a common system, rather than having each municipality develop and operate its own individual system, can significantly reduce costs.
Efficiency: The use of a common system allows for greater standardization of business processes and improved operational efficiency.
Data Integration and Analysis: Increased data centralization will facilitate statistical data analysis and policy making.
Futile point:.

Variety of needs: Because each municipality has different needs and requirements, a common system may not be the best fit for all municipalities.
Lack of flexibility: A common system is difficult to customize and does not reflect the uniqueness and characteristics of each municipality.
possible and impossible
Possible points:.

Technical feasibility: At the current level of technology, commonality is technically feasible through the use of cloud services and modular systems.
Governance: The national and prefectural governments will take the lead in establishing standards and guidelines.
Impossible:.

Budget and human resources: It may be difficult to secure a budget for the initial implementation and to secure specialized human resources for operations.
Integration with existing systems: Compatibility with existing systems and migration costs are major issues.
OSS (Open Source Software) and SIer (System Integrator)
Advantages of OSS: 1.

Cost: No license fees are required, keeping initial costs low.
Customization: Freely customizable and tailored to meet the needs of each municipality.
OSS Issues:.

Support: Professional support system may be thin and response to problems may be delayed.
Skills: advanced technical skills required to work with OSS.
SIer Advantages:.

Expertise: Engineers with specialized knowledge and experience are available and reliable.
Support: Good support system and quick response to problems.
SIer Challenges:.

Cost: Implementation and operating costs tend to be high.
Vendor lock-in: Easy dependence on a specific vendor and less flexibility in the future.
summary
While commonization of municipal information systems has many advantages, there are also individual needs, initial implementation hurdles, and technical challenges; the use of OSS and SIers, as well as national and prefectural governance, are key.

Discuss the use of existing services.
Discuss with regard to the fact that operations require know-how and that payment should be made to personnel with appropriate operational skills.

On leveraging existing services
Advantages: - No

Reduced installation costs:.

Initial investment can be reduced by utilizing existing services rather than developing new ones.
Since the system has already been verified, the risk at the time of implementation is low.
Rapid deployment

No development period is required, so operations can begin immediately.
This is a great advantage, especially when an emergency response is required.
Reliability and performance:.

Existing services with a proven track record are more reliable and trouble occurs less frequently.
It is often continuously improved based on feedback from many users.
Issue:.

Customization Constraints

Existing services can be difficult to fully meet specific needs in order to be generic.
Customization is often limited.
Adaptability issues:.

May not fully match the unique workflow and characteristics of each municipality.
Existing business processes may need to be modified to accommodate the service.
Know-how and human resources required for operation
Necessity:.

Expertise and Skills:.

The operation of existing services requires expertise in system characteristics, configuration methods, and troubleshooting.
Expertise in security measures and data protection is also essential.
Training and Education:.

Regular training and education is required for operational personnel.
Continuous learning to keep up with new features and updates is also important.
Cost: $0.00

Investment in human resources:.

High fees are required to secure personnel with the necessary skills for the operation.
Ongoing education and training costs must also be considered.
Outsourcing Considerations:.

If internal operations are not feasible, there is the option of outsourcing to a professional operations service provider.
Outsourcing is expensive, but has the advantage of improving operational stability and expertise.
summary
While leveraging existing services has many advantages, such as reduced implementation costs and rapid deployment, customization constraints and adaptability issues exist. In addition, proper operation requires personnel with specialized know-how and skills, and securing such personnel requires high compensation and ongoing investment. Based on these considerations, municipalities need to make a comprehensive decision.
