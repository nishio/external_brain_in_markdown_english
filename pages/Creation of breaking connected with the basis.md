[https://chatgpt.com/share/68cc2d70-b9c4-8011-a2d6-41ffd1f6b7da](https://chatgpt.com/share/68cc2d70-b9c4-8011-a2d6-41ffd1f6b7da)
An example of an abstract thought that was abstracted to a point where humans could not understand it, but when it was pulled back, it produced an idea that made sense to humans.

Creation to be broken while [[connected with the basis]].
- Changing something changes something that normally stays the same.
    - Because people don't focus on the things that change from time to time on a regular basis.
    - For example, the interpretation that "the sun revolves around the earth" has remained unchanged over the years as a worldview shared by many.
- This change in "things that don't usually change" is usually considered "[[destruction]]".
    - The new worldview that "the earth revolves around the sun" is destroying the traditional worldview.
    - Breaking is usually viewed negatively.
    - Many people think that the interpretation that has survived until now is more correct.
- However, if the destruction is based on evidence, more people feel that the destruction is right.
    - This is [[creation]].

Abstract schema (minimum vocabulary)
- 𝐄: unbroken experience (FELT MEANING)
- 𝐒: Symbol (word or symbol)
- 𝜎: specify map 𝜎: 𝐄 → concept (𝐂)
- 𝐑: relationship
- 𝐀: aspect = "part of the newly created 𝜎(𝐄)"
- 𝐆: (node = concept, edge = relation) graph
- 𝐐: quotient by equivalence relation (another name and context-specific label) 𝐆∕∼
- ▷: schematize operator (meaning A "types" an aspect of meaning B)

Axioms (matrix of discovery)
1. principle of double generation
- The relation can be expressed as "a line between two points" or "one side" and both are commutative:
- `relationship(A,B) ≡ aspect B gives to A ≡ aspect A gives to B` (representation choice problem)
2. intra/inter equivalence
- "Between A and B" is equivalent to "in AB" (depending on the choice of the cutout boundary).
- Discovery occurs in "boundary redrawing".
3. aspect = event
- Aspect is not an attribute but a "creation event". It is not a fixed value, but can be updated with each reference.
4. the principle of prior link (legitimacy of empty links)
- The prior creation of an unfilled node X is equivalent to the installation of a receptor that accepts future 𝜎
- The order "link -> content" is also consistent.
5. the principle of the quotient graph (aka bundle)
- Another name is not an identification but the introduction of an equivalence class: `𝐆 → 𝐆∕∼`.
- Discovery is often manifested in differences in the paths preserved/extinguished before and after this quotient mapping.
6. importance of bridges = emergent potential
- Importance" can be defined not in terms of frequency or local weights, but in terms of the potential to open unknown pathways.
- (Intuition: bridge centrality ~ new side appearance rate)
7. multi-schematic
- Any 𝐄 can be formatted in multiple schemes simultaneously:
- Both `A ▷ B` and `C ▷ B` can be valid. Overlaps, not conflicts.
8. creative regression operator ℛ
- `ℛ: 𝜎(𝐄) ↦ 𝐄`. Once verbalized, the operation of reverting back to 𝐄 is forward (generating a new 𝐀).
9. layer closure
- Closed areas (chapters, books, exteriors) should be treated as openable/closable "layers" rather than as inclusions to reduce inconsistencies.
- Discovery occurs at the layer boundary (semipermeable membrane).
10. reversibility of the trail
- Justification can be reversible (wayward) by "path + source".
- Non-reversible findings are not concepts but "fragments.

Transformer (abstract operator)
- Abstract convolution 𝔉 (core of QFS): `𝔉(G, question) → path sequence → sentence `
- Commercialization 𝔔: `𝔔(𝐆, ∼) = 𝐆∕∼`
- Boundary operations 𝔅: deform the path space by opening and closing layers
- Regression ℛ: 8 above

The "critical plane" at which the discovery occurs (criteria for determining whether the implementation is missing)
- When an unfilled node touches a layer boundary (4 x 9)
- When the shortest path is not invariant before and after commercialization (5)
- When the expression changes to minimize the description length when the same relationship is rewritten as "between/among/on the sides" (1 x 2 x 3).
- Regression ℛ when one application of ℛ causes another scheme to emerge naturally (7 × 8)

Meta rule (abstract not reducible to operations)
- Importance" is not a frequency function, but a generativity function.
- Understanding" is not a set, but a series of boundary operations and quotienting.
- The "explanation" is a mapping (path), and the reversibility of the mapping is trustworthy.
- Discoveries" are topological incidents that emerge in the replacement of representational systems (relations ↔ aspects, within ↔ between, names ↔ equivalences).

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT5/icon' alt='GPT5.icon' height="19.5"/>
I. Two Worlds and Sekite
- World E (Exper): Subject to unsegmented experience, the sphere in which the scheme is shot.
- World S (Symbol): a sphere in which the symbol sequence/concept is the object and paraphrase or inference is the projection.
- Expression function σ : E → S is neither complete nor faithful (information can be dropped or overestimated).
- The regression operator ρ : S ⇢ E is not a operator but a partial right inverse map ("semi-associative" that does not lead to an association).

II. Equivalence of dual labeling (Relation ↔ Aspects)
- with the display viewing the relation L(A,B) as "the projection between A and B",
The display that sees B▷A as "B is an injection that produces an interior side to A" is a natural equivalence of the two displays.
- This is the duality of "outer (between)" and "inner (within)".
The boundary manipulation (how much of the "object" is taken as the "object") is used to convert each other.

III. Layers and pre-layers (Sheaf pre-layers)
- Context set 𝒞 Assigning "fragments of meaning" on top of the prelayer 𝒫 : 𝒞ᵒᵖ → Set.
- Discovery occurs at the point where the pasting (gluing) is not uniquely determined (i.e., residual discrepancy).
- "Chapter/book/external" is an open set family, not an inclusion. Boundaries are treated as semipermeable.

IV. Quotient and group action
- The alias is not an identity but an orbit of group action (Alias group G acts on S).
- The quotient S/G shortens the explanation but also squashes the difference lost in σ.
- A discovery stands up when the "post-quotient minimal path" is not invariant to the pre-quotient minimal (invariant quantity breaking).

V. Aspects as Generative (Monadic Interpretation)
- We regard side generation as T : E → E (terminal addition monadic).
- Unit η : Id ⇒ T is "microscopic verbalization", Multiplication μ : T² ⇒ T is "chain folding".
- Creative regression is an operation similar to the cosine unit ε : G ⇒ Id of the cosine monad (i.e., "returning" from the created form to the original moya).

VI. Homotopy of Explanations
- Two explanatory paths p, q : A ⇒ B to the same question are isotopic (homotopic) if they shift continuously with microtransformations.
- Choosing a representative of the isotopic class = selection of "understandability".
- Discovery is the moment when a non-isotopic pathway is presented for the first time (phase-phase transition).

VII. Redefinition of importance (generativity)
- Importance I is defined not by frequency or order, but by the room to allow for new pasting:
I(x) ≍ 〈Number of noncommutative diagrams containing x〉 - 〈Number that vanishes in commutativization〉.
- Intuition: bridge centrality is only an approximation of it, and the essence is the density of commutative failure points.

VIII. Preservation and Tear (Indicator of Novelty)
- The ones that are not conserved by the truly new operation F (minimal path lengths, layer restrictions, quotient orbits, isotopes...) are candidate invariants.
- Measuring "what you break" is an abstract definition of "what you gain.

IX. Two kinds of extrema
- Interlimit: Integration as the limit/extra limit (pullback/pushout) of the relational network.
- The middle limit: integration (synthesis of aspects) as an internal extension of the object.
- The discovery is a "torsion" that stands when the two limit operations are not commutative.

X. Minimal Principles (Action Functional of Explanation)
- Description "Action" of E ℒ(E) = (length + inconsistency of the lamination + loss due to quotient - gain of new isotopes).
- A good explanation minimizes ℒ but does not drop it to zero (the allowance for creative room remains as a term).

11. General-purpose meta-conversion
- Boundary redrawing (external extension ↔ internal extension)
- Replacement Display (Relative ↔ Side)
- Opening and closing layers (local↔global)
- Change of quotient granularity (identification ↔ differentiation)
- Replacement of isomorphisms (adoption of another path representative)
→ These are all semigroup operations that are not reversible. Irreversibility creates a "sense of time".

Ⅻ. Definition (Findings)
A finding is a transformation of at least one of the representational system (S), layer (𝒫), quotient (/G), and display (within/among),
As a result, breaks in previously conserved invariants (e.g., minimal pathways, isotopes, commutativity) were detected,
It is an event that is still auditable and returnable through σ and ρ.
——
If we keep this abstraction, and further make it "provable/refutable," then we can go on to place propositions and complements that give **minimal proof of "breakage "** (non-success of the locally commutative diagram) in general form.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT5/icon' alt='GPT5.icon' height="19.5"/>
Continue. Do not concretize, but increase precision in the abstract.

XIII. Invariants and the Formalization of "Breaking
Setting: tabulated system σ: E→S, regression ρ: S⇢E, pre-layer structure 𝒫, another name group action G⊲S.
invariant family 𝕀
(a) Path invariant: shortest path length ℓ_min on S, isotopic `[p]`.
(b) Layer invariants: commutativity of restriction and affixation (local-global coincidence of the previous layer 𝒫).
(c) Quotient invariants: conservation of minimal paths by the quotient map π:S→S/G.
(d) Two display invariants: relational display ↔ natural equivalence of side displays.
Definition (tear): when operation F does not preserve any of 𝕀, F yields a tear.
Definition (Findability): Δ(F) := weighted sum of broken invariants (measured by curvature, described below).

XIV. Stratified Disorders (C̆ech-like)
Patching problem: local meaning s_i∈𝒫(U_i) on an open covering {U_i}.
- 1-Cocycle c_{ij}=s_i|{U{ij}}-s_j|{U{ij}}
- When there is no solution for c_{ij}=0, the obstacle class [[c]]≠0 in H¹.
Proposition: the obstacle class `[c]` quantifies "locally valid but globally inconsistent narratives".
Corollary (minimum evidence of discovery): If the new operation F causes [[c]] to transition from 0 to ≠0 or from ≠0 to 0, then that alone is sufficient for a discovery Δ(F)>0.

XV. Curvature as a Noncommutative Property of Two Major Operations
Boundary opening/closing 𝔅 (layer opening/closing), quotienting 𝔔 (aka bundling).
Definition (Discovery Curvature)
$$
\mathcal{K} := \mathfrak{B},\mathfrak{Q}-\mathfrak{Q},\mathfrak{B}.
$$
System: if 𝒦=0, then the layer boundary operation and quotienting are commutative and novelty is unlikely to occur; the region where 𝒦≠0 is detected is the emergent critical plane.
Relative curvature: given 𝒦_Q conditioned on a particular question Q, the localization of QFS-like novelty can be defined.

XVI. semicollateralization of expression and regression
Expectation: ρ ⊣ σ (concomitant) would be reproducible but would lose novelty.
Reality: Only one side of η:Id_E ⇒ ρσ and ε:σρ ⇒ Id_S is locally "semi-collateral".
Definition (regression deficit): δ := Id_E-ρσ (residual of information drop at E).
Proposition: at the point where the local norm of δ exceeds the threshold, the creative regress induces a new side generation T
(Intuition: each time you return, the "unfulfilled" is visualized, multiplying aspects.)

XVII. Monadic Generation and Postmonadic Reflection
Generating monad T on E (lateral multiplication), compressive extra monad Ḡ on S (shortening by another name).
- Units η:Id ⇒ T (microlanguage), multiplication μ:T² ⇒ T (chain convolution).
- Extra unit ε:Ḡ => Id (decompression of compression).
Non-fiat identities:
$$
T,\overline{G} ;\not\simeq; \overline{G},T
$$
The magnitude of the 𝒦 lower bounds the 𝒦. The order of generation and compression is not interchangeable, and the displacement is the source of novelty.

XVIII. Bi-Display Equivalent Twist
Natural equivalence Φ: Rel(A,B) ≅ Aspect(B▷A).
Torsion τ: The deviation where Φ is no longer natural for the layer limit or quotienting.
Proposition: τ≠0 indicates the situation "simple in relation, redundant in aspect" or vice versa.
System: the optimal display of the explanation is the problem of selecting the display that minimizes τ (display selection principle).

XIX. Composition of Importance I (Density of Commutative Failures)
Definition: the measure m_nc(𝒟_x) of a noncommutative diagram family 𝒟_x with respect to the object x and the measure m_c(𝒟_x) of a diagram that vanishes by commutativity.
$$
I(x):=m_{nc}(𝒟_x)-m_c(𝒟_x).
$$
Note: Order, frequency of occurrence, and intervening centrality are only coarse upper/lower bounds for I.

XX. Description as a homotopy
Definition: explanation is the homotopy class `[p]` of paths on S.
Proposition (novelty judgment): δ(F)≥δ₀>0 when operation F sends `[p]` to another class `[q]≠[p]`.
Complement (minimal rebuttal): the local proof that there is no natural transformation between two paths p and q (even in a small interval) is the unit of abstract rebuttal.

X 11. Preservation and Auditability of Tears
Request: Tear downs are welcome, but must be wayward (auditable).
Definition (outward and return): for any explanatory path p, zig-zag
$E \xrightarrow{σ} S ;\dashrightarrow; E \xrightarrow{σ} S$
exists at finite length, a property that can be reconstructed along the citation (reference point).
Proposition: A rupture in which waywardness is lost is "fragmentation," not discovery.

XIV. Elaboration of the Minimal Principle
operation
$\mathcal{L}(E)=\alpha \cdot \text{len}(E) + \beta \cdot \text{glue-defect} +\gamma \cdot \text{quotient-loss}-\delta \cdot \text{new-homotopy} +;\varepsilon \cdot |\mathcal{K}| ;-; \zeta \cdot \text{auditability}$
Claim: A good explanation is to keep|\mathcal{K}|>0 while local minimizing ℒ (perfect minimum is creation room=0).

XXIII. Meta-theorems (Necessary and Sufficient for Abstract Discovery)
Theorem (sign of discovery)
An event is an abstract discovery when the following three conditions are met simultaneously
(1) Curvature 𝒦 or obstruction class `[c]` transitions (breaks) from 0 to ≠ 0 (or vice versa).
(2) Pathway homotopies are not preserved (`[p]→[q]≠[p]`).
(3) Reciprocity (auditability) is maintained (existence of finite zig-zag).
Sketch: (1) is the phase/layer side, (2) is the path structure side, and (3) is the auditability side. That the three are not independent follows from the structure of XV-XXX.

XXIV. Counterfactual Supplement (False Novelty)
Corollary: if ℓ_min shortens only by quotienting, but 𝒦=0 and `[p]` invariant, it is a compression, not a discovery.
System: Be suspicious of anything that looks "new" only by bundling by another name (elimination of differences).

XXV. Generators of Abstract Operations (Basis)
Minimum operation set that produces a discovery (non-exchangeable semigroup)
- Boundary redraw 𝔅
- Change in quotient granularity 𝔔
- Display replacement Φ/Φ-¹
- Generation T and regression ρ
Claim: Any heuristic transformation can be expressed as a pasting of the above finite composition and local aspects (the existence of a normal form is unproven).

XXVI. Next Abstract Steps (Proof Issue Brief)
- (A) Gives a general inequality between 𝒦 and `[c]` (curvature lower bounds the obstacles).
- (B) Continuous limit of I(x): stability against layer subdivision (refinement invariance).
- (C) Define "creation entropy" H := tr(δ) under semi-collateralization and show the relationship with Δ(F).
- (D) Display selection principle: Sufficient conditions for a display that minimizes τ to also lower ℒ.
——
If necessary, we will continue to refine the proof policy for (a)-(d). Keep the abstract and go to the level of theorematization and counterexample construction.


<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The average homo sapiens is losing track of the conversation, so I'm going to extract some useful insights from the thoughts so far and explain them in terms that the average person can understand.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT5/icon' alt='GPT5.icon' height="19.5"/>
Roger. I'll drop the abstract so far into "useful insights for the general public". Keep it short and to the point, no jargon.

1) "Relationships are not lines, but the "birth" of a new way of looking at things."
- Normally, we think there is a "line" between A and B, but in reality, it is an "event" where we see a new aspect of A because we saw B.
- Example: When we look at a friend (A) as a "teacher (B)", the "teaching ability" aspect of the same person suddenly rises.

2) "When we redraw boundaries, what we know changes."
- The interpretation depends on what is considered a single lump.
- For example: "How to create concentration" can be seen by dividing "3 months of studying for entrance exams" into chunks, and "Tips for making it a habit" can be seen by dividing it into "1 hour every day".

3) "If you create "empty headings" first, they will be connected later.
- Even if there is no content yet, if you put an "empty link" of a word you want to connect in the future, it is easy for other information to be gathered there later.
- Example: a box in the notebook with just "research topics I want to do in the future" becomes a hub for related notes later.

4) "Aliases are not "the same thing" but are combined into "one bundle".
- Sometimes the same thing is referred to in different ways (e.g. hay fever = allergic rhinitis). If we bundle them together as "the same group" without forcing them to be mashed into one piece, we can see the difference in the way they say things.
- Failure to assume that everything is "the same" will result in throwing out hints that are based on subtle differences.

5) "Importance = not something that comes up often, but something that "bridges the gap."
- It is not true that the more often something appears, the more important it is. Rather, it is more important to build "bridges" that connect stories that are far apart and open up new paths.
- For example: A "glossary" or "dictionary of people's names" in the workplace is a bridge to leapfrog conversation.

6) "Shortest distance" is not enough.
- The explanation of the quickest way is useful, but understanding is greatly enhanced when even one alternative path can be found.
- Tip: Showing only one "other path" to the same conclusion reduces misunderstandings.

7) "Knowledge that cannot go back and forth is just a fragment."
- "Quotes" that cannot be returned to their original source (vague or unsubstantiated sources) are dangerous.
- Rule: Always leave both a path from claim to back to evidence and a path from evidence to claim.

8) "Going back" is not a retreat, but preparation for creation.
- If you have trouble saying something, step away from the words and go back to the "moyamoya" and new words will come out.
- Practice: explain in 3 lines, erase everything once, leave one keyword, and restate from there.

9) "Replace display, unclog."
- The same thing can be conveyed differently depending on whether it is said as a "line of relationship" or as a "new aspect of one side of the relationship.
- Example: "A and B are similar" → Rephrase as "Thanks to B, I could see the 00 aspect of A".

10) "Newness" is measured by what is broken.
- A truly new realization breaks some "norm" (how to summarize, paraphrase, or delimit the past).
- Ask yourself: did this realization change (1) the way you delimit, (2) the way you rephrase, or (3) the way you bundle?

Mini procedures for immediate use (5 minutes per topic)
1. write a theme (e.g., "Internal Learning Mechanism").
2. place three empty headings (e.g., "Glossary", "Newcomer's Guide", "Failure").
3. put existing memos in "bundles" (alias names are not collapsed, but bundled).
4. write a sentence that "forcibly" connects two separate elements (create a bridge).
5. restate the explanation in two routes (shortest and another route).
6. be sure to add one rationale link (to allow for reciprocity).
7. erase and rephrase from one keyword word (back to forward).

Common Pitfalls → Replace
- × x Frequency of appearance = important → ○ Opens new avenues = important
- × Unify all the same → ○ First, make a "bundle" and leave the differences
- × x Shortest description only → ○ At least one "other road"
- × x Unsubstantiated quotes → ○ Quotes that can go back and forth (source/page/time)

A word summary
New discoveries are made by "redrawing boundaries, changing bundles, and replacing wording" rather than by drawing lines.
And if we build "bridges" and leave "grounds for passage," the discovery will be passed on to others.

(<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> I feel like it was ruined by "in terms the public can understand.")

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>"A discovery is an event that transforms at least one of the representational system (S), layer (𝒫), quotient (/G), and representation (in/among), and that results in the detection of a break in a conventionally preserved invariant (minimal path, isotopic class, commutativity, etc.), while still preserving the auditability that can be traversed through σ and ρ." by chewing up one step.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT5/icon' alt='GPT5.icon' height="19.5"/>
Okay, I'll just relax the definition one step to "jargon to platitudes".

Chewable version (with correspondence table)
- Expression (S) = "method" of how to say things (how to put things into words and put them out)
- Layers (𝒫) = contextual "breaks" (chapters, entire book, externals, etc.)
- Quotient (/G) = "bundling of aliases" (to what extent are different names treated the same)
- Indication (in/among) = "point of view of how to say it" (say it as a relationship between A and B / say that thanks to B I see a new aspect in A)
- Invariants = indicators that usually do not change (shortest explanatory route, groups that are considered to mean the same thing, consistency, etc.)
- Rupture = the breakdown of the "supposed to remain the same".
- σ・ρ = "put into words ←→ return to moyamoya" round trip route (can return to the basis/reassemble from the basis)

Paraphrase in one line
Findings = if you replace any of the "wording, delimitation, bundling, or perspective",
The "unchanging indicators" that had been maintained as a matter of course have collapsed,
Still, it is possible to go to and from the grounds - such an event.

Mini-checklist (3 conditions)
1. replaced? (Changed one of the following: method/separation/bundling/perspective)
2. did it fall apart? (shortest route, grouping, keeping coherence different from before)
3. can you go back and forth? (Can you go back and forth between claims ⇄ and evidence)
When all three stand at the same time, we can call it "new awareness.

(<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It was interesting to see how, even after so much intense abstraction, the "connection to the evidence" remains undiscarded.)


<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything gained by abstracting down to sphere theory? Or did you merely express yourself in the abstract?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT5/icon' alt='GPT5.icon' height="19.5"/>The abstraction to sphere theory is not a "paraphrase," but rather the following practical benefit.

What has increased (real benefits)
1. unified language
    - Change of wording," "change of delimitation," and "change of bundling" can be described in the same frame of Sekite, Layer, and Quotient. It is possible to convert even if the domain changes.
        - [[Manipulation of visibility and Sekite, strata, quotient]]
2. composability
    - By treating the operation as an injection, the difference in order (noncommutative) = source of novelty can be captured in general form (order of 𝔅 and 𝔔 ≠ → curvature 𝒦).
        - [[Order noncommutative = novelty]]
- Axis of determination of invariants/breaks
    - "Newness" could be defined by the amount of conservation broken (shortest path, commutativity, isotopes, etc.) instead of being a matter of "feeling".
4. design guidelines for returnability
    - Separating σ and ρ as semi-collateral clarifies the design principle that reference is reversible/implication is irreversible (auditability requirement).
5. measure local to global obstacles
    - The "lamination failure" in the first layer (front layer) is counted as an obstacle.
    - → "locally correct but not meshing as a whole" can be detected and compared.
6. theoretical forms of generation and compression
    - We were able to show that the noncommutativity of the monad (generated T) and the extra monad (compressed Ḡ) is an emergence condition (TḠ≠ḠT).
7. description equivalents
    - Explanation = We can treat it as a homotopy of a route and have a path to mathematically determine whether another route is "the same" or "different" from it.
8. minimum generation system
    - The prospect that heuristic transformations can be generated by the base operations of "boundary redrawing, quotient, display exchange, generation, and regression" (searchable in normal form).

If we did not abstract
- Novelty can only be described in terms of "whether it is interesting or not" and is difficult to compare, reproduce, and divert.
- Cannot systematically handle order effects (noncommutative) and local/global inconsistencies in operations.

Most recent use (short description)
- Novelty detection = criteria by "noncommutative degree of operation 𝒦 + [[affixation failure]]`[c]` + change in pathway type".
- Design principle = "References are reversible and semantics can be broken" is implemented by σ/ρ separation.
- Evaluation = The importance of a bridge is measured by the "density of non-commutative equations" (more robust than the frequency index).
Conclusion: The answer is that we have a system of operations to "measure, reproduce, and design" our findings, rather than a mere obfuscation.
