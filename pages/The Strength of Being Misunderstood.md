[The Strength of Being Misunderstood - Sam Altman](https://blog.samaltman.com/the-strength-of-being-misunderstood) [[Sam Altman]]

There are two degrees of freedom in caring what people think
- Whose opinion do you care about?
    - (*) Coco Chanel, “[[I don’t care what you think about me. I don’t think about you at all.]]”
- Which timescale do you care about?
    - I am convinced that the newspapers are wrong.

We should trade our low short-term position for a high long-term position.
- But many are unwilling to do so.
- Making bets that are ultimately correct on important but non-consensus questions
    - If you are doing the right thing, [[not being understood by the masses is a strength]].
    - Able to solve problems that others cannot

relevance
    - [[Pleasing the masses is evil.]]
