title: "Overreaction or normality bias?"

Is a person who has a large reaction to an event an [[overreaction]] or a person who has a small reaction a [[normalcy bias]]?

No one knows at this time what the appropriate reaction is. Only time will reveal what was appropriate in retrospect.

    - [[hindsight bias]]
    - [[Test of Time]]
