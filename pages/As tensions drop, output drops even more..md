As tensions drop, output drops even more.

- [[Gutsy Motivation Person]], output goes down when the gears get a little out of sync.
- If the projects are A and B, and their respective [[willingness (e.g., to do something)]] is 10 and 9, the output is often 100:0 instead of 10:9
    - If A's motivation drops a bit to 8, the output will be 0:100.
- If you force them to give you a 50:50 output, they'll get less excited, 10:10, and start 80 doing something else.

relevance
- "[[Inability to load the context of the project into the living brain]] is one of the reasons [[tension]] goes down."
    - The first time you decide to do something, it's going to be heavy.
- [[When]] what you're trying to do doesn't work, you get less excited.


    - [The gears mesh.
