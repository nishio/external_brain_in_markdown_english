title: "Correct but not useful."
---

It's often the case that "correct but not [[useful]]."
- Because [[correctness]] and [[usefulness]] are not equal.
There are those who take the position that "what is useful is right" (and consider it equal), which tends to lead to a parallel line.

- [[Right but futile]]
- → [[If you fill a lake with a glass of water, will the surface of the water rise?]]
