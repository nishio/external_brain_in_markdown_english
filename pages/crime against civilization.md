    - This idea implicitly assumes that humans are more precious than other
    - It is not obvious that if some people commit acts that undermine civilization, we should respect them or not.
    - For example, "killing an idea" is more casually and frequently done today than "killing a human being."
        - Of course, people today recognize that "killing humans" is a bad idea.
        - When people were being casually killed, they didn't think killing humans was as bad as it is now.
        - What we are casually doing now to "kill an idea" may be an act of barbarism that is out of the ordinary in the eyes of future generations.
        - It is not self-evident whether the act of an idea being killed by "ethics", which is only a value at the present time, is different from the act of a human being being killed by the idea that a certain race is superior at a certain point in time.
