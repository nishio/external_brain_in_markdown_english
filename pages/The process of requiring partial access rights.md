The process of requiring partial access rights
Human Resources & General Affairs
Important for running the organization
A wide variety of [[irregularities]] occur.
When there is more than one person, the need for [[intra-team information sharing]] arises.
- You'll need access to "personnel and the person in question, but not to others."
    - [[partial access right]]
- The need for this type of access rights is difficult to realize until the size of the organization is such that there is more than one person in charge of personnel.

[[economies of scale]]?
- [[LLMs may cause economies of scale to disappear]].
