- In order to enhance the resolution of deliberative discussion, it is important to first gain a deeper understanding of its purpose and process. The essence of deliberative discussion is to build consensus and solve problems through the exchange of diverse opinions and mutual understanding. Therefore, it is a good idea to examine in detail the situations in which deliberative discussions take place, the participants, the rules, and the expected results, and to consider what conditions will make deliberative discussions successful.
- In particular, factors such as the size and structure of the deliberations, the way AI is used, and the choice of topics have a significant impact on the quality and efficiency of deliberations, so exploring the balance between these factors can help improve resolution.

    - [[Who was the first to say "mature discussion"?]]
    - [[John Rolls]] / [[Jurgen Habermas]].

    - [[What is the background of John Rawls' focus on deliberation?]]
    - Criticism of social inequality and meritocracy, and the pursuit of fair consensus building

    - [[What did Jurgen Habermas say?]]
    - In deliberations, he proposed a "theory of communicative action" and developed a unique perspective on social consensus building and legitimacy

    - [[What does Hannah Arendt have to do with Jürgen Habermas?]]
    - While Habermas and Arendt have some overlap regarding the public sphere and deliberation, they interpret it from different approaches and perspectives. In particular, the difference between Arendt's emphasis on the importance of action and Habermas' emphasis on the process of deliberation is considered a point of contrast in their thought.

    - [[How does Rousseau relate to deliberative democracy?]]
    - Rousseau's concepts of the general will and direct democracy are understood as the theoretical precursors of deliberative democracy and laid the foundation for the modern theory of deliberation by Habermas, Rawls, and others

    - [[What led Hannah Arendt to emphasize deliberation?]]
    - Opposition to Totalitarianism and Interest in the Greek Polis

    - [[General Will 2.0 and Audrey Tan]]
    - Audrey Tan's philosophy is positioned as "participatory democracy" that utilizes digital technology to promote conscious participation and collaboration among citizens. This approach differs from Hiroki Azuma's "General Will 2.0," which aims at consensus building through "unconscious data," and emphasizes conscious expression of opinions and consensus building through deliberation and dialogue. While both attempt to harness the power of technology for the sake of democracy, there are fundamental differences in the manner and process of its utilization.

    - [[General Will 2.0 and Glen Weyl]]
    - Like Audrey Tan, it is unique in that it has an approach to citizen cooperation and empowerment through the use of technology, but also proposes a restructuring of democracy from its own perspective, such as reforming market mechanisms and voting.

    - [[Rousseau's General Will and Hegel]]
    - For Hegel, the general will is not merely a public agreement, but a process of ethical development and self-awareness of history, culture, and community as a whole. The formation of the will is therefore always generated in the dynamic relationship between the individual, society, and history, and is not an agreement or will fixed at a particular point in time.

- [[Critique of the social contract by Hume, a contemporary of Rousseau]]

- [[Rousseau disliked the commercial state of Athens and preferred the military state of Sparta.]]
