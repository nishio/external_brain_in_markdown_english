Imaging at zoom
- As for zooming, it would be good to get the "currently displayed image" and bring it into the process of only zooming in and out of it.
- The image will be a little rough when zoomed in, and there will be white areas around the image when zoomed out, but there should be no practical problem.
        - [[Retrieving the currently displayed image]]
    - Overlap at the same position when zooming starts: done
    - Zoom/Scroll
        - get dislodged

    - [[Reflected in Paper when zooming is complete]]
    - [[Problem with toolbar overlay for some reason]]
