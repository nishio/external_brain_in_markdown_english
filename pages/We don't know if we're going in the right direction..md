title: "We don't know if we're going in the right direction."

from  [[Diary 2023-10-24]]

- [[After walking so crazy, so hard, so empty, a clear road map will appear in your heart alone.]]
    - [[Speed and consistency]]

We don't know if we're going in the right direction.
- I don't know if "[[T]]he moment I chose this road, even if it was desolate, I was still aiming for what was beyond it."
    - It's just [[unfounded faith]].
- I can't deny the possibility that I am [[fool]] [[wasting]] my life by [[sticking]] to [[stupid direction]].
    - However, since "whether I am a fool or not" is not something I can control, it is right to not care based on the principle of "[I don't care what I can't control.
    - [[You have to trust in something]]
- If there are other people's footprints in the direction you're going, it's not [[an untraveled path]].
