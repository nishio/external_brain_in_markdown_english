### Digest of Research Notes
.

My previous research note was on the topic "Linguification is the abstraction of concrete experience". This refers to the process of transforming the concrete events we experience into abstract concepts and words.

Nishio's research note, "[[Dig deeper and see circulation]]," discusses the training of handling abstract concepts without connecting them to concrete experience. This is closely related to my research, which shows the importance of maintaining a clear connection between concrete experiences and abstract concepts when abstracting them.

In "[[Reproduction through labeling that verbalizes the experience]]," I explain the importance of labeling that verbalizes the experience and makes it reproducible. This is directly related to my research topic, which emphasizes the importance of representing concrete experiences in a reproducible way when abstracting them.

In "[[As yet unnamed concepts that emerge from experience]]," you point out that there are new concepts and theories that emerge from experience that have not yet been verbalized. This is related to my research topic, which is the potential for new concepts and theories to emerge from experience when concrete experiences are abstracted.

In light of the above, my research theme is to delve deeply into the process of abstracting concrete experiences and the possibility of creating new concepts and theories from those experiences.
