- If the quantity of one thing A does not decrease, but the quantity of another thing B increases, then the proportion of A in the total of A and B will decrease.
- Although it looks obvious in the figure, some people focus on the words "decrease or not decrease" and think in a way that blurs the distinction between [[quantity and percentage]].
- When we're talking about "decreasing proportions," it doesn't matter whether the quantity is decreasing or not, because even if the quantity of A is increasing, if the quantity of B is increasing faster, then the proportion of A is decreasing.
