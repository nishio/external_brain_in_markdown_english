title: "Think Straight, Talk Straight."

> [sugimoto_kei](https://x.com/sugimoto_kei/status/1416409598806749185) I am skeptical about "[[psychological safety]]".
>  "A common feeling that within this team, we are comfortable taking interpersonal risks," but that doesn't work as a standard. On the contrary, it fosters an atmosphere of refraining from even saying what needs to be said .
>  It is more important that abusive language and other behavior that objectively deviates from the norm be properly disposed of.

> [sugimoto_kei](https://x.com/sugimoto_kei/status/1416411002602614786) As for [[leadership styles]], there is, of course, a distinction between [[democratic leadership]], which listens carefully to members' opinions, and its opposite, tyranny. There is (and has been for a long time).
>  I don't think it's anything more than that.

> [sugimoto_kei](https://x.com/sugimoto_kei/status/1416412081687990274) Rather, if we are talking about psychological safety, I think it would be better to clarify what that involves beyond democratic leadership.

> [sugimoto_kei](https://x.com/sugimoto_kei/status/1416417361649758216) It doesn't mean that the democratic type is good and the [[tyrannical]] type is bad.
>  In a situation where the future is hard to predict or in jeopardy, if everyone tries to make decisions by debating this and that, it makes me wonder if this leader will be able to handle it.
>  It is sometimes easier to get through a situation as a group if you give specific instructions on how to do something in a monopolistic manner.


> [sugimoto_kei](https://x.com/sugimoto_kei/status/1416595639819902978) The motto at [[Andersen]], where I was, was "Think Straight, Talk Straight. I liked it very much.
>  Similar to psychological safety, but with a crucial difference.
>  "I can speak frankly," while psychological safety is attributed to the environment, and this motto is attributed to [[the individual's]] will, right?
>  >sugimoto_kei: I'm skeptical about the "psychological safety" thing...

> [sugimoto_kei](https://x.com/sugimoto_kei/status/1416597099928428547) "Think Straight, Talk Straight." is a much nobler thought than "psychological safety".
>  Psychological security affirms that you are an entity that can be influenced in any way by your environment. It is the idea of slavery.
>  "Talk Straight" seeks to establish itself as an entity that confronts its absurd environment.

> [sugimoto_kei](https://x.com/sugimoto_kei/status/1416599040121180163) Of course, there are times when the environment is so bad that people find it difficult to speak frankly.
>  At such times, "Think Straight, Talk Straight." still gives us the courage to express our thoughts.
>  Psychological safety is quite the opposite, and when that happens, you whisper that it's not your fault if you keep your mouth shut.
- This could be related to Cybozu's [[answerability]] as well.

> [sugimoto_kei](https://x.com/sugimoto_kei/status/1416606177304055811) Environment and individual will are complementary, and one is never critically important. And while the leader must be mindful of the environment, the members must place emphasis on their own will.
>  "Psychological safety" is the ethos on the leader's side, and "Think Straight, Talk Straight." is the ethos on the member's side.
