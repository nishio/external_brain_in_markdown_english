title: "When the majority of Homo sapiens are unable to work"
---

SF story of the day
'I hate it, you're wrong about me being an extremist. Homo sapiens must be destroyed! I don't care if Homo sapiens is destroyed! I don't think that. I am just promoting the transfer of authority to software for the time when the majority of Homo sapiens will eventually be unable to work.

Since I wrote this, it's been raining combinations of the words "[[Empowerment of Human Rights]]."
