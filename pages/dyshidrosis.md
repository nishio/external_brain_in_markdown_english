- > Caused by damage to the cells of the olfactory epithelium, the part of the nose that senses smells, during a cold or other upper respiratory infection, and when they regenerate, they mistakenly send smell signals to the center.
- > I find it unpleasant as a smell, as if it were "burnt" or "rotten".

- This one from this morning.
- I guess my nose wasn't in good shape to begin with because of the fall pollen allergy.
- On top of that, he wore a mask from 3pm to midnight.
- I woke up in the morning and it stunk.
- At first I was like, "Did I sweat because I walked out yesterday? (Even though I took a bath?" "Is it because I ate Chinese food?" Or maybe my scalp smells like I'm getting old?" But according to my wife, there was no unusual smell, so I guess I have a bad nose.
- I've had a whiff of the smell before, but never one that lasted.
- It went away after one night.

- I went to an event with a lot of yellow dust flying around.
- Masks on and off.
