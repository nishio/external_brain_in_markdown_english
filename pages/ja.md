Since I created [[en]] as a flag to indicate that the text is written in English, I also created ja as a flag to indicate that the text is written in Japanese, for symmetry, but since the default is ja, it is probably omitted.

This page is auto-translated from [/nishio/ja](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/ja) using DeepL. If you looks something interesting but the auto-translated English is not good enough to understand it, feel free to let me know at [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en). I'm very happy to spread my thought to non-Japanese readers.
