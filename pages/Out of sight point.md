title: "Out of sight point"
---

- A situation where the pointer points out of sight (e.g., directly above) while the eye is looking forward
- Not intended to point to anything.
- So you can interpret that as [[gesture]] and assign functions other than points

concrete example
- In first person shooters, "reloading" is necessary during shooting, to which the gesture "pointing the gun up" is assigned.
- The gesture to remove the goggles in [[Virtual Virtual Reality]] also points out of view, behind you.
