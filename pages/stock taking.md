In business in general, "inventorying" is the process of identifying and organizing all the tasks and projects you have, and clearly understanding their [[priority]] and [[progress]].

When used in the latter sense, the main purpose of conducting an inventory is,
- Identify outstanding tasks and neglected work.
- Objective understanding of the current status of your project
- Review priorities and eliminate waste
This is the case.
