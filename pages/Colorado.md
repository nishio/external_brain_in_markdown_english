The Colorado legislature has tried a new voting method called "secondary voting" designed to capture the strength of voter preferences. This method is designed to correct a major problem with traditional voting.
Democrats were given 100 virtual tokens, which they used to vote on several bills, spending one token for one vote, four tokens for two votes, nine tokens for three votes, and so on, squared to the number of votes. This allows you to cast more votes on bills you think are really important.
As a result, the strength of support for each of the bills became more apparent. The bill that received the most votes was the "Equal Pay for Equal Work Act.
Secondary voting is one alternative to the traditional one-person, one-vote system to prevent the tyranny of the majority and to make it easier for voters to make their true voices heard. At this point, however, it is preferable to use virtual currency rather than actual money because of concerns that influence can be bought with money. Improving democracy may be difficult, but it is not impossible.
