According to my wife, I often "have too much faith in my future self.
My "I see" [[lifehack]] often seems to be based on the principle of "I don't trust my future self".

- I am unable to properly take the medication I need to take once a day
- The next morning, 'Did I drink last night?' I can't even answer the question, 'Did I drink last night?
- I can't even keep track of "I drank today" after I've had a drink.
This is a life hack on how to keep up the pace of one pill a day when the basic premise is [[distrust of self]].

    - Not keeping pace with one pill a day.
