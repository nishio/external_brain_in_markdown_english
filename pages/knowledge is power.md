He placed the concept as central in Western thought, and the phrase became widely quoted as "knowledge is power. Bacon was an advocate of [[scientific methodology]] and believed that [[the accumulation of knowledge]] based on [[experience]] and [[experiment]] would be the "power" to liberate humanity from the forces of nature and to build a better society. His ideas influenced many thinkers of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and led to an emphasis on the value of [[scientific inquiry]] and the importance of [[education]].
