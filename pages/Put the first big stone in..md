title: "Put the first big stone in."
---

It's a common metaphor, so I'll generate it later.

A typical "Big Rocks" story goes like this.
1. demonstration in class/training
    - The instructor prepares a clear glass jar and (1) a large stone, (2) a pebble, and (3) sand (some versions use (4) water).
    - First, the "big stone" is placed in a jar. It looks full.
    - Next, put a "pebble" in and shake it, it goes into the gap and still goes in.
    - And when more "sand" is added, more goes in.
    - (In the pouring version) water also enters at the end.
2. questions from the lecturer
    - What is the lesson of this experiment?"
    - Students tend to answer, "You can get a lot in depending on how you pack it," but the instructor corrects them.
3. the real lesson
    - 'What I really want to tell you is that if you don't put the big stones (the most important things) in first, you won't be able to put them in later.' If you fill it with small errands (pebbles/sand) first, you can't put in the important stuff."
4. correspondence of interpretations
    - Bottle = my time, attention, and resources (24 hours a day or operating this month).
    - Large stones = most important tasks directly related to value/goals (family time, deep work, health, etc.).
    - Pebbles = necessary but less important task.
    - Sand and water = chore, notification, and inertia.
5. attention to common misunderstandings
    - This is not "all-in magic". If there are too many big rocks, they won't fit. It is essential to narrow down the number first and place the scheduled blocks first (put them on the calendar first).

To drop it into practice, the standard usage is "decide on up to three large stones for the week and reserve time first → place the remaining pebbles/sand around them".

- The oldest verifiable source in print is "[[First Things First]]" (1994) by [[Stephen R. Covey]] et al. In the same book, the "Big Rocks" demonstration story is used.
- It was later widely disseminated through FranklinCovey's training materials and videos (a.k.a. "Big Rocks").
