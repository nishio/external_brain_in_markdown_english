title: "superficial knowledge"
---

In the work shift written in the English-speaking world, Wikipedia is used as an example of a "service that provides shallow knowledge and skills," but given that the term "Gugulekas" was coined in Japan, Google search is representative of a service that provides shallow knowledge.

With the appearance of such services, the value of knowing shallow knowledge (i.e., what you can find by Googling) will plummet, and you will not be able to compete in the market unless you have "expertise" beyond that.

You're called "googlers" because you ask questions about "what you can find out by googling" to a community that strives to acquire expertise based on that kind of "you should know what you can find out by googling" assumption.
