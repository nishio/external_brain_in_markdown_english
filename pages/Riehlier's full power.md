title: "Riehlier's full power"
---

June 2023
A case of buying 3 x ¥800,000 Pokémon cards with a credit card after reading an article encouraging the purchase of Pokémon cards and the price dropped to less than half of the original price in a few days.

- Someone buy all of Lelie's power.
- I bought 3 full strength 800,000 leelier's and cut off my aiful and credit card. Can someone help me?
- I bought 3 full strength Leelie's for about 800,000 because Mr. Sio, the pokeka soaring predictor, said it would never go down... I'm going to cry. I'm afraid to look at my credit card bill.

> PSA10 I know someone who bought 3 copies of Lelie's all-out effort for 800,000. Now they're at 250,000 yen a piece or so, and he's expressing his sympathy.
> And I don't know why the investor's NOTE is so high too 🤔.

> [@baham_yugiou](https://twitter.com/baham_yugiou/status/1670579549413969920?s=20): maybe these 3 on mercari are the ones that you bought... (all 3 were purchased 7 days ago)
> Perhaps Ganba Riie sold for 1,000,000 on 6/10, and he saw Riie selling for 800,000 on 6/11 or 6/12 (full force) and bought it before it was bought -> but it was actually originally a Riie in the 200,000-300,000 price range? Theory ↓↓

- > [@baham_yugiou](https://twitter.com/baham_yugiou/status/1670579916407189504?s=20): I wonder if he was whispering to a certain Pokemon investor in the preliminary stage that he should buy "Lelie" because the price won't go down, so he said something like "I was fooled. I wonder if he was saying something like "I was cheated".

> [@atemu0822](https://twitter.com/atemu0822/status/1670565210913132544?s=20): Holy shit, Lier 1 was over 800,000 at its highest.

> [@clare_dauan](https://twitter.com/clare_dauan/status/1669540958122430464?s=20): the widespread cessation of the purchase of PSA appraisals of Pokemon.
> The technique of "buying up appraised items to drive up the price, then replacing the contents of the appraised case with unappraised items and rejoining them for purchase" is so widespread that there is no way to get around it. I was flipped upside down when I heard that.
> 100,000 yen can be converted into 10 million yen, and since it is assumed to be bought up, it is too much of a gangster.
- > [@wed0828](https://twitter.com/wed0828/status/1669826642813026304?s=20): not exactly.
- > Since it is not possible to re-crimp, the scammer removes the label and card, puts the real label and other cards in a different case, and crimps the label and card.
- > If the card inside is legitimate, it's still good, but in the worst case, the card inside may be counterfeit as well.

> [@daizu1977](https://twitter.com/daizu1977/status/1671397534990995456?s=20): I'm having a great meal watching the bottom resellers who can't sell after buying a lot of Pokekas and then explode, but one thing I understand.
> "Resellers have budgets, too, and there are those who buy comfortably with credit cards and sell out before payment."
> I've found that if you dabble for more than two months with no sales, you can take a pretty big hit cash flow-wise.
> Don't buy inventory clearance either.
