    - [[reality]] and [[ideal]] have [gap
    - So think about that [[how to bridge the gap]] and do it.
    - This is [[improvement]].

- Find [what needs to be fixed
There are three patterns to this finding.
- 1:
    - I know the current situation is not good.
    - We still don't know what the ideal situation would be.
- 2:
    - We know that the status quo is not good.
    - I know what kind of situation is ideal.
    - I don't know how to achieve the ideal state.
- 3:
    - We know that the status quo is not good.
    - I know what kind of situation is ideal.
    - I also know how to get to the ideal state.
