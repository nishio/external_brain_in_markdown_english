An obsession that there should be something to like.
There is an obsession with the phrase "[[work what you love]]" that there should be something you love. When you are depressed because you are not getting what you want, it points to where you want to be. When there are ripples on the surface of your heart, there is something beneath the surface that you cannot yet see.
