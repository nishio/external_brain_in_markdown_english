> Some people are too concerned about what others think of them. Put others aside for now.
> Throwing away is indeed different. First, decide what you want to draw.
> Don't give the initiative to the customer. Don't give the initiative to the customers. --- [Aki Irie](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%85%A5%E6%B1%9F%E4%BA%9C%E5%AD%A3)

I also like the comment of a genius cartoonist, "Don't give the initiative to the customers. I try to draw with the resolve of "I can only draw like this, so it can't be helped, can it? I try to draw with the determination that "I can only draw like this, so it can't be helped," but I still lack the madness and the will to kill because I keep glancing at other people's faces.

> [Takashi_Shiina](https://x.com/Takashi_Shiina/status/1857968888438468615) I usually target "my junior high school self" or something like that, where I can see their faces. I enjoy the time when I can say, "You like this, don't you? I enjoy the preparation more when I can say, "I'm going to make this cut here, and I wonder what kind of reaction I'll get.

I was curious who the "cartoon genius" was.

> [06_1_n_t_s_p_l](https://x.com/06_1_n_t_s_p_l/status/1857374721530331354) The "Kaoru Mori and Aki Irie, Manga Artist" exhibition at the Setagaya Museum of Literature is free to photograph, so you can find any number of great manuscripts and illustrations if you search. I'll leave it to you now, but this comment made me feel so scared that I still wanted to upload it. I wonder if there are any other artists in the same field who are not shaken up after being told such a thing by Mr. Mori. #Irie Mori Exhibition

>  Other than that, of course, the live analog original drawings by Mr. Mori and Mr. Irie, but also the writings were just so cool and piercing...it was a wonderful exhibition.
