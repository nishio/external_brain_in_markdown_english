Role of the team leader and the concept of "strength"

Discussion of team leader responsibilities and perceptions of "strength"
- Tachikawa believes that the team leader sets the objectives and then persuades the members to buy into them.
- Nishio, on the other hand, raised the idea of [[servant leadership]].
- Also, as the conversation proceeds with the concept of "strength" as it relates to wargames, a discussion ensues regarding the recognition of one's own strength and the need to improve it.

Tachikawa: Why? There is a team leader who takes responsibility. That person decides and takes responsibility. For example, when the question is whether to take Q or C, I take this one, I take this one, and if it doesn't work out, I take this one. And if it doesn't work out, the team leader takes full responsibility.
Nishio: That is one way of thinking. The team leader is in such a position, and that is just one interpretation. On the other hand, in such a case, the team leader makes a decision, and the rest of the team members say, "Yes, I see. I see. The opposite is true, but the team leader is not the one who makes the decision. There are, of course, those who think that the team leader is a servant whose role is to support other team members so that they can work happily.
Tachikawa: Then I am not completely that way. In other words, the team leader decides the objectives. I think it is the team leader's job to then work to convince each person that it is a good idea.
Man X: Ahhh.
Tachikawa: It is also the team leader's job to make everyone think that the team leader thought spontaneously and decided to do it that way. So, for example, a team leader who says that the answer that everyone came up with spontaneously is the answer of the team organization is an extremely useless leader. It's just an evasion of responsibility.
Nishio: One interpretation is that.
Male Y: (laughs)
Nishio: So if you want to convince all of Tachikawa-san for now and want them to think spontaneously and have a particular idea themselves, then the werewolves need to be stronger. 〓01:36:39 〓
Tachikawa: Ah.
Male Y: That's what I mean.
Tachikawa: I am weak.
Man X: Why are you saying that? Because if you don't argue with that, you won't become a stronger werewolf.
All: (laughs)
Man X: Werewolves can only get stronger by making the assumption that they are strong and then training them.
Tachikawa: Hey.
Nishio: Yes (laughs).
Tachikawa: Werewolves are really bad at 〓01:37:00〓
Man X: No, that's a waste of time. If you think you're strong, you'll be strong.
Tachikawa: What - really?
Man X: If you don't think, you won't get stronger. On the contrary.
Tachikawa: I see.
Man X: I don't know anyone who became strong while feeling weak. In any field.
Tachikawa: I see.
Nishio: Words with connotations.
Male Y: (laughs)
Nishio: I think you will become stronger if you only act to make others perceive that you are weak but strong, and if you keep thinking that you are weak and need to improve yourself, you will become stronger.
Man X: That's great. It's a trend.
