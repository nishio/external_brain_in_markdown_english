> [lucknknock](https://twitter.com/lucknknock/status/1577976963855044609) We have created a GPU-powered virtual life ecosystem simulator!　You can observe how up to tens of thousands or more individuals form an ecosystem in real time by making their own decisions to eat, form groups, and pass on genes through reproduction.

> [lucknknock](https://twitter.com/lucknknock/status/1720703726124675161) I'm going to verify this at random around the end of November or December, so if it turns out to work, may I ask for your help in planning a FF project or something? If it turns out to work, I'd be happy to hear from you.
>  >lucknknock: I got a GPU that can always be driven free, so I want to do a guy who provides content 24 hours a day on Youtube.
