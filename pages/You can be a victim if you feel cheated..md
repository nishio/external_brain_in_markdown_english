title: "You can be a victim if you feel cheated."

> There are some people for whom it is more convenient to say, "Because [[propaganda]] was superior, [[Nazi]] was able to come to power," and that is the supporters of the Nazis, in other words, the German people at that time. This is what [[Takumi Sato]], a researcher of media history, says, but if we say that they did not actively support the Nazis but were deceived by cunning propaganda, they can be [[victims]] rather than perpetrators. In other words, by overestimating the effects of the propaganda, they can sort of [[avoid responsibility]].

Those who think of themselves as being deceived as "the deceiver is evil and I am good because I am not evil" and
Some people think it's their [[weakness]] to be deceived.

During this period, propaganda efforts led by [[Joseph Goebbels]] portrayed Hitler as a powerful and patriotic leader and skillfully exploited public unrest and discontent (The Holocaust Explained ) (Holocaust Encyclopedia).

However, it was not until 1933, when the Nazis seized power, that Nazi propaganda began in earnest. During this period, the Ministry of National Enlightenment and Propaganda, under the leadership of Goebbels, was established to spread the Nazi message through films, radio, and newspapers (USHMM Exhibits) (Encyclopedia Britannica).

On the other hand, it is said that the argument that some German citizens who supported the Nazis were "deceived by propaganda" was intended to justify their own mistakes. In doing so, they sought to absolve themselves of responsibility by attributing their actions to Nazi machinations (The Holocaust Explained) (Holocaust Encyclopedia Holocaust Encyclopedia).
