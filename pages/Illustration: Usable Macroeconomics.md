- Illustration Available [[macro-economics]].

- Chapter 3, "Economics that have Moved the Times," is a good overview of the currents as it is explained in chronological order.
    - Contrary to the title, it explains how it came into being before the birth of macroeconomics.

    - [[leviathan]] v.s. [[civic government theory]] The idea that value is added by labor.
    - [[Adam Smith]] Absolute advantage v.s. Rickard's [[comparative advantage]].
    - [[Adam Smith]]   [[work-value theory]]  v.s.  [[marginal utility theory]]  →  [[Marshallian uplift]]
- Neoclassical Microeconomics v.s. [[Keynes]] School Macroeconomics → [[Cessation by Hicks]].
- 1961-1963 Kennedy Administration + Keynesians → full employment
- 1963-1969 Johnson Administration: Medicare
    - Vietnam war
    - Government spending at full employment leads to inflation.
- 1969-1974 Nixon Administration
    - 1971 Dollar shock + price wage freeze treatment + 10% surcharge on imports
    - 1973 Oil crisis
    - Inflation has not stopped despite the recession [[stagflation]].
    - Keynesian cannot cope with stagflation because it is an aggregate demand management policy
    - Inflation expanded until 1982, tripling prices in 17 years (6.5% per annum).
- A New Wave of Keynesian Discreditation
        - [[monetarism]]
        - Milton [[Friedman]] (1912-2006)
                - [[freedom of choice]]  1977
            - Keynesians went too far and went beyond the natural unemployment rate to full employment.
            - That policy causes inflation.
                - [[money illusion]], not realizing that inflation is causing real reductions.
                - Monetary illusion: a 5% increase in payroll with 10% inflation is a reduction in real terms, but is mistakenly thought to be an increase
                - [Monetary illusion - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%B2%A8%E5%B9%A3%E9%8C%AF%E8%A6%9A)
                - The result is a reduction in real terms and an increase in nominal terms, with an increase in supply thinking it is an increase.
            - When it is widely understood that inflation is occurring?
                - [[Phillips curve]]
                - Rigidity in nominal wages prevents salaries from increasing at the same rate as inflation
                - The resulting inflationary increase would effectively reduce salaries.
                - The volume of employment increases (if not at full employment) in response to lower labor prices
                - But inflation at full employment will not add any more jobs.
                - And?
        - [[rational expectations hypothesis]]
        - Lucas.
        - People try to act rationally by factoring in future inflation expectations (forecasts)
- Relatively new idea
        - [[theory of games]] : Because of conflicting interests of people, even if each individual makes a rational decision based on his or her own interests, the whole may fall into a suboptimal solution.
        - [[behavioral economics]] : People's decisions are not rational to begin with.
        - [[information asymmetry]] : → [[contract theory]]
