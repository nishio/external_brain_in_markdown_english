title: "No respect for unfounded anger."
---

If Mr. A is expressing anger or displeasure without explaining why.
I don't know what the reason is, but Mr. A doesn't seem to like it, so we're not going to do it."
and the case where
Mr. A is being kind of negative, but he hasn't given us any particular reason to stop, so let's do it."
In some cases, this is the case.

- [[read the situation]] and likely the former.

Wait, rather than attributing it to the air
- Could it be strongly related to [[impulse organization]] of [[teal organization]], domination by force and fear?
Especially if the angry person is an older man.

If a powerful person is angry, there's a [[fear]] that he might hit you, so there's a respect for anger that happens.
They overgeneralize it and think it's a communicative technique that will always work.

- [[An ideology not to be taken lightly]]

Title has room for improvement.
