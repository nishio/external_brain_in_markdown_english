- For example, let's say you crawl [[Scrapbox]] once a day using the API and register each page as a record in the [[kintone]] app.
- With kintone features
    - You can see the [[change log]] on each page in [["diff" solar term (approx. Aug. 23, when the weather is said to start cooling down)]] style
    - A [[Comment]] can be added to each page.
    - Can [[notice]] when certain keywords appear
Kintone and Scrapbox are [[complementary good]], not in a competing relationship.
It is possible to increase each other's value by complementing each other's missing features
