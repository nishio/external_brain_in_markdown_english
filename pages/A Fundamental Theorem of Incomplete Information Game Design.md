- [[incomplete information]] Fundamental Theorem of Game Design
1. players have asymmetric information # Information asymmetry
2. accurate speculation about information that cannot be known gives the player an advantage
3. [[honesty]] behavior favors the player
[Fundamental Theorem of Incomplete Information Game Design | Spa Empire](http://spa-game.com/?p=5038)

When I think about this and [[Managerial One-Night Werewolf Commentary]] together, I realized that in a werewolf game, the human side is better off if they play honestly, but the werewolf side loses money. The human side has already revealed their human identity to the werewolf side, so there is no loss if they play honestly.
However, the position holders are not included.

Therefore, it is a game where position holders and werewolves fight.
If a villager honestly says, "I'm a villager," it gives the wolf a hint that there are able-bodied people left.
