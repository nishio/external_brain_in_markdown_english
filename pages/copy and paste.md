title: "copy and paste"

Select it and "Copy" will appear in the balloon menu.
- It is the selected object that is copied
- The object must not be affected by any edits made to it before pasting.
- As for copying stickies, I think it would be better to have a link to the reference source, but I reserve the right to do so.
- Implemented [[pRegroup-done-2020]].
- Paste adds it in the exact same position as you copied it, so you can say "Huh? Where?" you might say, "Where?

    - I implemented [[I want to use interesting things out of the test user's input.]] and it was one step away from copy and paste behavior.
- Just add a copy to [[Balloon Menu]].
- How do you menu the paste?
- After pasting, position and scale must be properly adjusted

- Copy and paste should be able to go into the clipboard and paste into other windows.
