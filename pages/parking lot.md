title: "parking lot"
---

>  In [[discussion]], a space set aside in a corner of a desk or whiteboard to temporarily hold off on a topic that is not deemed appropriate for discussion at this time. It is said to have the effect of avoiding confusion and unnecessary discussion. It is used to [[isolate]] off-topic topics, but when the discussion progresses, the topics reserved in the parking lot may be useful.

Using Jiro Kawakita's vocabulary, that's where you'd put [[ape]].
- Discussions in this period were [[voice communication]] where only one thing could be said at a time, so it was easy to miss the "[[might have something to do with it]]" that came from associations with the topic.
- Record it and keep it close by so you can use it later.
