title: "Four stages after lifting of the ban on double-duty"
---

- Stage 1:
    - Good to [[fully commit]] to the company
        - [[double-dealing]] = not fully committed to the company
    - I see duplication of work as a bad thing.
- Stage 2:
    - Experienced double-dealers bring a lot of things back to the company.
    - Increased awareness that "duplication of work benefits the company."
- Third stage:
    - Seeing the achievements of those with experience in compounding business accumulate, inexperienced people feel like they have to compound their own business too.
    - It has become an objective to do multiple jobs.
    - They are influenced by other people's values.
- Stage 4:
    - My main purpose in life is my life's purpose, and duplication of work is just one of the means to achieve it.
    - You can do multiple jobs or make a full commitment to the company,
    - It's your choice.
