The [[stench]] of [[the person]] who [[connects]].

> [HiroTHamadaJP](https://twitter.com/HiroTHamadaJP/status/1776886734137221603/history) I have an image of a person who connects people as a kind of a stinker, and I think I'm a stinker, too, but I'm like a person who connects people, too. I am like a person who connects people.

> [HiroTHamadaJP](https://twitter.com/HiroTHamadaJP/status/1776923084567793728) The reason for the stinker has recently been verbalized and will be written later.

>  The uncertainty of what is essentially new cannot be eliminated, so the stench remains.

> [HiroTHamadaJP](https://twitter.com/HiroTHamadaJP/status/1776967469145727387) I'm not sure how much to write,
>  It seems to me that if you have such a good sense of just making connections, you must have a proven track record.

>  If not, you basically smell like a stinker.

> [HiroTHamadaJP](https://twitter.com/HiroTHamadaJP/status/1776968273818788315) I think if you make it this far, you will be forgiven if you fail.

However, there is no clear agreement on the level of responsibility, and the amount of connecting activities by "M, who estimates the responsibility low," is relatively higher than that of others.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1777173839535100196) When there is some kind of trouble, "M" who estimates the responsibility of credit low says, "I only introduced him, so I had nothing to do with it. From the point of view of the party who suffered the loss, it looks like a scammer. Which interpretation is correct is not divisible by 0/1, so the difference in gray density causes trouble.

AI is useful for a nice blurring of specific cases...<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>List cases 1-4 again and give a brief bulleted list of lessons learned from each case. Blur out any details that are unnecessary to the lessons learned.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>
Case 1: The
- When intermediary M introduced supplier S to consumer D, S engaged in inappropriate conduct toward D. M made the introduction without conducting sufficient research on S. M introduced supplier S to consumer D without conducting sufficient research on S. S did not conduct sufficient research on D. M introduced supplier S to consumer D without conducting sufficient research on D. M did not conduct sufficient research on D.
- Lesson learned:.
    - Intermediaries should fully investigate the background of the person they are introducing.
    - Intermediaries should only refer trusted partners.
    - We should carefully examine our motives for approaching someone with no track record.

Case 2: The
- Intermediary M learned that consumer D was interested in a new idea and introduced supplier S, who had knowledge in the area, to D. D and S hit it off, but M failed to follow up.
- Lesson learned:.
    - Intermediary should follow up after referral
        - What happens if it is not done?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - Damage to trust: If the intermediary is indifferent to progress after a referral, he or she will lose the trust of both parties referred. As a result, the intermediary's reputation is damaged and opportunities for future referrals are reduced.
            - Loss of feedback opportunities: If they are not aware of progress after referrals, they lose the opportunity to learn about the success or failure of the collaboration and its challenges. Makes it difficult for intermediaries to grow themselves and improve their referral skills.
            - Limited use of the network: Because it ends with an introduction and does not get involved in subsequent development, the potential value of the intermediary's own network is not fully exploited.
    - Initial rapport does not always lead to results.

Case 3: The
- Intermediary M1 introduced supplier S to consumer D as an expert, and S took advantage of D's ignorance to enter into an improper contract. Victim D consulted a third party, who in turn consulted another intermediary, M2, who deemed this behavior inappropriate and provided feedback to M1, resulting in the perpetrator S's exclusion from the community.
- Lesson learned:.
    - Intermediaries should vet the expertise and personality of the referring party.
    - The intermediary should confirm the contents of the executed contract.
    - Third parties consulted by the victim should consult the appropriate intermediary.
    - Coordination and feedback among intermediaries enables problem solving

Case 4: The
- A third party T publicly referred to the collaboration between D and S as a good example based on partial information that a meeting between D and S was set up by M. In reality, only one meeting was held and no collaboration took place.
- Lesson learned:.
    - Hasty evaluations based on partial information are misleading.
    - Third party T has been involved in propagating a track record that doesn't exist as a result.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - This could be called "[[a]] piece of fraud," depending on the circumstances.
