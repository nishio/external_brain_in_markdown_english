title: "Should we understand the meaning of the sutras?"
---

> Also, even if you do not understand the meaning of the title or the sutra, the merit of [[the practice]] does not change.
>  For example, even if you do not understand the meaning of a foreign language, if you pronounce it correctly, people who understand foreign languages can understand it. In the same way, the title "[[Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo]]" and the sutras we recite in our daily prayers are "words" that can be understood in the Buddhist world. What is important is the heart that believes in the Gohonzon and the heart that praises and laments it.
- [Why do you read the Dharma Prayers and the Jujitsu?

This is a [[not for me]] way of thinking.
    - [[Mahayana Buddhism]] I think it's okay to say, "It's important to have faith.
    - I want to believe that, and those who can believe that should believe that.
    - Not for me.
- I value [[understanding]], so I have a strong resistance to "you don't have to understand"
    - from  [[Sanyuttha Nikaya 6.1.1]]
        - >  [[Trying to make those who don't understand understand create suffering.]]
    - I think it comes down to this.
    - I'm going down the hard [[self-training]] road of "understanding", but others can follow or not!
- Conclusion: "don't need to understand" for everyone, "should understand" for me
