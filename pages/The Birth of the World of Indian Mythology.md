title: "The Birth of the World of Indian Mythology"

from  [[Create" and "Born."]]

## Rig Veda's "Naasdhya Sukta" (Hymn to the Origin of the Universe)
- At the time, there was neither existence nor non-existence." It is stated that "darkness covered darkness," and at first nothing was settled and chaotic.
- It is said that the world developed as a result of the "heat (tapas)" and "desire" that sprouted from there.
- The emphasis is on "spontaneous generation" from a primordial force, rather than the "creation" of the world by a definite personal God.

## Cosmic Egg ([[Hiranyagarbha]]), Brahmananda
- In the concept of Hiranyagarbha ("golden fetus" or "golden egg"), the story goes that a golden egg first appeared as the root of the universe, from which the gods and the world were born.
- These images of "the world = spontaneously arising from inside the egg" also speak of the flow of a "fundamental force" rather than an "intentional creator" that gave birth to the world.

## Cyclical view of the universe
- In Hinduism, Brahma creates, Vishnu maintains, and Shiva destroys, which is also premised on a cyclical worldview that repeats itself endlessly.
- Although the beginning of a cycle appears to be "creation," it is often seen as an "inevitable rhythm" rather than "God's will" for the world to unfold.

- Summary

- Indian mythology has a strong "generative" color, with the spontaneous generation of the world from primordial chaos (darkness, emptiness, heat, etc.) or the cracking of a cosmic egg to give birth to the world.
