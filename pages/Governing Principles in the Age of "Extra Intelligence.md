In this way, people will contribute to governance through "connection and care" rather than "smarts.
By removing intelligence from the leading role, governance will naturally shift to a threefold cycle of [[decentralization]], [[cooperation]], and [[inclusion]] - that is the basic form of the [[post-intelligence era]].

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Explain why this is.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3/icon' alt='o3.icon' height="19.5"/>To summarize the process.
- 1: [[Commoditization of intelligence]] by AI
- 2: Centralization and single value axis cannot handle environmental changes and diverse interests
- 3: Multiple centers x multiple values x multiple entities will inevitably emerge
- 4: Human role = weaving networks and circulating [[mutual care]].

In a word.
- In [[an intelligence-plumbed world]], the [[governance bottleneck]] will not be information processing but "[[relationship care]]. The key to solving this problem is [[multi-centered]], [[multi-valued]], [[multi-entity]] + care.

A note that o3 said something like that.
- There is a feeling that he is speaking inspired by [[Plurality]] and does not seem to have a clear basis for his predictions.
    - I'm starting to feel the danger of a filter bubble because my ChatGPT is getting more and more tainted with the Plurality context because of ChatGPT's memory feature.
    - Use [[local GPT]] occasionally or
