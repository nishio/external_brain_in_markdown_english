title: 'Aversion to the label "old".'

I think you have too many "unpleasant feelings (e.g. hatred, disgust, revulsion, fear) toward the label [[the old]]". (Note: It was pointed out to me that

- [[problems caused by the elderly (esp. gerontocracy, and elderly people's control over the young)]] is valid only when the following two points are compatible
- It's actually harmful.
- It is significantly concentrated in the aged

Simply because the old man is more prominent doesn't mean he's as harmful as he could be.
