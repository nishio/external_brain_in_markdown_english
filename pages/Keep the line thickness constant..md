- Until now, a path of constant width was written, independent of zoom.
    - Lines get thinner when zoomed out.
- Path Thickness
    - Selection enclosure, dotted line spacing, movement speed
    - Path smoothing units
- If it's a physical paper metaphor, the apparent line thickness will be thicker when zoomed in.
    - But toolbars, etc. naturally remain the same size, independent of zoom.
    - Which is closer to the thickness of the drawn line

- Line thickness should correspond to screen zoom
    - Now when I zoom in, the lines get thicker.
    - Same for the dotted line of lasso selection.
