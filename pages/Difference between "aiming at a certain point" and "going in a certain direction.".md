title: 'Difference between "aiming at a certain point" and "going in a certain direction."'
---

> [ina_ani](https://twitter.com/ina_ani/status/1410158756495650817?s=21) I feel that it is easier to do things when I stop "have an eye on a point [[have an eye on]]" and change to "advance [[advance]] in a [[direction]]" method. I feel that it has become easier to do many things.

When you are aiming for a certain point P, all the way until you reach it, "who is not P."
When you're going in one direction X, the whole time you're "the one going in direction X."

> If you try to get there with a distant goal of "this is how I want to be," it is sad that you cannot affirm the status quo when things don't go well.
>  I think it would be happier to find and affirm the happiness and goodness in the current situation, and then act to go from that standard to a state that is one step BETTER.

    - [[have an eye on]]
    - [[Target]]

    - Sometimes [you need to go in one direction, but not if you only go in one direction.
