- > [[sense of beauty without power]] hates [[intelligence]] because it demands what it cannot do, but it is the life of [[spirit]] that endures death and sustains itself in death, not the life that avoids death and keeps itself pure from desolation. The life of [[spirit]] is not the life that avoids death and keeps itself clean from desolation.
- > The spirit acquires [[truth]] precisely because it places itself in the [[absolute division]].
- > The spirit does not demonstrate knowledge by turning away from the negative and becoming a mass of affirmations.
- > It is precisely by [[Facing the Negative]] and staying with it that the spirit is powerful.
- > While remaining there, the magic power to turn negativity into existence is born.

- The so-called "[[Hegel's dialectic]]" idea.
    - The word [[dialectics]] itself is not used by Hegel.
- By facing and staying with the negative rather than ignoring it, a reversal to existence occurs.
