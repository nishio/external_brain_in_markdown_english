Contract reading comprehension questions with no prerequisite knowledge required
- A: If Company Y receives a lawful disclosure of the same information from Company Z, then Company Y has no further obligation of confidentiality
    - →× 1-4 says "acquired legally from a third party without following confidentiality obligations", so if there is an NDA with Company Z, it is NG.
- d: If the disclosure was made by court order, and Company X was notified in advance, Company Y is not obligated to maintain confidentiality thereafter.
    - →×
        - It does say to give prior notice of any court-ordered disclosure.
        - It doesn't say that this would remove the duty of confidentiality.
        - 1-5 Does the information fall under the category of "information for which written consent to disclose has been obtained from the disclosing party"?
            - I don't. Because you have only "given notice" and not "received consent".
        - 1-3 Does it fall under "became public knowledge through no fault of either A or B"?
            - Is there any attribution for the court ordered?
            - I wonder if court-ordered disclosure means "not public knowledge because it was secretly shown to the court" or "made public knowledge".
