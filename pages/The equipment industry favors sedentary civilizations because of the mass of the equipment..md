succession
- Equipment (industrial) industries require large machinery and equipment, and these machines and equipment are generally heavy and difficult to move. For this reason, equipment industries are advantageous for a sedentary civilization.
- In a sedentary civilization, cities and towns form, people gather, and labor becomes available. In addition, infrastructure and logistics systems develop, facilitating the transportation of resources and products. These factors promote industrial development.
- On the other hand, nomads have a lifestyle of moving around without settling down, making it difficult for them to carry large industrial facilities with them. Therefore, nomads were mainly engaged in economic activities that allowed them to live on the move, such as raising livestock and hunting and gathering.

- [[Expansion of group size due to population agglomeration]] is important.
