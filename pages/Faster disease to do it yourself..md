- The book describes the "do-it-yourself disease" as a condition in which people think it is faster to do things themselves because they "don't know how to delegate," "can't come up with satisfactory quality," or "don't have time to teach.
- In a presentation by someone who has been through a [[LoanDEAL]] transfer, he talked about how he realized his lack of [[Engulfing force]], and he realized he lacked the ability to get involved as well.
    - I was lucky enough to be surrounded by people who were "very involved, smart enough to choose the right themes to get involved in and have a long-term perspective that didn't try to exploit me in the short term," and while I was dabbling, things [[being swept up in]] came to this.
    - In fact, going to a LoanDEAL event is itself involved in the [[hydroxyl radical]].
- I bought the book because I felt bad when I saw the expression "As the disease progresses [[Lonely and successful]]" on the book's description page.

Two ways, "It's faster if I do it myself."
- I can do it faster because I can do it better than those around me.
- I don't know how to ask for help, and it's faster to do it myself than to worry about how to ask for help.

    - [[The more work you take on, the less room you have for it.]]
- Affirm yourself by blaming others and the environment for why things don't work out.
- The members we have now are the best members, there is no "if someone better comes along" etc.
- The phrase "I can't ask because I'm too reserved" is just a fancy way of saying "[[discretion]]," but it means that "a relationship of trust has not been established.
        - If you have a [[relationship of mutual trust]], "Can you please?" "Okay/it's a little difficult right now" shouldn't be difficult.

- Four Happinesses
    - To be loved by others.
    - Being praised by others
    - Helping people
    - To be needed by others.

Doing "work for your own praise" only tickles your self-esteem.

- It's [[selfishness]] to think, "It's faster if I do it myself."
    - Tend to get intoxicated with [[the pose of altruism]], saying "I'm working so hard" when they have their own work to do.
        - [[Teach them to fish, not give them fish.]]
        - There are two kinds of acts of giving.
        - The act of giving fish is, in the long run, "If you don't give fish, your hunger will not be satisfied."
        - Short-term satisfaction of having "done it
        - So "act of giving" but "selfishness."

- Three Misconceptions about "Delegating
    - What you entrust to us comes back to you [[with the expected results]].
        - That's not true.
        - The basic premise is that failure and results that do not meet expectations are returned.
        - It's funny that "I can't trust him because he might fail."
    - Leave it to me = Throw it all in my hands
        - That is only if the other party is a professional who has grown to a level where it is safe to throw the whole thing away.
        - In the majority of cases, you will be left in charge but remain "ready to help if the need arises".
    - Delegate to make your job easier, delegate to make your job easier.
        - That's after they've grown up enough.
        - The goal to be reached in the future by "delegating.
        - For those who are not delegating now, in the short term, delegating will create more work.

The "boss's dilemma" that every manager faces.
- That we must bear both "short-term results" and "medium- to long-term results."
- Medium- to long-term results = growth of oneself and one's surroundings

    - [[Failure is an opportunity for growth]]

Delegate authority informally.
- How to deal with organizations where it is difficult to formally promote and empower people with no track record
- Delegation of authority to informal on your own initiative.
- After the results are achieved, persuade them on a performance basis by saying, "Actually, he is the one who achieved these results.
- Giving opportunities to those who can't, so they can become people who can. This is education.
    - But not just anyone.
    - Responsibility and trust
    - Give them a job that is a little harder and judge them by their work performance.

Don't try to make copies of yourself.
- I tend to think that the way I have experienced success in the past is the right way.
- I tend to say it like I'm tracing my own way.
- It's a robotic job from the other person's point of view, "I'm being told to do as I'm told.
- 'If you're going to give me the job, let me do it my way, otherwise I'm out of this job.'
- Stifle the urge to meddle.
    - Or tweeting, "What I'm about to tell you is a soliloquy, so you'll have to decide for yourself whether you want to adopt it or not."
    - Balance between push and pull. Don't push too hard, you will have 100 things you want to say, but say only 3.
    - Don't say everything that comes to mind, but only what is really important right now, once you have accumulated it.
    - It is important to give yourself the ability to make this choice.

PDCA cycle
- D to keep myself out of it.
- Inevitably, it will be weighted to the rest.

They don't come to me for advice when I say, "Let me know if you need anything."
- I would set up a time for the interview, maybe a meal, coffee, etc.

Assumption that "the work is too complex to outsource."
- Difficult because they try to make a 100-point manual.
- Create a 70-point manual.
    - For example, a list of minimum things to check

At this time, it was implicitly assumed that the subject of "leave it to me" was a human being.
With the evolution of LLM and the emergence of [[Devin.ai]], which operates autonomously, the "leave it to me" partner has become AI.
Many have also come to experience the perspective of the "delegator."

The "do-it-yourself disease," as this book points out, refers to a condition in which people avoid delegating and involving others and hold onto work, resulting in lost growth opportunities and isolation. The main points are as follows

- I don't know how to trust them and hold on to them
    - They tend to take on tasks on their own for reasons such as "I don't have time to teach them" or "I'm afraid I'll leave it to them and they'll fail.
- Between short-term and medium- to long-term results
    - Managers and leaders need to balance immediate results with the growth of the team as a whole. Delegating provides opportunities for growth, but in the short term, it rather increases one's own workload.
- Failure tolerance and trust building
    - Instead of "throwing it all away," create a system to help when the need arises, and allow failures to lead to growth. If there is a relationship of trust, both parties can "ask" and "refuse" without any difficulty.
- The illusion of selfishness and altruism
    - It is actually selfishness to hold on to the idea that "it would be faster if I did it myself." It is important to have the perspective of "teaching people how to fish, not giving them fish.
- I don't make copies of myself.
    - Respecting the other person's way of doing things and ideas leads to independence and growth. Don't say everything, but strike a balance between push and pull.
- Informal delegation of authority
    - Even when it is difficult to officially promote someone in an organization, there are ways to persuade others on a performance basis.

New consideration: the emergence of the "leave it" perspective to AI (LLM) and autonomous agents.
In recent years, with the spread of LLMs (large-scale language models) and agents that operate autonomously (e.g., Devin.ai), there are more and more situations where AI is entrusted with areas that were previously considered to be "left to humans. This creates the following new challenges and possibilities.

- Cost to teach and design
    - Instead of "guidance" and "failure care" when delegating tasks to humans, inputs to AI (instructions and prompt design) are important. The point that results will fall short of expectations if the settings are incorrect is similar to the failure when leaving the task to humans.
- Interaction between learning and growth
    - By leaving it to AI, humans can concentrate on more advanced creative areas. On the other hand, the process of evaluating and improving AI output also leads to learning on the human side.
- Change in "it's faster to do it yourself" thinking
    - When AI can perform a large amount of work in a short time, it is highly likely that human "it would be faster to do it myself" will no longer necessarily be true. On the contrary, new concerns such as "risk of entrusting results" and "risk of information leakage" need to be addressed.
- Not a trust relationship, but "[[a]] design of trust."
    - Even when dealing with AI, "how to trust" is an issue. Although emotional trust is not as important as between humans, it is important to create a mechanism (model selection, prompt optimization, security, etc.) to continuously return correct results, so to speak, as a "design for trust.

In the future, the "do-it-yourself is faster disease" will appear not only in the relationships between people, but also in the way people entrust AI. The key to medium- to long-term growth will be the ability to invest in "learning costs" for involving and utilizing AI, rather than focusing only on short-term results.
