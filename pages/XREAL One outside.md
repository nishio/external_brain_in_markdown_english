The screen drifts in the fixed space mode due to lateral acceleration when accelerating and decelerating, so it is necessary to use the mode to fix the screen against the view. The apparent size of the screen is about the width of two or three seats across from each other.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1883375750600106347) I originally carried an A4-sized iPad 12.9" with an emphasis on large screens, and I use it to view PDFs on the train, but I hold it up in front of me It's about the size of an iPad. In reality, holding up an iPad is hard on my hands, so I have to look down, which puts a strain on my neck, but with XREAL, it's right in front of my eyes, so there's no strain.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1883376263173390845) When connecting to an iPad, isn't it difficult to see the operation at hand? I was concerned about this, but when it comes to scrolling PDFs vertically, I don't have to look at my hand to operate the device. This was a realization after actually trying it. On the other hand, I think I need pen tab skills to do hand-drawn illustrations.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1883376741936480340) Since the intended screen size is not the height of an A4 PDF, if you try to put a page on the screen page by page, the width will be reduced due to the height limitation. If you want to display a page on the screen in pages, the width of the page will be smaller than the height. If you want to scroll continuously vertically, you can enlarge it to the full width, so it is more compatible for that kind of use.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1883376918445330464) By the way, the PDF of the book was cut and scanned and placed in a dropbox, and the dropbox had the book locally in offline mode. The dropbox was in offline mode and the book was stored locally, so I could instantly experience reading the book on its immersive big screen without the need for an Internet connection.

It feels unsafe to I did it on a bench.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1883378173209202999) Conversely, considering the fact that using an iPad or PC in this brightly lit park tends to result in "not being able to see at all", being able to block out the background allows one to see properly, I think it might be useful when working digitally outside. It is too cold now to work for a long period of time. It's also nice to be able to see outside with one touch without completely blocking the view.
