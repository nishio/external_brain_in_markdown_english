title: "What is not important follows the AI."

- [[important]] What is not is subject to AI.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1878535865129148669) Just like [[Steve Jobs]] always wore the same clothes because he "didn't want to waste [[decision-making]] energy on useless things", I think we will let AI decide and follow the decisions that don't seem so important among the various decisions in our lives. Meta-decisions about what to make and what not to make will become more important.

[[AI follows]].
[[What's important]]
