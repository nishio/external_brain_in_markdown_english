title: "Accuracy first, not speed"
---

- I was listening to [[Kazuhiro Shiozawa]]'s explanation of how to remember [[thumb shift]] and found it interesting, so I wrote it down.
- learning musical instruments
    - You can pull it off fast, but it won't be a proper song if it's full of mistakes.
    - First of all, it is important not to make mistakes
    - Once you can do it without making mistakes, you'll get faster as you repeat it.

- [[Accuracy.]] #Speed #Faster than [high speed
