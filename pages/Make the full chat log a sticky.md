title: "Make the full chat log a sticky"
---

When converting chat logs to stickies, there should be a sticky containing the entirety of each post

Ensure "Worst case scenario, if you look at this, you have all the information."
- Prevent the fear that information may be lost due to poor quality mechanical conversion
- Eliminates the action of going back and forth between chat logs and Regroup to compare them.
    - Inconvenient to compare multiple screens.
- You can easily create a new sticky by cutting out a part of that long text with [[✅Multi-line import dialog with sticky click]].

demerit
- the Japanese writing becomes finer.
    - I can't read it as it is.
        - but on the Regroup you can zoom in and read
        - No real harm done.

The "full text of responses" on the far right is naturally more detailed, but on the Regroup, you can zoom in and read it, and by ensuring that "worst-case scenario, this is all the information you need," you will not have to worry about losing information, or go back and forth between the chat log and the Regroup to compare them.

It's too long to read as is, but you can read it if you zoom in, and the inclusion of the raw chat logs frees you from the fear that information will be lost due to the poor quality of the mechanical conversion.
