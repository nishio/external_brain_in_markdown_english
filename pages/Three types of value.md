title: "Three types of value"

Three kinds of value.
- Value stored in me.
- Value stored in others
- Value stored outside the human


## [[Value stored outside the human]]
- This is the easiest "thing" to recognize.
- Money is a prime example.
    - [[monetary capital]]  /  [[monetary asset]]  /  [[monetary reward]]  /  [[financial capital]]
- Stocks, real estate, options, copyrights, patents, contracts (= claims), etc.

## [[Value stored in me]]
- Typical examples are "[[knowledge]]" and "[[skill]]".
    - [[knowledge capital]] / [[intellectual capital]] / [[human capital]]
- Originally accumulated as craftsmanship among artisans [[technetium (Teknay)]].
    - [[Difficult-to-distribute resources]] / [[Difficult-to-transfer resources]]
- The use of the word "knowledge" has created an ambiguity as to what "knowledge" is in the first place.
    - How is knowledge different from [[wisdom]] or [[information]] or [[data]]?"
- Unlike money, it is "[[value stored in humans]]" and cannot be easily circulated, and this is the value of distinguishing and discussing it.
- For example, when you want to count the number of elements in a list in Python, people with low skills start writing for statements.
    - A skilled person can instantly remember and use it, saying, "There is something called Counter in the collections module of the standard Python library that does exactly what it says it does.
    - This skill was acquired by "having read the Python library reference" and is not easily transferable, so it was considered a skill.
        - [[investment of time]] and [[experience]] will be earned by
    - As of 2024, if you say to ChatGPT, "I want to count the number of times what elements are in a list in Python," it will say, "To count the number of times each element appears in a list in Python, you can use the Counter class in the collections module. The following is a concrete example:<code>" and it returns
    - In other words, it is no longer a "hard-to-transfer skill" because it can now be easily transferred.
- IT engineers have too strong a mental model of "acquisition by reading publicly available information".
    - Especially those who were active between 2000 and 2023 have the successful experience that "there is no information in Japanese, but you can understand it by reading the original documents in English, and by reading English documents, you can learn more than other players in Japan and have a competitive advantage".
    - I think the advent of ChatGPT has extensively disrupted this winning pattern, because if you ask a question in Japanese, the AI will answer it based on the English documentation.
    - Later historians might consider this to have been a unique phenomenon of the last quarter century.
    - In [[Gossett's]] time, knowledge was secret and not circulated.
- In the coming period, the acquisition of confidential information may account for a higher percentage of "[Value stored in me.
- A "I did this" "[[track record]]" is also a resource that is difficult to relocate and stored within you.

## [[Value stored in others]]
- 「 [[trust]] 」「 [[degree of familiarity]] 」「 [[reputation]] 」
    - [[SOC]]  /  [[SOC]]
- "[[Value stored in a human being]]," and since it's not you, you can't directly take the action of accumulation.
- I was going to write this page because I was trying to say something like, "If someone X does something that undermines trust and then asks me to [[introduce]] such a person, and I introduce someone Y to X, and X does something that undermines trust in Y, then Y's trust in me will also be undermined, and if [[the expectation value of trust creation]] is not positive, then the trade won't happen. If the [[expected value of trust creation]] is not positive, the trade will not happen, right?
- The reverse is also true: those who behave in a [[positive-sum]] way will be handed this kind of capital in abundance and for free just by living a normal life, while [[negative-sum]] people will not be able to acquire it [[difficult-to-procure resources]] even if they piled up a lot of money.
    - Well, as for "[[you can't get it with a lot of money]]," I can't say that it's true, since it's now possible to become a member of a celebrity's salon and gain recognition from the celebrity or to gain visibility within the salon.
    - It appears that there are a very few who understand the composition and take advantage of it [[whether for good or ill use]], and a few who don't understand and are called "[[endowments]]" who offer their money.
    - I have not had a chance to look inside the paid celebrity salon in detail, so my impression is a bit vague.


Accelerated acquisition effect from any resource to any resource
- This means that if a path can be created that has an acceleration effect, [[exponential development]] will occur, so it's an easy phenomenon to identify.
