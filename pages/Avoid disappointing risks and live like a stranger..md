title: "Avoid disappointing risks and live like a stranger."

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/60488305162207232?s=21&t=xAfnDP_xPg85aAyLqTv8Qw): if you don't [[expect]], you don't [[feel disappointed]]. But if you don't have expectations, you won't take action. Which is [[It's a Wonderful Life]], [[Live your life as if it were someone else's]] with [[Avoid disappointment risk]] and no active action, or [[Active Action]] with expectation of good results and sometimes disappointment? Wonderful Life]? I prefer the latter.
