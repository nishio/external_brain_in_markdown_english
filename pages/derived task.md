- Letting AI Create Task Lists
- Do Task 1.
- Task 1 spawned derivative tasks 1-2.
- Should I do task 2 or task 1-2 at this time?

- New tasks (1-2) derived from Task 1 are additional tasks on the same stream
    - Efficient when processed consecutively because the context is inherited
    - If Task 2 is independent, it is better to complete 1-2 once and then move to Task 2 to reduce switching costs
- However, if Task 2 is a higher priority, then it follows the priority by suspending 1-2. Basis.
    - Do not break the flow of derived tasks by processing them as they are.
    - Prioritize high-priority tasks, if any
- Two points to consider are

- [[depth first search (search algorithm in AI)]]
    - [[digging deeper]]
- [[in depth]]

- [[context switching]]
- [[Switching costs]]
