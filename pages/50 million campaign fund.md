[Former Governor Inose: "50 Million Yen is Election Funds," Pays 500,000 Yen Fine and Apologizes - Nihon Keizai Shimbun](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXNZO69070670Z20C14A3CC1000/)
> According to the indictment, on November 20, 2012, before running for governor, Inose allegedly borrowed 50 million yen in cash from Torao Tokuda, 76, former chairman of Tokushukai, through Takeshi Tokuda, 42, a former member of the House of Representatives, as campaign funds, but failed to include the amount in his campaign expense balance report.

Assuming it's true that he borrowed the 50 million, it's important to know if it's on his campaign expense statement.

If you perceive your opponent as an enemy, you will immediately try to spread information that seems unfavorable to them, without stopping to consider whether it is really true.
If you do that, you get the boomerang of "I guess they just want to attack without any desire to look closely.

>  Of course, if it's within the upper limit, no problem. But if you look at the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications data (2019) how much the upper limit is, Tokyo is 59,250,000.
>  50 million in loans from the business community.
>  Isn't he a fine politician?

I see, so the reason for the 50 million debt is because the legal campaign limit is 59.25 million.

> [sasasanosasayan](https://x.com/sasasanosasayan/status/1806353708802052353) According to Shukan Shincho, Shinji Ishimaru's ketomo, Doutor Toba, gave 1.5 million yen in personal donations, plus 1,000 yen in loans plus 40 million yen from New Business 40 million yen from the New Business Council
>  A loan looks like a loan, but if you don't charge interest and reschedule the repayment date permanently, it's as good as given.
>  It's starting to look like a relationship between an independent-minded hostess and a patron (laughs).

>  >yuyawatase: Ishimaru is terrible. During the press conference, when the reporter asked about the loan, he did not answer about the more than 50 million yen loan related to the founder of Doutor, but just talked about personal donations and misled the audience. Worst politician ever. Video evidence is below (must watch from 57:40)

> [YuhsukeTakenaka](https://x.com/YuhsukeTakenaka/status/1806670674884538426) It's a legitimate money loan agreement made privately, so it's not illegal and there's nothing to be guilty of. Do you understand what this means?
>  Please use social common sense.

> [yuyawatase](https://x.com/yuyawatase/status/1806712026540171560) Since political donations are capped at 1.5 million yen, the candidate loaned 50 million yen to give more money (and the candidate himself hid it).
>  The act of doing so is usually a guilty one.
>  Loans are more influential than donations, and the amount is 30 times greater.

> [kon8207](https://x.com/kon8207/status/1806718995808362727) What did you borrow such a large amount of money against?

> [namimasa_P](https://x.com/namimasa_P/status/1806953529527128509) four years of the Governor's original annual salary plus maturity severance pay, totaling about 15,000,000
>  If the halving of the governor's annual salary that Yuriko had implemented were to continue, the total would be about 92 million.
>  I guess that means that even if you put this much money in the bank and return it to the goose, you still get something in return (stick).

> [tesgo365](https://x.com/tesgo365/status/1806902901513789921) Borrowing money is fine, but from whom? And for what? is the important thing.
>  If the Tokyo New Business Council is an organization that doesn't contract work from the local government, there's no problem, because the company Inose rented from is a major hospital related to the local government.
>  So I guess he needs to answer what he borrowed it for.

I see.
So a $50 million debt is affected by the lender.
