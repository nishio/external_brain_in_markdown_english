Bourdieu's (2012) point of view explains the phenomenon that as long as a national unit is composed of diverse cultural groups, the dominant culture is taught as the "legitimate culture" in order to integrate them. This perspective can be summarized as follows:
1. diversity and the need for integration
    - Presence of diverse cultural groups
        - Different hierarchies, regions, and languages have different values and cultures among the people.
        - Examples: rural vs. urban, elite vs. workers, minority language vs. official language.
    - Common infrastructure for integration
        - A "common culture" or set of values shared by the people is necessary for the management of a nation.
        - Therefore, the culture of the ruling class is positioned as the "legitimate culture" and disseminated through education and the media.
2. legitimization of the dominant culture
    - Dominant culture as cultural capital
        - Bourdieu argued that the dominant culture is considered the "legitimate culture" and that individuals gain "cultural capital" by mastering it.
        - This cultural capital contributes to the improvement of social status and the reproduction of power structures.
    - Spreading culture through education
        - The content taught in schooling (language, history, literature, etc.) is based on the dominant culture.
        - E.g., mastery of the standard language, emphasis on national identity.
    - Dress as "universality
        - The dominant culture is presented as "universal and legitimate for all" and is positioned as superior to other cultures.
3. the problems behind cultural integration
    - Suppression of cultural diversity
        - The dominant culture is considered "legitimate," while other cultures (minority and local cultures) tend to be marginalized and neglected.
        - Example: disappearance of minority languages and dialects.
    - class reproduction
        - Teaching the dominant culture as "orthodox" puts those who do not have that culture (working class and rural people) at a disadvantage.
        - Educational outcomes depend on the availability of cultural capital, not on individual ability.
4. application to modern society
    - Globalization and Cultural Competition
        - As globalization continues to transcend national boundaries, the criteria for which culture is considered "legitimate" are wavering.
        - Example: While English is positioned as the international "orthodox" culture, the challenge is how to protect the cultural diversity of each country.
    - Changes in the Digital Age
        - The Internet and social networking sites have facilitated the spread of values and cultures other than the dominant culture.
        - E.g., local cultures and minority voices are globally communicated.
5. balance between integration and diversity
    - While keeping Bourdieu's point in mind, modern society requires a balance between
    - Redefining legitimate culture:.
        - An approach that positions multiple cultures as "legitimate" in an inclusive manner, not just the dominant culture.
    - Respect for Diversity:.
        - Recognize the value of diverse cultural groups in education and policy.
        - Examples: multilingual education, preservation of local culture.

This book analyzes the reproduction of the ruling class in France through elite educational institutions ([[grandes écoles]]) and the role of culture and education in maintaining power.

Bourdieu points out that the educational system contributes to the reproduction of social stratification by teaching the dominant culture as the "legitimate culture." His theory discusses how education maintains and reinforces social inequality through the concepts of cultural capital and symbolic violence.

Bourdieu's work on the sociology of education also aims to clarify the action of symbolic power in the educational world, and the action of power in educational endeavors is analyzed from the symbolic and cultural aspects.

These references will help you better understand Bourdieu's theory on education and how the dominant culture is reproduced through education.
