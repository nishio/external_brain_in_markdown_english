title: "Knowledge obsolescence and teaching poses"
---

There are more and more people with age and position who adopt the pose, "I have a lot of knowledge and I'm a [[Teachers]] person," but when they adopt that pose, [[New Knowledge]] doesn't come in.
And [[knowledge becomes obsolete]], so if no new knowledge is coming in, then more and more knowledge is being lost. [[Maintaining the status quo is a step backward]].
- In order to avoid [[aging population combined with the elderly]], we may have to maintain the attitude of "[[I don't know]], [[I want to know]]" at any age.

- [[Knowledge obsolescence]]
- [[teaching position]]
- [[curiosity]]

relevance
    - [[Taught by people with a lot of knowledge.]]
    - [[Updating knowledge is more burdensome than learning new things.]]
