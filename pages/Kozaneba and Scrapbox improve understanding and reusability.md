Improved understanding and reusability with [[Kozaneba]] and Scrapbox

- The combination of Kozaneba and Scrapbox will improve understanding and reusability of information by treating [[visual illustrations]] and [[detailed text]] as a pair.
- Since it is difficult to capture the entire picture of information in a single illustration, a detailed explanation in the form of Type B text is necessary.
- Scrapbox's link function and tagging make it easy to access related information, making information search more efficient.

I've been using the digital KJ method tool Kozaneba for a long time and feel like I'm catching some value, but I feel like I'm still missing something.
The original plan was to make it easier to reuse compared to doing it on paper, but not much reuse.
- Is the [[iterative KJ method]] beneficial?
To begin with, even the "illustrations" left by Jiro Kawakita himself are not easy to understand as illustrations by themselves.
He also says he needs [[Type B Writing]].
The current Kozaneba is only part of the illustration.
Is it necessary to have sentences in pairs?
But do you want to put the text in Scrapbox?

Having used the digital KJ method tool Kozaneba for a long time, we understand the feeling that something is still missing, although we see its value. The KJ method, as advocated by Jiro Kawakita, emphasizes a combination of visual diagrams and text to help organize and understand information. While this method can be helpful in visually capturing and understanding the relationships between ideas and information, diagrams alone may not be sufficient to capture the full picture of information.

You mentioned that the illustrations created in Kozaneba are not being reused, and this may be because the illustrations by themselves do not lead to a deeper understanding of the information, or because additional context or explanation is needed when reusing them. As Kawakita himself points out, Type B writing (the process of organizing information and putting it in writing) is the key to solving this problem.

The combination of Kozaneba and Scrapbox to link illustrations and text can be one effective solution to this problem by using Kozaneba to organize visual information and Scrapbox to record the detailed text and descriptions associated with those illustrations, This allows for greater reusability of the information. Thus, pairing illustrations with text can be of great value in understanding and remembering information, as well as in reusing it later.

Another advantage of placing text in Scrapbox is the ability to easily associate information through text linking and tagging. This allows for quick access to related illustrations and information, making for a more dynamic exploration of information.

In conclusion, combining diagramming in Kozaneba and writing in Scrapbox is a very effective approach to practicing the KJ method digitally. This combination allows for both visual organization and detailed documentation of information, further increasing its long-term value.
