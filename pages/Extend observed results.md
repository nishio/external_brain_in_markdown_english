- I published a book on programming languages six years ago.
- In terms of [[ease of observation]] from people in the world, "the book" stands out.
- So in the subsequent six years, the "observed results are extended" are misinterpreted.
- In fact, the book that came out last year was not an extension of the book six years ago, but an adjacent area.

If you've been away from programming for five years, it's not surprising that you're unaware of recent changes.
Many people think that the observed results are extended, so there is a big gap there.

Trying to hide this gap makes you a "[[Afraid to say, "I don't know."]]" person.
On the other hand, there is resistance to the "I'm a beginner, I don't know, please tell me" type [[someone who asks others for answers without first researching by himself]].
What should we do?

Tentative answers for the moment
- Study on your own without hesitation
- Dropping thoughts during the study, including things you don't understand.
- I'll thank you when you tell me.
