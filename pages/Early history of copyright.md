title: "Early history of copyright"
---

Even if it is decided that "works created by automatic work generators" are not copyrightable at this time, copyright itself is a right that "was not originally managed, but was recognized because it became necessary," so a new right to protect "works created by automatic work generators" will be created again. A new right to protect "works created by an automatic work generator" will be created.
In such cases, it has not yet been determined whether the right belongs to "the person who put the idea into the device" or to "the owner of the device" or "the developer of the device," and in the current situation where the law has not been established, it will be determined by contract and power relations.
