title: "The salon you can get in for money is a low hurdle."

- [[Closed community]] is sometimes called "[[inner circle]]" or "[[sarong]]",
- The [[sarong]], where [[eligibility]] is based on payment of [[cash]], is a relatively low hurdle.
Many closed communities have more hurdles or [[entrances are]] not open to the public.

If you try to get into a university, there is an entrance exam; if you try to get into a company, there is an interview.
