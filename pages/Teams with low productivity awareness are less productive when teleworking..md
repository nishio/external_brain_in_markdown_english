Teams with low productivity awareness are less productive when teleworking.
[What is the difference between telework winners and telework losers? ｜Cybozu's Media Specializing in Hybrid Work](https://hybridwork.cybozu.co.jp/articles/booksandapps-productivity/)
> According to a survey by the Japan Productivity Center, the telework implementation rate in July 2022 was 16.2%, the lowest ever recorded*1. *2
>  The most likely reason for this is not "telework is great. The reality is probably that "companies with declining productivity are stopping telework one after another.
>  In other words, the situation is such that companies whose productivity decreased due to teleworking left teleworking early, and now only those companies whose productivity increased due to teleworking continue to telework.

It's quite a stimulating theory... [https://t.co/Or1uDCX2jh](https://t.co/Or1uDCX2jh)
