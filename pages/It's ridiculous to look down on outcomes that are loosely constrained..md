For equally good results, those produced under tight restrictions are more impressive, but it is ridiculous from the point of view of those who do not care about restrictions to see people who are trying to produce results under tight restrictions but have not yet done so emotionally oppose the results produced under [[lax restrictions]] and try to feel superior by making mysterious [[contempt]]. It is funny from the point of view of those who are not interested in constraints.


    - [[constraints]]
    - [[results]]
