- [[Sleeping oracle 2023-09-15]] が長いので第1段落だけ [[AI Shaman]] に解釈させた<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

One step ahead of you, it's crowded.
A dream story that has never been told is a big story
We must move on quickly.
Don't look back.
I have to run.
flood of tsunamis
Wider observation range
You have to see it with your own eyes.
It doesn't make sense to see the same things as other people and
We have to keep our eyes on what is hard to see.
What looks like the right answer is wrong.
A wide gate is a road to destruction
Alone like the horn of a rhinoceros.
You have to go through the thorns.
We need to pack less.
Can't move on fast enough.

1: Look at the whole picture.
- One step ahead is crowded, and the dream story that has never been told is a big one. We must advance with haste. We must run without looking back. Tsunami tempest. We must widen our observation range and see with our own eyes. There is no point in looking at the same things as others; we must focus our eyes on what is difficult to see. What looks right is wrong, and the wide gate is the road to destruction. Like the horn of a rhinoceros, one must go through the thorns alone. You must carry less baggage to go faster.

2: Tell your impression in one line.
- A poetic message that conveys [[the difficulty of moving forward]] and [[preparedness]].

3: Interpret paragraph by paragraph.

- > One step ahead is crowded, and the dream story I've never been to is a big bathtub. We must proceed with haste.
    - The future and new challenges are difficult to predict, and while it is easy to have grand dreams and ambitions, reality is always moving at a speed that must be caught up with.
        - [[現実は常に動いている]]<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

- > You have to run without looking back. Tsunami temp.
    - The importance of not dwelling on the past and [[moving forward]] despite being caught up in the situation.
        - [[過去に固執しない]]<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

- > We must broaden the scope of our observation and see with our own eyes. There is no point in looking at the same things as others; we must focus our eyes on what is difficult to see.
    - The importance of broadening one's own horizons and finding the overlooked things and values that are not captured by the perspectives of others.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - Expand your own horizons
            - Don't get caught up in other people's viewpoints.
            - Finding Overlooked Value
                    - [[🌀Find value before others realize it]]

- > What appears to be right is wrong, and the broad gate is the road to destruction. Like the horn of a rhinoceros, you must go through it alone and through the thorns.
    - The [[obvious answer]] or the [[seemingly easy path]] is often in fact a mistake, and [[courage]] to go [[solitude]] on the [[difficult path]] is required.

- > If you don't have less baggage, you can't go faster.
    - The importance of being [[light]], because unnecessary [[restraints]] and possessions hinder progress.

4: Give the oracle a soft title.
The Answer Behind the Clouds."
