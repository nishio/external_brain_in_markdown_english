> [glenweyl](https://x.com/glenweyl/status/1817955522035032270) BTW @takahiroanno-san and @nishio-san, you should know that the idea of "broad listening" comes from @iamtrask's work.  He's a PhD student and dear friend of mine.  I hope you all can connect.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1817961449408598405) Hi @iamtrask, I heard that you invented the term "broad listening." I believe naming this concept is a wonderful contribution to humanity.

> [iamtrask](https://x.com/iamtrask/status/1818012199006388351) Wow! @glenweyl and @nishio-san thank you so much for your kind words. I imagine every researcher endeavours to be exactly that — and it's not every day that someone says it so directly. Very very honored.
>  And of course please do reach out if ever I can be of service (or a chat)!
