- About the Format
    - Today's e-books have the same format as paper books, [[one-dimensional]] content.
    - [[Wikipedia]] is a [[network-like]] content using [[Wiki]] features.
- About Content
    - Wikipedia is intended to be an encyclopedia by an unspecified number of authors
        - This creates a strong bias to be objective.
        - Putting personal subjectivity into it will cause an editing war.
        - There's a tag that negatively implies "original research."
        - Prone to tasteless enumeration of facts
    - Books are intended for a specific few authors to express their ideas
        - With a few exceptions, such as data collections, the goal is "knowledge creation".
            - [[Creation is subjective]]
        - Can be supported by objective data, but the main one is on the side of subjective interpretation.
- The Wiki format creates a written knowledge creation of a specific few authors.
