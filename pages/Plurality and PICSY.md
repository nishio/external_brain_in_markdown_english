[[Ken Suzuki]] was asked the relation between Plurality and PICSY in NAMERAKA Conference 2([[なめら会議2]])
- PICSY: [[Propagational Investment Currency SYstem]]
    - Here is an explanation about the Currency System in English, which is implemented by Ken Suzuki in 2012:
        - [Ken Suzuki — PICSY : Proposing a New Currency System Using Social Computing, Introducing “Plural Money” from Japanese Complex System Researcher | by taka | Medium](https://medium.com/@tkgshn/ken-suzuki-picsy-proposing-a-new-currency-system-using-social-computing-introducing-plural-771d5d8ebdf6)

He answered:
> I sense a '[[family resemblance]]' between [[Plurality]] and [[PICSY]], but I think it would be better to have a detailed discussion once I have a deeper understanding of Plurality.
- >  "Technology as a solution" is a common goal we share.
- >  I've mentioned security in my book: [[currency]] → [[resource distribution]] → [[voting]] → [[security]]. It seems like Plurality hasn't fully reached that point yet.
- >  With the emergence of [[Ethereum]], I feel the need to think about a new [[social contract]].
- >  There's no need to emphasize the differences; from a global perspective, Plurality and PICSY are similar, like family. What's important is to establish cooperative relationships to bring change to the world.
