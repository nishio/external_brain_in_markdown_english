title: "Blog Comments"
---

from  [[Participate in other people's projects in Scrapbox]]
    - In the days of [[Blog]], there was a discussion about whether or not to open [[the comments section]].
    - By the way, I was open at first, then I saw that [[Hiroshi Yuki]] was closed, so I copied him.
        - I wonder if there is an article about that time.
            - I can't find it.
            - Without writing a particular article or anything, I'm starting to feel like I'm closing it quickly, thinking, "I somehow thought it was a bad thing to refuse comments, but Yuki-san does it too, and if you think about it, opening up the comment section is just giving it an additional benefit, not taking anything away from it by closing it."

The comment field in [[Note]] can be turned off only with a paid plan.

X (Twitter) can "select reply range
- All (default)
- Followers
- People who @Tweeted (only those to whom you Mentioned)


Similar to [[mechanism to prevent replies]].
- Rather, historically, there were no "[[commentable mechanism]]" web pages when the Web first appeared, and they were invented later.
- Apparently it was before blogs.
