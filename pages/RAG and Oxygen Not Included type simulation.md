RAG and Oxygen Not Included type simulation
Abstract: We link the mechanism of LLM, which incorporates external knowledge and returns optimal answers through RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), to gas, water, and heat resource cycling in a closed ecosystem such as Oxygen Not Included.

Commentary:

ONI needs to circulate resources such as oxygen and water within a limited space to achieve an overall balance.
RAGs, on the other hand, temporarily incorporate external knowledge from a limited internal model (interacting with an external database) to generate more informative answers.
If we view this as "[[a]] process of reopening and renewing a closed system," the RAG appears to be an external injection of "fresh oxygen" that resolves a deadlock (oxygen deficient state) inside the model.
In other words, in a situation where the internal resources of the language model (prior learning) have been exhausted, the RAG is a mechanism to replenish external resources from the environment, and when viewed in the context of an ONI-like management simulation, it is a mixed sustainable system that is "self-sufficient plus external replenishment.
