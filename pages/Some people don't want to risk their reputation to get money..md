- Specific examples of how [[SOC]] trumps [monetary capital
- I have a shabby vacant house. If I rent it out for 30,000 yen/month, I think I can get a tenant.
    - Landlord's position:.
        - Not exactly the kind of people who come to cheap rentals...
        - I don't want to rent because if strange people live there, [[reputation]] will go down.
        - I don't want to take on [[reputational risk]] for money as high as $30,000.
        - I don't want people to look at me and say, "You did something weird for a high price of $30,000."
    - Realtor position:.
        - I don't want to broker a cheap deal because it's not worth the hassle and I don't want to do it because I don't see a return on my investment.
    - → Vacant houses are not rented out and left unoccupied.

- Nishio-san, why don't you sell the apps and services you are tired of making and neglecting to others?
    - Nishio's position:.
        - Well, that's the kind of thing that often happens with Chrome extensions and the like, where the person who buys the extension plants malware or directs you to an advertising site, which causes problems.
        - Generally, what I create is publicly available and tied to my name, so if it turns into malware, it will damage my reputation.
        - I'd have to be able to interfere with the operation after the sale, or veto the change policy.
            - I don't think anyone would buy it under those conditions.
