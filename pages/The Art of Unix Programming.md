The Art of Unix Programming
Eric Steven Raymond
[The Art of Unix Programming](https://homepage.cs.uri.edu/~thenry/resources/unix_art/index.html)
> [[Basics of the Unix Philosophy]]
- >  Rule of Modularity: Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces.
- >  Rule of Clarity: Clarity is better than cleverness.
- >  Rule of Composition: Design programs to be connected with other programs.
- >  Rule of Separation: Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines.
- >  Rule of Simplicity: Design for simplicity; add complexity only where you must.
- >  Rule of Parsimony: Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do.
- >  Rule of Transparency: Design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier.
- >  Rule of Robustness: Robustness is the child oftransparency and simplicity.
- >  Rule of Representation: Fold knowledge into data, soprogram logic can be stupid and robust.
- >  Rule of Least Surprise: In interface design, always do theleast surprising thing.
- >  Rule of Silence: When a program has nothing surprising to say, it should say nothing.
- >  Rule of Repair: Repair what you can â€” but when you must fail, fail noisily and as soon as possible.
- >  Rule of Economy: Programmer time is expensive; conserve it in preference to machine time.
- >  Rule of Generation: Avoid hand-hacking; write programs to write programs when you can.
- >  Rule of Optimization: Prototype before polishing. Get it working before you optimize it.
- >  Rule of Diversity: Distrust all claims for one true way.
- >  Rule of Extensibility: Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think.
