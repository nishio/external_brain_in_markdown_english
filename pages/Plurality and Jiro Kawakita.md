Among Jiro Kawakita's major works, the following points are considered particularly useful today

- The KJ Method: Development and Application of the KJ Method" (in Japanese)
    - The KJ method emphasizes the process of sharing data with many people and interactively categorizing, organizing, and making sense of the data.
    - In the context of digital democracy, it can be used as a means of "colliding and bringing together" diverse opinions online.
    - Furthermore, it is easy to visualize pluralistic culture and plurality because it provides a bird's eye view of the minority and majority of opinions.

- 『 [[Continuing Ideas]] 』
    - It provides an in-depth look at the application of the KJ method and the relationship between conflict and creation on the process.
    - It emphasizes the process of deriving new ideas and policies from the collision of different perspectives, rather than mere consensus building, and is effective for collaboration with members from diverse cultural backgrounds.

- 『 [[Field Science Methods]] 』
    - Details field survey procedures and observation methods.
    - The process of taking a multifaceted viewpoint, rather than looking at things from a single perspective, and then aggregating these perspectives is similar to the process of data analysis and consensus building in the digital society.
    - The thought process of integrating information from multiple data sources and participants with different backgrounds is especially important in today's pluralistic society.

These writings do not merely introduce techniques, but also carry through Kawakita's idea of "turning the clash of different opinions and cultures into creativity" as the plot of his philosophy. As a way of thinking that respects and creatively aggregates diverse opinions, it is highly significant that they be reevaluated even in the digital age.
