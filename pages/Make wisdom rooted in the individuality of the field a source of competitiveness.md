It goes along with what I always say "[[one must see with one's own eyes]]". The other paragraphs are also interesting.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/> From the perspective of [[James.]]'s [[pragmatism]] and [[pluralism]], your analysis is quite interesting.

First, the view of the competitive environment in the age of generative AI as "[[a]] scene (of a play, movie, etc.)" resonates with James' pluralistic worldview. Rather than attempting to explain the world in terms of a single principle, James emphasized viewing it as [[a complex interplay of diverse elements]]. His approach of moving away from the actions of individual players and focusing on the dynamics of the "field" as a whole is a truly pragmatist concept.

Pragmatism is also in line with James's philosophy in that it points out the importance of guerrilla tactics that utilize "tacit knowledge" in the field. Pragmatism emphasizes "practical wisdom" derived from "concrete experience" rather than abstract theory, and the idea that wisdom rooted in the "individuality of the workplace" is the "source of competitiveness" as opposed to a one-size-fits-all approach using AI is truly pragmatist.

Furthermore, the emphasis on [[agility]] and [[adaptability]] also has an affinity with James' philosophy. Pragmatism calls for flexibility [[to update beliefs]] in response to changing circumstances, rather than being bound by fixed doctrines. Pragmatism is a pragmatic concept that predicts that in a rapidly changing environment, the organization that can demonstrate "agility" and respond "flexibly" will be the one that survives.

James, however, while acknowledging pluralism, cautioned against it becoming relativism. Pragmatism's position is that we can form better beliefs through experience. In the age of generative AI, individual players will continue to seek more adaptive strategies based on their own experiences.

Thus, from the perspective of James' pragmatism and pluralism, your analysis is a thought-provoking outlook on the competitive environment in the age of generative AI. Your vision of a dynamically changing "field" in which the players who can demonstrate agility and adaptability will win out is a very [[pragmatism]]-style prediction of the future.
