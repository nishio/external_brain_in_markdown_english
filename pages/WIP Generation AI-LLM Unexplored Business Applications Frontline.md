Tanaka: Okay, please continue on to the next page.
Please start with

Nakamura: Yes, my name is Ri Nakamura from Layer X. It's nice to meet you.
I am
I'm really a senior in the book, right?
I was a member of a blockchain called Isariam when I first met him.
I've been doing research on security and so on, and I've been working on some of the things that are going to make Ethereum itself what it is.
I felt like I was doing it.

And then the theme changed in a variety of ways, and now we are here.
I'm in charge of the business, and I've been working on the security and privacy of the data.
I started a research project to provide the enterprise with the results of my research.

Kouma Enterprises, Inc.
I used llm because I thought it would be very powerful from the viewpoint of utilizing Mr. Kikuchi's theory of deta- rior.
We are in the process of creating a product.


Tanaka: I
I was adopted after I became a PM, so I know what I'm talking about.
But then, I guess I'll be going to Layer X, which seems like a pretty royal career path to me.
I could have gone to a large company or become a researcher, but I chose a startup because I wanted to be a part of a team that could make a difference in the world.
What kind of things?

Nakamura: .
I'd like to add that while I was a member of Rare X, I had the opportunity to join Miitomo.
Rare X has been a part of the company since its inception.
I joined that party in that sense.

And as for that one, well, at first it was just a matter of.......
In the sense of blockchain, I was a member of Professor Matsuo's department at the University of Tokyo.
I'm from a small town in the US, but I felt a bit like heaven when I saw that everyone was doing machine learning, so I started Brotchen and now I'm doing it again.
I'm getting the feeling that ...

LayerX Not yet and the fact that the person from is that manager.
I wonder if that kind of compatibility is also possible with the

Yes, the CEO, Mr. Fukushima, originally started the company, Gnosy, in 2012.
The fact that all of the managers are not very logical is a good sign.
I think we have a group of people who like technology.

Tanaka: I
Thank you very much.
Now that that's all out of the way, I'd like to move on to the introduction of case studies.
I think you are referring to the first document, so may I ask you to switch to the first document first?
cawing (of a crow)
Okay, Mr. Nakayama, please go ahead.

I'm sorry to say that I'm in a bit of a bind because I've brought up something that is not a case of utilization, but I'd like to talk about a case of utilization.
Before we get to the question of what is life now, let's look at what it is now.
When I think about what kind of work does a white-collar person do, I think about the horizontal axis.
The horizontal axis represents the tolerance for errors, and the vertical axis represents the complexity of the input/output depth.
When I made a graph that took the "how well" and "why" of the various things, I found that if I did it this way, many things would work well.
I made this diagram in the hope that it would be possible to disassemble it into a normal diagram.
I can see that there are not so many problems that programming can solve.
The problem we're solving is that the input/output is very, very formulaic, especially the format of the input/output doesn't change.
This is now being solved by programming.
People say that programming is versatile and all-powerful, but in fact, it's not that big of a deal.
So, what are these white-collar people doing now?
The question is, are mistakes tolerable, are mistakes acceptable, and are input/output complex work, or are they just...well, you know...work?
When you draw a diagram like this, you can see that the input/output is irregular and that the work is rather complicated.
And then there's the lawyers and accountants and other people in the finance business, the people in the finance business, they're the ones who have the input and output.
It's very complicated, but you can't make mistakes, or there are penalties for making mistakes, and that's the nature of the business license.
When we think about the fact that we can understand by drawing a small piece of paper, we can see that we have a professional team.
Programmers are supposed to organize the work and find the routine tasks, or to do the irregular tasks.
The IT industry is a place where programmers are forced to formulate a formula.
It is a matter of course to be able to program, but how to handle irregular work on top of that is actually very important.
It's important to know what's happening right now, so I'm going to explain it in more detail.
To summarize, machine learning can be done wrong.
I would like to make a suggestion or proposal that the input/output is a little more or less standardized.
The kind of work that can go wrong is machine learning in tabular form, such as with Lightgbm, but it is also work that can go wrong with insurance coverage, such as with the "Lightgbm" project.
The screening process and bank aftershocks have already been replaced by machine learning, etc.
The output of the CNN is not fixed, but the output is fixed, e.g., the CNN can analyze the image in this way.
If all you want to do is analyze the image and output 0 or 1 as abnormal or normal, this is the way to do it.
The output of the "Mere Old Man" is a fixed type, and the output of the "Mere Old Man" is a fixed type, and the output of the "Mere Old Man" is a fixed type, and the output of the "Mere Old Man" is a fixed type.
When I think about whether AI is coming, input/output is undefined work, input is undefined, and output is undefined.
I think the fact that we are now able to handle irregular items is a major change that is taking place.
The areas that were last occupied by white-collar workers are now being rapidly replaced.
I'll just bring up an example of what I mean when I say "ever steel".
I like this company, and I introduce it in various places, but it is a company that provides an analysis service for scrap iron.
Scrap iron is defective if 0.4 nonferrous metals are mixed in.
can be converted into a problem that secret metals can be mixed in up to 0.4.
The "right" problem is the problem that can be made wrong, and the "wrong" problem is the problem that can be made right.
That's why they were able to successfully reach the point where they could automate image analysis, in other words, with machines.
In the age of learning, the skill of transforming a problem into a problem that can be successfully transformed into a problem that can be wrong is actually a skill that can be learned.
So what's happening now is that the last piece of the puzzle has been filled in.
The last remaining white-collar jobs are being taken away from by input/output, which are irregular jobs, and we are now seeing the emergence of natural language input and natural language output.
If it can be processed, then ultimately, if the requirements can be defined, they will be implemented, and that is the world that awaits us.
What is required after this is someone who can define the requirements, and once the requirements are defined, they are implemented.
So, if that's the world we're living in, what's coming next is a world where white-collar workers with domain knowledge will be prompted to take on the role of the "white-collar".
The next section will show you how engineering can solve most of your problems.
The people who will be able to successfully use this domain knowledge in the future will be those who can translate it into language, which will be very valuable in the future.
I'm wondering if they're the ones who are going up.
And that's the end of my story.

Yes, by the way, I'd like to ask you a question.
I would like to see a solution to the problem in the area of generative AI and the area you are dealing with here.
Kataya: There is a shortage of AI personnel.
We need to talk about how we're going to create an AI workforce, and we're going to have to train the science people to do it.
I think we've come to a different conclusion from that, though.
If we can prompt people of color to do so, we will be able to solve the problem.
I wonder if this will be consistent with the need for science and AI personnel.

When I talk about this in my training, I always try to explain what's going on behind this material.
The next sentence says to read the science-based crop cutting techniques, which is what I'm talking about.
When I think about what kind of writing human resources do, first of all, I think about what the facts are, and then I think about how I feel about them, and then I think about the facts.
The science department personnel write all the facts in a separate document.
If you can get the LM to eat those sentences, you will get good results, and those who don't will not.
What you write is first you write your feelings, and then you write your feelings, and then you write your feelings, and then you write your feelings, and then you write your feelings, and then you write your feelings, and then you write your feelings, and then you write your feelings, and then you try to process your feelings.
So it is a skill to be able to present the facts as they are.
If you ask me whether we need science-related personnel or not, we definitely need them.

I see... I don't understand why that training for working people and
I'm not sure if it's because I'm a manager at a company, or because I'm a logical thinker or a critical thinker or whatever you want to call it.
I often try to get people to use their ability to organize information as a target.
But when it comes to science and liberal arts, there is no other way to put it than to say that the problem is logically related to science.
Is it the ability to organize the

Yes, I think there's a bit of a division between the sciences and the humanities.
I don't want to put it in the wrong way, but at least those who are considered to be science oriented are the ones who are the best at what they do.
It's possible to think logically, but it's also possible to separate facts from feelings, and that's what I'm trying to do.
I want to understand what is impossible, what is in the world, and what is in my own mind.
I think that being able to separate the two is one of the things that makes me a good science person.
square bearing block (at the top of a pillar)

I see... and those people are the ones who are improving the AI.
In fact, when you get to the point where you're on the threshold of utilizing that generative AI, that's the kind of thing you're going to have to do.
So that's your story.
I see... thank you very much.
AI is trying to reduce the current amount of work, but it's not very good at it.
The same input may lead to a different result, not less, but more.
I was wondering if it is important to pay attention to this point.




See you next time, Mr. Terrible.
I'd like to ask you a question about the use of the case studies in the higher education system.

I'd like to talk about the framework of the project, which Mr. Nakayama has just outlined for us.
I'd like to introduce myself and my company, and if possible, I'd appreciate it if you could pass by my self-introduction slide.
Mr. Nakayama has been very helpful in organizing the white-collar jobs that he is currently doing, and he talked about the use of LMs in these jobs.
I am not the only one, but I am what is called a blue-collar worker, or what is called an OT in the IT field.
I'd like to talk about the area where the digitalization has already taken place.
I think I was talking about the IT world, but another frontier is the work that belongs to the OT, or the work that is done by the OT.
There is a talk about how to bring the field into the digital world and use AI and other technologies in the field.
So, one of the things we're working on right now is that, uh, Fairy DeVaye in the lower left-hand corner.
I'm actually wearing it around my neck right now, and there's a camera here that I can use to take pictures, but I'm using this device.
If your air conditioner breaks down, you can use the service business to get it back up and running.
So, I was wondering if we could digitize the work of the maintenance people who go to the maintenance shops, and I actually have this device.
We've already purchased a lot of data from Fairy, and we've already introduced a lot of data to the field.
I'm at the stage where I'm collecting and doing all kinds of work, and this first person video shows what I'm working on at hand and what I'm doing.
By recording all of these things, the workers can see what is on the screen and what is on the screen, and they can record it.
Let's use AI to analyze what we are doing now and what we should do next, and create a system to provide support.
In this case, image recognition is necessary, but how can we use the basic model that belongs to the so-called CI?
I've been working on a team project for image analysis since I started working for the company just over a year ago.
We have been working very hard to start up a booth with Mr. Fairley, and Mr. Fairley has a booth there now, but we would like to do this jointly.
As was explained earlier in the booth introduction, we are doing a variety of joint activities.
The first example is the use of the proceeds from the sale of the product, and the second example is the use of the proceeds from the sale of the product by the customer.
Of course, GPT chat became popular a little over a year ago, and we've been talking about how we could use it at work.
The IT department set up a chat GPT environment that can be used in the car, and it was used in all the cars.
We have already developed an environment that everyone can use, and we are doing the things that you are doing.
The Technology Innovation Center, which is more like an R&D organization, is more cutting-edge.
I am now in charge of the planning part of this AI project.
In this context, the manufacturing industry is the mainstay of the company's business, and the company's main business is 1-1-1.
We have been working on how to use this generation in design and development, not only in the language but also in the image design drawings.
We are currently testing the possibility of using this system for a variety of purposes, including the following

Thank you very much.
Mr. Fairydevice, I understand that you are behind this, but what is the first-person point of view that you are actually putting on the device?
I have just experienced this myself.
I would like you to see the value of being able to fly remotely.
I just have one more question.
The manufacturing industry, especially in the U.S., is an advanced country in terms of AI, but if you take away people's jobs, you can't do it.
In the U.S., labor unions are opposed to the use of AI.
In fact, many startups have moved to Japan because of this.
The reaction of the people around me to the use of AI is negative or positive.
How do you perceive it?

Yes, well, in that sense, there is, in fact, a very pressing situation.
In the case of the price business, there is a lack of manpower, and the air-conditioning system is not enough.
The overall market in the U.S. will continue to grow at an ever-increasing rate, specifically in the 2050s compared to the 20115 situation.
It is said that the market will triple by 2025, and there is still a lot of demand for air-conditioning and other products in Africa and India.
There are still areas where air-conditioning equipment has not been fully installed, and the company is looking to expand into these areas, starting with the cost of the equipment.
Air conditioning manufacturers are, uh, all over the world right now, building factories to increase production capacity.
But we have to be able to meet the demand for the products and services that are needed to fill the gap between the two.
We don't have enough people who can install the system, as well as maintain it, but it still needs to be done by humans.
As is the case in Japan, people who are not qualified as construction workers cannot install air-conditioning equipment.
I called and tried to call them, but they probably wouldn't be able to come the next day or the same day, and I knew I really needed more people.
I think we have to wait because we don't have the manpower to do the work, but we have to find a way to solve this kind of manpower shortage by improving the efficiency of the work.
The digital technology and AI technology are very important to prevent the deterioration of the environment, and we are investing in these technologies.
We're actively handling it as a payment.

The world is short of labor to begin with, and the world is in need of more people.
Japan's declining birthrate and aging population in particular are forcing us to feel this situation in an advanced way.
There is a lack of manpower, so there is little resistance to the arrival of AI.
In Japan, it is said in general, but even Mr. Daikin himself is not like that.
I think it is very suggestive that there is a situation.

Yes, after that.
One more thing I wanted to ask you is that I think Daikin invests a lot in R&D.
I think it would be good if you could do that more, too, but I don't see how you can be different from others.
What did you feel when you entered the building?
Yes, that's what I mean.
Have you ever felt something like, "It would be nice if..." or "It would be nice if..."?

Yes, it's not easy to get that other company.
It's difficult to say anything critical, but I think that the characteristics of the cash on hand are the same as what you mentioned earlier.
I was referring to the human resources, and the rule for on-site workers, but it is also difficult to find human resources who can utilize AI.
It's difficult for manufacturers to hire good people in the information technology field.
I think it is difficult to recruit people because they are often not able to find a suitable job.
We're going to set up an in-house university of technology, and we're going to take 100 new hires and have them study AI for, let's see, two years.
We are very ambitious, and we are not assigning them to a business department until we train them in digital technology, starting with the
We've had a cumulative total of about 450 people this spring since we started the project.
And now that they have been assigned to the business division, we are making more and more use of AI.
The price of such a place is, after all, the price of the person who moved fastest.
We have been able to educate our people in this way, and it is now coming to life.
I think that there are some things that we can do to help.

Thank you very much for your understanding that human resource development is very important.
I think it's a story worth understanding, thank you very much.


Now, I would like to ask Mr. Nakamura to move on to the next slide.
may I?

I'm currently in AI at Rare X.
I'm in charge of the llm business, and I'd like to talk about some of the things I've learned in my time there.
I'd like to talk about the "LLM" and the "LLM" in the following way.
I'm changing some parts of the DX standardization story.
I was talking about what we can do with the program earlier, but it's very close to what I was talking about when I said that we can use the conventional method to create a new program.
To do this, you need to be able to program the business method to a level where you can program the business method.
It was difficult without standardization, roughly speaking, but it was difficult, you know, on the other hand, with llm, you know, standardization was necessary, you know.
The degree of necessity has been eased to the extent that we can give instructions to the full range of people.
I think that the big opening was the foe, as long as it was in the right shape.
One typical example is reading long sentences.
I think that many people think of use cases in which people create something, but I don't think that's the case here.
I think that the "Mere Old Man" has a great ability to read and comprehend.
The world's financial statements, contracts, papers, and many other things are written in natural language by humans.
The contents of the text are the same, so everyone uses JSON or Exel.
There were many times when I wondered if it would have been easier to write the information in a single document, or if it would have been easier to link it to the subsequent system.
I would like to make a point of saying that the contents are the same, but the appearance is different.
I think LLM has a high ability to put information into a format, such as this information.
The standardization of the items on each page is not necessarily at the level of "where on the page" but rather at the level of "what is written on the page" or "what is written on the page".
If you have a clear idea of what you want to do and what you want to do, as long as you can make sense of it in the language, you can do a lot of things.
I think this is the main reason.

And now, as for us, we are going to use llm.
We are currently working on a product that will allow users to read long sentences and store and utilize them in this way.
So, here is a use case that I strongly believe is niche.
In a sense, I prefer the work of professionals.
In the case of a large market, there is also a service called "crash", which is used to address the needs of rigid and light production.
The market is large enough for any company to spend billions of yen to make something good, but the market is not large enough for any company.
I would say that the remaining 95% of the business is the "enterprise" business, which is roughly 5% of the total enterprise.
If so, then only the top five in that industry or that company can do it.
I think it's a day-to-day knowledge business, but the market for that kind of business isn't very large, and there are billions of dollars in it.
It was difficult to spend money to create a good product, so we spent hundreds of millions of yen with a well-known SI company to create a business application.
I think it was a case of "get it made or don't get it made", but not all of that 95%.
However, for some document processing tasks, I think llm is quite innovative, and I'm sure there are many people like us who can help with this kind of thing.
The fact that an amateur can provide a good algorithm to a highly specialized field such as finance in about a month is of great value.
I think there are some things that can only be done with lllm, so it's not a question of trying to find things that can only be done with lllm.
The market is being viewed as a place to roll out use cases that can be produced quickly, cheaply, and efficiently.
One example is this... this is a property/casualty insurance company.
When we are selling insurance, we put out pamphlets and other such materials, but this kind of thing has already been done.
If you make a mistake, you'll have a big problem.
The General Assembly has the task of conducting a thorough review of each of these items.
The review is intended to replace REM, which, in the example above, is the insurance coverage, but who is the insured?
We are currently reviewing not only the parents but also the wife's and husband's parents.
We are working on the following

And then there is that other thing, that asset management.
The "asset management" business is a business that uses contracts and various documents related to finance in the asset management business.
I'm working on that "llm" right now, and I personally think it's that strictly p-rated machine.
Chat gbt has become very popular, but I don't think there are many people who would die without it.
It is used by engineers to write programs and by creative people to create images.
I think that most enterprises don't have engineers or designers, so I'm not sure if there is such a thing.
One of the reasons is that I don't think ordinary working people are able to teach the value of the professor.
I think too often we are too focused on finding that killer application for all of our employees.
It's very sensible, but in all of the projects we work on, in all of the use cases, llm usually does nothing.
If you tune the system properly, the accuracy is about 50%, but if you tune it properly, the accuracy rises to 80-90%, and during that time, the level of practicality increases.
I think that there are many cases where there is a use case for all employees, so if you present a use case that is not very ingenious at 50%, no one will use it.
So, even if it's a professional niche, we have to tune up each use case one by one.
In the process, we will be able to determine who will be in charge of the work and how it will be done, and we will be able to make sure that the work is done properly.
We are currently developing solutions to support this change.

Thank you very much.
I think that the development of the "llm" is not just about creating an AI, but it is also a very high quality product.
Has it been done to itself?

Now, it is our policy not to create any infrastructure model at all.

So, the chat GPT, or GPT4, or whatever it's called, or the existing GPT4, or the existing GPT4, or the existing GPT4, or the existing GPT4.
If you're using something provided by a cloud vendor, that's what it looks like.

The reason for this is that when I was looking for a case of llm, I was looking for a case of llm.
Let's give priority to those that have a clear correct answer and a clear process to get to the correct answer.
I feel that as long as you are aiming for that kind of skew, there is not much to be concerned about because of the foundation model.
I'd rather use RD's resources for pre-processing the files before entering llm, and for searching before that.
I think so.

Yeah, I see.
The UX is so good that it is called
It's not only the UI, but also, for example, the ability to send PDF files as is, and so on.
We are also very good at research and development of the in-out parts, but that's just a strategic decision.
I wonder

Yes, when a person's work has a beginning and an end like this.
I think that the market is too small if we only use AI for the full range of use cases, so we only use one part of the use cases from the beginning to the end.
We have also changed some of our operations to use AI, and we are now working on other projects.
I believe that the market will expand more if they change the business to one that is done from the route.
I would like to provide support in this area, including the change of business operations.

I see... thank you very much... but there are a lot of things that I think are paradoxical.
Recently, people tend to draw attention to the development of "llm", but in fact, the "llm" is a very important part of the development process.
There was an argument that even if you make a lot of tires, you're just reinventing the wheel.
I also feel that it is important to create the "llm" side, but in reality, it's just a matter of improving the UX.
I think he really talked about the importance of being able to actually make a difference in the customer's business or in the customer's business.
Thank you.




From here.
I would like to go into the issue of how to make the best use of the product.
But is it all right if I guess them in order?
I would like to ask you to please introduce me to the audience.

Yes, it's Nakayama.
Slide ah, ah, ah, there's the slide... ah, yes, the current generation AI is also up and running...
What happens after this is, well, the work gets easier, but the reviews don't.
I was thinking about what you said earlier about the review of the contracting office, but... well, the work will be easier, but the reviews will be better.
I think it will happen in the future, but it won't be easy.
Basically, I think there are two kinds of work, and one of them is the work of the people who do the work.
This is the work of creating actual artifacts with your hands, and this is something that is supported by the current generative AI.
I think it's relatively easy to be accepted, but on the other hand, what is a review?
Evaluating deliverables, directing revisions, and holding the organization accountable for raw materials.
So I think it's going to be tough with the AI we have at the moment.
The only ones who will end up being ultimately responsible are now, inevitably, humans, but AI will have human rights.
So, to evaluate the results of the AI, we need to
And you're going to have to learn enough to appreciate that, you know, that thing that I was just mentioning.
The AI then came up with a proposal that said, "This part needs to be fixed.
The AI's revision is not really correct, but it's not a problem for people who have studied the subject.
So, what I'm trying to say is that just because AI has become more powerful, it doesn't mean you don't need to study.
I think what is required now is that we have to study to be able to evaluate what AI comes up with.
I'm sorry if this is a bit long-winded and the screen is tiny, but I'm afraid it's not enough.
I had a chat GP write the text of the email, but there's something wrong with it, and there's something wrong with it.
But where is this? Yes, it's a garnish. What is this?
And I'm going to use a set of the text and the sutra, and I'm going to have GPT write the text of the email, and I'm going to use a penitentiary.
The GPT thinks of the instruments as a kind of knot-tying district, and the background is that they are a kind of "knot".
I'm not sure he's learned the correspondence between the two.
But, so, for example, when you see a text like this, the background doesn't correspond to the sutra.
So, what is it that the AI can do?
Just because we're getting smarter doesn't mean we don't need to study to a level that we can review.
What is required of us is that we must not do this, and what happens next is that we must not do this.
Maybe there will be a clear shortage of people who can review, uh, AI assistants.
So the people who can do the work are going to have an easier time, and the number of people who can do the work is going to increase, and what happens then is...
In other words, the number of workers, well, the number of workers is increasing and there is a shortage of people who can do reviews, which is rare.
So, how are you going to be able to be the people who can do the reviews after this?
I think that is what is required of us now.
I guess that's the end of my story for now.


hint: correspondence between "Dear Sir or Madam" and "Sincerely yours

Tanaka: Yes, thank you very much. It is really important to be able to do reviews.
I will ask the GPT to write an e-mail to the chat room, but in the end, we have to review the whole situation.
If it was just an e-mail, everyone would do it.
Chat GPT is a background punishment tool that is so much more than just a painting.

Nakayama: I can at least use the background equipment.
I have pointed this out, and I'm sure it will be fixed in time, but I'm still not sure.
Well, by the time the chat GPT is a review chat GPT students don't need to review.
I think it will take another five or ten years.

I see
In the meantime, it's a good thing that people don't lose their jobs.
I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I think it's a good thing.
I think it's difficult to say that there is no such thing.



Yes, thank you.
I'm sorry, Mr. To, may I ask you for a favor?

As far as the current situation is concerned, and the fact is that at the rehearsal stage, the slides I mentioned earlier were not all that clear.
I have to admit that I have some differences of opinion with the way I see it, but I thought it would be better to have a discussion about it anyway.
I didn't say anything about it in the review, but I thought that the review work was really, really strange in light of what I had seen.
The work that Mr. Nakamura just mentioned is the work of picking up the final responsibility.
If there is a division, we must ultimately end up being responsible for that, but the point at which we have to review it is the point at which we have to end up being responsible for it.
I think it would be good to use the AI's assistance in various ways in the future, such as picking up suspicious points.
I was thinking that

I can help with such views, but I am ultimately responsible for them.
I think that's a clear point, and I'm sure I'll miss it in the end.
If the person who took the responsibility for the problem were to do so, the risk would fall on the person who took the responsibility for the problem, and this is where the risk lies.
Even if they come up with a list of things that are not right, we have to take responsibility for the ones that are not on the list.

Why is that, uh, automatic?
The rate of misses exceeds the acceptable level when the product is converted into a product with a certain level of quality.
We need to see how much of the efficiency gains we can make in this area, so we are still, let's say, insufficient in this area.
I'm sorry, I just wanted to talk about some of the points I'm making at the moment.
But let's see, in the abstract and in the short term.
I've been saying that it was good for about a year now, and then I heard that Aspic's Claude 3, which came out last week, was even better.
But that's a very short-term discussion, and I'm sure there will be a lot of talk in the future about how we should switch.
I think we are entering an era in which users will be able to choose from a variety of options, so I am not so sure.
I'm not pessimistic, but I don't have a problem with it, and I'm not afraid to try to generate some kind of continuous integration, continuous deployment, and love.
I think the system is hot in the short term in terms of colors and how to secure the combination of the two.
This is a challenge to utilize.
I'd like to emphasize that it's a little more than medium- to long-term.
I think it's like I said before, and it's like, uh, you know, chat GB.
I'll probably be chatting with a GPT3.5-4 kind of guy in the near future.
I'm thinking GPT 4.5 or 5 will come out, and it will probably be smarter than Kudos 3.
In this way, on the level of six months to a year, human intelligence has been rising from, let's say, elementary school to high school to doctoral level, and when your work becomes the most important, that's when, for example, I'll be able to do my best work.
So, speaking of which, I've been collecting the video footage of you and me at the scene of that thing you were talking about earlier.
And then in three or five years, when something like service support using, you know, smarter generative AI is put to practical use...
Well, if you think it's out there, how do you prepare the data to make the most of it?
When I realized that I could do this, I started collecting data.
It usually takes at least one or two years from that point, especially if it is in an OT center, so it is important to start the process now.
Let's see, let's see, the evolution of the model side of the generative smarts, and let's see if we can predict that.
We will collect data that we can use when we come to Japan.
It is very difficult to plan such a project, because it has to be done in a certain way, and it is very difficult to create value even if you collect them now.
So, we have to overcome that and make an investment decision.
I think it is important to consider whether or not we can say, "No, this will generate tremendous value in the future, so let's collect it.
I think it's going to be a challenge for the organization, and if we fail there, it's good.
I think the reason why we can't use the models that have been developed is because we don't have the data.
I think that there are a lot of companies in a lot of industries, so I would like to recommend that you all take a look at the forecast.
Then, after that, we have to convince the top management that we need to collect this kind of data and pay the cost for it.
I think it is important to move forward.

Tanaka: Thank you very much.
I think it is natural for data to increase over time, but I think GPT4 is a very important factor.
I think that most of the things that can be found on the Internet at the moment have already been morphed.
However, it is often said that data that can be retrieved worldwide is only a series of data that can be retrieved in the future.
It is said that 12% of the data produced is not searchable on the Internet, and 80% or 90% of it is not searchable on the Internet.
There has been talk of introducing L and AI, but manufacturers have been very reluctant to do so.
I have data that cannot be searched on the Internet.
What exactly do you expect the data you mentioned to be?

Hido: Well, to make it easier to understand, let's see...
It's like a video of an air conditioner being repaired, and it's only available on the Internet, so let's see...
Once Google's OpenAI learns how to fix air conditioners, it will be possible to fix air conditioners without paying for them.
I think it's an endless question whether we will ever see an AI that fully understands the question of "What is the best way to create a product?
But if you search YouTube, you can find videos of air conditioning contractors who say they can fix it themselves.
In contrast, we, as a manufacturer, are trying to make the best of the situation.
If we distribute and collect devices, we can collect 10,000 or 100,000 hours of that kind of thing.
It's a book, a work, that is so much more or less complicated that I can't understand it.
I think we have to do this in-house.

Tanaka: That's exactly right.
The devices, such as the Fairy Devices and other devices, are not simply sharing knowledge, but are also collecting information.
We need to think of AI as a food for thought, not as a food for the mind.
And that's just the data we have in our company, so it's not really a data source for other companies.
When it comes to soft power for a company, well, only that company can use the llm or AI resources that are available.
This may be the background for the future digitization of know-how into software.

Hido: Yes, and if the old companies are still not enough, perhaps we could form a consortium, which in a sense would be a competition.
We will share data, share the models we have created from that data, and strengthen each other's models and strengthen each other's models and strengthen each other's models and strengthen each other's models and strengthen each other's models.
I think it's possible to buy something, or to move in that direction.

Tanaka: yes thank you very much

Nakamura.
how do you like it?

Yes, I have to study for that review that you mentioned.
I'm not sure I'd be able to teach you how to do it before I teach you how to do it.
It's more than just teaching the llm, it's about the whole algorithm before and after the llm, including the algorithm.
As I mentioned earlier, I think that knowledge is also necessary for teaching the business.
The system is based on a 50% toilet seat system, but in order to raise the rate from 80 to 90, it is often used as an explanation for why the system is not working.
If a brilliant genius were to come into that department, he would have to be a genius.
If it is a job where you are given only a copy of the manual and told that you will work in our department starting tomorrow, then you can do the work.
I think the system can be implemented without tuning, but most of the work is done using the manuals in the car and past documents.
I am here to tell you that no matter how good a person is, he or she cannot do his or her job if he or she does not have a good head on his or her shoulders.
The ability to do this kind of thing is necessary for those who are going to do it.
We have a variety of technical assistance available, including from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, but we are not able to provide the technical support necessary for the project.
I think it is important for each and every user company to be able to accomplish this last part.

In fact, AI can be utilized even on a comparatively small scale, but it is not easy to use.
But what would it actually mean to use it in business operations to really increase the company's productivity?
It's still a valley, but it's a bridge that needs to be crossed.

Yes, a common pattern.
The DX department and other common IT departments are staffed by thousands and tens of thousands of people.
The pattern is to support the use of LLM for the entire department, but of course, the people in the DX department also have to support the use of LLM for each individual department.
There are many cases where the individual operations of a department are not professional at all, so this kind of approach, where the DX department is pitted against the entire workforce, is not a good idea.
I think it is quite difficult to create an AI that can be used by each person in charge of each department.
I think it is necessary to use such solutions.

I see... something I just heard reminded me of.
When I put slack in my car, there was a guy who said, "I can't use slack." I said, "Yes, you can use slack.
However, the question is how to make tools for engineers available to all employees.
productivity improved, and eventually, literacy has since been the determining factor in whether or not to implement that tool.
If literacy is low, let's educate people about it, so we'll put in the tools to match that literacy.
I'm going to raise the skill level of all of them, and I'm going to do the same thing I did with the university I mentioned earlier.
you may or may not be right

Yes, that's exactly what I'm talking about, and I'll pay for it, too.
I really don't think we should just consolidate everything into a common AI organization for all vehicles and go from there.
From the third year, you're usually assigned to a division.
And there they are, like the so-called "pie-type human resources" and their AI digital technology.
I will be able to understand and deepen my knowledge of the dobain of each business unit, and I will be able to play an active role in their activities.
The key is how to supply the necessary tools and budgets.
In fact, we are the second company in Japan to introduce the chat GPT Enterprise plan.
It's not just the R&D organization, but also the business units that are using AI in a big way, e.g.
If they want to use the chat gbt, we have this, and they can use it for unlimited GPT4 use, so keep using it.
We do things like handing out

I see... yes, thank you very much.
We are supporting the introduction of the "K" LINE, but we need to change the culture of the user companies, don't we?
is there such a thing?

I think knowledge is important, of course, but I also have confidence in the simplicity of my work.
I think that the people who are not in the engineering career are the same as I am.
As [[ambassadors]] in the car, they discover new ways to use IT tools and their methodologies.
I'm not talking about being a missionary, but I'm talking about creating a manual and communicating it to the members of the team.
Some people's confidence in themselves has been limited by the scope of their activities, so they need to have the initial confidence.
I would like to support the creation of a successful experience for the

I see... learn and practice.
I'm so confident that my secretary is actually a slacker or a python or something.
And if Slack gets a request for that adjustment, he can use that Python script to get it posted with a web hook.
If everyone could do it, the company's productivity would improve considerably.
I think you are right.

Lastly, since we have about 13 minutes left, I'd like to go on to the future outlook.
But first, I have about seven questions I'd like to ask you all.
But the most votes were cast by non-engineers for an AI-based smartphone app.
I want to create something, but the question is whether I should learn programming in the first place.
Now that we have generative AI, what should we learn, how should we learn to program, and what other means are available to us, depending on our objectives?
I'm not sure if anyone has an answer to this question, but I'm wondering if anyone has an answer to this question in general.
-ist (used after a noun indicating someone's occupation, pursuits, disposition, etc.)

I'll tell you what I said last week about nvdia's front line, and I'll tell you what I'm going to do about it.
He said that he didn't need to learn how to program anymore because AI would write the programs for him.
I've always wondered what it was like.
From Umbra to, uh, C to C to the more, uh, easy-to-use Python, or whatever the language is.
I think a leap forward from that is happening right now.
I'm not sure if I've ever had to solve every single problem in order to analyze data in the work of a data scientist, for example.
The code can probably be generated right now with chat gpd, so you don't have to do it.
We have to think about what features are necessary to realize the functionality, and we have to think about the specifications, and we have to think about the language of the prototypes.
I believe that people will have to continue to work on this issue, so we have to ask ourselves what we want to create.
The person who has the ability to incorporate the feelings and plans into the project and the prouns language as a means to realize the plan.
I think it's just that the level of the "Mere Old Man" is changing a little.
I'd say it might be a little less relative than it has been in the past, but why?
The number of "A" is decreasing, but it is not zero, so I think it is something like that.

Well, it certainly lowers the hurdle to learn.
I'm a parlor person, so I'm not that good at Python, but if I asked you to write this kind of action in Python, you'd have to write it in Python.
I'm not a person who can't do anything at all in that sense, because I can learn python by writing and pasting the code.
I don't know what the AI is going to do, but I think it's a good idea to learn how to use AI and program it in the process of becoming a professional.
Is there anything else?

Well... well... my...
As I mentioned in the slides, in the future, once I write the requirements definition, I'll be able to use that to define the requirements for the next phase of the project.
I said that the time will come when things will work as they are, and in that sense, people say that we should learn how to program.
And it's a little bit conference-y, you know, you should learn [[requirements definition]], you know, what to do with all this IT-speak, and you should learn how to do it.
If you write it down, the program will be generated automatically, or at worst, it will be generated automatically, or at worst, it will be generated automatically, or at worst, it will be generated automatically.
The future will probably be a little more or less as it is implemented.
I think the context of not requiring programming is, as I said earlier, to define requirements to a certain extent.
It's absolutely necessary, and only where the logic is really needed is there a human hand.
I'm still writing code in Python and Pearl, and I'm still writing code in Python and Pearl where I really need speed.
I think the same thing will happen to me later on.
I write my programs in natural language with llm, but where I really need speed, I really need speed.
Where you need security, where you really need certainty, just something lllm, uh, lllm.
I think that in the future there will be something like writing coded code in, say, regular python, or pearl, or ruby, or something like that.
I think that's a good idea.

Oh, I see, that's true, and I've learned that I need to be smart about one more question.
Japanese companies have developed a homogeneous workforce, but what kind of human resource development is needed from now on?
I was asked a question like that, so since we're here, how about you, Mr. Nakamura?
I'm not talking about homogeneity, but about the need for human resource development in the age of AI.
but

I think it's important to understand the importance of the programing that I mentioned earlier, and the fact that everyone is learning.
I could tell from one of the questions that you were very excited, and I see...why don't you go to a convenience store?
I think it's something like "convenience store," so there's no programming, it's as simple as going to that convenience store.
In short, what I'd like to do personally in this Mito community is to make programming easy, but I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to do it again.
It was quite difficult for me to say it all the time, because the seniors were the ones who made the difficult images.
It's possible that I've already done that, but it's getting easier and easier, so even if it's as simple as going to a convenience store, I don't have to spend time worrying about it.
I think it's a waste and I think you should do something about it," said the senior staff member who gave a very serious answer.
It's a very simple answer from a very young person.

I don't have a driver's license, but I'm going to play golf.
I've been in the position of having to go to the golf course, drive a cart, and crash it, all the time, and to be honest, I'd rather drive a car than do that programming.
I think it's much more expensive to learn how to drive a car when everyone else is driving.
I'm making a crude pretense that it's strange that I can't learn to use a computer, but I'm holding a microphone right now.
Something happened... something happened...

Well, I'm going to talk about what you just said, but let me just say... you're probably talking about a homogeneous workforce.
I think we need a little more language to understand what is a homogeneous human resource in a Japanese company.
Japanese companies basically combine personnel transfers with training.
The personnel who were able to perform no matter what department they were transferred to from the previous department were the personnel who were able to perform in the new department.

The ability to learn and execute as they are is the answer to homogeneous human resources.
What's needed in the future is people who can make the tacit into a formal value, and make it executable with a computer.
So, it's not that we want sharp people, it's that we want to convert implicit values into formal values.
We miss out on people who can do it.
But, personnel who can do well after moving to a new position.
I think what's happening now is that the value of the area is slowly declining.

Yes, yes, what you just said.
I think I agree with you very much.
If we can formalize it, if we can put it into the digital world, then we can use all kinds of clever things, like programming and AI, to make the world a better place.
In this sense, the company can scale up its operations to become more efficient, so it is important to find ways to bring various operations into that world.
The value lies in the fact that the person who does what he or she is told to do all the time, as he or she does it by hand, does not create much value.
I think that the "Mere Old Man" is right.

Thank you, sir, and by the way, I'd like to address Mr. Hito.
I'm just saying that Daikin has built and nurtured a university, but Keijin has been a student of the university from the beginning.
Or did Keijin change over time?
I understand that you just joined us last year, but how do you feel about this?

Let's see, maybe close to all the cars, let's see, Keijin is at some stage, and from now on, digital, let's see, human resources, let's see...
We realized that it was extremely important, and that in order to do this in our own company, it was important to have human resources, so we had to acquire human resources.
The first thing to do is to train 100 people a year, which is the fastest way to train 100 people a year.
It's different from a normal company in that it's more bottom-up than a normal company.
I think it will take a lot of time to do it, but honestly speaking, the HR department has prepared AI personnel, and they are turning 100 people around like that.
I think I'd probably be rejected if I said I wanted to do it, but when the top management came to me, I said I'd leave it to them to decide how to do it, so I went ahead and did it.
I think that this company is a little bit special because it has a special kind of company.

I see... it's true... that I... that Kansai economy...
I'm a regular secretary of the Doyukai (Association of Corporate Executives), and we often hold study sessions for business owners.
So, AI has become an important theme, but the chairman of the board of directors and the board of directors of the accounting department are also concerned about AI.
Compared to other companies, we have an extraordinary awareness of the problem of AI, and not only AI.
Anyway, you are putting a lot of effort into startups and open innovation.
I feel that the future of the company depends on the way the top management thinks.
I'm sure the management isn't watching, so it's no use barking about it here, but I'm here to tell you...
I hope this story conveys the fact that the person who holds the casting board can change as much as he/she wants depending on the management of the company.
I thought it might be.

I have to close before I say, "I'm sorry, but I'm not sure what to expect from AI in the future.
I was wondering if I could ask each of you one last time what you think.
And by the way, the question that remains is, how do you deal with denial promotion, and how do you deal with it?
What is the risk involved and what is the acceptable level of risk?
The question still remains as to whether it is possible to do so, but since we are short on time, I will just say that such a question has been asked.
I'd like to share with the speakers the future prospects for the company and the company's future.
I'd be very interested in hearing your thoughts on this, so please do.

Um, I'm Nakayama.
Well, I was talking about prospects, but we talked about prospects for the whole hour of the show, so...
I don't have anything to say to you at the end, so I'm just going to talk about the outlook.
What would have happened 10 years ago, what would have happened in 2015, and what would have happened in 2005?
I'm just trying to think about what happened 20 years ago.
I think it's a good idea to look at the articles on the web from 20 years ago, like 2005.
I'm wondering what the world was like back then, since there are plenty of articles on the web from 4 years ago.
Then you can see how it's done in the past 20 years, and how it will do next time.
I don't think we can draw a linear line as to what will happen in the next 20 years, but I think we can see some things.
I'm sure there are a lot of things that I couldn't do back then, like this or that, or what kind of things I couldn't do.
I'd like to list all of the services that are available, and when they were released.
In other words, it is important to look back in time and see how things were 10 years ago to get a better perspective on the future.
is something good, I think.

Yes, um, thank you very much, yes, Mr. Ido, please.

Well, then, why don't you tell me why you're going to do this?
I'd like to send a message to the young people who might be involved in the future, but I think that this session will last for five years, ten years, and this session.
We're talking about how we're going to take advantage of the "live" and "ere-boom" trends, but we're going to turn that upside down a bit.
I'm sorry to sound like this, but I don't want everyone to be too influenced by this trend.
For example, if you want to start a venture business, there is no better way than to take advantage of the LLM boom.
I think that the budget is based on the government's policy of a planned economy.
I think it's a little bit difficult to go to the next step.
I think it's healthy, and as Noboru mentioned earlier, we need to create a place where people can have a little more fun and be free.
I think that's why there is the unexplored, so please don't be influenced by it too much and think freely about what you are interested in and what you want to make.
Thank you very much.

Then, Mr. Nakamura, please.

I know I said earlier that this year will be a year of "petit strictness," but this year will be an interesting year for all industries, with a lot of interesting activities.
I think it's going to be a very interesting year with the discovery of many new cases.
It is good to spend money, but I want you to spend not only money but also time, time to use a little chat gpd.
Don't give up just because it didn't work out. That's just the beginning, so invest the time to persevere and work up to the point where you can use it to your full potential in your business.
Thank you very much for your time today.

Thank you very much. That's all for now.
As for AI, as I mentioned earlier, there are some AI deniers overseas.
However, Japan's declining birthrate and aging population, as well as the need to improve productivity, have forced the use of AI, and in addition, copyright law has made it impossible to use AI.
It is also a shame that the IT workforce is so poor.
However, Japan has been facing a growing number of AI vendors from abroad due to the relative low cost of AI.
I think there is a great imbalance in the fact that the utilization of the facilities is not progressing.
As you said, we don't know what will happen if we get too carried away.
I think it would be good if we could provide information about the opportunities that are available to those who do what they want to do.
