title: "Rebalancing to Emotions"
---

- When a [[positional make-up]] based on [[emotion]] is made, and then a decision based on [[reason]] is made that is successful and grows large, the rational side has grown large as a share, and in order to return to the proper balance, the successful rational side should be disposed of and [[reinvested]] in the sensible side. In order to restore the proper balance, the successful rational side should be disposed of and the sensible side should be reinvested, and this is the philosophy that emphasizes "[[emo-centricity]]". Since this "[[Truncate what has worked in the past.]] judgment" is often accompanied by [[fear]], it is necessary to break through it with [[force]].

### digest
.
If, after position-making based on emotion, a decision based on reason is successful and the reason side grows, the successful reason side must be disposed of and reinvested in the sensibility side in order to maintain the proper balance. This is an "emo" philosophy, and although the decision to discard past successes is accompanied by fear, it is necessary to break through this fear with vigor.

These notes discuss the balance between emotion and reason, emotion-based decision making, objectification of emotion, the link between emotion and action, uncertainty and emotion, and the quality of decision making, and are related to the discussion of reinvestment to balance emotion and reason, and the decision to devalue past success.

### deep thinking
The balance between emotion and reason affects not only individual decisions, but also the overall quality of life and work. There is interdependence and interaction between emotion-based position making and reason-based decision making. The decision to devalue past successes is accompanied by fear, but breaking through it with momentum can open up new possibilities.
