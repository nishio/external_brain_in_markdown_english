title: "environmentally controlled power"
---

> Environmentally controlled power is a society in which people are created and changed so that their own desired behavior, rather than making others obey them, becomes the superior behavior for society (behavior that increases the productivity of society), so that no one thinks they are being controlled and everyone enjoys living on their own. A society in which people live as people who think they are being controlled, but who are in fact being manipulated by the powers that be. This is a model of a futuristic society that will be turned into a theme park. Conventional power is a disciplined and disciplined power.

The following is a summary of the academic establishment of the so-called "environmentally managed power" expression or what similar concepts are discussed in the literature. In conclusion, the term "environmentally managed power" itself is not a widely established academic term. However, there are several schools of thought and research that address similar ideas.

# 1. Michel Foucault's (Michel [[Foucault]]) theory of power
- Representative Bibliography:
    - The Birth of Prison: Discipline and Punish
    - The History of Sexuality, Volume 1, etc.
- Related Concepts: "[[Discipline training power]]", "[[biopower]]", "[[sovereignty]]", "[[governmentality]]"
- point:
    - Foucault discussed the internalized obedience of individuals through "discipline and surveillance" in modern society. In "Raw Power" and "Governmentality," Foucault also focuses on the mechanisms by which the state and society manage people's lives (health, work, lifestyle, etc.) and direct individual behavior in "desirable directions.
    - Although the term "environmentally managed power" does not appear in the book, the perspective of "directing the behavior of subjects through the institutional design of society as a whole and the living environment" has some overlap with the discussion of governmentality.

# 2. Gilles Deleuze's [[control society theory]]
- Representative Bibliography:
    - Addendum on the Societies of Control" ("Postscript on the Societies of Control", 1990s)
- point:
    - The paper discusses the transition from Foucault's "disciplined society" (a society that molds behavior in closed spaces such as factories, schools, and prisons) to one in which behavior is "controlled" in real time by electronic networks and information technology.
    - The way in which spaces themselves are designed to encourage "spontaneous action" by consumers and citizens, such as [[theme parkization]], can also be understood from Deleuze's "[[control society]]" perspective.

# 3. [[theme parkification]], [[consumer society theory]]
- Examples of main theorists and related literature:
    - Jean Baudrillard, "Myths and Structures of Consumer Society
    - [Alan Bryman, The Disneyization of Society
- point:
    - The creation of a theme park-like space creates an environment in which people "willingly" and "voluntarily" consume and act. Whether or not this is seen as a [[power apparatus]] is up to interpretation, but the perspective that "society is made to look like an amusement park, where people are manipulated in their behavior patterns without realizing it" is close to the image of environmental management-type power.

# 4. behavioral economics or [[nudge]] theory
- Representative Bibliography:
    - Richard Saylor and Cass Sanstine, Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness
- point:
    - The idea of guiding individual choices through "environmental settings" rather than coercion (e.g., people are more likely to make spontaneous healthy choices if healthy foods are placed in dining halls where they are easy to get, etc.).
    - This is also explained as "soft guidance" rather than "power," but the fact that the environment itself is intentionally designed to lead the subject's behavior in a desirable direction can be viewed as manipulation through "environmental management.



# Summary
.
- The term "environmentally managed power" itself.
    - Rather than being a formal term for a widely established theory of power, it is thought to be an expression that emerged (or is used for convenience) as a result of a comprehensive reading of Foucault's theory of governmentality, Deleuze's control society theory, and the nudge theory of behavioral economics, mentioned above.
- "It is desirable for society that the other party behaves as it wishes to behave itself" design.
    - The idea of going one step further from what Foucault calls "discipline-training power" to induce "spontaneous action" by designing a more holistic environment is closely related to the ideas mentioned above.
- "theme park-ization" image.
    - It is often associated with the consumer society and Disneyfication theories of Baudrillard, Bryman, and others.

Thus, the image of "environmentally managed power" in the question text can be thought of as a cross-cutting interpretation of Foucault's "biopower," Deleuze's "control society," and behavioral economics' "nudge." As for the exact source corresponding to each phrase, similar discussions can be found in the above literature, but it should be noted that the term "environmentally-managed power" itself is not explicitly mentioned in any single authoritative literature.

> Part 3: Modern power has changed to "environmentally managed" power
> What is interesting is the change in the power structure from "discipline training-type power" to "environmental management-type power," as Higashi points out in "Thinking Freedom" (NHK Books, 2003). The former is conventional power "based on the sharing of [[The Big Story]]," which "instills norms = discipline in each person's inner self," while the latter only "physically restricts people's behavior. In contrast to the former, which is based on shared values as a foundational principle, the latter rather allows the coexistence of diverse values. Under environmentally controlled power, even though each individual may think he or she is acting as he or she pleases, the power side actually controls each individual and determines the degree of freedom to be given to him or her. This is supported by technologies such as personal authentication, networks, and ubiquitous computing.
