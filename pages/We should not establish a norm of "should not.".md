title: 'We should not establish a norm of "should not."'
---

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The [[norm]] of "[[should not]]" is itself based on [[values]] or [[social expectations]] that seek to limit certain actions. However, raising that [[counter-norm]] of "should not set up a norm" can lead to contradictions and further normative chains. In other words, [[a certain prohibition]] is also a kind of norm, and the act of trying to deny it is also establishing a new norm.

Given this [[cycle of norms]], it can be said that the ideals of [[complete freedom]] and absolute [[absence of constraints]] are difficult to achieve in the relativity of norms. As a result, rather than eliminating the notion of "[[should not]]" altogether, a realistic solution would be to diversify norms and allow [[norm flexibility]] depending on the situation.

This composition is also connected to the norm's conception of "[[autonomy (philosophy)]]" and "[[individual judgment]]," which requires a deeper understanding of the self and the social framework.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Right. If we prohibit all norms x, we would end up with a "no norms" norm, which would be self-contradictory. Therefore, it is preferable to limit the scope of norm x and allow it the flexibility to apply to specific situations or subjects.
