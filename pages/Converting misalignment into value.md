1.### [[process oriented psychology]] is a concrete measure for [misalignment utilization
.
    - In Chapter 3, there was talk of writing a more specific methodology for "[[AI-mediated discussions]]" and "[[using]] intersubjectivity as a source of emergence.
        - The process that [[process-oriented psychology]] (Mindel) emphasizes, "[[gaining]] new insights by intentionally handling conflicts and misalignments without suppressing them," is very compatible with the perspective of "[[antivulnerability]]" and "converting misalignments into value" in this paper.
    - Therefore, a practical explanation tied to AI-mediated communication could be reinforced by citing and applying the workshop method of process-oriented psychology and other methods as examples of concrete implementations in Chapter 3.

2.### Analog games as a complement or alternative to "drinking games"
.
    - The "significance of [[physical shared experiences]] (drinking sessions)" is discussed in Chapter 4, and the commenter states that he is using [[analog games]] as his own initiative.
        - While [[get-together]] is suited for sharing emotions and physicality, games have the advantage of forming a natural "field" of rules and dialogues, and of allowing each other's subjectivity to be expressed in the form of "play.
    - This is also an effective mechanism for creatively visualizing misalignments, and demonstrates the various possibilities as a means of offline "[[Sympathetic Infrastructure Formation]]".

3.### Expansion of concrete examples that readers can easily put into practice
.
    - Although the original text has abstract concepts such as "drinking sessions" and "online/offline two-stage setup," by presenting yet another tool (game or workshop method), it becomes easier to get a concrete image that "I can do it too.
    - The comments increase the number of options that can be addressed by those who are not comfortable with drinking or who prefer other means of communication, and increase the persuasiveness and application of the discussion.
