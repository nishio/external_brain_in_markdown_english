- It has been discussed in detail by philosophers [[Michel Foucault]] and [Gilles Deleuze.

- Disciplinary Society
        - According to [[type of dramatic recitation accompanied by a shamisen (associated with the Japanese puppet theater)]], a disciplined society is one in which power is exercised in a specific closed space (e.g., school, hospital, factory, prison). A disciplined society is one in which power is exercised in a specific closed space (such as a school, hospital, factory, prison, etc.).
    - In this type of society, individuals are expected to follow rules and norms within a specific time and space, which regulate their behavior.
    - Individual actions are strictly monitored, recorded, and controlled.

- Society of Control
    - On the other hand, the concept of a managed society proposed by [[Deleuze.]] refers to a society that has evolved further from Foucault's disciplined society.
    - In a managed society, power is freed from closed spaces and extends throughout the individual's daily life.
    - Examples include continuing education, home electronic monitoring, and day care.
    - In this type of society, individual behavior is consistently tracked, evaluated, and adjusted.
    - This is a kind of "intangible prison," where power is exercised not through physical closure but through information and networks.

These two concepts provide a useful framework for understanding how forms of power and social control have evolved over time.
