> [@gadd9](https://twitter.com/gadd9/status/1530014603937054720?s=20&t=g-G3ipVlNFCNE3ObFGdz9w): "It's not good to assume that just because one person is like that, everyone is like that." Of course it is, I know. But "there is only one person like that and no one else who would do such a thing" is also incorrect with a very high probability. If you want to be frustrated, show me that everyone else is sane.
