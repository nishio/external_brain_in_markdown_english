- 1:
    - They shared the food they took in a small group of blood relatives.
        - [[joint deposit]], [[reciprocal gift]], community, exchange style A
- 2:
    - The more people, the less successful it will be -> need a "governing" (RULE) mechanism
    - Protect if you obey, punish if you don't follow the rules, state, exchange style B
- 3:
    - Private "contracts" made possible by the power of the state to "punish you if you don't play by the rules".
        - If you break the contract, the state power retaliates against you, which creates a deterrent and protects the contract.
    - Currency, investment, markets, division of labor with faceless people, capitalism, mechanisms broader than the state, modes of exchange C
- Through the exchange style A -> B -> C, [[recovery at a higher level of exchange style A]] takes place, which is the X of Gyoto Karatani.
