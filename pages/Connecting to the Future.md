title: "Connecting to the Future"
---

The phrase "leading to the future" is a common phrase when a [[middle-aged man who is always in the dark]] "rewards and punishes" a [[young man]] for one's past performance.
- But [[the reward for success is]] the opportunity for the next success.
        - [Capitalizing on Opportunities
            - [[The Parable of the Tallantons]]

In a society of good people, this is a positive value transaction
- Bad people mimic that trade.
    - Imitates a transaction of positive value so it can be misinterpreted as positive value
    - Mislead people into making transactions of negative value.
    - Bad people gain in the short term.

As this information spreads, people will think, "This is a negative value transaction."
- That would make the bad guy's scheme untenable.
- But the "positive value transaction" that was causing [[long-term value creation]] also ceases to exist at the same time.

I wonder which is better for society as a whole.
