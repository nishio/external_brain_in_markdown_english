title: "To-Do Management"
---

Q: Which apps do you use to manage your to-dos?
A: I also use sticky notes for to-do management.
- I think digital's characteristics of "you can write as much as you want" and "you can't see what's off the screen" are counterproductive for task management.
- To-dos that are never started accumulate and become filled with garbage.
- There should be a cap on the amount.
- It is important that the list be kept up to date.
- By fitting task management into the framework of the "sticky note and KJ method," the number of tasks that can be run concurrently is naturally limited to about 100.
- My personal ability to execute becomes more of a problem than my ability to manage the task management system.
    - If I were in a position to manage tasks for more than one person, it might be a different story.
- On the other hand, time- and GPS-triggered reminder functions are in favor of digital.

- Related [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]] Chapter 2, p. 51 Get an overall picture of the task, Chapter 5, p. 149 Write it down and arrange it to make it more listable.

- PS
    - There is a big difference between [[Task Management]] by yourself and managing tasks involving other people.
    - Nothing gets done unless you act." v.s. "It's all about how you can make sure that a lot gets done while you do nothing."
    - Maybe we should separate the two as they are very different.
