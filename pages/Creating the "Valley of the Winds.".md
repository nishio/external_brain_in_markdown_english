title: 'Creating the "Valley of the Winds."'

Now that the local commons can no longer be protected by local residents alone for various reasons (in the case of Japan, the macro cause is the declining population and aging society), what people outside the community and those living in the community can agree on is to “create a disaster-ready community. For example, a village where people can live comfortably even if the outside temperature reaches 50 degrees Celsius and is self-sufficient in energy and water. This is an activity to create a safety net for everyone while protecting the local commons. Perhaps it is time to create a “valley of the winds” in each region, as depicted in the Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki's “Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind.
