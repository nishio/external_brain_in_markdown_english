    - > In 1997, Yaohan Japan filed for bankruptcy under the Corporate Reorganization Law and went bankrupt with total liabilities of 161.3 billion yen... After the bankruptcy, Yaohan Japan's window dressing was revealed, and the author's second brother, who was the president, was arrested on suspicion of illegal dividends. The author regrets that he was too busy with overseas strategies in his position as chairman to detect the window dressing and to make appropriate appointments to the president, saying that it was "a matter of a thousand pains. In particular, he recalls that in 1995, when Yaohan Japan incurred its first consolidated loss, his inability to make a decision to replace the president due to the affection of his immediate family contributed to the company's bankruptcy.
