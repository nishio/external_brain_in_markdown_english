- Passing information through the brain's web
- 1: Close is Connected
- 2: Distant things don't connect
    - drift away
- The amount of material that can be removed through a fine mesh is different from the amount of material that can be removed through the same mesh.
    - The latter is more common.
    - Likewise, a person with a dense web of knowledge is more likely to be left with the same text.
        - Associations: [[knowledge network]].

Creating artificial nets

    - The web on the desk and the web in the brain
    - Artificial and natural nets
    - After I painted the picture, I thought I'd better put it through a natural net first.
    - Those who use only natural nets, those not caught in the net will drift away.
    - Those who also use artificial nets are pooled on the artificial nets once the ones that did not get caught in the natural nets
        - They will be [[Bridging and Connecting]] later.
    - Q: What is the difference between simply stocking a list or other information?
        - A: I don't have an answer for this yet.
            - In fact, is it possible to have just a list without using Kozaneba, etc.?

- [[parable of the net]] # even if
