title: "Make a two-dimensional array into a sequence of coordinates"

[$ f: (x, y)→\{0, 1\}
[$ \{(x, y) | f(x, y) = 1\}

Advantages
- Rotation implementation available
- The process in its original form is O(N^2) with width N, but advantageous when $M := \sum f$ is asymptotically smaller than that

- [[problem transformation]]
