<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT-4/icon' alt='GPT-4.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Many people call [[GPT-4]] [[ChatGPT]], but many still use [[GPT-3.5]].
- There is a large [[intelligence gap]] between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.
- Since less than a month has passed since the GPT-4 release, there is a large gap in perception among users.
- [[The same word can refer to different things]], so it is important to check what they mean.
- GPT-3.5 is assumed because GPT-4 is too high for business use.
- The [[gap in perception]] between users and developers is widening.

> [@kmizu](https://twitter.com/kmizu/status/1644878155818373120): I do almost all of my benchmarking stuff these days on the GPT-4, because with the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, there's just no way around it. I think that there is an uncontrollable "intelligence gap" between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.
> And yet, it has been less than a month since GPT-4 was released, and I think the gap in perception between 3.5 users and 4 users is also quite large.

> [@kmizu](https://twitter.com/kmizu/status/1644878157558976513?s=20): There are so many cases that are "not understood" in GPT-3.5, but "understood" in GPT-4, that I think the argument based on GPT-3.5 is no longer valid in the future. I think GPT-3.5 based arguments are no longer valid.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1644913612061032449) Ah, yes, indeed. I've been using GPT-4 for a long time too, so the term "ChatGPT" would refer to "GPT-4 instead of GPT-3.5", but 3.5 is the majority in the world, so the concept has already caused a discrepancy.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1644921176463151106) But here's what it actually looks like: it's actually the same word for different things.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1644921609529200640) I think @fladdict said a long time ago that "Money functions as [[an Early Access Right to the Future]]". I think @fladdict was talking about "Money functions as [[an Early Access Right to the Future]]".

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1644921894074982401) I didn't draw it in the diagram, but there are "people who [[haven't even]] tried 3.5 in the first place" outside the column, maybe that's the majority

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1644923498396274690) I drew that too.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1644956834728677378) It's important to check what the other person means by the word. When the other person says "smartphone," if you are using an iPhone, you subconsciously assume that the other person is also using an iPhone, but in reality it may be a smartphone that is easy to use.

> [techtalkjp](https://twitter.com/techtalkjp/status/1644922588848885760) If I do this for work, I will have to use gpt-3.5 as the premise since gpt-4 is too expensive for business use. I'll have to use gpt-3.5 as a premise.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1644925019691294721) Well, that's true. And the people who make and press out a feature in business don't say, "I'm using 3.5, not 4!" The gap between the users of the feature and "people who touch 4 themselves" is going to get wider and wider!

> [kmizu](https://twitter.com/kmizu/status/1644916366066204674) I was the one who was off, but once I saw all the responses, I said, "Oh. I remembered that most people were 3.5", right?

> [ringo](https://twitter.com/ringo/status/1644916459720822785) I also say default as 4.
