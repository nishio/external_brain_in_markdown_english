Improvements to [private-omni
- [[Move IterativeCommenter to private]]
- Ah, so [[Iterative Commenter]] is running on public Github Actions and doesn't have private data?
- Right now private omni is running in a local environment.
    - That would be a hassle if the machine breaks down or something.

- [[Neri Neri's value is slowly decreasing.]]
- > I noticed a spec bug.
    - [[omni spec bug]]

How to improve
- How you want to use it
    - [[Extension of red link]]
        - [[SLOW SEARCH]]
            - You can make the process longer.
        - landing
            - Cases where you want to land your ideas in someone else's context, patterns that you can hit from within your own ideas.
                    - [[Neri Neri's value is slowly decreasing.]]
            - In the first place, isn't there a pattern that needs to be reversed to land other people's ideas in their own context, but there isn't?
    - [[Long-term project]]
            - [[🌀I want AI to manage tasks for long-term parallel projects.]]
            - This page itself does.
            - Not detailed enough to begin implementation now
            - Write down your thoughts and put them to bed.
            - I'd like to look back over time and flesh it out.
        - I think it would be a good idea to put only publicly available projects in this Scrapbox, and private projects are hidden in the back, but the project management itself should be done in private-omni.
