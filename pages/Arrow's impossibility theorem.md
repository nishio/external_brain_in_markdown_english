>  [[Amartya Sen.]], "[[Collective Choice and Social Welfare]]", translated by Motoyoshi Shida, Keiso Shobo, 2000.
>  [seems to be required reading on [[social choice theory (e.g. Rousseau's)]]. See chapters 3 and 6.2.

> Geoffrey Brennan, `The contribution of economics', in Robert E. Goodin and Philip Pettit ed., A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy, Oxford: Blackwell, 1993, 123-156.
> In his interpretation, what Arrow's theorem implies is that in order to give a proper meaning to "[[public interest (e.g., public good)]]," it is necessary to perform an "interindividual comparison of utility" (p. 136).
- Interindividual comparison of utility → [[Quadratic Voting]].
