title: "color bath effect"

It is difficult to answer the question, "Answer the red things you have seen in the past," but if you are conscious of looking for red things, you will see a lot of them. This effect was introduced in "[[contrivance]]".

> Before I leave the house in the morning, I decide on my "lucky color of the day". Red? Blue? Yellow? It can be any color. For example, "Red today! and go to work as usual. Then, commute to work as usual. Then, you see a lot of red cars today. ...... You don't know what it is, but strangely you see a lot of red cars. You also see red outdoor billboard advertisements. This is the color bus effect.

As one of the "Thinking tools that get information into your head," this article introduces a technique that allows you to discover a variety of information in a city that otherwise looks "the same as usual" by setting an unusual "section" called color. This is one of the "Thinking tools that get information into your head".

> The Color Bus is a tool that tells you [[Broadening the scope of discovery]] when you focus [[Viewpoints to Watch]] on an unusual genre.

It is often spoken of as a "psychological term" without exhibiting it, but I have researched [article [http://www.kariness.com/entry/2018/02/05/インターネットで偉くなった](http://www.kariness.com/entry/2018/02/05/インターネットで偉くなった) "Color Bus Effect"] to the effect that it is a hoax.
There is no reference to the "color bath effect" on the Internet before "kōgu" and no mention of it being a psychological term in "kōgu," which appears to be the source.
