title: "Accelerate your contemplation to reach the edge of experience"
---

- By accelerating the [[linguistic]] [[speculation]], you can quickly get to the [[edge]] of [[experience]] where you say, "I guess we'll never know unless we actually do this and [[observe]] it." It makes sense to get to the [[edge]] of [[experience]] and go from there.

relevance
    - [[Work to open up the forest of what has yet to be written.]]
    - [[one must see with one's own eyes]]
    - [[Trade-off between speculation and development]]

[[edge]] or [[abyss]], undecided.
- [[abyss]] is more [[metafolic]].
