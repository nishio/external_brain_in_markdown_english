- S0: Step 0 is the assumption that the future is an extension of the past
- S1: Step 1 is where you realize that there may be significant changes in the future.
        - By [[awareness]], [[we're]] taking [[one step forward]], but we're only taking one step back.
    - I don't think you can look back and laugh at someone with S0 in that state.
- S2: Describing the landscape as it appears to me at the moment
    - Wind is blowing strongly, represented by blue translucent arrows
    - That will change the course of your career.
        - I'm thinking "not 100" with the previous extensions at this point as 100.
    - There is a zero at the end of that path, but I doubt it will reach zero.
        - [[resistance]] indicated by gray arrows.
            - The [[air resistance]] metaphor
        - [[The things that are easy to change will change and the things that are hard to change will be left behind.]]
        - Historically, sometimes it was zero, sometimes it wasn't.
        - There are options that stabilize along the way, and there are patterns that asymptotically approach zero but take longer than expected to reach zero.

[[0 or 100]] is [[1bit thoughts]] [[resolution too low]], [[need more resolution to see further]].
