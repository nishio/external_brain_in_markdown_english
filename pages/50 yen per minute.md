title: "50 yen per minute"
---

- An example of a ratio that is easy to understand in considering the exchange ratio of time and money.
- Of course, it varies several times from person to person, but the purpose is not to calculate accurately but to "have a rough skin feeling"
- So it is better to adopt a ratio that is easy to remember without considering the details.

- What is 50 yen per minute?
    - 3,000 yen for an hour's work
    - 8 hours a day, 20 days a month for 12 months, 5,760,000 yen

- You could make it "[[1 yen per second]]" at 60 yen per minute, which is only 1.2 times the difference.
        - [[Example of 1 yen per second calculation (Rhodia)]]
