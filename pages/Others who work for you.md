- Opinions elicited by the expression [[Others who work for you]] in [Computational Thinking is a monarchical theory
In this context, I thought I would probably choose "moving" instead of "working".

> I thought "others who work for you" was connotative. It was originally described as slaves.
> I think that [[Measure what matters]] (OKR's book) and [[teal organization]] describe a change from an image of employees who do what they are told (slaves) to an image of employees who voluntarily achieve some goals (others who work for them). I think it is.
