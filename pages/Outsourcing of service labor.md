title: "Outsourcing of service labor"

> Service labor becomes outsourced. Work that is outside the organization's value system cannot be promoted from that area to top management. Thus, no one in top management has sufficient knowledge, no matter how costly. Hospitals focus on patient care. Therefore, building maintenance and clerical work receive little attention, even if they account for half of the hospital's costs.
> Improving maintenance productivity is a primary concern for maintenance companies.

Is it true that "improving maintenance [[productivity]] is a primary concern for maintenance companies"?
I am now considering contracting with [[Online Secretarial Services]], but payment is on a "pay for time spent" basis. They don't seem to have any incentive to save time.
Outsourcing service labor may not necessarily lead to [[increased productivity]].
