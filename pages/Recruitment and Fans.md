> [tnsm0223](https://twitter.com/tnsm0223/status/1110508552165036032): I've been doing a lot of interviews for new graduates recently, and my impression is that there are more and more "[[fan]]" groups, as this article calls them. While this is gratifying, there are certain cases where we can't reach a mutual match at this point in time. pic.twitter.com/QMGKQ2NF3K

> [tnsm0223](https://twitter.com/tnsm0223/status/1110510020079157248): Rather than being primarily concerned with "I want to work freely in a diverse environment," why do we need groupware to create a society full of teamwork? Why do we need groupware to create a society full of teamwork? It is easier to imagine a future in which we can work together to achieve our ideals if you tell us how you are trying to work from the perspective of "Why is groupware necessary to create a society where teamwork abounds?

> [tnsm0223](https://twitter.com/tnsm0223/status/1110512683894206466): Instead of hanging on to "I want to work for a company full of teamwork," "[[Creating a society full of teamwork]]" I wonder if there is a difference here. I wonder if this is the difference. Freedom to work" and "a workplace where diverse personalities can be utilized" are the status quo of society (= customers) that we need to change. People inside the company are not at all attached to those aspects.
- [[Diverse personalities will be brought to life]].
    - [[Diverse personalities]].

> [tnsm0223](https://twitter.com/tnsm0223/status/1110515931812265986): According to "Fanbase", core fans seem to be comrades who help companies in times of distress. However, as long as fans are "service recipients", I don't think the relationship between company ⇔ customer will change. How do we exchange value with fans (= customers)? If we don't take the viewpoint of "how to exchange value with fans (= customers)," it will be difficult to imagine working together with them.

> [tnsm0223](https://twitter.com/tnsm0223/status/1110517040941391872): If I am a fan of a company, what can I do for my potential and actual customers to make them happy while also What can I do for my potential and actual customers to make them happy and increase my company's profit? This is the kind of perspective that is needed. Take a critical look at the company. Propose what issues need to be addressed. I think that is what Mr. Tabata is talking about when he says, "Be rightly dismissive.

> [tnsm0223](https://twitter.com/tnsm0223/status/1110517852430229504): For example, I'm a fan of Tenshizhu Brewery, but I'm not going to think about the problems with their business model and try to solve them by getting involved in management or making sake. I am a fan of Tensho Shuzo, but I don't want to be involved in the management or the brewing of sake in order to solve the problems of the business model. At that point, I am probably just a "fan" and a "good customer. I wonder if the determination to seriously try to fulfill the company's ideals is what creates "mutual love".

> [tnsm0223](https://twitter.com/tnsm0223/status/1110545960826859522): To add a bit more, I guess the "corporate ideal" is "what we should do (what society wants us to do)". If my "what I can do" and "what I want to do" overlap here, I think I can enjoy working here. It is said that "Will, Can, Must," and I think it is really important to reconcile these three.

>  "I want to work in a company full of teamwork" gives me a passive feeling that "the company is already full of teamwork and I am a beneficiary". Cybozu's definition of "a company full of teamwork" is the exact opposite, as it is an active attitude of "making our own company and our clients' companies full of teamwork in order to create a society full of teamwork.
