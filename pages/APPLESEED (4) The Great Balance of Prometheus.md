> Now that our coexistence with technology is undeniable, we must know how to use it for good and what to avoid.
> If we fail to do so (control) and allow emotionalism to hinder the progress of science and technology or, conversely, allow them to run amok, then we will be able to achieve our goals.
> We will not be far behind, and the whole earth will perish.
