title: "Stair climbing is bouldering."

- The bouldering experience has developed a sense of "is my weight on my feet?"
    - If you're on a slab wall and your weight is on your feet, you can stand on one leg and your hand can only maintain posture.

- Based on this experience, the act of climbing stairs, which I had been doing unconsciously, is an act of lifting my body by putting my weight on one leg.
    - Isn't [[stair climbing]] [[bouldering]]?
        - You've finally reached this point.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - It's not cost-effective to go up the stairs every day, but it's not impossible to go up and down the stairs while having lunch in front of the station.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Observing from that perspective, I've noticed a tendency for the right knee to run outward.
        - The result is unsteady posture and unnecessary use of force.

    - If you shift your weight slowly, being careful not to let your knees run outward?
        - Isn't this more inside where the right foot should have landed in the first place?
        - So if you keep going, your center of gravity will be outward and to the right, and your knees and upper body will be balanced by the left to prevent your upper body from falling to the right.
        - I wonder if this is why my right knee hurts when I climb mountains and why I was prone to twisting my right ankle when I was wearing regular shoes in the first place.
        - Did you find it easier if you tried to place your feet a bit on the outside?
    - I was descending like a penguin, and my upper body was so shaky that I could understand why I almost fell down on the downhill mountain road.
        - I'm not sure about the right way down.
        - I'd bend my knees to lower my center of gravity, leaving my weight on the mountain side.
