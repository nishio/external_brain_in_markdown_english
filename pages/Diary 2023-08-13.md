- I wrote in my last note about my considerations developed in [[Co-operation with AI]] and they were ignored in their entirety.
- After all, if you have a feeling that you want people to use this, you should explicitly instruct them to do so.
- If you want to control it properly, you should separate the steps.
- The previous note should not be repeated in its entirety.
- It's not a good idea to throw away all the notes from last time.
- It's important that the thoughts develop from the previous note.
    - Otherwise, we're just doing one random gacha per day, and there's no point in having a "previous note".
- Better to find a connection between the previous note and the current fragment

from the start
> Read the information provided, which consists of random fragments from a colleague's research notes
> You can read your own research notes
This prompt clearly tells me that random notes are more important than my own notes, my English is bad.

>  Read your previous research notes, which are essential
>  You may also read the random fragments from a colleague Nishio's research notes
Changed it to this.

But there are a lot of functions that need to be developed to "adjust the input/output to meet the legal requirements", and it takes 2-3 years each to build them to have high versatility and excellent UX". I feel like I'm watching coffee boil on a coffee server. ‚òïÔ∏è
