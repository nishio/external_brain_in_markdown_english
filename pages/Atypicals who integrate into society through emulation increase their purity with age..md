title: "Atypicals who integrate into society through emulation increase their purity with age."

The type of Asperger's that emulates a high IQ, stereotypically developed person and integrates into society, the emulator's performance declines with age and Asperger's-like traits increase.

Asperger's] who, like me, blend into the world of typical people by emulating the behavior of a [[socially awkward person]] with a high IQ, become closer to normal Asperger's as they age and the computational power to run the emulator declines. As they age, they become more like normal Asperger's.

In other words, you will not be able to predict how they will react emotionally to what you say more and more in the future.
I'm in trouble.
We must destroy the stereotypical developers as soon as possible (black joke).
