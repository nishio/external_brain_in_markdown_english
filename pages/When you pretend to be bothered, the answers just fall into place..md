title: "When you pretend to be bothered, the answers just fall into place."

>  To begin with.
>  Showing some kind of distress.
>  "I've been [[pretending to be bothered]] for a while.
>  "[[answer]]" is someone else's downfall.
>  I've learned that it's a thing.
>
>  Therefore.
>  "I'm having so much trouble (showing you), and you still won't tell me the right answer?" I have been told (continued)

> [yontengoP](https://x.com/yontengoP/status/1857225558263996650) And what's more, the problem is...
>  The source code that he created is riddled with errors and doesn't work, so do something about it,
>  and that's what I'm talking about.
>
>  It's not that you're being mean or trying to
>  from "I can't solve it either unless I look at the errors one at a time.
>
>  "I actually know the answer, but you're deliberately being a tease and not telling me!" And that it's not like that.

> [yontengoP](https://x.com/yontengoP/status/1857226486639669315) and we ended up looking at his source together.
>
>  (To be very specific)
>  Write source without understanding it well
>  Apply QuickFix as Eclipse says if you get an error.
>  The source code became more and more different from what it was supposed to be, full of mysterious extensions and imports, and finally Eclipse could no longer modify it automatically, so I asked for help.
- I think that with the advancement of AI, "change as AI says" -> "I don't understand anymore" is going to happen frequently...

> [yontengoP](https://x.com/yontengoP/status/1857277201340924261) and ended up
>  Delete unwanted external libraries
>  Re-install library for field use
>  Erase compile errors
>  Add {numbers not matching}
>  And while we're at it, fix the indentation...
>
>  and in the process, I've been able to
>  I even explained to him, "There's a ; in here, so it's an error..."
>  Maybe he didn't seem interested.

> [yontengoP](https://x.com/yontengoP/status/1857278173714800893) He's not interested in technology, but he's a communicator, so I didn't tell him straight out.
>  "Um, can I ask you to do that?" I don't want to be in the way, and I probably don't even know what I'm looking at right now, so can I go ahead and leave? I don't know if you can see me right now,
>
>  I think he probably just wanted to throw it to me and get the hell out of here.

> [yontengoP](https://x.com/yontengoP/status/1857279344173027386) and the hard part is.
>
>  I don't want to be punitive and say, "No, stay there until I'm done!" I don't want to be punitive, and if I ask them to stay, it would mean overtime, and I don't have the authority to tell them to do so.
>  "I can't tell you to stay, so if you want to leave, go ahead," I said.
>
>  After all, I was still coding as Eclipse told me to, with errors all over the place, and it didn't change.

> [yontengoP](https://x.com/yontengoP/status/1857280047088037903) several times, "Um, the way you program it, you'll always be left to others like this, and it won't help..."
>  I told you that.
>  No! Well! I'll do my best!
>  "I'm sorry," was the cheerful reply, and that was the end of it.
>
>  I thought, "I don't want to be resented by the employees of other companies for interfering any more...
>  I left it alone (continued)

> [yontengoP](https://x.com/yontengoP/status/1857281703297126539) On one occasion, a sales person from that other company came to the site to talk to us.
>  Straight.
>  From what I'm seeing, I don't think you understand it and program it.
>  I think we're in trouble in the future because we're ending up leaving it to others and having a hard time at other sites.
>  I think it would be better to have him study with a senior colleague somewhere...
>  I told you that.

> [yontengoP](https://x.com/yontengoP/status/1857283558337065163) Sales: "No, really, it's the help of 4.5P and the other super engineers on site! I really look forward to working with you in the future!
>  to say and
>
>  Ahhhh, this company
>
>  Putting out-of-strength workers on the field for a low price,
>  Good luck if he miraculously blossoms
>  If we are lucky and another company wipes our asses, all the better.
>  I thought it was a strategy to dump them when they can no longer be included in the case.

> [yontengoP](https://x.com/yontengoP/status/1857286538436178108) And, as I said, I'm also a person from another company.
>  I can't say, "Your company sucks, you should change jobs.
>  "We've been working on the site to clean up the mess," and have them transferred to a different team.
>  Though I'm free from his care.
>
>  > Perhaps there was no one left to take care of him after that, or maybe he left the scene.

> [yontengoP](https://x.com/yontengoP/status/1857287286377083157) In a way he is too,
>  I feel sorry for him, because maybe he came to the IT industry as a new graduate or a second graduate and was taught that "this is how to work, to involve other companies 《Involve》.
>
>  When you turn 25 and then 30 like that.
>  I sometimes wonder what's going on, or if there's something going on...
>
>  I don't know.
