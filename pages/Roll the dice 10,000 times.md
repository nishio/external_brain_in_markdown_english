title: "Roll the dice 10,000 times"
---

> [OgaTatsu_NAC](https://x.com/OgaTatsu_NAC/status/1829096655972643097) There was a junior high school student who rolled the dice 10,000 times during his junior high summer vacation to find out if the probability really approaches 1/6 on every roll. I wonder if he was taught what the "law of large numbers" is.
>  Then you wouldn't understand how a [[sample survey]] could be done at all.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1829304217837945221) People whose job is to educate junior high school students are supplied with "junior high school students who don't know what they know" every year, and they spend a lot of time communicating with them. When a student who is better than the teacher appears once in a while, they start to have [[cognitive dissonance]] and start to say funny things.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1829372576503595375) Since this is a structural problem and funny middle school teachers will continue to occur, it might be better to promote the idea on the part of students that "teachers sometimes say funny things, too, so if what you did was not evaluated by a nearby teacher, you should not think that what you did was not worthwhile and look for someone else to evaluate it. It might be better to promote the idea that "teachers sometimes say funny things, so even if what you did was not evaluated by a nearby teacher, you should not think what you did was worthless, but should look for someone else to evaluate it" on the part of the students!
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1829382418337501651) Well, independently of that, it is a loss for society when talented middle school students are crushed by teachers who say strange things, so I thought it would be a good idea to criticize teachers when they say strange things. I thought it would be a good idea to criticize teachers when they say strange things, because it is an act to improve society.

>  "The whole class rolls the dice around to make sure the result is 1/6."
>  It was. I'm not being shallow, like it's obvious that the law of large numbers makes it closer to 1/6, so there's no point in looking it up.


> [sakura_osamu](https://x.com/sakura_osamu/status/1829817253879300475) I've always wondered if the dice are actually not perfectly 1/6 because the center of gravity is slightly off because the number of holes in the dice is different on each side. I have always wondered if the dice are actually not perfectly equal to 1/6. I talked to a statistician about that before, and he said that there is a paper (unconfirmed) that actually did it and looked into it. If so, this 3rd grader's question is as good as an expert's!

> [domoboku](https://x.com/domoboku/status/1830199498057941364) I saw a post where a math teacher ridiculed a middle school student who experimented with 10,000 rolls because the probability of each dice coming up is 1/6, but the eighth grader made a hypothesis and experimented I would like to see the research that confirmed that 'the probability of getting each eye is not 1/6, and that there is a large variation, especially with dice with dimples' widely known.

> [kaityo256](https://x.com/kaityo256/status/1830077046912897185) Student experiments in college, why do we have to do experiments where we know the outcome is obvious, is an interesting topic. I think the answer differs from teacher to teacher, but for me it is "because I want them to acquire a raw sense of numbers".
> [kaityo256](https://x.com/kaityo256/status/1830078714484232262) For elasticity, "Is this material in MPa or GPa?"; for optical excitation, "How long is the laser wavelength to cause this phenomenon? How much is the current?" for electromagnetism, "How many trials does it take to get this level of accuracy?" for the law of large numbers, etc. I want students to acquire a sense of numbers that is difficult to acquire from books.
> [kaityo256](https://x.com/kaityo256/status/1830082472513806705) For example, with electromagnetism, you know amperage and watts, but it's hard to get a sense from a textbook of how dangerous it is. For current, 50mA is huge, or for lasers, 0.5W to class 4, etc. I want students to learn that sense through safety measures in experiments.
> [kaityo256](https://x.com/kaityo256/status/1830083467667005586) I believe that professional education in the sciences is about "[[acquiring]] a sense of numbers," and for example, in my field of study, classical MD, one can acquire a sense of whether 1 million atoms are too many or too few. For example, in the case of classical MD, which is my specialty, whether one million atoms is too many or too few, or whether the temperature of 1.0 in the LJ unit meter is high or low, I believe that one acquires a sense of these things through continuous daily calculations.
