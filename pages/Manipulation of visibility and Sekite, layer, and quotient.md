We are talking about three different "[[manipulations of visibility]]" that can be reused by dropping them into the same mathematical frame.

Correspondence (intuition)
_
| Manipulation of Reality What Changes? Vessels in the abstract |
| -- |
| Change of [[way of saying]] (expression, translation, change of viewpoint) Change the way A is mapped without touching A itself. |
| Change [[delimiters]] (chapters/scope/context) How much of a context is the same as another layer/pre-layer (pasting together each "open set") |
| Change of [[bundling method]] (alias/synonymous integration granularity) How far to equate Quotient (divide by equivalence relation / trajectory of group action) |
Point:
- The three appear to be separate, but are actually all "view conversions".
- When put on the instrument (Sekitei/Layer/Quotient), synthesis, comparison, and difference detection can be done with the same moves.

1) Change of wording = Sekite
- Example: The same event is referred to in a "technical memo", "summary for management", and "English translation".
- Advantages of capturing with the function hand:
    - Synthesizable (evaluate the order effect of the chain, e.g., specialized -> plain -> summary).
    - Can say preserved/unpreserved (e.g., keep evidence links but increase ambiguity).
- Diversion: research -> public relations, design -> support, education -> exam preparation... the same evaluation axis can be used across expression types.

2) Change of delimitation = layer
- E.g., "Talk about the chapter alone/talk about the book as a whole/include related externals".
- The advantage of capturing it in layers:
    - Local-global alignment can be measured ([[affixation failure]]`[c]` detects "correct in part but misaligned in whole").
    - Boundary operations (opening and closing of ranges) can be reused in other areas.
- Diversion: departmental summary ↔ company-wide document, functional unit ↔ whole product, class session ↔ whole semester... common treatment of contextual granularity issues.

3) Change in bundling method = quotient
- Examples: Garoon=Garoon=Gr(in-house)" as a bundle/not as a bundle, ICU=Intensive Care Unit or University.
- Advantages to be captured in the quotient:
    - The integration granularity can be continuously adjusted (finely differentiated ↔ roughly integrated).
    - Breaking the invariants (shortest path, cluster change) before/after the quotient can be treated as "novelty".
- Diversion: medical terminology, different notation of laws and regulations, social networking handles and real names... The danger/utility of identification is evaluated with the same tool.

Why is it advantageous to have the "same frame"?
1. order effects (noncommutative) can be handled in a batch
    - Bundle first and then cut the range (𝔅𝔔) vs. cut the range first and then bundle (𝔔𝔅) with difference = curvature 𝒦.
    - Even if the domain changes, the method of finding "order difference = novelty" can be used as it is.
2. reuse of invariants
    - The common judgment of "it's working/not working" is based on conserved quantities such as "shortest description", "commutativity", and "isotopes".
    - In any area, "if it breaks, it's a candidate for discovery".
3. common design of auditability
    - The separation (σ/ρ), where reference (source/location) is reversible and signification (summary/integration) is irreversible, works everywhere.
            - [[Meaning making can be broken.]]

Mini-Procedure (same process applies to all areas)
1. Sekite: copy the current wording in two ways (specialized ↔ plain, etc.) → record the difference.
2. layer: Check for lamination failure [[c]] by raising or lowering the grain size by one step.
3. quotient: aka change the granularity of the bundle by one level and look at the shortest path/cluster change before and after.
4. order: (1) → (2) → (3) and (3) → (2) → (1), turning both in order of difference = "hot spot".
5. back and forth: check whether the back and forth of the claim ⇄ root link is still there (if not, reject it).

summary sentence
If you put the saying (sekite), the dividing line (za), and the bundling line (shou) on the same vessel,
Order difference, storage volume, and auditability can be handled by a common set of rules.
Therefore, even if the area changes, the "discovery operations" can be transferred as they are.
