title: "Minecraft is the Metaverse"

[[Minecraft]] is pretty good [[metaverse]].
- You know what they are looking at.
- I know what they are trying to do (the tools in their hands).
- You can see the current status of their work (they're using the house and have just finished the walls, for example).
