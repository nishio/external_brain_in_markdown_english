- Mr. B is simply moving toward a "higher mountain" (something more interesting, etc.)
- If Mr. A acts, "I don't know what it is, but someone is going in that direction, so I'll go there too," he can observe the new mountain with his own eyes.
        - [[Trade-offs between use and exploration]]
- On the other hand, when Mr. A says, "B is a fool for not seeing the value in the mountain I'm on," or "C is a fraud for calling B out," the firing line gets tighter.
    - Because Mr. B will not invite Mr. A to a new mountain or meet Mr. C when Mr. A makes such a claim.
        - [[The world closes in on the naysayers.]]
