> [yuccaaa](https://x.com/yuccaaaa/status/1837021918899359768) "Don't we have to demand [[leadership]] from everyone? I used to think that too many leaders would be too much work." I used to think "Why don't we just ask everyone for [[leadership]]?
>
>  I recently attended a camp where leaders from various fields such as business managers, NPO representatives, politicians, medalists...etc. were gathered, and leaders are also good at becoming followers!
>  Specifically, the best community was created because out of 100 leaders, [[leaders of leaders]] would emerge and the rest would become [[active followers]], all of whom [[awareness of the parties concerned]] would be high in the moment.
>
>  I heard a while ago that "people with leadership skills also have high [[follower]] skills, because leaders know how difficult it is to move people together. I am convinced that this is exactly what you mean.
>
>  *I didn't mean more leaders as a role, I was talking about leadership as a skill, which is great!
