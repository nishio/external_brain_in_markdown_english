title: "innovation"

There is a persistent misunderstanding that "innovation = [[technological innovation]]," and it is tedious to explain it every time, so I have summarized it here.

- [[Schumpeter.]] : The term innovation was first defined in 1911.
- Innovation ([[new combination]]) refers to the [[coupling]] of means of production, resources, labor, etc. in an economic activity in a way that is different from what has been done before.
- There are five types of innovation.
    - Production of new goods, i.e. goods not yet known to consumers, or goods of new quality
    - Introduction of new production methods
    - Developing new sales channels
    - Acquiring new sources of raw or semi-finished products
    - Realization of a new organization

[[If innovation does not occur, the market economy will reach equilibrium]].
    - In the [[balance]] state of the [[market economy]], the entrepreneurial profit disappears.
    - So we must continue to innovate.
- Innovation can disturb the economy and increase imbalances [[prosperous conditions]].
- The economy then becomes [[recession]] in equilibrium.


- [[Drucker.]]
- > Innovation is not about invention. Nor is it a concept solely about technology. It is about the economy.
    - By P. F. Drucker [[Essential Edition Management]] p.18
- > The Meaning of Innovation Innovation is not science or technology per se, but value. It is the change it brings to the outside world, not within the organization. The measure of innovation is its impact on the outside world. Therefore, innovation must always be market-focused. Innovation focused on the product, not the market, may produce novel technologies, but the results will be disappointing.
    - Ibid. p. 267.

Innovation is not [[technological innovation]]. The measure of innovation is its impact on the outside world, so a major innovation is an event that has a major impact on the world.

What axis do you use to measure the "great" in "great impact"? What do you mean by "great" in "great impact"? It's a huge impact! But the term "innovation" was coined by economists in the context of an imbalance in the market economy, so it should be interpreted as a "major economic impact" rather than a "major scientific impact. Even if it is a scientifically great invention, if it did not have a significant impact on the market economy, it is not an innovation.

- [[Parable of the New Combination and the Surface of the Water]]

- [[Management of Innovation]]
> The term innovation is often confused with invention, which is one of the problems in innovation management. It is the process of transforming an opportunity into a new idea, and then nurturing it so that it can be put to widespread practical use.

### digest
.
Innovation is not technological innovation, but rather the combining of means of production, resources, and labor in new ways in economic activities. According to Schumpeter, there are five types of innovation, and if they do not occur, the market economy will reach equilibrium. Drucker defines innovation as pertaining to the economy and explains that the measure of innovation is its impact on the outside world. Innovation should have an economic impact, not a scientific impact, and if it does not have a significant impact on the market economy, it is not an innovation.

### Relation to Fragment
.
Fragment "Hatena2010-02-27" is consistent with the note, stating that innovation is value, not science or technology itself. Fragment "Hatena2010-03-30" also indicates that innovation is not limited to technology, which is also consistent with the note's assertion.

### deep thinking
Understanding the essential meaning of innovation is an important step in creating new value and economic impact. It is necessary to understand innovation from an economic perspective as well as scientific progress.

### summary of thoughts and title
.
