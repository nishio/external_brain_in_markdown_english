Created by Dentsu's 4th president [[Hideo Yoshida]] in 1951
- > 1.  [[Work should be created by oneself, not given to others.]] 。
- > 2. [Work is about being proactive and working ahead.
- > 3.[[Work with big jobs.]] Small jobs make you small.
- > 4. Aim for the hard work, and progress is made where this is accomplished.
- > 5.[[Don't let go once you've worked on it.]], Don't let go even if you're killed, until you've completed your objective. ......
- > 6. [[Drag around the perimeter.]], Dragging and being dragged can create a gap between heaven and earth for a long time.
- > 7. Have a plan, and if you have a long term plan, you will have patience, ingenuity, and the right effort and hope.
- > 8. be confident, because without confidence, your work has no power, tenacity, or even depth.
- > 9. The head must always be on a full tilt, mindful of all directions, and there must never be a minute lapse in service.
- > Don't be afraid of friction, [[Friction is the mother of progress and the fertilizer of positivity]], or you will become mean and unrefined.

- [[Progress is made where difficult tasks are accomplished.]]
- [[From long-term planning comes patience, ingenuity, and the right kind of effort and hope.]]
- [[From confidence comes power, tenacity, and thickness.]]
- [[What is work?]]
