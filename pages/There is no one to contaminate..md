title: "There is no one to contaminate."
---


- Lines in [[Satisfactory Multiplayer 2025]].
- At [[Satisfactory]], if you pour something incorrect onto the conveyor belt, you get into nasty trouble.
    - [[Contamination]]
- I was told, "This meeting is comfortable because no one is contaminating it."
- So why does the average person get contaminated?

Fast thoughts on having that conversation.
    - I think you're aware of [[point of responsibility]].
    - Implement in isolation to minimize the impact of failure, and combine later.
        - [[boundary between oneself and others]] is clarified.
