On stochastic events that succeed 10% of the time and fail 90% of the time
- The act of saying, "[[I'm]] going to fail anyway," is not very informative.
- The act of saying, "[[You will succeed]]," has a high probability of being said in the future, "It was a wrong prediction of the future.
    - The side that wants to [[success]] should not think in terms of "[[success or failure]]" but rather "how can we turn 10% into 20%?
        - [[False dichotomy]]
        - [[random event]]
            - [[Increased probability of stochastic change]]

Most ventures fail.
- There is value in challenging attempts that can fail.
- The "I'm going to fail anyway" attitude is unhelpful.

The value of working together for a common goal

Considering my capacity capacity, I actually don't watch open lines and I don't watch videos synchronously.

I had always been interested in this candidate, but I was concerned that he might be too much focused on AI and technology. However, after listening to his speech, I felt that he had a clear understanding of Tokyo's issues, agenda, and logic.

> [golden_lucky](https://x.com/golden_lucky/status/1808359516976959670) After all, direct elections are like a "pledge" contest, so it's good to see issues pulled out into the open, whether or not those who are elected can deliver on them. It's good that issues are brought out into the open, regardless of whether the elected person can realize them or not.

Many of them want to ask.

This presentation by Girshick, who has created modern object detection, argues that image classification and object detection may not be necessary to solve the final task in image processing. [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VodGljuEhBKwZIXQwN-ApH6g2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VodGljuEhBKwZIXQwN-ApH6g2) wBAVAdK/view...
>  He said that it is not a mistake to have studied object detection so far, and it is true that we have accumulated and advanced our knowledge by doing so, but in order to advance further, it is necessary to think about what is the problem we really want to solve instead of creating better object detection. Object detection tasks are too limited, fragile, and data constrained; it is important to question the thinking that has been taken for granted for 50~60 years, and to think about what tasks (each person) really wants to solve.

> [mas__yamazaki](https://x.com/mas__yamazaki/status/1808129413575594005) Tokyo is the capital of Japan, right? The Tokyo Metropolitan Government is the capital of Japan and the gubernatorial election will be held in five days. The current governor, Yuriko Koike, has been suspected of corruption, including the illegal sale of Tokyo-owned land at a discount, massive descent from the government to the company to which the land was sold, and opaque spending of huge amounts of public funds on Dentsu. Is "Shibusawa bread in Shibusawa Eiichi's hometown" more important news?
>  ![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GRfEG0tb0AIGP1f?format=jpg&name=medium#.png)

> [mas__yamazaki](https://x.com/mas__yamazaki/status/1808132370307936633) At some point, NHK and the major media suddenly started praising Eiichi Shibusawa in an unusual way, which I thought was unnatural. I thought it was unnatural, but it turns out that Eiichi Shibusawa was involved with both Dentsu (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone) and Hakuhodo (Hakuhodo, the advertising division of Naigai Tsushinsha). Shibusawa's new paper money to hide the Tokyo gubernatorial election? A composition symbolic of today's Japan.
>  >kimuratomo: Shibusawa Eiichi and Dentsu. The portraits of the foster parents of the propaganda agency are on the highest denomination of the new banknote. The TV stations are all over it. Nippon, after all, is Nippon. This is a very clear indication of the intentions of those in power who consider how to maneuver the country more important than protecting the lives of those who live in it.

I was also surprised that the administrative structure of the capital of Japan advertises the projected lights but does not post any call for voting for the Tokyo gubernatorial election.
