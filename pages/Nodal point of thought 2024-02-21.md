Nodal point of thought 2024-02-21
My impressions after running for almost a year, anyway.
- [[Keichobot]] is definitely useful for that "having a conversation helps me organize my thoughts" part!
    - Rule-based algorithms do not.
    - It used to time out sometimes, even if you did one conversation per request, but now it's much faster, so it's doable.
    - On the other hand, it's not one speech, one request.
        - You can do a lot of things in parallel.
    - In the history of Keichobot, it was created in CUI to begin with, then turned into a web service to turn it into a Slack bot, then turned into a web service
    - Now is the time to abandon legacy code and rebuild.
- [[Kozaneba]] is worth it as it is.
    - Can support the "chopping" and "texting" areas that have been bottlenecks.
    - This "purpose" is not clear to other users
    - For me personally, it is a system that facilitates understanding of things that are difficult to comprehend with the raw brain.
    - While we use it because it's useful, we're not yet at the point where first-time users can understand its value.
    - It should be developed to further strengthen my personal capacity for understanding.
    - I thought [[motivating system]] was a language support for Next Action
    - The reason I myself am no longer using this system is because its needs were met by Keichobot.
    - This will blend in as part of a Keichobot-like
- Keichobot is an assistance in taking out and understanding what is inside of you
    - Kozaneba will assist in structuring the vast amount of "information that has not yet found its structure" that has been extracted in this way and that is derived from books.
    - So it's "understanding" in the form of finding structure.
- Scrapbox / [[Omni]]
    - Scrapbox is a system for storing knowledge in a form that can be used over the long term
    - I stuck with Omni for now.
    - There's still room for improvement, but I think we're headed in the right direction.
    - The direction that external knowledge sources support the understanding of the start is now being explored in PluralityBook.
        - Glossary and fine-grained search seem important
        - There is development as questions become words.
        - Connect with Kozaneba in terms of understanding support
