title: "Example of Reply Implementation Failure"
---

- Early Twitter allowed you to talk to others with `@aaa`, but it was not a reply to their specific statement
- But it had no realistic pointer to what others said.
- So there were difficulties trying to review the conversation again after some time had passed
- In the current implementation, if you reply to a specific statement, the Tweet ID of the referring Tweet is saved.

#Groupware implementation
