title: "Expectations of People"
---

Although I say, "[[I don't expect]] homo sapiens," I still expect a little bit of "[[people power]]," and that is why I am widely providing [[information sharing]], [[information disclosure]], [[know-how]], etc. to the general public. I guess that's why we are doing [[information sharing]], [[information disclosure]], [[know-how provision]], etc. I believe in the possibility of something [[unexpectedly good]] coming out of it. On the other hand, those who don't really expect it, don't disclose [[OSS]].

[[expectation]] against [[people]].

relevance
- [[Expectations of others]].
    - [[Resignation toward Humanity]]
- [[Homo sapiens.]]
