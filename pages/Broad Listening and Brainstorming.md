title: "Broad Listening and Brainstorming"
---

- [[broad listening]] is like [brainstorming
It is a way to reduce oversights and to think about things from multiple perspectives by allowing everyone to express their opinions from different points of view.
There is value in seeing a diversity of opinions, not a system of deciding things by quantity like majority rule.
I value diversity, so more is better than less.
Even if the quality of online opinions is low, it's better to have them than not, because it increases diversity.
