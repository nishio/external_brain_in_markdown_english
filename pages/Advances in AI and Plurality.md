# Making
2025-02-05 11:00-12:00 5 minutes in the middle For Cybozu internal use
- Five minutes, so not much to talk about.
- Lunch and then OST from 1:30 p.m.

The title is fluffy.
- That's what I thought at first, but after writing what's inside, I thought this was the way to go.

- [How to Scale Digital Democracy?
- When I wrote what was in it, I thought, "That's not how it works."
- It's easier to understand if you stand in the Cybozu context.

- You can also use this resource for the introductory slide that I had to make for the [[Unexplored Guerrilla New Year's Party 2025-01-24]].
- I'll make a PDF and put it on my iPad.

Additional information will be available on 1/31, so I'll finish it up after that.
- Plurality book to be released by Cybozu Style Books in May
- April 2023 [[Plurality Tokyo]].
- Broad Listening Concepts
    - important
    - transmission
- 2023-12-12  [[Plurality and Cybozu (2023)]]
    - Figure at this time
- Someone utilized this concept in 2024.
    - Yasuno.
        - July: Mr. Anno, who ran for Governor of Tokyo with a manifesto of "Broad Listening," received 150,000 votes, the first time in his 30s in history.
        - → Manifesto Award
        - [[AI Engineer Takahiro Yasuno and Cybozu's Yoshihisa Aono]] If we change our "sense of distance" from technology, we may be able to create a society where no one is left behind | Cybozu Style [https://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m006208.](https://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m006208.) html]

- 10/26 Ground wave
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/f525385c2fc4027505264cb3cd1f50f1/thumb/1000)
- Tokyo [[Shin Tokyo 2050 Broad Listening]].
    - result
    - [[Digital Democracy 2030]]
    - Instantly, multiple opposition parties responded and tweeted the situation.
    - Since it is OSS, it can contribute to "making Japan better with digital technology" without being a form of support for a specific political party.
    - The influence of software on society is very much on the rise.
    - Advances in AI assistants have lowered the cost of creating the tool itself.
            - [[Try Devin.ai 2025-01]]
    - Bonus time in 2025 when the cost of making and the impact of what we make will decrease and increase.

- In this situation, a Japanese version of the book will be published by Cybozu Shiki Books in May.
    - Audrey Tang and Glen Weyl will visit Japan at that time
    - I'm working on event planning, etc. at that very moment.



- [[What is Plurality?]]
Audrey explained in an interview at Cybozu
    - [[Plurality was coined as a colorless neologism]]
