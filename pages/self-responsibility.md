It was interesting and I made a note of it.

While there are interpretations like this, my interpretation is that
- (including whether or not to obey the opinions of others in the form of commands).
- Responsibility for the consequences of one's own will is self-responsibility.
- There are those who think, "I followed an authority figure's opinion, so it's not right that I should be held accountable."
- It's used solely in the form of "You made the decision to follow your own will" to such people.
It is interesting to see the subject assumed in reverse.
