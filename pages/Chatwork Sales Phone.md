> [@shiology](https://twitter.com/shiology/status/1578518730115457024?s=46&t=M9n0_8Nt4OluzltSEifdUQ): I used #Chatwork as a trial for a board meeting of an academic society, and several I contacted Chatwork and they said there is no way to stop the telemarketing. We have decided to stop using Chatwork altogether. I'm also quitting completely. 10 years #Thanks Chatwork!

I'm getting the same stinky feeling as the other day with [[The Chatwork Forced Survey Case]].
