title: "Should AI take cultural sensitivity into account for a global audience?"
---

Don't ask a developing AI to do what humans can't do either.

- [Social conflict is an opportunity for intercultural understanding. For the [[majority culture]] to be "sensitive to [[cultural sensitivity]]" is, in the end, to deprive the [[minority culture]] of [[opportunities for understanding]].

The Americans should inadvertently use the "mushroom cloud" motif to antagonize the Japanese, the Japanese should inadvertently export the anime "[[Crayon Shinchan]]" that depicts the crotch of an infant and be mosaicked by the Thai government, and the Thai media should inadvertently post [[photos of dead bodies]] in foreign news outlets to antagonize the rest of the world. Thai media should also inadvertently put [[photos of dead bodies]] on foreign news outlets, which would cause a backlash from the world. After that, they should forgive each other.
