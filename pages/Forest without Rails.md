title: "Forest without Rails"
---

- No [[rail]] [[shrine grove]].
    - Wo noch Worte fehlen] "[[Where words still lack]]" in [[Thinking at the edge of the edge]] and the image of [[Where words still lack]] in [[Thinking at the edge of the edge]].
- The image of [[train]] regarding [[decision-making about the direction to go]], [running on a predetermined rail

shrine grove
- [[mountain road]].
- [The visibility is poor due to [[overgrown trees]].
- [The road is bumpy and narrow, so you can't drive in.
    - Movement speed is determined by your [[leg strength]].

rebuttal
- Isn't it the same as running on rails, because if you walk off course on a mountain trail, you will get lost?
    - Change course depending on the situation: [[escape route]].
