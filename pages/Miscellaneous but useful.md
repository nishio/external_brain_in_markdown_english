>  MIT researchers tested 444 people to see how productive they were at work (especially writing) using ChatGPT
>  As a result, the group using ChatGPT finished their work 37% faster and the quality of their work improved by 20%.
> The output from ChatGPT is [[miscellany (classification of Japanese poetry)]], so it seems to have taken more time to edit it, but the benefit of lower start-up costs far outweighs that.
