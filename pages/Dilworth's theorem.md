from [[ABC134E]]
The minimum path coverage on the DAG (the minimum number of paths required to split a vertex so that all vertices belong to the appropriate path) is equal to the number of elements in the maximum antichain (a set of vertices such that for any two vertices in the set, there is no path connecting them)
