title: "Phobia of not coming to work"
---

> I know there are companies that make it a virtue to [[go to work (e.g. in the morning)]] no matter what, even if it's snowing heavily. I think that company employees are still suffering from a kind of "phobia" about not coming to work. I think it is necessary to change their mindset.
