title: "Searching for cases by abstract structure"

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Give an example of something with the following structure: A is overwhelmed by B, on top of which B forms C, which is the inverse of A, but the experience of C gives rise to D, which is A-like; D has elements in common with A, but it is not A itself, and it is only made possible through B and C.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>An example of such a structure would be the "process of language acquisition," interpreted somewhat abstractly.
- A: Early language skills in children. The stage in which the child attempts to sense basic language and imitate surrounding sounds.
- B: Language learning in the external environment, especially in schooling and textbooks. In this phase, correct grammar and vocabulary of the language are emphasized, overwhelming the child's early intuitive language skills.
- C: The process of learning a foreign language and the experience of cross-cultural exchange. This forms a new linguistic and cultural perspective that is not limited to one's native language.
- D: The ability to communicate with a multilingual speaker identity and an understanding of different cultures. This has intuitive elements in common with the initial language sense of A, but with a more flexible and deeper linguistic understanding after the experiences of B and C.
Thus, through the process of language acquisition, one can move from initial intuitive competence to more mature communicative competence through external learning and cross-cultural experiences.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Of course, two more general examples are provided.
...
- A: A child's early sense of rhythm and the joy of singing
- B: The acquisition of theory and technique in traditional music education, where technical exercises and theory may overwhelm the intuitive enjoyment of A
- C: Encounters with different musical genres and cultural backgrounds
- D: Development of original music and unique style, with elements in common with the intuitive fun of A, but with a more refined musicality after the experience of B and C.
These examples illustrate the process of starting from an initial state and evolving to a mature form through external influences and new experiences.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I felt that language acquisition and music acquisition were good examples. Give another example that is not acquisition.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Understood. I will think of an example that does not involve mastery.
Cooking process:.
- A: The natural flavor of the ingredients. For example, the taste of fresh tomatoes.
- B: Addition of seasoning or heat during the cooking process. Cooking here may overwhelm the flavor of the ingredients in A.
- C: Additional flavors, e.g., herbs and spices as toppings.
- D: The finished dish, with the tomato flavors of A as the foundation, but with the processes of B and C resulting in a more complex and richly flavored dish.
This example illustrates the process that begins with the natural flavors of the ingredients and evolves into the final culinary form through the process of cooking.
