> Yutabon can live with that, but why do I have to go to school? I told him that Yutabon could get a position with that, but there is only one "Yutabon slot", so he won't survive if he does the same thing.

Good explanation
- In other words, in a game where people are competing for [[limited resources]], if there is only one resource, the first person to do it grabs it, so you can't get the same thing by imitating them later.
- In a game where power is allowed to compete for resources, the "most powerful of those who want it" wins because those who come later and are more powerful take it.
    - This is a metaphor for physical prowess, but it's the same thing when a large company with name value and existing business synergies imitates a product developed by a weak company and steals its customers.
- It is not clear if we can survive if we move in the direction of the majority.
    - You're using the metaphor of living unconsciously and dying, but you're not going to die plainly either way, you're just going to live a life with a slowly declining rate of agency.
