*1362062381*Calendar of what's done for what part of the year
I was intrigued by id:Yoshiori and made this. https://gist.github.com/nishio/5061891
>||
yoshiori: Is it true that 1/6 of 2013 is coming to an end?
nishio: @yoshiori I thought it would be nice to have a calendar with some such epoch written on it
yoshiori: @nishio The one who started it (ry)
||<

Note that if there is an epoch at 0:00 on a certain day, the date is assigned by interpreting it as "24:00 on the previous day". Because an epoch that is already over when you wake up is sad, isn't it?

Note: I replaced the first version (https://gist.github.com/nishio/5057178) with a version reduced to 1/10 because the first version (https://gist.github.com/nishio/5057178) would be too much information if I listed up to 1/50.
