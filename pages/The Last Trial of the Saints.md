> [Tamejirou](https://twitter.com/Tamejirou/status/1710211149600583889) I think it was ancient Buddhism or Brahmanism, but I rather like the idea that "a certain number of severely handicapped children are always born" is "a trial that saints go through at the end of their reincarnation. I like the idea that "a certain number of severely handicapped children are always born" is "a process for saints to truly realize the value of Buddha's (or God's) salvation in a situation where they cannot do anything without the help of others".

## Digest
1. ancient Buddhist and Brahmanic teachings that severely handicapped children and the beggar caste are regarded as the process of realizing the value of saintly trials and salvation, and that they are a warning against human conceit.

In "Tannisho," the belief in salvation by Amida Buddha is described as a shift from an "enlightenment" type of Buddhism to a "salvation" type of religion. This is related to the teaching that severely handicapped children and the beggar caste realize the value of the Buddha's salvation in circumstances where they are unable to do anything without the help of others.

3. in "Two Kinds of Spirituality," there is a story about a strong person who is able to see through the chi of others, which is related to the teaching that warns against the conceit that man wants to attain enlightenment by his own strength.

4. the "evil person's righteousness theory" emphasizes a deep awareness of one's own sins and vexations and gratitude for Amida Buddha's unconditional salvation. This is related to the teaching that severely handicapped children and the beggar caste realize the value of the Buddha's salvation in circumstances where they are unable to do anything without the help of others.

5. "On Faith" describes the idea that enlightenment is possible. This is related to the teaching that severely handicapped children and the beggar caste realize the value of the Buddha's salvation in circumstances where they cannot do anything without the help of others.

6. "Kozaneba as a Process Leading to Enlightenment" describes the process of targeting what is not yet understood or put into words. This is related to the teaching that severely handicapped children and the beggar caste realize the value of the salvation of the Buddhas in circumstances where they cannot do anything without the help of others.

## Thought
The teachings of ancient Buddhism and Brahmanism offer a perspective that warns against human conceit and offers the realization of the value of salvation through circumstances in which nothing can be done without the help of others. This is common to other religions and philosophies that emphasize salvation through other means rather than one's own strength. In addition, the process of targeting the ununderstood and the unspoken leads to a deeper understanding of this teaching.
