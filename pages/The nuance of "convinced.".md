title: 'The nuance of "convinced."'
---

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>You are an expert researcher on the Japanese language. The Japanese word "[[understanding]]" seems to be translated as [[agreement]] or [[understanding]] in English. However, I feel that "agreement" is "[[agreement]]" and "understanding" is "[[understanding]]" and both mean different things from "understanding". Please explain the difference in nuance between the three words "agreement," "agreement," and "understanding" in Japanese.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Indeed, the Japanese words "agree," "consensus," and "understanding" may refer to similar concepts, but each has different nuances.
- The word "agree" refers to the state in which, after receiving an explanation or information, one is convinced of its content, i.e., one feels "I see then. It is often felt inwardly as "I see, I am convinced.
- An "agreement" is when two or more people agree on the same idea, opinion, or plan. This is primarily an extroverted action, often accompanied by an explicit "understanding" or "agreement.
- Comprehension refers to a knowledgeable grasp of something, or a deeper grasp of the meaning of something. In this state, there is a deepened awareness of the information or situation, but not necessarily a conviction or agreement.
The English words "agreement" and "understanding" are often translated as "agreement" and "understanding," respectively, but there may not be a complete word for "understanding" in English that expresses the nuances of the word. It is necessary to choose the appropriate expression for each context.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I see, AGREEMENT is supposed to be [[interaction]] of multiple people, while CONFIRMATION and UNDERSTANDING are not person-to-person interactions. Focus on the difference between these two.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Indeed, "conviction" and "understanding" are terms that refer primarily to [[changes within the individual]], but the differences include the following.
- Convincing: This word refers to the state of being "convinced" of some specific information or situation, i.e., the state of having an "aha, so that's what it is" in one's mind. This state is often achieved when newly acquired information matches [[existing knowledge]] or [[values]], or vice versa, when [[question]] or [[uncomfortable feeling]] is resolved.
- Understanding: This is simply knowing information or grasping a complex concept or situation. However, having "understanding" does not necessarily mean having "conviction. For example, we may understand someone's position or way of thinking, but not necessarily agree with it.
Conviction is often accompanied by a kind of "[[comfort]]" or "[[relief]]," a sense of inner conviction. In contrast, "understanding" is a more neutral state, itself independent of any particular emotion or evaluation.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Make an example sentence that highlights the difference between the two.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Of course, below are typical example sentences in which each word is used.
- understanding
    - His explanation finally made sense to me."
    - In this statement, it refers to the state of feeling in one's mind after receiving an explanation, "I see, that's what you meant.
- understanding
    - I understand his position, but I'm not convinced by it."
    - In this sentence, the person expresses a state of being able to understand the other person's position or opinion, but not being inwardly convinced of it.

In the example of "understanding," the mind is calmed by some specific information or explanation. On the other hand, the example of "understanding" indicates that the other person's position or idea can be [[understood in the head]], but the [[emotion]] or evaluation (in this case, conviction) of it does not necessarily match.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The convinced side understands and it [[fits]] with [[my thoughts]] and [[values]] and it's [[comfortable]].
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Yes, that is correct. Convincing" refers to the state of being at peace with understanding and having that information or situation match one's own thoughts and values, or having one's doubts or discomfort resolved. The result is often a feeling of "comfort" or "relief.
