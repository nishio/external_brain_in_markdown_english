title: "People who achieve great results focus on opportunities, not problems."
---

from  [[Urgent/Important Matrix]]
People who achieve great results are not focused on problems, but on opportunities.
- "People who achieve great results are [[concentrating]] on [[opportunity]], not [[concentrating]] on the problem." is a statement by [[Drucker.]] that [[covey]] mentions.
    - Maybe not directly like that. He's said something like that a few times.
        - > If there is one secret to success, it is concentration. People who achieve results start with what is most important and only do one thing at a time.

        - > If you want to make the most of your forte, you recognize the need to make your strengths your key [[focus on opportunities]]. In fact, there is no other way to achieve results.

        - >  [[growth strategy]] must target where the opportunities are. We must concentrate on areas where our strengths produce unusually large results
