title: "Losing motivation to defeat your delusional self."

[[Duolingo]] chat

I started Korean as "I have tried to learn to read Hangul, but I can't remember the difference between vowels", but I'm making progress very slowly at a "better than nothing" rate.
Maybe if you have the feeling in your mind that you should be going at such and such a speed, such as school or NHK radio, you may lose [[willingness (e.g. to do something)]] to be too slow compared to that.
I'm not serious, so I don't study other things, so I only have [[Past Self]] to compare myself with, and compared to my past self, I "understand more now than before," so maybe that keeps me feeling positive.

PS
- The original title was "Speed Comparison," but it was changed to "Losing motivation to [[Delusional self]]" a short time after I wrote it.

relevance
    - [[Difference between "aiming at a certain point" and "going in a certain direction."]]
    - The difference between continuing to progress in the way you learn a little about the language and aiming for a delusional "fluent-speaking self".
    - Metaphorically speaking, aiming for a "self that can continue to learn" is also aiming for a point.
