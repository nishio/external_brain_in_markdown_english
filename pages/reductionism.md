[[broad interpretation]]" is a phenomenon that I see often, but I realize that the opposite is also true.
- The other party only says "X is necessary," but you take the liberty of interpreting the narrower scope of "Y is necessary," and worry that your case P is not included there.

[[Mistaking the unrequested for the demanded.]]
[[Interpret the requirements as high.]]
[[I'm raising the bar on my own.]]
[/villagepump/ interpreting the demand level as high / raising the bar on your own](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/ interpreting the demand level as high / raising the bar on your own).

I've seen descriptions that pair "magnification" with "underestimation," but I think the synonym for underestimation is "overestimation.
- There's another story mixed in with these two: "the relationship between the appropriate value on the valuation axis and the smallest value on the valuation axis."
- As the opposite version of "expanded interpretation," which is a broader interpretation than the original scope, I think "reduced interpretation" is more appropriate.

reductionism
The reason why we have thought that we can understand things in a reductionist way is because mankind is too stupid to realize the limitations of reductionism, and we finally began to realize that we are too stupid to understand when computers beat humans in Go, which has long been enjoyed as a game with a difficulty level that cannot be solved by reductionism. The computer finally began to realize that it was too stupid to understand.
I have always disliked people who claim that "humans are superior to machines" and wish they would be destroyed quickly, so I am glad that more and more people are realizing this and coming over to our side.
