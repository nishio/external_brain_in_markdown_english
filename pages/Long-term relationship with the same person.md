title: "Long-term relationship with the same person"

> [realNuun2](https://x.com/realNuun2/status/1831106395439042709) I can remember things from the past that are analogous to current circumstances, but I have very little memory left of the past that has nothing to do with the present.

> [realNuun2](https://x.com/realNuun2/status/1831108535520043198) Since "situations" are mostly relationships, one might conclude that "[[you should]] stay in a relationship with the same person for as long as possible."

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1831895835719942478) Maybe this [[Barbell Strategy]] is appropriate. If we only use "[[long-term relationship with the same person]]", [[everyone gets one year older every year]] and [[elderly thinking filter bubble]] will be generated. (About 80% of the community when I was in my 20s has become a filter bubble.)

> [realNuun2](https://x.com/realNuun2/status/1831921738021814774) I see!
>  I think it would be good to not only "[[hold the same relationship for a long time]]" but also "[[belong to]] a community where people are metabolized."
>  It is a mystery to me how I can belong for so long and yet have a metabolism.
>  "Befriending [[a friend's child]] in a long-term relationship" seems like a quick way to do it.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1831952723199320492) I'm starting to think that a [[metabolizing community]] can only exist if there is no [[freedom of choice]] or [[Freedom of Movement]], like "if a child is born in a village, it automatically joins the village community". of Movement] like "if a child is born in a village, it automatically joins the village community" (probably an extreme theory).

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1831952980603724235) [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1831952980603724235) [[The incentive to join an already established community later]] is usually not very high, so when there is freedom of choice, [[old communities]] become less selective. Is this a good thing?

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1831953964793029106) There are upper and lower limits of communication depending on human cognitive capacity and personality, which are both resources and needs
>  No new exploration takes place because needs are met by staying in a long-lasting community.
>  What is the incentive for new people to join such a group of people? Depends on the situation?

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1831954656567902442) After all, [[the need for quantity of communication]] is satisfied by the mere existence of the community, so the only people who are not satisfied by that are those who have a strong desire for "[[new thing]]." The only people who can't be satisfied by that are those who have a strong desire for "[[new thing]]", and the only way for them to be satisfied is to [[move and go to a new community]].


> [takiuchi](https://x.com/takiuchi/status/1831956045083897856) For example, working for a company is a typical "join an already established community later", and as long as it performs well, it's likely to survive normally, so the choice I don't think freedom or old-fashionedness has much to do with it.
>  >nishio: Is the freedom of choice due to the fact that the incentive to join an already established community later is usually not very high, so that old communities become less selective?

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1831965446515626211) The incentive is that the community pays the salary!

> [takiuchi](https://x.com/takiuchi/status/1831969181874724873) So incentives are ok if they are retrofitted :)
