title: "Distributed representation of characters"
---

- Imagine that the [[distributed representation]] of a character is placed in the same vector space as the [[Distributed representation of words]].
- The word "unknown" and the letters "un," "know," and "word" are placed in the same space.
- The closest thing to an "unknown word" would be "word."
- If sets X and Y are arranged in the same vector space, then for element x of set X, we can say "What would you dare to express this in Y?
- What is the closest word to "un."
