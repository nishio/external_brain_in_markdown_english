- How can the stretching method be applied?
- Maybe we don't need to avoid it.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - A related concept is [[The Curse of Production]].
    - Aversion to not engaging in productive activity makes it impossible to rest
    - If you think of this in terms of the stretching metaphor, it's like you keep putting pressure on a muscle and never stretch it, not good.

generalize
The findings from these fragments are diverse and require in-depth consideration from different perspectives. In particular, we find thematic connections to technology, philosophy, education, and storytelling. We feel that further research and collaboration with colleagues is needed to deepen our understanding of these themes.
