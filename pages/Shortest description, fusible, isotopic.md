The following is an explanation of what is meant by using "conserved quantities (invariants)" as a criterion for judging whether something is going well or not.

1) "[[shortest route]]" ([[shortest route]])
- Meaning: the shortest explanatory route (fewest relay points) to a certain conclusion.
- Why conservation volume? : If you change the wording or the labeling, the path that makes sense in essence should remain roughly the same.
- What happens when something is "not working"?
    - The shortest route falls apart every time just by slightly changing the display or bundling method → Somewhere there is an impossible integration/excessive cutting happening.
- On the contrary, it is a "discovery" signal:
    - Shorter paths emerge for the first time with new operations (previously unreachable/too far) → valuable structural change.

2) "[[Commutability]]" (is it the same if the order is rearranged?)
- Meaning: if the order of the two operations (e.g. bundle -> cut range and cut range -> bundle) are interchanged, is the result the same?
- Why conserved quantity? The model is sound: "small rearrangements" usually don't change the behavior significantly.
- What happens when something is "not working"?
    - Conclusions and clusters change drastically just because of differences in order → The definition of operation is too coarse / the way the boundaries are cut is arbitrary.
- On the contrary, it is a "discovery" signal:
    - Finding a place where the order difference works only in a certain region (noncommutative) → This is a hot spot where a missed connection/disconnection lurks.

3) "[[isotopes]]" (a different route, but virtually the same explanation?)
- Meaning: different phrases and different routes can be treated as the same class if the main points are the same (i.e., isotopic).
- Why conserved quantity? : Well-designed knowledge retains its core of meaning when paraphrased.
- What happens when something is "not working"?
    - A slight rephrasing of the word is treated differently and knowledge is fragmented → Inappropriate granularity and definition of the alias bundle (quotient).
- On the contrary, it is a "discovery" signal:
    - Two routes that were "thought to be the same" for a long time show a difference that cannot be filled by paraphrasing → A new distinction (re-conception) is needed.

How to use (mini-step-by-step)
1. record the shortest description in the reference view (A→...→Z).
2. change one operation (e.g., alias bundle granularity↑).
3. comparison:
    - The shortest explanation is soundly shortened -> forward.
    - Drastic change/ destabilization → design review.
- The two operations are executed both in the same order (commutativity check).
5. create one more route to the same conclusion and check if it is isotopic or not.

Guideline (Signs of disorder)
- The shortest explanation is shaky with small changes.
- Significant change in results with reordering
- Paraphrasing does not converge on the same

In a word.
Shortest description = streakiness, commutativity = stability, isotopia = core consistency.
If these three things are maintained, we are "doing well.
The places where any of these are torn are the candidates where discoveries are made.
