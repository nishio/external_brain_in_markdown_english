Strong association between [[attacks on the unfamiliar]] and [[Observation coverage issues]]: [self

- [[Attacking the unfamiliar without looking at it properly.]]
- I would like to write a commentary that combines this with [Observation coverage issues

- The tendency to attack the unfamiliar without looking at it properly: This is due to various factors, such as anger, rejection, fear, pessimistic misunderstanding, etc. This tendency can be expressed in the form of acting without looking closely, rejecting without trying to know better, attacking without looking closely, assuming something is bad and keeping it away, etc.
- The problem of observational coverage: this refers to the fact that humans can only observe part of the world. We tend to generalize from what we observe and make judgments about what we do not observe, but this generalization often contains errors. This problem is further exacerbated when the range of what can be observed is biased or when the bias is due to attributes of the observer (e.g., not being understood because of a lack of comprehension or being shunned because of one's usual words or actions).
- These concepts can also represent "[[blind spots]]" that are strongly associated with the self. In other words, they represent the problem of a lack of understanding about oneself and one's environment that limits one's ability to properly understand, evaluate, and cope with the unknown.
