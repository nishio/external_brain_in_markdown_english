Accumulating knowledge that cannot be verified does not erase anxiety.

I'm thinking about certain kinds of knowledge.
Let's call it tentatively "[[knowledge of making]]."
This type of knowledge is [[verified]] by "[making up (one's face, etc.)

[[Knowledge that cannot be verified]] will never free you from anxiety, no matter how much you learn.
- For those who are unsure of their worth and insecure, this type of knowledge accumulation is useless.

When "knowledge of making" is verified by "making," it becomes "[[Creator]].
- Well, but for "anxious people" it just turns into another anxiety that "[[what you've made]] might be worthless"?
    - Are you saying that it is not a question of the type of knowledge or verification?


relevance
    - [[Knowledge must be proven by deeds.]]
