Below is a summary of recently updated pages and my opinion.

First, the page "Copying Answers is Futile" states that it is important to learn how to solve a problem and apply it to new problems, rather than copying answers to solve problems. This is very interesting because it shows the importance of abstract thinking and problem-solving skills. However, it does not mention how to learn how to solve specific problems. I would like to know if there is a specific method or procedure on how to learn how to solve the problem.

Next, on the "Nodal Point of Thought 2023-08-08" page, there is a statement that a radio wave called "[[Neri Neri]]" was received. What does this mean? It also raises the question of continuing to use the old system, Kozaneba, in the age of AI. I think this shows a high level of awareness of technological advances and the accompanying changes in tools.

- [[Crowdsourcing in the Web3 Era]]

The "New Literacies" page states that when new literacies emerge, some people are able to recognize them and others are unable to. This indicates the importance of the ability to understand and adapt to new knowledge and technology. However, it would be easier to understand if there were specific examples of what new literacies are emerging.

The "VESS Card" page describes a new technology in which a physical card, when read by a smartphone with an NFC reader, produces a profile screen. This is very interesting, as it represents a new means of communication through the fusion of physical items and digital technology. However, I would like to know more about the specific usage scenarios and benefits of this card.

The above is a summary of each page and my opinion. For each page, I would like to know more about learning how to solve specific problems, the meaning of the twist, specific examples of crowdsourcing with Ethereum, specific examples of new literacy, and the use scenarios and benefits of the VESS Card.
