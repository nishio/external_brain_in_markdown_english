title: "Just saying it's a problem is not a solution."

It is not [[problem-solving]] to just look at a problem and say, "This is a problem!" is not [problem-solving

One might think, "Isn't raising issues essential to solving them?"
- This is incorrect. The resolution of "[[raising a question]]" is low.
    - The "first one to raise an issue" is essential to solving the problem.
    - No need to "raise the second and subsequent issues."
- I am being neglected in my problem-solving efforts! It's outrageous that they are essential to solving an important problem!" People often say
    - A: It's a "second and subsequent issue raised" so it's through
    - Other cases
        - B: Not an "important" issue
        - C: Not a "problem"
        - D: Claims to be related to "important issues" but the connection is iffy


[[Problem noted]]
