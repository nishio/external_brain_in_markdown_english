> [mishimaru_tete](https://twitter.com/mishimaru_tete/status/1722413630933831757) The other side of the "jobs come to those who can" story.
>
>  For those who can really get the job done,
>  New [[self-challenges]] and [[impossible]] tasks will come in. Naturally.
>  It is very tough and hard to be a party to that.
>  But if you get over it, you get something in return that makes you stronger anyway.
>
>  For those who can do the job so-and-so,
>  The work will be gathered within the scope of what the person can do.
>  I can give you a certain amount of credit for being in charge of that area, though,
>  We have to be careful because it is hard to grow or get stuck in a rut.
>  We can say that the person's tendency is to have an invisible issue of not exceeding expectations beyond what they are told.
>
>  If you can't get the job done,
>  > office duties and miscellaneous tasks are gathered. Or these are jobs that someone does not want to do.
>  Nevertheless, this is definitely necessary in the initial growth process, and this is not a bad thing, as the carefulness of each of these jobs will be the axis for judging the next job to be assigned.
>  However, if this continues for a certain length of time, it is my assessment that there is no work to be given.
>
>  We need to change the way we do things and create more trust.
