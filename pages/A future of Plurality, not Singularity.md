[[What is Plurality#6436be24aff09e00006809d3]]
- That's a good explanation for a concept I just learned about at the time.
    - [[If a concept can be succinctly explained in existing language, it is not a new concept]]
    - [[Plurality is a new term]]

I didn't know if it was 10 minutes or 5 minutes, but I got the notice that it was 5 minutes, so I don't think I could explain solid concepts, etc. if I gave a book announcement in a few minutes.

I've been kneading this for quite a while, but I don't think I have time to talk about it.

- As with [[Advances in AI and Plurality]], the style is to first announce the publication of the book and then explain it.
Since the target audience this time is not Cybozu but unexplored, I thought Ken Suzuki's commentary would be a good idea.

If it comes down to a confrontation between pro-AI and anti-AI, we lose in terms of numbers.
- Technology makes possible what could not be done.
- People who make things happen.
    - Often a minority
- Bring about change v.s. Dislike change

techno-libertarian criticism
- It's bad enough to be identified with tech just because you like it.
