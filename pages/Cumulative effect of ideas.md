title: "Cumulative effect of ideas"

2023-01-19
I think the concept expressed by the [[Interference Effects of Ideas]] diagram in Jiro Kawakita's "Idea Method" is a very good one, but the diagram itself is not easy to understand.

So I drew a new diagram.

First, we look at [[concrete data]], and from there [[ideas]] emerge.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/72c80aeed579bd6b0df5c9f1df17e7aa/thumb/1000)
- Some people tend to take the words "idea" and "idea" too seriously, but "idea" also includes [[hypothesis]], such as "Is this what you mean?" but [[hypothesis]] like "I wonder if this is what it means..." is also included in this "idea.
- In this article, once you've read it, you'll think, "Is this what I mean?" and read on as if it were a hypothesis that "this is what I mean.
- That this hypothesis remains hypothetical <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Jiro Kawakita/icon' alt='Jiro Kawakita.icon' height="19.5"/> calls it "underdeveloped".
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/b6155b0809ab6919f9d983390331c0b4/thumb/1000)


Another time, another set of data, and the same old "is this what I think it means?" can come up.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/e11881b46abccad9c685ac7d52dc0e5c/thumb/1000)
- When this happens, that "is this what I mean?" hypothesis becomes stronger.
- This is what <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Jiro Kawakita/icon' alt='Jiro Kawakita.icon' height="19.5"/> calls "gaining stability"
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/abc059657c953d18e0e8df5e3a6b402a/thumb/1000)


Conversely, some hypotheses may appear to have apparent [[inconsistency]] with previous hypotheses.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/db0c62c7f9aed4d843b2ec788c3bb6d0/thumb/1000)
- At this point, if you think about it for a while and can't resolve the discrepancy, you'll say, "Well, neither hypothesis was correct.
- This <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Jiro Kawakita/icon' alt='Jiro Kawakita.icon' height="19.5"/> calls the "downfall"
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/df2d81972e8786f32920f8262a407223/thumb/1000)


In some cases, when you think about it, you can come up with a non-contradictory explanation for what appears to be a contradiction.
- This is very important.
    - It's called [[dialectic development]].
- Example: [[Improved/not improved]].
After a connection is discovered between the past and something that is not the same, it can develop further from there
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/25aeab330a8cba335301002d7085f258/thumb/1000)
- Jiro Kawakita.icon] calls this "[Achievement of inclusiveness
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/8c44caf55f9079d52610a682b8b68a23/thumb/1000)
        - It was hard to highlight in the enclosure, so I traced a different color.

Concepts not in my diagram but in <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Jiro Kawakita/icon' alt='Jiro Kawakita.icon' height="19.5"/>'s diagram
- The idea born from the first set of data and the idea born from the second set of data were combined to create a new idea.
- Combined with an idea born from the third set of data, a new idea was born.
- Combine that with the ideas generated from the fourth set of data, and even more new ideas were born.
- After I got to this point, I looked back at the record of when I worked with the first group of data, and I found even more new ideas connected to ideas that were undeveloped
    - This is an interesting event and I know you wanted to paint a picture of how this could happen.
    - Maybe it was hard to understand how you crammed four different explanations of the phenomenon into one sheet.
