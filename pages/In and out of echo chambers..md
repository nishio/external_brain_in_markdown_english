In and out of echo chambers.

The experience of being inside an echo chamber
- [[Clubs and Bazaars]]
- [[feverish]]
- [[sense of unity]]
- [[festival]]
- [[psychological safety]]

People who don't enjoy
- I haven't been able to join a club.

Don't stay cooped up in the club.
- There is an outside world (bazaar)
- In the bazaar you have to deal with people with different values.

Need to get in and out.


relevance
    - [[Inside and outside is a false dichotomy]]
