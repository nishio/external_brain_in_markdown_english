title: "Do not make every occurrence of a keyword a link"
---

    - It is not a good idea to [[link]] all the places where [[Keywords.]] has [[appearance]].
    - It's the same result as if you [[search (e.g. for someone using a search engine)]] for that keyword on the search page
    - [[There is an optimum between the two extremes.]]
    - One extreme, "the keywords are not links at all."
    - At the other extreme, "every occurrence of the keyword is a link."
