I've heard stories about people feeling "stuffed" about these digging questions, and I thought, "Those people are boring," and then I realized that both words are "stuffed."

- [[corner (esp. an opponent's king in shogi)]]
- to ask a question, to question
- close a debate
    - hammer out a story (e.g. in progress)
        - Tight attention to detail.
        - Check each other's perceptions to ensure that there is no discrepancy between each other's perceptions
    - persevere
        - > Do one thing continuously, with a focused mind.
