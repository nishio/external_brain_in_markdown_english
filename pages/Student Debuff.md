- When I introduce myself these days, I try not to reveal the attribute that I'm an undergraduate student unless I have to.
    - The attribute "[[Heian-period student of government administration]]" feels mysteriously [[debuffed]].
    - Okay.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - It's a debuff.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/Summer498/icon' alt='/villagepump/Summer498.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - There are a fair number of people who interpret "being a student" as "not trustworthy."<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - What kind of "trust" for what kind of behavior?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/blu3mo/icon' alt='/villagepump/blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - If I had to guess at what point I felt debuffed, I'd write, "The project the students are working on is[[継続性]]に疑義がある」という感じ<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
                    - Because you're graduating.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/Summer498/icon' alt='/villagepump/Summer498.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - It's a mistake to think that people will "keep going" because of "what working people do," but there are a good percentage of people who think that way.
                    - If it's "a project that working people are getting paid to do," then the question of continuity is a little weaker(?).
                    - No, but if the company's policy changes on a project that's being done by the company, it will suddenly end no matter how enthusiastic the person in charge is...
                - To be more specific, high school students often create a web service and want "many people to use it," but if the service is "the type of service that requires an investment of time and other resources to believe that the service will continue," the problem is that most users will not invest in the service because they think, "It's a service run by high school students, so I don't trust it. So I don't trust it" and don't invest in it.
                - It's subjective, but there is a [[FACT that there is such a subjectivity]], the one that says.
                - Often there are cases where the creators don't understand that FACT, so they do their best to communicate it, or they don't try and go through with it.
            - To be frank, just because you're in the workforce doesn't mean you're going to be trustworthy. w
            - I don't trust anyone anymore (...)<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - [[学生をデバフと見る人]]、というのがどういった人か想像出来たけど、その心境は理解出来ない<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/Hiro Aki/icon' alt='/villagepump/Hiro Aki.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - I'm paranoid that it's the other way around.
                - Something made by old people, so it can't be trusted for continuity or something?
                - I associated it with the question of whether I can invest in someone who tries to make a map of Japan after he is over 60 years old.
                    - [[Ino Tadataka]] started surveying at the age of 56, or he mistakenly thought he was past 60.
                    - This is why humans are also halucinating.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/hiyori/icon' alt='/villagepump/hiyori.icon' height="19.5"/>
                    - In this case, I think they'll be evaluated on their performance.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>
                        - > In Ezo, Imperial Russia was coming under increasing pressure... In light of these tensions in the north, Itoki drew up a plan to make an accurate map of Ezo and asked the Shogunate to do so.... Tadataka was put in charge of this project. Although Tadataka's advanced age was a concern (114), his surveying skills, leadership ability, and financial resources made him a suitable candidate for this project (115).
                        - >  Itoki's proposal was not readily accepted by the Shogunate... The villagers of Sawara submitted a box appeal to the Shogunate asking for permission for Ino Tadataka and his son Keikei to be granted a surname belt directly from the Shogunate in honor of their previous achievements, which was also believed to be aimed at impressing the Shogunate that Tadataka was an honorable man and to have the survey project approved earlier....
                            - [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/伊能忠敬#暦学への取り組み](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/伊能忠敬#暦学への取り組み)
                        - I think there is a FACT that when there are "students who have done nothing" and "older people who have done nothing" there is a subjective expectation that the former have higher expectations ([[I think there is a FACT]] what?).
            - I think the number of observations of "students who achieve more than working people" is zero.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - You painted a related picture...
                    - [[Assumption that adults are superior to children]]
                    - If this becomes institutionalized,[[seniority by length of service]] になってしまう<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/hiyori/icon' alt='/villagepump/hiyori.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/blu3mo/icon' alt='/villagepump/blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>appears to be correct because it does not require a student buff and is only a real debuff.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/mtane0412/icon' alt='/villagepump/mtane0412.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - It's a case-by-case basis, of course, as there are times when students benefit from student buffs, and it seems a bit unfair to change to a stance on a case-by-case basis.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/blu3mo/icon' alt='/villagepump/blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Rather than whether or not a person is a student, I use whether the person is an individual or a corporation, and if a corporation, which authority the person has and what the corporation's financial statements are like, to determine whether I can trust the person in my business.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/terang/icon' alt='/villagepump/terang.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - Whether I trust him as a person, not in his work, is of course another matter.
            - In my case, I consider it important to know to what extent the partner understands, embodies, and practices such a sense of numbers. For example, even if you are not in charge of accounting or finance at a large company, your sense of trust will go up and down depending on how far you can connect your business with the policies of the corporation or business unit in numerical form and talk about them externally (in this case, to the other party <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/terang/icon' alt='/villagepump/terang.icon' height="19.5"/>).
                - (Huh? Maybe I was talking about trust, not trust. Oh well, used here to mean the same thing)
        - Sometimes "how you spin the words" is a better criterion for trust than attributes, right?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/kaede/icon' alt='/villagepump/kaede.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - Sometimes I like the moment when all the attributes melt away and "only the voice remains".<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/不思議ちゃん/icon' alt='/villagepump/不思議ちゃん.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - It would be easier if "attributes" could be taken off and put on like clothes.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/hiyori/icon' alt='/villagepump/hiyori.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I've been able to do this in regards to my appearance.[[VTuber]]かな<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - I think <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nomadoor/icon' alt='/villagepump/nomadoor.icon' height="19.5"/> said somewhere that it's a [[0% appearance]] world that humanity finally got.
                - [[人は見た目が0割]]だ<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nomadoor/icon' alt='/villagepump/nomadoor.icon' height="19.5"/>
                    - Looking at [[MR glasses]] and AI's [[video2video]], I wonder if the appearance of the real world will be similar to the skins and textures of the game world, and if we will soon be able to apply mods and change them as we like.
                    - However, it is a playful way of putting on a beautiful face or black clothes when you look at the other person, rather than making yourself look like the other person, so it may be a different story if you can make the other person look trustworthy.
    - It's annoying how sometimes the "attributes" start talking before the "name".<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/kaede/icon' alt='/villagepump/kaede.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/bsahd/icon' alt='/villagepump/bsahd.icon' height="19.5"/>
