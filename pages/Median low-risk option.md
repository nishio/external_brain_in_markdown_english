title: "Median low-risk option"
---

I saw a fraud case many years ago and chatted about it.
    - There is often a risk of being fooled by [[new thing]]. But if we are too cautious and avoid new things, they will not develop. What should we do?
- Just collect the judgments of those around you and take [[MEDIAN]]. Extremists die first.

In other words, not standing on the edge is a [[risk aversion]].
- On the other hand, it is those who take such risks who gain the [first-mover advantage
- What happens to those who do not take cutting-edge risks, but take the [[second-best strategy]] to the extent that the cutting edge can be observed?
        - [[After the world is torn apart]], we can have a [[trade and commerce strategy]] that bridges the divide.
