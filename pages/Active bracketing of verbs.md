title: "Active bracketing of verbs"
---

After [[Bracketing Suggestions]] was [[Bracketing]] to "Dodge the Contradiction" in [/rashitamemo/tsuji edit reciprocal exchange](https://scrapbox.io/rashitamemo/tsuji edit reciprocal exchange), the switch to [[bracketing]] the [[verb]] was turned on.

If we don't bracket "dodge the contradiction", what would be the keyword instead?
- Tends to be hard words such as "aversive behavior."
    - [[one should drink alcoholic beverages]]

relevance
    - [[Panda, monkey, banana, which one is your friend?]]
    - [[Tsuji Bracketing]]
