Benefits of Openness
- You won't have to answer as many times.
> When we first started promoting "Open API," many ministries did not understand the benefits of allowing outside vendors to use their data for commercial purposes. Vendors may see more business opportunities from it, but what is the value to the civil servants?" And.
>  But now it is different. Everyone understands that the biggest advantage is that "if many people come to ask you a question, you only have to answer it once, and you don't have to spend time on it because you only have to present something once and people will discuss it with each other after they have seen it. And as you speak to many people over and over again, you don't inadvertently create differences.
>  In other words, by making it open, not only did it save time and effort on the part of the public officials to duplicate and answer many times, but it also eliminated something that restricts [[creative people]]. I think this could be helpful to everyone in Japan.
