title: 'Which is riskier?" is a false choice between the two'

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1953677024167702749) My naive feeling is something like "If you think in yen, the risk of yen is 0 and the risk of BTC is the value X. If you think in BTC, the risk of BTC is 0 and the risk of yen is the same X. The difference of opinion on which is more risky is just a difference of what denomination you are thinking of implicitly" kind of feeling.
