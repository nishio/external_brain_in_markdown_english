title: "Hearing of dissatisfaction with Scrapbox"
---

- Digging into my wife's statement about wanting to "do [[liquidation]]."
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Scrapbox has a "[[let chaos be made to speak]]" part, so it seems weird for people who want to get rid of that [[chaotic]].
    - What is this "organizing"?
    - [[big picture overview]] I want to
        - Different from [Classification.
    - Not that I want to be classified.
    - Sometimes classification is used in the process of understanding the big picture, but the goal is not classification, but rather the big picture.
            - [[Understanding the big picture is not classification.]]
- To get the big picture is to know "what kind of things there are and how much of them there are.
        - [[Know your portions]]
    - I want to [area classification
- Not classification [[Physical arrangement]].
- Anything that can't be classified as either a book or a toy should be somewhere in the middle.
    - If you put it in the book section, above the toys, that's all you need to do.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> The [[bat problem]] is caused by [[crisp]] classification, and it is better not to do it.
    - [[Associated with Location]] instead of [[labeling]] # Location
    - [[put away]] That's the image.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> You want to make the stickies a little more [[grouping]] than what you can get with the [[KJ method]].
        - The current [[Scrapbox]] has stickies lined up, but I can't do anything from there.
- A restless, though not troubled, mind, [[pith]], exactly [[good-for-nothing (e.g., in terms of quantity or quality)]].
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Customers don't understand what's at stake.
- Not inconvenient.
- I don't have trouble getting things out.
- I don't need to know exactly where everything is, but "where did that go?" but if you can remember "that area," you will be more motivated.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>You can shrink the scope of your search.
    - It's "somewhere in this room," and that's not motivating.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I understand that there is a great need for physical objects, but in the case of electronic data, you can narrow the scope by doing a [[search (e.g. for someone using a search engine)]], so why not?
- Similar to the difference between an electronic dictionary and a paper dictionary, in the process of searching for the desired object, the [[map]] is updated by looking at the surrounding objects
    - Electronic dictionaries are direct and only give you what you want.
    - If you just want to get to what you're looking for, it's faster that way.
        - I want to [[Map Update]].
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Since doing a search means that a list of things that contain a certain keyword will come up, shouldn't things in the vicinity be in view in the sense that they "contain a common keyword" of some sort?
    - Are you saying that just the fact that it contains keywords is too inaccurate?
- Large variation
- Dictionaries are organized.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Well-formatted.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Dictionaries could be organized because the target is one type of information: "word meanings".
- Search results are too unconnected.
- I don't know where to put what I see.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Cognitive burden in putting search results on the map is high.
    - [[cognitive burden]] is large, it is thrown away.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The problem is that the search results page is cluttered.
- If it's "Here's a list of all the red things in this house," there's too much information to map, so you have to squint and throw it away.

- I want to decide what is important to me.
- 'I want to make it easier to focus on what's important to me at that moment.'
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of things are important varies from time to time.
    - Therefore, we need to prepare [[information design]] to make it easier to focus at the time.

search (e.g. for someone using a search engine)
    - [[concierge]]
    - [[recommendation]]

    - [[Arrangement and Location]]
