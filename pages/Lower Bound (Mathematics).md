title: "Lower Bound (Mathematics)"

I noticed that the word "[[lower world]]" is interpreted as "gekai."
- I generally use "kakai" in the mathematical sense.

Lower limit (infimum, GLB)
The lower limit (infimum) is the largest element that is less than or equal to all the elements of a subset S.
When a subset S is contained in an ordered set P, the largest element in P that is less than or equal to all elements of S is the "lower bound. This is also called the Greatest Lower Bound (GLB).
