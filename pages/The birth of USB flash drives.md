The birth of USB flash drives
- We want to create a new mainstay product using compact flash memory.
- The Floppy Era
- Small capacity, touchable floppy
- High-capacity, untouchable file transfer over the Internet
- Over 100 ideas were all on this [[trade-off bias]].
- →What can be touched with large capacity? →USB flash drive
- Research after the idea was conceived found similar products already on the market.
    - Why wasn't it popularized?
    - Driver installation required
    - Can this be solved? → Discover the technology that solves it
    - The T and C in [[Business Model Technology Consumer Experience]] have shifted.
- Business model "how customers understand the value and buy" is weak.
    - →Sell to major manufacturers, abandoning the principle of self-sufficiency.
    - IBM began marketing the product as its own brand.
