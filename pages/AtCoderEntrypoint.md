Problem conversion note that I didn't notice.
- Given a column → [[Value determined for column → DP in section of column]].
- Maximization → [[Maximization with bisection search.]].
    - [[Determining the size of a real number]] →Want to calculate without error, but floating-point numbers are not accurate enough →Bisection search using integers
- Function with huge definition range -> [[Exchange of value range and definition range]].
- 2^100~2^10000→ [[Comes down to the smallest cut.]]
- other
        - [[Typical ideas for coming up with solutions in competitive programming]]
        - [[problem transformation]]

get_samplejs

```
let xs = $(".lang-ja .part pre[id^='pre-sample']");
let ret = "\n"
for (let i = 0; i < xs.length; i += 2){
  id = (i / 2) + 1;
  q = xs[i].innerText;
  a = xs[i + 1].innerText;
  ret += `T${id} = """\n${q}"""\n`
  ret += `TEST_T${id} = """\n>>> as_input(T${id})\n>>> main()\n${a}"""\n`
}
console.log(ret + "\n")
