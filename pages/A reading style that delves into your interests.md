> Interesting [[reading]] style: first [[itemization]] to get a [[summary]], then [[delving into]] what is [[interesting (in something)]] from there

In the past [[paper books]], if there was something [[we wanted to know]], there was no way to know [[where it was written]].
    - [[search (e.g. for someone using a search engine)]] could not

Digital books could be searched, but early searches were for exact string matches, which was poor for finding what you wanted

The "[[new search]]" that "[[finds]] information relevant to the question and generates an answer" has enabled a style of reading that "[[delves]] into things that interest you."

A similar experience is "[[consult a dictionary]]."
- A dictionary is a book that arranges information in a way that facilitates searching
- You can "[[dig]] deeper" by looking up words you are interested in.
