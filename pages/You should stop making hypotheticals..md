title: "You should stop making hypotheticals."

> [aki_akiaki](https://x.com/aki_akiaki/status/1825545982383407506) In some fields of natural science, the argument is being made that we should stop making hypotheses, and in the medical-biological sciences, this is becoming the norm. The reason is exactly the same as what you are saying here. (1/5)
>  >zeong_dictator: I've never made a "hypothesis" when I think about it. I've never had a "hypothesis" before, but I tend to come to a conclusion, and that's a bit prejudicial. And if I try to prove it with evidence, I have to use the evidence selectively, so the conclusion is likely to be distorted, which diverges from my fundamental desire to "know.

However, as a result, it also became the practice to formulate a suitable hypothesis and collect data to fit it. (2/5)

As a result, a tendency arises to collect only data that fits the hypothesis. This is the source of non-reproducible research and fabrication. What should be done, then, is simple: (3/5)

Whether the model fits reality can be verified each time new data is obtained. If there is something that does not fit the real data, the model is modified or reconstructed to fit the reality. (4/5)
