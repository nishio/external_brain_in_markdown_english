- Mr. Okuda lives from the perspective of [[himself from the future]] and considers it his [[mission]] to [[always make changes]].
    - To this end, we place importance on [[clashing values with various people]] and [[creating new values]].

- Also, in relationships, we do not judge people based on likes and dislikes, but on their distance from us.
    - We believe that by changing the distance, we can get along with different people.

- Mr. Okuda believes that in work, happiness is choosing a job that matches one's values and working at it with conviction.
    - I am more concerned about [[working on something I am comfortable with and have chosen to do]] than about money.
