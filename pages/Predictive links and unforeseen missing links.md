title: "Predictive links and unforeseen missing links"
---

    - [[Link to Prediction]]
    - I can [[bracketing]] that a page with that title would exist, and the link will turn blue to confirm that there is indeed a page.
    - [[Insufficient unforeseen links]]
    - I bracketed the page with that title because I thought it would exist, but then the link turns red and I'm like, "What? Didn't I write that?"
    - This is an opportunity.
        - A real case of "what I thought was written was not written".
            - Write now only the minimum
            - Or just leave the keywords there.
        - Cases that were written but expressed differently
            - Are those two expressions the same thing or do they have different nuances?
                    - [[Notice the differences in similarities.]]
            - If it's just a typographical error, correcting it will correct all the links together.
            - If it's a notational quirk, you can add a link and it will connect to whichever representation you write.
            - If there is a difference between the two nuances, [[understanding]] goes a step further by writing how they differ.
