title: "Don't let others take on the risks you didn't take on yourself."
---

What I casually said verbally was mentioned several times as an important point to be made, so I put it down in writing.

A number of ARAF graduates of unexplored fields say that they are "playing it safe," "they tend to choose options that could certainly be done successfully," and "they should try more things that could fail," after seeing the presentations of the current students' results in the past few years and so on. I share their sentiments in saying that.

However, I still don't think it is appropriate for others to tell them to "take more risks. It is the life of the current student creator that is exposed to risk, and others cannot shoulder the burden.

There are people in the world who get angry when others succeed, and get satisfaction by looking for rough edges and dragging them down. When they publish a book, they receive low reviews that seem to indicate that they have not read the contents, and anti-posts are made daily on social networking sites. There is no need to feed these people.

In the days of the ARAF graduates, the debriefing sessions were not recorded and shown on YouTube. In our time, we were angry that "old men who had never started their own businesses were telling young people, 'By all means, start your own business,' and 'If you do, you will definitely succeed,' etc." The composition is the same. You should not make others take risks that you did not take yourself. We must not create an "atmosphere" in which it is natural to take such risks. It is the current student who decides whether or not to take the risk, and others can only help them understand the advantages and disadvantages before making the decision.

Alumni who have survived until now may think, "It is the natural order of things that anti-survivors occur, so we need to train ourselves to be able to go through them without worrying about every single one. This is [[survivor bias]]. Only those who have not had their hearts broken by anti-Arapaho attacks, or by the memes of [[imposter syndrome]] in which people wonder if they are overrated, or by [[Delusion that the world should admire him]], remain. The reason that the current alumni are immune to those mental attacks is because of the [[multiple achievements]] they have accumulated so far, so they can believe that their value will not be diminished by the attacks. Remember, for many current students, this is "[[the]] first achievement".

supplement
- Are you arguing that we should stop releasing recordings of results briefings?"
- No, it isn't.
    - I think the release of the recordings themselves is very conducive to raising the level of innovation in Japan. I think it will create more value if it continues.
    - However, this is for the convenience of the project sponsors, and should not be at the expense of the individual creators who have been selected.
    - It would be good to make the design of the current recording public as a given constraint, while leaving it up to the individual creator to decide how to make decisions within that context.

relevance
    - [[Biases around entrepreneurship]]
    - [[Bazaar and Clubs]]
    - In the world, there are both bazaars (markets) where you cannot control who comes, and clubs with members who share common values, and they are interconnected.
    - Some people in the world have the value that if you try something new, of course you're going to fail, and some people don't.
    - The results briefing is in the bazaar and the boost - 8th station is in the club.
    - Bazaars are inevitable in life, but you don't always have to be in the bazaar.
    - [[Don't panic, but keep going.]]
    - [[The problem of not being a frog in a well]]
    - Until the development of SNS, it was possible to [[nurture self-esteem]] in [[Small Communities]].
    - Young people today have had social networking services for as long as they can remember, and are exposed to an environment where they are compared to people their own age around the world.
    - This is a harsh world that no one over the age of Ala. has ever experienced.
