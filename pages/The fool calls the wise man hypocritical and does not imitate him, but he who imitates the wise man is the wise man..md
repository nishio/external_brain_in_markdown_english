title: "The fool calls the wise man hypocritical and does not imitate him, but he who imitates the wise man is the wise man."

- Stupid people hate smart people.
- They say things like, "You're just selling your name by embellishing the fact that you're giving away small profits for big profits."
- You say such things because your way of thinking and that of the wise are far apart
- Such a person would not seek to imitate the behavior of a wise man.
- But [a wise man is a man who imitates a wise man.
see  [[Tazurezuregusa, paragraph 85.]]

- [[hypocrisy]]
