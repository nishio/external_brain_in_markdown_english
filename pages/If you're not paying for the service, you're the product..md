One of the earliest sources is found in the article "Little Brother Is Watching You: The Menace of Corporate America" written by Claire Wolfe in 1999. The article mentions electronic markets and the buying and selling of personal data (Quote Investigator).

Also in 2001, in a Usenet newsgroup, Tom Johnson was confirmed to have stated that "TV viewers are not customers, they are a product" (Quote Investigator). Furthermore, in 2010, on the website Metafilter, the user name "blue_beetle," Andrew Lewis, left the comment "If you are not paying for it, you're not the customer; you 're the product being sold." (Cornell Blog Service) (EconAmbassador EconAmbassador).

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>In 1973, artists Richard Serra and Carlota Fay Schoolman broadcast a short video called "Television Delivers People." In this video, text slowly scrolled up in white letters on a blue background while a peaceful soundtrack played.
