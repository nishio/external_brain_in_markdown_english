[A truly global, non-WEIRD examination of collectivism: The Global Collectivism Index (GCI) [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/) S266662272100023X](2022), covering 99.9% of the global population, Japan ranked 180th out of 188 countries in terms of its score indicating the strength of [collectivism

(Many people believe it is high.) What is relatively high is [[uncertainty avoidance]]. What is relatively high is the tendency toward [[uncertainty avoidance]] and [[long-term thinking]], low [[diversity]], high [[gender gap]] index, and [[stressful]] personality. But any scholar who claims these are the causes of economic stagnation is not sane. lol

>  I'm using the data here, are there any empirical research papers that look good? I've heard that the discourse is not even supported in the first place, and I'd like to update my knowledge.

- Readers will surely notice that Japan received a very low GCI score, ranking 180th out of 188 nations. We address this issue in great detail later. For now, we begin with the obvious. Modern Japan has very small families, very high rates of car ownership, and low levels of ingroup favoritism (Hamamura, 2012). Japan is also one of the least religious nations on earth. Such facts make Japan an individualistic nation (Matsumoto et al., 1996). This does not mean, for example, that people from Japan care little about interpersonal harmony. Instead, concerns for interpersonal harmony may not be as tightly linked to collectivism as many have assumed (cf. Vignoles et al., 2016, and see also Minkov et al., 2017).
    - Japan ranks 180th out of 188 countries with a very low GCI score

>  I guess we should no longer teach collectivism.
>  Uncertainty Avoidance is still high.
>  It is surprising that Motivation toward Achievement and Success is so high, but in a way it is a pleasant result.

> [kodai_kusano](https://twitter.com/kodai_kusano/status/1730596646336049619) Yes, I think it's better not to tell them! I'd rather convey the difficulty and value of social science research on this matter.

> [tatsuyautexas](https://twitter.com/tatsuyautexas/status/1730597446609199603) Like Maslow and others, there are many things that only discourse can stand alone and are no longer recoverable.
>  Every day I find it very difficult to correct something that somehow "rings a bell". I am rather complicit in the reproduction. I have reflected on this.

> [kodai_kusano](https://twitter.com/kodai_kusano/status/1730597965612343603) I think it's hard to find anything other than your own specialty, because it's a world where 51% agree with you and 49% disagree with you lol.

> [tatsuyautexas](https://twitter.com/tatsuyautexas/status/1730598657362174178) You are right. I have to teach a wide range of classes, so it's really hard to update the whole thing..,
