<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>It is important to utilize digital tools to streamline discussions and manage costs, and to properly assess the balance between the need for dialogue and costs.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Here is a summary of this conversation:
- Using social networking sites such as Polis and Twitter to gather opinions from a wide audience, obtain real-time feedback, and build consensus through visual analysis can be helpful, but managing the impact and privacy of the public forum can be a challenge.
- Digital tools can be used to facilitate efficient discussions through information sharing, focus meetings, and surveys and polls.
- There are a variety of ways to balance the need for dialogue and cost to promote efficient and effective problem solving. Cost efficiency and clarity of objectives are particularly important.
- We need to evaluate the value and cost of dialogue and choose which discussions to spend our time on.
- In a dialogue, it is important to understand each other's position and find common ground, as the other party may feel that there is room for discussion.

## conversation log
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>There are times when I think "that's not up for debate" about certain things. Like, for example, people who are skeptical about the use of AI.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The phrase "it is not debatable" in Japanese often means that something is so obvious that it is not worth discussing, or that a consensus can be found; perhaps you think it applies to those who are skeptical about the use of AI. How do you feel about that? Any particular concerns or thoughts?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>So from the other side, you don't "think it's debatable."

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Yes, from the other side's perspective, they may feel that the opinions and questions they have are fully debatable. The argument arises because there exists a difference of opinion and a gap in understanding from each side's point of view. In such cases, I think it is important to understand each other's views and find common ground through dialogue.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It is not always necessary to find common ground because dialogue is costly, and it always makes sense to dialogue and rub together if you continue to work on a project with that person, but in general it is not justified to pay the cost of rubbing together if you simply have a conversation.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>That's right. Dialogue involves time, effort, and sometimes emotional cost. Therefore, it is important to consider what you are trying to accomplish through dialogue and whether the value outweighs the cost. Efficient decision-making is required, especially in business contexts and project management. Dialogue is necessary when the outcome is directly related to the success of the project or when it is important to avoid future misunderstandings or problems. On the other hand, it is not practical to devote time to every opinion, so it is necessary to be selective about which discussions to spend time on.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there any way to get closer to the overall optimum than simply shutting down the dialogue with "no room for discussion" without incurring a significant cost on my part?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Certainly, rather than shutting down the dialogue altogether, an approach can be considered that aims for total optimization while keeping communication costs down. You may want to consider the following methods
- Share information in advance: Share relevant information, data, and positions in writing before the discussion takes place. This will save time during the actual meeting and dialogue and allow you to focus on more specific discussions.
- Set up limited meetings: Rather than unlimited discussions, set up shorter meetings that focus on specific topics or issues. This keeps the discussion focused on the essential points and avoids wasting time.
- Use a decision-making framework: for example, adopting a majority vote or a decision by a named decision-maker, rather than reaching a consensus, can end the discussion quickly.
- Use of digital tools: Gather opinions using online surveys and feedback tools to identify trends in opinions prior to the actual meeting. This allows you to narrow down the necessary discussion points in advance.
- Use of an outside mediator or facilitator: Having a third party facilitate the meeting may allow for objective and efficient discussion. This allows only the necessary points to be clarified while avoiding emotional conflicts.
These methods are designed to balance the need for dialogue with the cost to efficiently and effectively solve problems. Which method is chosen depends on the situation and the characteristics of the target group.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Certainly, having a third party intervene (number 5) could incur additional costs. On the other hand, approaches 1 through 4 are good options that can increase the efficiency of communication and reduce costs through the use of digital tools. In particular, the following tools may be useful:
- Online document sharing: Use Google Docs, Microsoft OneDrive, etc. to share information in advance so that participants can review the content beforehand.
- Focused Online Meetings: Utilize platforms such as Zoom or Microsoft Teams for focused discussions in a limited amount of time.
- Surveys and polling tools: use SurveyMonkey or Google Forms to gather and tabulate opinions to identify which points to focus on.

By utilizing these tools, participants' opinions can be efficiently collected and analyzed, allowing them to focus on the necessary discussions. In addition, since digital tools can be used in the same way even when participants are remotely located, collaboration is possible without the constraints of physical distance.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Consider using Polis-like or Twitter or other social networking sites.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Using platforms like Polis and social networking sites like Twitter is an effective way to quickly gather a wide range of opinions. In particular, they can be helpful in the following ways
- Gathering a wide range of opinions: Social networking sites are used by a large number of people and are well suited for gathering opinions from participants with diverse backgrounds.
- Real-time feedback: Platforms like Twitter, in particular, allow you to see real-time reactions and get an immediate sense of what is going on in the discussion.
- Visual analysis and consensus building assistance: Polis provides a visual clustering of opinions, making it easy to identify which opinions are gaining traction and where divergence exists.

One caveat to using these tools is that discussions in a public forum can be easily influenced by the opinions of participants, and privacy must be managed. With proper moderation and guidelines in place, these issues can be minimized while still allowing for effective discussion.
