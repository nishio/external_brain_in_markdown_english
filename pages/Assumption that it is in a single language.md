Assumption that it is in a single language

Work to make information accessible that has not yet been made accessible by AI
    - [[accessibility]]
- Verbalize what has not yet been verbalized.
- Assumption that it is in a single language

I'm not writing a sentence [[I'm writing down an inner word]].
[[English (language)]] mixed with [internal language
- Accessible" comes before "accessible."
