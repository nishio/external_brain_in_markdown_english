    - [[Hofstede]]
- A Multicultural World Learning Differences and Finding a Way to Coexist
    - The Japanese title by itself seems decent, but when compared to the original title, it's #Weird Japanese title.
    - Original title: [[cultures and organizations - software of the mind]].
    - Culture and Organization - Software of the Mind
    - The Japanese title leaves out the issue of how culture influences the way an organization is organized.

- Borrowed from the company.
    - At the time I rented the book, it was in short supply and at a premium price, so I did not purchase it, but now that a new edition is available, it is cheaper.
