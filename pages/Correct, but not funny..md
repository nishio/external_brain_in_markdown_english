### digest of notes
.
When creators fall into the "realism disease," they tend to produce "correct" but "uninteresting" works based on the laws of physics and human psychology.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The fragment "You can't make good work without ideals. But if they are too high, you can't even make bad works" is related to the note. It is related in that when creators fall into the "realistic disease," they tend to create "uninteresting" works because their ideals are too high.

### deep thinking
The cause of creators falling into the "realism disease" may be that their ideals are too high. However, without those ideals, interesting works cannot be created. Therefore, it is important to find a balance between ideals and reality.

### summary of thoughts and title
.
"The balance between ideals and reality cures creators' 'realism disease.'"
