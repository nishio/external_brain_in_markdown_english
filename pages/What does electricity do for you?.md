- Michael Faraday was a 19th century English scientist and pioneer in electromagnetism. His experiments and theories laid the foundation for the theory of electromagnetic waves, the invention of electrical machines, and modern electrical engineering and electronics.
- After a lecture in which Faraday disclosed the results of his research on electricity, the then British Prime Minister asked, "Such a discovery of electricity, specifically [what's the use?" He is said to have been asked.
- Faraday reportedly replied to the prime minister, "Sir, I do not yet know the value of that discovery, but one day you will impose a tax on it.
    - Faraday's response was insightful, showing that scientific inquiry does not always bring immediate practical benefits.
    - In fact, Faraday's work played a decisive role in the later commercialization of electricity and the development of electrical engineering, forming the foundation of modern society.
