title: "remote collaboration"
---

- Collaboration allows for the sharing of non-verbalized [[tacit knowledge (knowledge management terminology)]].
    - [[SECI Model]]
- There is a well-known misconception that "communalization" means physically getting together.
    - The image is generalized because of famous examples of implementation, such as camps
- The key element for tacit knowledge sharing to occur is "being able to observe the behavior of others.
- Before the development of ICT technology, "being able to observe the behavior of others" = "being in the same place".

- Even remote areas can benefit from co-location.
    - Of course, being in the same place is more informative.
    - but the cost of creating a state of being in the same place is also high.
    - Taking low-cost measures as a small start is also an option.

- Example
    - Multiple remote people working on a project with a high degree of discretion
    - Able to observe actions taken by a person (e.g., tools chosen at discretion, people contacted, etc.)
    - There is learning for the participants.
