Graduating children from [[allowance]].
> [nagise](https://x.com/nagise/status/1829287178545123401) Today, the borders of work have been raised, making it harder for kids to work and get paid, and there is a huge disconnect between kids getting an allowance and working in the workforce. There is a big disconnect between children receiving an allowance and working as adults. Independence for kids would be a big challenge for parents.

> [nagise](https://x.com/nagise/status/1829288246515495030) It's not good for children to feel like they're being provided for one way or the other. When I was in high school, I wanted to be independent as soon as possible. Homo sapiens is a herd living creature, but if you don't [[contribute to the herd]], you [[don't exist]]. If I don't feel that I'm [[being useful]], I don't feel at home.

>  The transition from child to adult involves such a change of position, and I think this is one of the reasons for the mental instability of [[adolescence]].

[[I want to get out of being nurtured.]]
