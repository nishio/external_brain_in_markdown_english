title: "What is a drinking party?"
---

- What is [[get-together]]?
- Cooking was introduced as [[excuse object]],
- A place that is softened [[broken out]] by the high cost of moving seats.

A drinking party of 10 people will generate a smaller group on its own.
- Due to difficulty in hearing voices at a distance
- A [[Zoom Drinking Party]] of 10 people would make the group too large and would interfere with [[synchronous communication]] via voice.
- A Zoom drinking party of 2-3 people would work.
    - but this time, "new combinations with unexpected members" will no longer occur.
- Proposal to randomly assign large numbers of members to small [breakout rooms
    - This causes pain "when you are matched with someone you don't like".
    - Because the "excuse object" of food does not exist, the air of "I have to interact with the people who are there" is generated.
