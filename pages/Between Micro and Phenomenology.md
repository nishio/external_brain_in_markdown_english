Between Micro and Phenomenology
The theme "between the micro and the phenomenological" suggests philosophical, artistic, and scientific considerations that explore the relationship between minute phenomena and elements (micro-scale) and the consciousness of the subject experiencing them (phenomenological perspective). Such themes are often discussed at the intersection of music, technology, and philosophy in particular.

The following is a detailed explanation.

1. what is micro?
Microscale refers to very small components or phenomena. This can apply to sound, image, matter, time, and many other dimensions.
Specific examples:.
Music: Granular synthesis, which breaks sound into millisecond "grains".
Video: Technology that analyzes and reconstructs video frame by frame.
Biology: microscopic structures at the cellular and molecular level.
2. what is phenomenology?
Phenomenology, a philosophy proposed by Etmund Husserl, explores how the consciousness of the subject experiences the world and constructs meaning.
Important features:.
Emphasis on the perspective of the subject experiencing the world.
The focus is not on "what exists," but on "how existence is experienced."
Explore the relationship between consciousness and phenomena.
3. themes between micro and phenomenology
Themes explored between "micro" and "phenomenology" include questions such as:

(1) How micro elements are perceived
How do human senses integrate and make sense of micro-scale phenomena (e.g., microscopic grains of sound or frames of images)?
Example: The
How sound particles in granular synthesis are perceived in time and space.
In video editing, how are the individual frames experienced as a unified flow?
(2) Relationship between perception and microscale
How can technology extend microscopic phenomena beyond the graspable scale of human perception and provide new experiences for consciousness?
Example: The
Electron microscopes and digital tools translate microscale information into perceptible forms.
(3) Relationship between micro and wholeness
The process by which micro phenomena are integrated to construct wholeness and how this is experienced by the subjective.
From a phenomenological perspective, we ask how micro-scale components cohere as a "phenomenon.
(4) Temporal and micro
We will examine how microscale elements shape the temporal flow.
How does phenomenological time (Bergson and Heidegger's "duration") and micro-scale fragmented time (frame or grain) harmonize or conflict?
4. application examples
(1) Music
Granular synthesis (e.g. Curtis Rose):.
It creates a new acoustic experience by breaking down music into millisecond grains and reconstructing them.
Phenomenologically, the question is how a collection of particles is perceived and temporally coherent.
(2) Video
Microscale (frame-by-frame editing) in video editing:.
A phenomenon in which individual frames are integrated into consciousness as a "flow".
The impact of frame-by-frame choices on the audience's experience can be analyzed phenomenologically.
(3) Digital Art
In digital art, minute pixel-by-pixel manipulations affect the overall visual experience.
Phenomenologically, it is important to understand how pixel-by-pixel manipulation transforms the viewer's experience.
5. conclusion
Between the Micro and the Phenomenological" is a theme that explores the interaction between microscopic components (sound, image, matter) and the consciousness of the subject experiencing them. It provides a framework for analyzing new technological sensory experiences and understanding how humans make sense of and perceive complex phenomena. This exploration is applicable across multiple disciplines of philosophy, art, music, design, and science.
