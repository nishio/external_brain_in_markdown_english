    - [[Resolution of perception of things]]
    - [[Wrong 2]] I thought of an example of an over-abstraction of various realities
        - [[Abstraction is not a good thing.]]   [[moderation]]
- I tried to depict the transition between those interpretations.
- 1: The state of assuming that there are only two kinds of things
    - The state of thinking that only black and white exist in the world.
- 2: A state in which one realizes that there is also an in-between.
    - The state in which I realized that in addition to black and white, there is also gray.
- 3: A state in which one realizes that there are not several kinds of things, but a myriad of kinds.
    - A state in which you realize that there is not one kind of gray, but gradations and various kinds of gray.
- 4: A state of realization that the two attributes are not in conflict but can change independently
    - What you thought was black and white is independent, like red and blue, and there is purple with both and black without both
        - [[There is more than one axis.]]
- 5: State where you notice that the value is accompanied by a variance
        - [[uncertainty]] has a variance in the presence of
    - One step beyond this is "the state in which one realizes that [[distribution]] is not necessarily normally distributed," where "expected value" and "value with the highest probability of occurring" are different.

4 ahead [[Trade-off between two attributes]].
Might as well put it in a blind spot card.

- > Maybe we can put it in a blind spot card.
- After considering it, I felt that this should essentially be broken up into multiple cards.
- > I guess you dichotomized the lowest resolution state at the resolution stage, but there's even more "identical" --- [[what you thought was one concept is two nested concepts]].
- First there is a point, a realization that "[[It's not a point, it's a size.]] In a set," which is the base realization of [Proceed in reverse, but the goal is the same.

        - [[Assume it's a point.]]
        - Added 2023-09-08 "[[It's not a point, it's a size.]]" implicitly assumes "there is a size" = "there is a boundary." but may be [There is no boundary. [[It's not a point, it's a probability distribution]].
    - The opposite mistake is [[the mistake of thinking the distribution is a point]].
- There is a realization that changes from thinking of a set of that size as "one thing" to "two different things," which is [[Different things belonging to the same thing]].
- In the diagram now, there are two followed by three.
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/994fad428fbe7af23a9086a983e159d7/thumb/1000)
    - I skipped over that and realized, "I thought they were two separate things, but they're gradients" [[False dichotomy]].
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/10ad9c1f6cfd2701d0af1a5e0c661869/thumb/1000)

- The realization that the system may not be a single axis of 4

        - [[False dichotomy]]
        - [[The axis is not one-dimensional.]]
        - [[There is more than one strong and weak axis]]
        - [[Large and small relationships do not exist.]]
- As for 5.

        - [[Expected value is not the mode.]]
        - [[Deviation from the mean and sample size]]

    - [[Isn't it the size?]]
    - [[One? Two?]]
    - [[Are the boundaries clear?]]
    - [[Isn't there a third one?]]
    - [[False dichotomy]] : I didn't put the diagram above because there is room for improvement.
    - [[Aren't there countless of them?]]
    - [[Isn't there more than one axis?]]
    - > 4 not a single axis, but the realization that the system is not a single axis.

        - [Isn't there a variance?
        - Isn't [[Expected value is not the mode.]] like a blind spot because it's often said?
        - Should we adopt it because so many people are addicted to it, as they often say?
    - I find it surprising to hear that the comparison of averages is not in full order [[Efron's Dice]].
    - The other two are, well, blind spots.
    - Sometimes the greater the variation, the better."
        - If you listen to a lot of people's opinions and take an average when the greater the variation the better, it's going to be worse.
        - The two are connected in terms of
    - Fundamentally nonlinear threshold function effects
        - So [[probability resonance]] also leads

- I'll chew on 5 a little more.
        - [[Isn't there a variance?]]
        - [[I thought the variances would be different.]]
        - [[I thought the distribution shapes were different.]]
            - [[Recognition of distribution shapes]]
            - [[Note the shape of the distribution, not just the mean.]]

It was once titled "Resolution of Reality" phase (2019-05-06)
- I tried to link this page on 2021-03-28 and mistook it for "stages of cognitive resolution" [[Cognitive Resolution]].
    - After thinking about the swing of [[Resolution of Reality and Cognition]], I felt that [[Resolution of perception of things]] would be better.
- I used "stages of resolution" because "stages of resolution of perception of things" is too long.
