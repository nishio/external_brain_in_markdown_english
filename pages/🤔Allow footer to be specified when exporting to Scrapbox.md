title: "🤔Allow footer to be specified when exporting to Scrapbox"
---

I did [[✅Insert URL when exporting to Scrapbox]] because I want it, but for the average user, it is an unnecessary feature
On the other hand, I think there are cases where you want to add a common footer to the log, so it would be good to have a footer specification function.
