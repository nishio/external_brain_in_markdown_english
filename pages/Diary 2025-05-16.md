> [kensuzuki](https://x.com/kensuzuki/status/1923150375701369062) I just finished a raging week of attending (including preparation) Audrey Tan and Glenn Weil for 4 days. It was a great luxury to be able to listen to their talks, including Q&A sessions, more than 10 times from a very special seat. I may have learned the most from them.

Clearing out too many open tabs for the weekend.
- This was still a little bit of a gap year, a little bit of a cleanup.
- There are 9 desktops 14 Chrome
- task1
    - [/plurality-japanese/[[Audrey Tan x E. Glenn Weil talk about the next generation of democracy and the future of Japan]] "PLURALITY" Cybozu Shiki Books Publication Memorial Talk Event (Moderator: Ryuichiro Takeshita)]
        - [[Talk Event to Commemorate the Publication of PLURALITY at Tsutaya]]
    - I'm in the process of making a summary, but I feel that it would be better to release it at the same time that the ivy side starts selling videos, so I'm downgrading the priority.
- task2
    - [[Plurality Tokyo Namerakaigi #2]]
    - The summary of this should be a clean YouTube video, so it should be easy to do using a transcription once it's done.
