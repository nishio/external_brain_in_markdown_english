title: "Procrastination and Self-Compassion"
---

> [nori76](https://x.com/nori76/status/1794186899915186444) I was reading a book on "[[procrastination]]" and found it interesting that the key to dealing with procrastination is "[[self-compassion]]". The theory is that people who tend to procrastinate are often "[[self-critical]]" or "[perfectionism (psychology)", which leads them to think, "I'm so bad" or "I can't produce at this level" when, for example, their work is not going well. This leads to procrastination.

>  I am also a procrastinator, and this mechanism is very applicable to me. I've been saying "I'm not good enough" less and less lately, but "I can't deliver this" is quite common, and when I'm in that mode, I procrastinate a lot.
>
>  This kind of logic is why compasition is indeed important. I've learned to practice it without realizing it, and I've reduced my "fatal" procrastination since my mid-30s.
>
>  The key there was to not make compaction a big theme. It's hard to achieve something like "improving [[self-assurance]]," but it's easy to do something small and concrete like "I was able to reply to one email! It is easy to praise small, concrete accomplishments like "I got one reply to my email! I've been doing this repeatedly, and before I knew it, I was able to use a "self-compassion" mode, and it certainly seems to have reduced my procrastination. So, I have recently studied the theoretical model of this and it has become very clear to me.

>  I encountered the psychological logic of "I procrastinate because I want to think that I am still better off by having guilt about procrastination,
>  I once found that if I kept a praise diary, my procrastination behavior naturally disappeared.

> [yukimitsumugiya](https://x.com/yukimitsumugiya/status/1794646862445924852) I've been doing some research to improve my resolution on "Procrastination, Guilt, and Self-Compassion" and found that procrastination is a dopamine-dependent behavior. I found out that procrastination is a dopamine-dependent behavior. In the end, it all comes down to brain science. .... Procrastination is often seen as "not taking action," but it's the act of procrastinating.

> [yukimitsumugiya](https://x.com/yukimitsumugiya/status/1794647288583008539) The seemingly illogical and mysterious behavior of procrastinating in order to feel guilty can also be explained by the fact that the procrastination was done in order to feel dopamine. I can explain it by saying that I was procrastinating to feel dopamine.

> [nori76](https://x.com/nori76/status/1794189119444435177) As you can read in Watkins' book, for example, when you don't finish the work that is due tomorrow, and you keep thinking "How bad I am," and you don't get to the work in front of you, and you keep looking at your phone, it actually works as "[[reward]]" in the sense that you "detach" from the painful reality of not finishing the work. When you avoid doing so, it actually functions as a "[[reward]]" in the sense that you can "get away" from the painful reality of not being able to finish your work. So it gets "learned".
>
>  Of course, if you don't finish the work, you will be scolded the next day, and in the long run this is a disadvantage rather than a reward, but in the short run the reward is that you can "escape reality.
>
>  Not all people are like this, but I think it makes a lot of sense to me that the feelings of "I hate myself for worrying so much and procrastinating so much" are actually a reward for learning these patterns, and that's why I think solving problems of the mind is so difficult. I think that's why it's so difficult to solve the problem of the mind. It's very ambivalent.
