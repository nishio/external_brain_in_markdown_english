title: "Bullet-pointing the AI's output"
---


from [/omoikane/chat page 5](https://scrapbox.io/omoikane/chat page 5).
- When I first created [[AI writes research notes daily]], I was trying to observe the AI's thoughts as they progressed on their own, without any interaction with me.
- Later, it settled on "[[Bullet-pointing the AI's output]]", a style of interaction that is a mystery to the general public.


- Question to [AI writes research notes daily
- Q: An AI compiles an article written by a human and then the human puts additional input into it to make the article better?
    - I think the general structure is correct in that interpretation, but there is ambiguity in the interpretation of "summarize" and "improve the article".<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - AI is more like "write what you think" than "summarize".
    - People are not "making the article better" at the moment, but rather "making bullet points, discarding or rearranging what they don't need, and adding new things that come to mind".
