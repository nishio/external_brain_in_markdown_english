title: "Stationery called waterproof smartphone"

    - If you have a [[waterproof smart phone]], you can take notes while you [[take a bath]].
    - [[stationery]]
- I wrote this one while bathing.

It's been realized for several years, but I only benefited from it when I bought a new iPhone in [[2019]] and got the [[iPhone11]].
