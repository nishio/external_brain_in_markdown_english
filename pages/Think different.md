> "Think different" was the slogan of Apple Computer's 1997 advertising campaign... The use of this slogan continued until 2002, when a follow-up ad campaign, the Apple Switch ad campaign, was launched. The slogan was perceived as a twist on the old industry motto "[[Think]]" created by IBM's first president, Thomas J. Watson. At the time, IBM was one of Apple's direct rivals in the personal computer market. What was clear was that Apple's slogan was intended to present Apple products as a more sensible alternative for consumers who were considering buying PC/AT compatible machines and Windows, both of which had their origins in IBM.
