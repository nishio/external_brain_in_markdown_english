title: "To enjoy something new, you have to pay the cost of mastery."
---

from  [[There are two ways to behave toward new things]]

You have to pay [[acquisition cost]] to [[enjoy (oneself)]] the new one.
- Every new tool requires a learning cost to use and enjoy it.
- When some people enjoy using a certain tool and others don't.
    - Learning from those who enjoy it is more efficient.
- People who attribute the reasons for their lack of enjoyment to the shortcomings of the tools will not be able to learn effectively.
    - Because communicating with that person is not fun for "the person who enjoys that tool."
