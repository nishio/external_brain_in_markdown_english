Yes, Safari on Mac can organize it (assuming iCloud tab sync); Windows alone practically can't.

Close iPhone tabs on Mac
1. turn on iCloud Safari sync on both (iPhone: Settings -> My Name -> iCloud -> Safari, Mac: System Settings -> Apple ID -> iCloud -> Safari) ([Apple Support [https://support.apple.com/en-us/](https://support.apple.com/en-us/) 108409])
- Open Safari on your Mac and go to the menu "Bookmarks" -> "Show Start Page". You will see a list of the tabs you have open on your iPhone in the iCloud tab at the bottom. Control-click on the tab → "Close Tab". ([Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108409))

Batch organization by tab group (Mac)
- By right-clicking on a tab group in the sidebar -> "Delete", you can close all tabs in that group at once (and close the iPhone side during synchronization). ([iGeeksBlog](https://www.igeeksblog.com/use-tab-groups-in-safari-on-iphone-ipad-mac/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

supplement
- There is no official way to view/manipulate iCloud tabs on a Windows PC. Organize them from your iPhone OR Mac. ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/aj3kic/icloud_tabs_on_windows/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- If tab syncing is unstable, try turning off "Safari in iCloud" on the iPhone/Mac and then turning it back on to try syncing again. ([Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108409))
If necessary, we will guide you through the procedure in detail to the location of the screen according to your current environment (with or without Mac and OS).
