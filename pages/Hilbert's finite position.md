title: "Hilbert's finite position"
---

- Hilbert's Second Problem, 1900.
- How can we guarantee the existence of transfinite objects such as the real numbers that mathematics is dealing with?
- Hilbert thought it would be sufficient to first formally express the properties of transfinite objects as axioms, and then prove the consistency of the formal system obtained in this way.
- In 1931, Gödel proved the Incompleteness Theorem, which showed that it is not possible to prove consistency within the "finite standpoint" that Hilbert had originally thought.
- In [[1936.]], Gentzen succeeded in proving the consistency of natural number theory by relaxing Hilbert's "finite position" a bit and allowing transfinite induction up to a certain ordered number.
- Gaisi Takeuchi developed a method for describing larger ordered numbers and extended Gentzen's method to provide a proof of the consistency of subsystems of real number theory.
