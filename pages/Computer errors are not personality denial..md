title: "Computer errors are not personality denial."

> [yontengoP](https://twitter.com/yontengoP/status/1382472819838095360): In fact, it seems that there are people who feel "denied" or "deprived of dignity" every time an error occurs when writing a program. I met a new graduate who asked me, "How can I get rid of errors? I'm having a hard time in my mind..." The men who kept making errors all at once fell silent.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1382549102055989249): "It's hard when the computer makes errors. It's a problem of communication skill that the computer takes it as if it's a denial of one's personality even though it's just pointing out a fact.
    - [[Phenomenon of reading non-existent intentions on its own.]]

> yoya: I'm rather worried if I don't get any errors at all, so I deliberately mix errors temporarily to make sure my process is reflected. It's up to the point. (And if you forget to remove it, it's very important)
- There it is. And as a Python user, I often use "1/0" to intentionally generate an error, but I have trouble doing the same thing in JavaScript and getting no error!

If you are an empathic type of person, you can say, "The computer is smart enough to instantly see the errors in the program you wrote, but it doesn't hate you or shy away from you and tell you how many times you made a mistake! And yet you don't read the error messages the computer writes for you!" I say.
