title: "Don't expect value to be provided for free."

- Don't [[expect]] that something with [[value]] will be offered [[for free]].

[If it is offered [[by chance]] [[at one time]], [[in a limited location]], do not expect it to be offered [[continuously]]!

[[Ease of understanding is a value.]]
    - [[Without literacy, you can't see it or read it.]]
