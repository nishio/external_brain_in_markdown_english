- If all you see are pages with word titles, your heart won't dance when you look at the list of pages.
    - I feel like I'm looking at a dictionary.
    - I worked hard and unnecessarily created a lot of word description pages, resulting in a dictionary-like wiki that broke my heart.
        - 2023-08-25 Related: [[Wiki is not a dictionary]].
    - Many people have experienced the heartbreak of the old wiki system, which turned the means and purpose of using the wiki upside down and turned words into pages, resulting in the mass production of pages with little content and the experience of "clicking on a link and being disappointed because there is no content.
- They are so wary of this that they dislike pages with word titles
- However, the word title page helps create a team [lingua franca
    - Someone writes a messy sentence.
    - The person who reads it [[Words you don't understand]] will make it a link.
    - Write a description on the link.
        - I can put any number of detailed explanations on a separate page.

- What is the difference between the former and the latter?
    - The former is trying to create a dictionary-like "explanation of the meaning of words" from the beginning.
        - A collection of dictionary-like definitions of a word can easily become "[[a]] disjointed article."
    - The latter is written first.
        - Then it says what the word "[[as necessary]]" means.
                - [[pull system]].
        - Not the definition of the word, but the "[[context]]" in which the word is used first.
            - Avoids being defined on the ground.
        - The definition of this unfamiliar word can be made into a link by Mr. A and written by Mr. B who understands it, or Mr. A can ask Mr. C a question and write what he understands.
