<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I want to put Keichobot in context.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "Keichobot" is this "Keichobot"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Listen first.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Yes, sir.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Groupware facilitated the distribution of written information.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Groupware."
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>However, it is only "written information" and this is a weakness of the current groupware.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Groupware."
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>The problem is that the "blurbs that can't be put into words well" are not circulated until they are put into words. Because it is easy to see "what has been put into words," it is misinterpreted as if it is the entirety of opinion.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>"A blur I can't quite put into words."
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It tends to be the responsibility of individuals to verbalize and transmit their mumbo-jumbo, but many individuals feel that they are not good at it. The advantage of an organization is to increase productivity as a whole by having those around you cover for the individual's unskillfulness.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>The human-powered solution to this problem is "listening," and discussions on good listening techniques have been held and given names such as "listening" and "coaching.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Listening.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>This can create a quality experience if the listener is trained to "not impose his/her opinion," etc., but using [[a flesh-and-blood person]] is expensive.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Opinion."
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Replacing this with software, instead of losing quality, creates another advantage: you can use it whenever you want.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Benefits."
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>For example, it can be used while taking a walk early in the morning, or while taking a bath late at night.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Early morning."
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It is based on clean language, a coaching technique. In this technique, the listener asks only questions and does not express his or her own opinion.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Listener."
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>In this method, listeners are trained to use only the words used by the speaker and not to interpret them arbitrarily and change them to other words. However, this is something that requires training for humans, who are prone to interpretation, but software is rather good at it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Listener."
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I could talk about how it works, but that's not the context, so we'll leave that for another time.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Context."

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Listener."

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I would like to sort out the context of Keichobot.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the "context" of this "context"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Why were you born and why do you need it?

- What kind of "listener" is this "listener"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>People who are not able to put their mumbo-jumbo into words, and if you hit them with someone else's words, they will be influenced by them and prevent you from forming your own thoughts.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>That such a person can put the bother into words.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "moyamoya" is this "moyamoya"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>A mass of "feelings" (felt sense) that have not yet been put into words that come from what the person has experienced.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  What such a person can do to put his/her bewilderment into words.
- Is there anything else you can tell us about this "blur"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Treasure trove, if it is covered by what is already in the word, no moya-moya will remain, so in the moya-moya lies knowledge that the organization has not yet acquired.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between the "word" and the "blur"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I can't tell others about it if it's still a blur.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>How do you know that "blur"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I can tell by the fact that I feel somewhat uncomfortable or unrefreshed.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  Can't tell others if it remains a blur
- What do you hope will happen regarding this "blurring"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>When it can be expressed in words, you say, "Yes! This is what I wanted to say!" and you'll be happy.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "word" is that "word"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Something that expresses feelings.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  Can't tell others if it remains a blur
- Where does this "blurring" come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Comes from personal experience
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  When it can be expressed in words, you say, "Yes! This is what I wanted to say!" and you'll be happy!
- Is there anything else you can tell us about this "word"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>In order for the person to be able to express himself/herself and be happy, it is enough if the expression is one that the person can understand, and the process of making it into an expression that others can understand can be done after the "language that only the person can understand" has been created.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is the "word"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Near the surface of the blur.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is this "blur"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Well, maybe in the mind.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  In order for the person to be able to express himself/herself and be happy, it is enough if the expression is first understood by the person himself/herself, and the process of making it into an expression that others can understand can be done after the "language that only the person can understand" has been created.
- Where is this "word"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>From the surface of the blur, "words that only he can understand" emerge and are passed on to others. Whether or not others can accept and understand it is a relationship between the words and that other person, not something the narrator should worry about beforehand
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is the "word" the same as "moyamoya"? Is it different?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>No. Words are born from mumbo-jumbo.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is this "blur" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>If you divide the mind into the surface and the deep, it's in the deep.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  No. Words are born from mumbo-jumbo.
- What does this "blur" look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>The sea, like the primordial sea in Mesopotamian mythology, is a sea of fertility, a sea that gives birth to many things, itself chaos, clean fresh water flowing into it, giving birth to diverse gods, which in turn shaped the world.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  No. Words are born from mumbo-jumbo.
- How do you know this "word"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>You can tell by the way the words come out and it feels right.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Where do these "words" come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Words are acquired through learning with "institutionalized" meanings. However, when we are faced with a "blur" that cannot be explained in words, there are no appropriate institutionalized words to express the blur. Therefore, existing words are used to express the new experience, and this is Eugene Gendlin's metaphorical creation of meaning.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to the "blur" when that "word" is used?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>If the words and the moyamoya are "compared" and they feel right, the moyamoya is expressed in words and disappears. On the other hand, if you still feel a sense of discomfort, compare the words with the fuzziness and dig deeper to find out what is the same and what is different, and the fuzziness will be broken down into smaller pieces.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is between the "word" and the "blur"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>(This is a tough question...)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Sometimes a probabilistic spontaneous occurrence can occur from a state of moyamoya, but it is inefficient to leave it to luck and wait for it to happen. In Mesopotamian mythology, fresh water flows in, and in the case of my sea and fish metaphor, casting a net, or in the current implementation of Keichobot, the software is trying to increase the probability of words being produced from the miasma by asking clean questions
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to the "word" during that "blur"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Words acquire new meanings.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen with regard to that "word"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It is not beneficial just to create new meanings for words or new meanings for words. It is like a child thinking of a cool special move name. It becomes profitable when the new combination of created words and meanings brings about an economic benefit to the thought
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to the "word" for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>In the case of a word that is understood only by an individual, the use of the word as a tool for thinking needs to cause an increase in the efficiency of thinking. In the case of words that are used by multiple people, the words need to cause a reduction in communication costs. (Of course, it is preferable if this indirectly improves the efficiency of the organization's thinking and the thinking of individual members of the organization.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Can you do that with regard to "the word"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>This is a challenge. Some words will be, some will not. It is not something that "does"; it is something that "becomes" some of the many that are created. At least through repeated calibration meetings with Mr. Tachikawa, the phenomenon of the actual creation of that kind of thought-economy-like words has become an observable fact.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What does that "word" look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>(Oh, I see, what is it like? This is a very important question. I can't think of an answer right away, but if I can answer this, I guess I'll be good to call it a day. My first thought was "this is exactly what the word is", but I don't feel like that says anything.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I thought, "It looks like a cog." The explanation as to why it is a cog has yet to emerge, but that will come later.
