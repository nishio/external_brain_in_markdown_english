Learn the art of conversation
cxlviii
Develop conversational skills.

That's where the real personality emerges. There is no act in life so commonplace, yet so demanding of attention. You either lose or gain by it. If writing a letter, which is nothing more than a well-meaning conversation, requires attention, ordinary conversation, in which one has the opportunity to exercise one's intellect promptly, would be even more so. The expert feels the pulse of the soul with his tongue. So said the wise man, "Speak, and I shall know thee. Some believe that conversation should not be artistic, nor flashy like clothing. This is appropriate for conversation between friends. But in conversation with those to whom we wish to show respect, we must be more dignified, as if responding to the dignity of the other person. It is appropriate to conform to the mind and tone of the other person. Nor should one be a critic of language. Otherwise you will be considered a pedant. And if you are a taker of ideas, people will avoid you, or at least sell their ideas at a premium. In conversation, discretion is more important than eloquence.
