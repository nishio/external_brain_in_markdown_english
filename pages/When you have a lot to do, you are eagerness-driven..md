- Relationship between "[[be made]], [[should do]], [[want to do]]" [[Will/Can/Must]] and the amount of "should do".
- I titled it "Inflation to do" with the intent of what would happen if the amount of "[[should do]]" were inflated.
    - Maybe the naming is too bad.
    - After three years, I changed it to "want-to-do-driven when there's so much to do".
- If you make it "the relationship between the amount of work that needs to be done and the amount of work one wants to do," it could be misinterpreted as something like "[[Thinking about adult developmental disabilities]]."

When what needs to be done is too narrow
- Do what you can
- It's easy to see what needs to be done but hasn't been done.
- Learn it and increase the range of "[[be made]]".

When there is a wide range of things to do
- I know I should do it, but not all of it.
- Hard to know which one to start with.
    - [[too many choices.]] and I'm in trouble -> [[demotivation]].

That's where "[[want to do]]" becomes important.
    - Increase [[motivation]] by making selections based on [intrinsic motivation
- The concept of making choices based on "I want to" among "I should" was discussed in the Motivation Creation Method.

- What people want to do is different for each person, so what they will be able to do is also different for each person.
- As an organization, it is preferable to have a variety of people because they can cover a wider range of "to do" #Diversity

- Driven by what you want to do, even when there is nothing in particular to do.
- In other words, it's more common that way, and only under limited circumstances is it driven by what needs to be done.
