- Two major trends that progressed in U.S. companies in the 1990s
    - Demingism: [[Continuous Improvement]] ([[kaizen]]) with [[statistical quality control]] and [[all-participation]].
    2. "Hammerism": "Re-engineering" (radical reengineering of operations around IT)
- Deming's relationship with Japan
    - W. Edwards Deming taught quality control to Japanese companies in the 1950s.
    - [He popularized Statistical Process Control ("SPC") and Total Quality Control ("TQC"), and became a spiritual pillar of the postwar "Japanese Quality Revolution.
    - Success in Japan (e.g., [[Toyota Method]]) was reimported to the U.S. in the 1980s, and U.S. companies also embarked on the "Quality Movement.
    - Deming emphasizes "total rather than partial optimization," and stresses cooperation and stability in terms of "lifetime employment" rather than individual competition.
    - Rejecting motivation through awards and performance evaluations, he explained that "[[the]] joy of work itself" is the source of quality improvement.
- Acceptance in the U.S. and conflict with the Hammer way
    - In the late 80s and early 90s, U.S. companies introduced the Deming style, but it was inconsistent with [[restructuring]] and stalled.
    - In its place, Hammer-style reengineering emerges, gaining support for its short-term results, top-down reforms, and use of IT.
    - Deming's style is bottom-up [[gradual improvement]], while Hammer's is top-down [[radical redesign]].
    - The article introduces the movement to seek a compromise between the two through the case of [[NYNEX]].
- suggestion
    - The key to governance in large companies is to combine "all-inclusive learning" and "IT-driven restructuring.
    - It is suggested that the culture of cooperative and human-centered improvement that Deming brought to Japan remains important in the information age.
