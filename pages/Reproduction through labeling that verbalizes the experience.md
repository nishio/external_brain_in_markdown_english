from [[U Theory and Tokoroten#5a5ca826aff09e0000ddc698]].
Reproduction through labeling that verbalizes the experience
> t> [[U-theory]] is a labeling that verbalizes one's [[personal experience]] for those who have experienced [crystallization
> n> Assuming that there is a prior "[[experience]]", encourage [[verbalizing]] of it, and make it consciously repeatable.
> t>  [[Reproduction by labeling]]
> n>  [[pattern language]]

I felt there was a strong connection to [[Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning]], which I am currently reading.
