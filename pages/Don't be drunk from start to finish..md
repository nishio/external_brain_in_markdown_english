> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1657791519427002368?s=20): To make a good [[drink]], you need to drink, but not to be [[drunk]] all the time. To create [[euphoria]], you need time to be [[sober]].

- The person who creates [[wild enthusiasm]] must not be a constant enthusiast himself.
