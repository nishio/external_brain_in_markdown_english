Those who claim to have a problem and do not act to solve it are those who benefit from claiming to have a problem

Some people come to people who are taking action to solve a problem and say, "It's not going to be solved anyway."

Nothing useful will come from that person to those who solve the problem, so just ignore it.
Attention is a finite resource and must be used for something useful.
