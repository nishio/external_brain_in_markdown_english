- Eth as a protocol for human coodination
- Programmable ...
    - Business
    - Government
    - Society
    - Listening to this, I'm thinking that being programmable means being clearly verbalized.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- By AI and Web3
    - transparency
    - accountability

        - I think you're right about Web3, but I'm not so sure about AI. I think there is some black boxing going on in the opposite direction...

    - Membership NFT
    - Not available for purchase
        - [[Tokens that money can't buy]]
            - [[Cash is weak capital]]
- [[Ph.D. is verified credential]]
    - No one wants to make money by selling the Ph.D. he earned at his university.
        - Indeed!<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - Because all I saw was people trying to make money selling [[NFT]], I had a strong assumption that it was something to sell.
            - Since the NFT is just a [[digital identifier]], it's open to what you want to do with it?
            - In fact, there is such a thing as a non-transferable [[SoulBound Token]], and [[Proof of Participation NFT]] is not for sale.

- > [@hal_sk](https://twitter.com/hal_sk/status/1646071121064886272?s=20): will leave archive!
    - > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1646072759238414336?s=20): #PluralityTokyo I'm happy to hear that we can see today‚Äôs discussion again in archives. I have handicap in real-time English understanding :p

> [@hal_sk](https://twitter.com/hal_sk/status/1646072350662885376?s=20): glad to see Scrapbox is getting a grueling update. It's nice to be able to keep up with it even if I lose track of context when I'm watching and listeningüëç.
> [https://t.co/BpeR04GCTI](https://t.co/BpeR04GCTI)
- > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1646073758237724672?s=20): #PluralityTokyo Slow non-real-time communication on Scrapbox should be great help for community of diverted language speaker
    - > [@ntszw](https://twitter.com/ntszw/status/1646074476449374209?s=20): @nishio It would also be great for online participants üëç

> [@extreme_stretch](https://twitter.com/extreme_stretch/status/1646081386284199936?s=20): attending #PluralityTokyo, after a long time [[Tadao Umesao]]. I want to read [[Tadao Umesao]] for the first time in a while. An Introduction to the Ecological History of Civilization].
- > [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1646085452011798528?s=20): And also I remembered Kawakita Jiro, as his goal ‚Äú [[gather the public's knowledge]] ‚Äù is collect intelligence from view from 360 degrees diverted viewpoints. It is definitely related to plurality. #PluralityTokyo

# Panel 2

> [nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1646082839820263424/photo/1) ‚Äú[[Small closed communities]]‚Äù enlightened me #PluralityTokyo
>  ![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FtgPgooaQAEgb0y?format=jpg&name=large#.png)
    - [[Small closed community]]
    - A number of articles I've written in the past and context connected.
            - [[Small Communities]]
            - [[Gates should be hidden.]]
    - I honestly didn't expect this place to connect!
- > [nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1646083161884086273) Btw l posted ‚Äú[[freedom of curiosity]]‚Äù
    - I couldn't write it in low-density English because of the word limit [[Freedom to pursue curiosity]].
        - Everyone is doing whatever they want based on their own curiosity.
        - Everyone's curiosity is different, so everyone will have different perspectives and knowledge
        - ‚Üî Reverse pattern
            - For example, "You can't get a good job unless you get into college, so let's all train ourselves to do what's in this textbook fast and without error."

> Plurality has the potential to implement oriental values
- > [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1646100843559788544?s=20): Referring the relationship between East Asian culture and plurality. Interesting viewpoints. I feel the Confucian worldview seems to reinforce hierarchical organizational structures, while the Buddhist worldview encourages pluralistic organization #PluralityTokyo

> [@mindlikeplants](https://twitter.com/mindlikeplants/status/1646093200971665409?s=20): I don't talk to almost anyone in real life, but, well, it's fun and it's possible I'm contributing somewhat. I think it's plurality.
- > [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1646095079021645824?s=20): Verbal communication is just a method in many communication methods. He said he didn‚Äôt talk much, however I think he did communication beyond time. Nice contribution, isn‚Äôt it? #PluralityTokyo

> [fpocket](https://twitter.com/fpocket/status/1645273974732099586/photo/1) In a panel discussion at #PluralityTokyo, a question about the difference between Plurality and Diversity Plurality and Diversity. Plurality has the structure that the world is one and shared, although the "way" of seeing the world is pluralistic.
>  ![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FtUvgt7aQAA7nFf?format=jpg&name=small#.png) ![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FtUviDracAEVJhR?format=jpg&name=small#.png)
> Shigeru Taguchi, Koyato Saigo, "Deepening Phenomenology through Sphere Theory", Gendai Shiso, July 2020, Special Issue = The World of Sphere Theory -- The Frontiers of Contemporary Mathematics
- > [fpocket](https://twitter.com/fpocket/status/1646085327956873222) Such a structure becomes a place for co-evolution of multiple intelligences and improves the resilience of people and society. On the other hand, I see Diversity as not focusing on such structures.
    - > [fpocket](https://twitter.com/fpocket/status/1646086267619397632) Plurality can be seen as a Networks as Processes (sphere-theoretic) paradigm and Diversity as a Networks as Things (set-theoretic) paradigm. Diversity is concerned with states, while Plurality is concerned with processes (process-centric).
        - >  ![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FLoMqMQacAQvqJw?format=jpg&name=medium#.png)
        - > We are developing and operating a business automation system using an Executable Business Process Network, and I think the importance of "network as a process" will increase.
- > [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1646093947985616896?s=20): He said, in Plurality viewpoint, even the views of the world are diverted, the world itself is single. I feel it related to the word in previous panel: the internet is single but it is decentralized. #PluralityTokyo

> [@mindlikeplants](https://twitter.com/mindlikeplants/status/1646087793142276096?s=20): #PluralityTokyo
> I am writing a messy but somewhat abstract interpretation of Plurality.
> I have a hypothesis that the discussion can be advanced by considering Plurality not as a [[fluffy]] "idea" but as a "vector" with a starting and ending point, direction, length, thickness, and resolution.
> [https://t.co/BQUA11FZ4e](https://t.co/BQUA11FZ4e)
- > [@mindlikeplants](https://twitter.com/mindlikeplants/status/1646088292046352384?s=20): The hypothesis suggests that viewing Plurality as a "vector" with distinct attributes, rather than a vague "idea," could lead to more productive discussions. #Plurality #VectorThinking
    - > [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1646093709342285826?s=20): I also feel that the plurality is vector, in the panel 1. I‚Äôll read the page after the event and think more! #PluralityTokyo

> [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1646109650276978689?s=20): Moving beyond code-is-law / Sound interesting but, because of my poor English skill I couldn't catch it. #PluralityTokyo

- [[How did the Named Enemy Association come about?]]

- > [mindlikeplants](https://twitter.com/mindlikeplants/status/1646129615164047360) I agree. Especially the top two.
- >  „ÉªPicture big ideals (maximize vector extension)
- >  „ÉªClarify definitions (increase vector resolution)

- >  I think this was a high priority action for a historical event, but I think it was too weak.

> [AkioHoshi](https://twitter.com/AkioHoshi/status/1646154275268050946) I was given 5 minutes to speak at today's Plurality Tokyo event.

- > [AkioHoshi](https://twitter.com/AkioHoshi/status/1646154942019690502) Plurality is the subject of a book by Taiwanese Minister of Digital Affairs Audrey Tan and economist Glenn Weil, parts of which are It is available to the public.
- >  In Audrey Tan's terms, "Digital connects people to people (not to machines)" and "Plurality is a mechanism that allows people with different opinions to collaborate.
- > [AkioHoshi](https://twitter.com/AkioHoshi/status/1646155490127237120) In my opinion, the strategy of commercial social networking sites to gain access to people's psychology is now dividing people and threatening democracy. Extreme opinions, disinformation, and hate speech are picked up and spread by algorithms, preventing deliberation.
- >  We believe that we need new digital sharing materials to make people's deliberations work.
- > [AkioHoshi](https://twitter.com/AkioHoshi/status/1646155833275809792) Audrey Tan introduces [http://pol.is„Å®„ÅÑ„ÅÜÊÑèË¶ãÈõÜÁ¥Ñ](http://pol.is„Å®„ÅÑ„ÅÜÊÑèË¶ãÈõÜÁ¥Ñ) & visualization platform. It is a mechanism to visualize similar and different opinions instead of dividing people.
- >  This [http://pol.is](http://pol.is) was also used at this year's Plurality Tokyo Unconference.
- > [AkioHoshi](https://twitter.com/AkioHoshi/status/1646156357052104704) Plurality is an effort to make democracy work again by making multiple opinions visible and deliberation through the power of digital. The piece of the puzzle is digital mechanisms such as [http://pol.is,](http://pol.is,) Quadratic vote, DID and SBT.
- > [AkioHoshi](https://twitter.com/AkioHoshi/status/1646157008633044992) Digital technology is now being used primarily to subvert democracy (i.e. mass commercial social networking).
- >  But technology is value neutral. Digital could be used to make democracy work again.
- >  There should be a digital way to restore people's dignity and freedom.
- > [AkioHoshi](https://twitter.com/AkioHoshi/status/1646168580931690496) Aside:
- >  Today was actually an "Ethereum & web3 neighborhood event", but looking back, none of my LTs were blockchain-related: ......
- >  Reason for retrofit:
- >  I think that's because the time to speak is short, and also because digital democracy is an ongoing issue that needs to be addressed regardless of the success/failure of ethereum and blockchain.
