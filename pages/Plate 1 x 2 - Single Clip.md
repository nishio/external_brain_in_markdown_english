The half size one is [[Tile 1 x 1 - Clip]]. it took me a while to find it in brickers because this part is in the plate genre and the half one is in the tile genre. I guess they are treated as tiles because they don't have studs on them.

- [[Plate 1 x 2]]  -  [[single clip]]
- [[Plate 1 x 2 Clips]]
