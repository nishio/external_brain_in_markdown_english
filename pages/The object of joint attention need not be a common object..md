title: "The object of joint attention need not be a common object."
---

- The object of [[joint warning]] need not be a general object (such as a sequence of natural language written by a human to communicate information to a human).
- Just like infants don't eat the same food as adults.
- Start with limited vision and hearing as well.

- The [[Listening Chat System]] is already a system of joint attention to "the string written in the chat just before".
- Referring to a past statement when making a [[reference]] is also a mechanism for creating joint attention.
