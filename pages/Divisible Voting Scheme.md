<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This document is an academic paper on [[divisible voting scheme]]. Its main contents are as follows:.
- Definition of a divisible voting system: 1.
    - Each voter has more than one vote and the number may vary from voter to voter
    - Multiple candidates.
    - Voters can split their votes and vote for more than one candidate.
2. requirements for a secure divisible voting scheme: 1.
    - Accurate tabulation results must be obtained.
    - Voters cannot vote for more than they have.
    - No disclosure of individual voting details.
3. propose a simple divisible voting scheme based on existing electronic voting schemes and point out its inefficiencies
- Proposal of two new divisible voting schemes that are more efficient: 1.
    - Schemes using divisible multiple sets
    - Scheme using L-decimal representation
- Theoretical and experimental evaluation of the efficiency of the proposed method
6. proof of safety

The paper proposes a new type of electronic voting system that allows voters with multiple votes to split their votes and shows how it can be efficiently implemented.

I had presented at the peer-reviewed international conference ISC in 2003 that [[Quadratic Voting]] can be considered as a tool, but without such weighting, each person can [[split vote]] on multiple options with different multiple votes.

> [Shane Matsuo](https://x.com/ShaneMatsuo/status/1816317086177882280) Remembering this paper I published at ISC in 2003, I would like to think about the conditions that make it work and those that don't, since there is no universal system in the world. I would like to think about the conditions under which it works and those under which it does not.

There are multiple ideas within one person. If a person can only cast one vote for one candidate, he or she is ignoring the minority within himself or herself."
