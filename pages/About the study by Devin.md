About the study by Devin
- We like to keep our experiments as simple as possible.
- So it's not a good idea to mix multiple stories in monorepo
    - Don't tie it to a repository, just give them the information they need and let them implement it.
    - Push the result to a new repo (it's too much trouble to receive it in patch because there is both data and code).
        - Isn't this enough? it turned out to be
- In other words, a REPO is created for each experiment.
    - Even experiments that are not useful should be recorded.
    - We don't want experiments that aren't useful mixed in with the next one.
- Write details in README
    - Have Devin write the README itself, but have a human fix it.

When I think about it, it doesn't feel right to do monorepo in broadlistening-research or to put it in kouchou-ai.
