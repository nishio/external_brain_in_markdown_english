title: "Expert advice and layman's opinion"
---

There is value in the advice of the expert and the amateur, and conversely, there is no value in the expert's opinion and the amateur's advice.
    - [[amateur]]'s [[advice]] is [[retailing]] someone else's opinion.
    - Not gone through [[verification]] to actually do it myself
    - [[impressions]] of [[professionals]] are often at odds with "the impressions of [[the majority]]".
    - The majority of the world is amateur.

> What you should really listen to are "[[Professional Advice]]" and "[[Impressions of a layman]]," and what you should not listen to the most are "[[Professional Impressions]]" and "[[Layman's Advice]]. So, you don't have to follow deeply even if a person who is familiar with the industry says "Wow," and you don't have to listen to a person who says "This is what you should do" about something he/she has not experienced.
- [In advice and feedback, the difference between what you should really listen to and what you shouldn't listen to is very familiar "I feel it in my body" - Togetter](https://togetter.com/li/1276935)

relevance
    - [[Knowledge must be validated by practice]]
    - [[Facts and Interpretations]]
    - [[Experts are a minority]]
        - [[No one is equal to the market.]] because [[Don't assume that an expert's opinion is the opinion of the market.]]
