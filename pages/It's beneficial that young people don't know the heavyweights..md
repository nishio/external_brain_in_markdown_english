- [[metabolism]]

The size of what we have created in the past is not the size of what we will create in the future.
- There's a correlation, though.

At the end of life, both [[remaining life expectancy]] and physical strength decrease rapidly, so [[future value]] declines quite rapidly.
- But [[Social Evaluation]] doesn't follow suit.
- This is where a detrimental gap is created.

- The fact that [[young man]] does not know about the elderly called "[[authority]]" is favorable because it means that he is not affected by the harmful gap
- Since many people rate it higher than the appropriate level, it can barely be balanced by those who rate it lower than the appropriate level.
- Hitting only those who rate lower than the appropriate level is not good because it widens the gap.
