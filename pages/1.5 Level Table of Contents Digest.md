title: "1.5 Level Table of Contents Digest"
---

- In placing the table of contents of [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]] in [[Scrapbox]], we want to [[linking]] keywords to make effective use of Scrapbox's features.
However, putting the entire table of contents on one page would have 307 lines, so the links would be cluttered.
Then I thought of dividing it into chapters, but the table of contents for one chapter alone has 70 lines. I want to make it more detailed.
That's when I realized that it's the "[[top down]]" division that I'm thinking about, whether to divide by chapter or by section.
I think we discussed in chapter 5 that it is important to attach them with [[bottom-up]], not [[bottom-up]].
Therefore, I looked at the end headings, attached them, terminated them when they were not too long, and made a new [[making a table nameplate]] without being bound by the "current headings" (i.e., [[Framework created in the past]]). This is very much like the [[KJ method]].
