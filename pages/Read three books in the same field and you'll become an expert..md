title: "Read three books in the same field and you'll become an expert."
---

- There is a well-known idea that something like "you can become a [[specialist]] by reading three books in the same field," but I'm wondering what the origin is and if there are any sources that could be cited or mentioned.
    - [[kur]] Triangulation? It's a social science field, but I suspect [http://www.cscd.osaka-u.ac.jp/user/rosaldo/16_triangulation_Social_SCience.html](http://www.cscd.osaka-u.ac.jp/user/rosaldo/16_triangulation_Social_SCience.html) is the original source [[kur]].
        - > In the social sciences, [[triangulation]] was proposed by Norman K. Denzin in his 1978 book, and was conceived as a way to increase the validity of [[qualitative studies]] by pluralizing methodologies and methods of validation (i.e., by assuming more than three dimensions that are neither unitary nor dualistic, and calling it "triangulation") (Denzin 1970, 1978, 1989). Denzin 1970, 1978, 1989) to increase the validity of [[qualitative studies]].
        - >  Denzin proposes at least four basic visualizations of triangulation: 1) triangulation of the data itself, 2) triangulation of the researcher, 3) triangulation of the theories used in the analysis, and 4) methodological triangulation. These are: 1) triangulation of the data itself, 2) triangulation of the researcher, 3) triangulation of the theory used in the analysis, and 4) triangulation of the methodology.
        - Reading three different books is an action similar to (1), which diversifies the input information sources with respect to the act of "reading and studying".
