title: "Mechanisms for discussing with a large number of people"

A system for [[discussion]] with [many people
- [/blu3mo-public/ a mechanism to discuss with many people](https://scrapbox.io/blu3mo-public/ a mechanism to discuss with many people).
- The nuance of "with many" instead of "with many" is interesting.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - It is [[Anthropomorphism, which takes a set of people as a person, to argue "with many people" because "many people" is a set of people, not a person]].
    - An important key may lie in this anthropomorphism.
            - [[Cultivating intersubjectivity]]

- In order to create a need, the significance of participation must be clarified.
    - Emphasize the value of "your voice reaching society," for example, in the policy formation process and in functioning as a new consensus-building platform.
- Detecting loops could make barren discussion areas visible and direct discussion participants to another constructive node.
    - Oh well<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - When I detected the loop, I thought I was going to get rid of it.
        - Simply detecting a loop and having the AI point out, "This is [[a round-about discussion]]," creates an incentive for participants to leave it.
- By analyzing "points at which opinions tend to converge and diverge" and "frequently appearing key terms," it becomes easier to understand the landscape of the entire discussion.
    - It would be easier to understand the flow of the discussion if we could just visualize the key terms that appear frequently.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Overall, we feel that the approach of structuring, visualizing, and reusing text-based discussion data is interesting and has the potential to develop into a useful "huge discussion archive" or "map of social knowledge" depending on appropriate guidance (user experience design).
