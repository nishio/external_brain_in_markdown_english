[Electric Sea Moon Incident](https://jellyfish-movie.jp/)
> All locations were filmed in Fukuoka, which is attracting attention as an IT and start-up city.
>  The cast and crew from Kyushu will present the ongoing Fukuoka.
>  All of this work has undergone full-scale technical supervision by active IT engineers, programmers, and others.
>  We also conducted our own interviews with hackers to get a closer look at their ecosystem and their thought processes.
>  What tools do they use to hack, why do they become black hackers, and in fact, can [[white hackers]] become the new hero image of our time?
>  Real Fukuoka and real hackers appear here now.


Producer: [[Satoru Kondo]].
