title: "Is it right to think without implementation?"
---

- Is it [[right]] to [[consider]] without [[mounting]] or [[right]] to [[consider]] without [[mounting]]?
→Separate "[[Create a prototype]]" from "[[Incorporate into product functionality]]".

Last Wednesday and Thursday were the first time in a long time that I was in a position to get some time together.
- But as a result, it was never implemented.
- There was a realization that the language was not clearly articulated to a workable level as to what should be implemented.
- Time spent thinking about it.
- I'm pondering if this was the right thing to do.
- You think you've done the "thinking," but is that true?
    - [I think that "thinking" without a clear concrete next action is just "pretending to think".
- On the other hand, if you implement the task in front of you without thinking about what really needs to be created, you'll end up "[[efficiently doing the task will efficiently create a shitty app]]".
    - Here it is: [[Efficiently handling tasks would implement a fast fucking application.]]
    - It's hard to find the balance between thinking and acting, and I'm always struggling with that.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/sta/icon' alt='/villagepump/sta.icon' height="19.5"/>
There is a large amount of information that is BETTER to input, and if you input it, your life is over just by inputting it.

I don't know
- If you don't know, then it's of equal value to you, so you can decide by feel and dice.
- But since I am having trouble trusting my own feeling...
- Why don't we just give AI Quarrier a "decide-your-own-decision mode"? (Mysterious conclusion)

liquidation
- It's hard to find a balance between "information gathering," "thinking," and "action/experimentation."
- When a person's subjective feelings are skewed one way or the other, it's a good idea to do it.
- But as they become more balanced, they start saying, "Is it OK to do this?" while doing any of them, or they stop and say, "Which one should I do?" This is not good!
- An AI trying to be neutral would say "each has its own merits" or "humans should make decisions".
    - Instead, Mr. Qualia should impose his subjective value that it is important to advance the civilization of homo sapiens.
    - There is only decision-making in business development.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>

succession
- Thinking" cannot move to the "action/experiment" phase unless it reaches the "next action decision.
    - The idea is that each phase is a transition, and that if you don't push forward to the point where you can get to the next phase, you've "hit your stride" and can't move on.
    - There is a pattern where this next action becomes "gathering information about ~".
- The "Action/Experiment" phase is
    - If you find any information that needs to be collected
    - If you find something you need to think about
- The information gathering phase may be the most difficult.
    - Aimless information gathering tends to be reinforced by the fact that you can find something useful in the mess, but I think it's basically sterile.
    - Swamped by information gathering with no clear end in sight.
    - Should I limit my time or create an output?

    - > I think it's good to make [[prototypes]] because you never know what you're going to get unless you try.
    - She wrote good stuff.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Separate "prototyping" from "incorporating into product features," [[resolution increased]].
