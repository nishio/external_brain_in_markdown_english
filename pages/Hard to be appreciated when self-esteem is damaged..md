Hard to be appreciated when self-esteem is damaged.
> [@Akira_Akagawa](https://twitter.com/Akira_Akagawa/status/1665883487394746371?s=20): they say layoffs can hurt any person.
> If you are looking for a new job at a time when your self-esteem is damaged, that unfulfilled feeling may come across in interviews and make it difficult to be evaluated, so if you are having a hard time, start by talking to someone you trust who has no vested interest in you to help you recover.

> [@tzkb](https://twitter.com/tzkb/status/1665899493857038336?s=20): this is really true. Even I, who am usually brazen, was quite sick immediately afterwards, and my family tends to fall in the dark because it is hard for them to understand the situation.
> I also got some advice early on in the DM process, "Don't go into the interview looking unsure!" I got a lot of advice to get back on my feet. Looking backwards won't help you. Let's look forward.
