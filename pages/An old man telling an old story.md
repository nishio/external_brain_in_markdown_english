Talking about the past is not in itself harmful.
- It is often useful to bring up strongly related past story B in response to current topic A
- The problem is that they come up with a weak related C
    - The old man has not observed A closely enough recently to recognize that A and C are far apart due to the low resolution of the horizontal axis.
            - [See figure under Cognitive Resolution.
    - He has a low cognitive resolution, so he can't recognize that he's saying the wrong thing C.
        - He thinks he's doing B.
        - People with high cognitive resolution neglect it because they feel that "C is a story that has nothing to do with A".
        - The old man is angry at this, saying that "B is beneficial, but he doesn't understand it and neglects it.
            - He's angry that "old things have value, but young people don't understand that."
        - This is the problem with the old man not being able to distinguish between B and C.


Other problems are also likely to occur
- Saying the same thing over and over again
- Assume you don't know something the listener already knows and explain it.
This is not unique to the elderly, although it tends to occur in the elderly.
- People who don't feel their words have been received repeat the same thing.
    - People who keep insisting on the same thing at meetings.
    - [[The person is being ignored because he/she is saying something misguided on the subject]], but he/she does not feel that his/her statement has been accepted, so he/she makes the same statement repeatedly.
    - The hand used to deal with the situation is to take it once and write "let's discuss it later" on the whiteboard #ParkingLot
- Assume ignorance and give explanations to women [[mansplaining]].

- [[reminiscence]] to [[old person]].
    - [[problems caused by the elderly (esp. gerontocracy, and elderly people's control over the young)]]

- [[Thinking like something similar in the past]]
