I've got three events over Saturday and Sunday, and I was thinking of writing in the gap, but that's not normal.
- 2:00 Sleepy
- There's another event tomorrow from noon to night, so take a quick bath and go to bed.
- 4:00 Go to bed.



> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1957105841737445743) I'm home on the last train after about 11 hours of continuous operation even though it's my day off, I'd like to summarize my notes but I'm sleepy.
