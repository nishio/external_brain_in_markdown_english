I'm sure there are times when you see a post on Facebook or something like that and you come up with a boring old man gag, or you have a feeling that you just don't enjoy making that assertion, but you have to be prepared to react immediately because it's an emotion and you have to be able to say that it's happening. The first thing to do is to listen and objectively observe that an objection to the power to plan has occurred.
