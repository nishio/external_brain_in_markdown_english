- [[Teaching AI the KJ Method]]
- [[How AI summarizes]]
    - Is the choice of summary method arbitrary?
        - Of course it is.
            - [[What's wrong with being arbitrary?]]
- I think it would be good to put [[Jiro Kawakita]]'s thoughts on this area of discussion.
    - When the summary process discards things that don't fit into the existing framework, it becomes a reproduction of the framework.
        - It's important to respect the [[detached monkey]].
    - If you have traceability to where the fragments came from, it doesn't matter if you add something new because it is identifiable that it is a creation that is not based on input data.
        - In fact, if you try to put it all together without adding anything new, it won't be any good.
        - There is no such thing as an objective arrangement.
