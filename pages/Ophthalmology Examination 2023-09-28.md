[My astigmatism is so bad that it's hard to see.
    - The two or three [[landolt rings]] appear to overlap...

I see 1.2 with glasses.
- A little harder to see compared to checking with the lens in.

I think my subjective vision without glasses has deteriorated.
- But as a real measurement, the right eye went up from 0.5 to 0.8.
- Left eye remains at 0.5

- [[glaucoma]] Tests are on the edge of the line and will continue to require further observation.
