<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I think tokoroten discussed a lot of things under the keywords "big book management", lightly summarized.
- PS: The Tweet that triggered this was here: [[anxiety-resistant#5b70ee32aff09e0000cef354]].
    - The expression was "[[official announcement by the shogunate (or a daimyo, etc.) that the government will step down from its post to the Emperor]] to manage.

The following is a very brief summary of the essence of "Daihon Management" (= [[Daihon Houei Management]]) as advocated by Mr. tokoroten.

Keyword Summary
- It refers to a style of internal governance in which the upper echelons of the government continue to transmit only the "winning" economic information rather than the actual situation, such as "[[official announcement by the shogunate (or a daimyo, etc.) that the government will step down from its post to the Emperor]]" during World War II. This refers to a style of internal governance in which the upper management keeps sending out only the "winning" and economical information rather than the actual situation.
    - [something nice like DX or DevOps or something Fujitsu TechLive | PPT](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/dxdevopstechlive/229735702?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- basic structure
    - The HQ (headquarters) subdivides abstract issues and distributes numerical targets to each department. The field follows the numbers, and HQ maintains morale with positive announcements throughout.
    - [The "big headlines" and "big announcements" for governing "ordinary people who are frightened by anxiety"](https://zenn.dev/shin_semiya/articles/d22d1c6f76f4d6)
    - relevance
            - [[Incorrect KPI setting]] (but the person setting it intended to do so)
            - [[Vanity Indicators]]

Why do we fall into it?
1. an organization with many people with low anxiety tolerance
    - When the majority of employees are vulnerable to anxiety, it is easier in the short term to give them "reassurance" than to share the reality with them in a casual manner.
- (2) "Making ordinary people work harder" in the phase of rapid increase in the number of employees
    - Observation that when the size of the group exceeds 40 to 100 people, it becomes difficult to have discussions at a high level of abstraction and "big headlines" become necessary.
3. promotion to higher positions and lack of management experience
    - When people without managerial skills are at the top, they tend to make "we're winning" type appeals.

Benefits (Factors contributing to the occurrence)
- Easy to evaluate
    - You can judge how good or bad an individual or team is by simply dropping in a numerical target.
- Easier to recruit ordinary people.
    - Easily broken down into less abstract tasks for immediate results
- Easier decision making at HQ
    - Reduced load because it can be turned by simply issuing simple commands

Disadvantages and bankruptcy patterns
- Disconnection from and concealment of reality
    - It makes it harder to report problems and failures, and [[organizational learning]] comes to a halt.
- Outflow of broad-minded personnel
    - Positive one-sidedness is rather negative for "[[broad-minded people]]" and leads to turnover.
- Final collapse
    - The moment success stories collide with reality, trust and morale simultaneously crumble. tokoroten himself mentioned, "I'm going to write an article on why organizations collapse.

To prevent
- Encourage transparent sharing, including negative information, and design psychological safety that allows people to talk about their failures.
- Clearly define anxiety tolerance and negative capability as human resource requirements and cultivate them as part of the organizational culture.
- Practice a "scout mindset" where HQ updates hypotheses based on field data.

> *one-line summary**
>  tokoroten's "Daihonchou Management" is a quick-fix model to move "the majority with low tolerance for anxiety" by managing numbers and announcing regular victories, but if the organization loses its ability to face reality, the entire organization will fail. But if you lose face to face reality, the entire organization will fail.
