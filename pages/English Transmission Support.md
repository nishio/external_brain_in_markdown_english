    - I think it would be better to send out the message in [[English (language)]], but it's hard to start because it's a task with no deadline.

If you looks something interesting but the auto-translated English is not good enough to understand it, feel free to let me know at [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en). I'm very happy to spread my thought to non-Japanese readers.
