- Similar to [[TextRank]] and [[PositionRank]], [[keyphrase extraction]] is a mechanism for unsupervised [[keyphrase extraction]] from sentences.
    - The key is the use of [[embedded vector]].
        - [[Keyword character representative of this document.]] by vector similarity.
    - [[doc2vec]]

Interesting concept of MMR.
- [[Maximal Marginal Relevance]]
