title: "Understanding is thinking within a mold."

[[Phenomenology as non-logical steps]]
- > When we precisely understand its formed intricacy, that is just when we exceed its forms. When we don't understand a book, we can only quote it. To understand it is to [[dwell-think]] in its forms, and that is more precise than the forms.
- > (DeepL)If you cannot understand a book, you have to quote it. To understand it is to think within its form, which is more precise than the form.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Translation: We need not surrender to "what is already structured. When we understand a complex structure accurately, that is the moment to go beyond that structure. When we read a book and do not understand it, we can only quote it. To understand a book is to dwell-think within its structure, which is a more accurate understanding than the written structure.

- [[When you don't understand a book, all you can do is quote it.]]
[[I can only quote what I don't understand]].

from  [[Phenomenology as an illogical stage]]  in  [[Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning]]
- > When we understand exactly the complexity that has been formed, when it transcends its form
    - >  [[When you don't understand it, all you can do is quote it.]]
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>That's me right now.
    - > To understand is to be "in" the form "[[Housing - Thoughts]]".
        - > This is a more accurate understanding than "keeping" the formality.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> [[Shuhari]] I associate it with
            - When you don't understand [[type (e.g. of machine, goods, etc.)]] you can only defend [type (e.g. of machine, goods, etc.)
            - When understood accurately, the mold is broken.
            - The machine translation translated "form" as "shape" but changed it to "type.
        - Understood: [[Dwelling" and the Kozane Law]].
            - Do you really understand?
                - How do we know if we "got it exactly right?"

    - [In "Dwelling" and the Kozane Law
    - > "By creating a pseudo "symbolic space for the other party" through the placement of sticky notes, we can "live" by working within that space.
- To verify if this "understanding = hypothesis" is correct, we put it into practice and observed the results.
    - Specifically, I worked to transform Heidegger's "[[Building, Living, Thinking]]" into a space without distorting its symbols.
            - [[Kozaneba:dwell-think]]
    - The conclusion, in a word, is half right, half wrong with my representation.
        - The meaning of the word "live" was much more abstract than initially imagined.
    - This would be more interesting if it were firmly verbalized instead of just one word.

- Firmly verbalized: [[Building, Living, Thinking]].
