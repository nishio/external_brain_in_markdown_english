<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>I will explain "capitalism without capital" in more detail based on the viewpoint of Gyoto Karatani:

Definition of the concept:.
- Capitalism without capital" refers to a new form of capitalism that creates significant value with little or no traditional physical capital (factories, equipment, etc.).
- The rise of the [[IT platform company]]:.
    - As a prime example of this concept, Emaya cites the rise of IT platform companies. For example, Uber, Airbnb, and Amazon have created enormous value without many physical assets.
- Materiality of intangible assets:.
    - In this new form of capitalism, [[intangibles]] such as data, algorithms, brands, patent rights, and R&D play a central role.
    - New form of [[differentiation]].
    - Capitalism Without Capital" represents a new form of differentiation. Differences in information and data have become the primary source of value creation.
- Differences from traditional capitalism:.
    - Whereas traditional industrial capitalism was based on ownership of the physical means of production, this new form is based on control of information and networks.
- Globalization and related topics:.
    - This form of capitalism is made possible by digital technology and globalization. The immediate distribution of information across borders is its foundation.
- Transformation of Labor: The
    - In "capitalism without capital," forms of labor also change. It is characterized by an increase in freelance and gig workers and the spread of remote work.
- Issues and Criticisms:.
    - This form of capitalism is causing new problems related to wealth concentration, data privacy, workers' rights, etc.
- Future Impact:.
    - Emiya believes that this "capitalism without capital" suggests a new phase of capitalism. However, he points out that it does not solve the problems of traditional capitalism, but may create new forms of contradictions and challenges.
- Relation to the exchange style:.
    - In the context of Karatani's exchange style theory, this "capitalism without capital" can be understood as a new developmental form of exchange style C. At the same time, however, it may also suggest the possibility of a transition to Mode of Exchange D.

This concept of "capitalism without capital" provides an important perspective for understanding the transformation of the modern economic system and is an important issue for the future development of capitalism.
