> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1561619927215517696): Yesterday and the day before yesterday I was at Kinki University for the midterm camp of Unexplored Junior. The eSports facility was amazing, but I couldn't get a good picture of it because they were in the middle of an event.

I have a feeling that this university is amazing. I feel that they are making things like "you don't have to go to the university to take liberal arts classes because you can learn on demand" a reality.

I've heard that the mobile version of Scrapbox is very good, better than using Porter, so I'm trying to use it from my iPhone in my browser (Safari)
- I don't know how to do Ctrl+T.
- The page menu has been hidden for a while now, and I thought it was because I was using Porter even though mobile support has progressed, but it usually happens in native browsers as well.
    - I think I've removed the suspicious looking UserCSS, but I need to sit down and investigate again!
    - This hidden menu, how it is hidden, has a hit point (a page that was not intended to be duplicated has been duplicated).
        - I'm afraid of inadvertently doing something strange, so when the page menu appears, carefully tap the area where the menu seems to be and close it.
