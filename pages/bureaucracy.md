> Weber pointed out the rational function of the modern bureaucracy and argued that the bureaucracy has technical excellence like a good machine. However, he also foresaw the negative aspects of modern bureaucracy, such as the possibility of suppression of individual freedom due to the permeation of bureaucratic control, and the difficulty of control due to the enormous size of the bureaucratic organization.
