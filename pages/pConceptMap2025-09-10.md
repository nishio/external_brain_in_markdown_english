I can't see the graph when I look at it on my phone, but I dare you to use it.
- Nothing can be done if the initial selection has not been made.
    - There should be a list of concepts below.

- I want to link across chapters and graph and link related articles.
    - Simply arranging them is not good enough.
    - Connecting them to a single graph looks intense but doesn't make much sense.
    - Create a view that convex hulls and arranges by document, such as chapters, or

Tend to make small improvements when implemented by AI.
- In terms of the above, we can "add a list of concepts" right now.

There are two types of placement: placement by embedding and placement by physical calculation using the relationship as a springboard.
- There is, of course, manual placement.

Organize objectives
- The "create a conceptual map for a book" should be done once as an experiment.
    - I've always thought it's simply not worth the user value of visualization.
    - It doesn't matter if people see it or not.
    - We should try to prototype a system where the AI reads it and answers questions.
        - Whether it is offered as a service to the general public is another story.
- Apart from that, I'm also interested in a system that weaves things that don't come together as a single book into this network, in the context of intellectual production.
    - A specific example is the group of articles related to Plurality in the Cybozu formula

What to do with the view of a concept map for one book is a matter of views

Consolidation and miscellaneous visualization
- Not for the user to see, but for me to observe and gain insight.

Read that whole graph again, loaded with context, to add new vertices.
    - [[rereading]]
- This is also the system that "weaves together in this network what is not in one book.
    - Load the knowledge graph up to that point in context and then read the new text to acquire the concepts.
        - [[parable of the net]]

I need a permalink for the concept.
- Display concepts from other chapters on a graph; clicking on a concept switches to the view of that chapter and makes that concept selected.

- [[You want to create a function?]]

for next:
- Permanent link to concept
    - Now if there are the same keywords in different chapters, the IDs will clash.
    - Insert section prefix
- Create consolidated graph data for one book
- Observe the big picture
- Create page-to-page links
