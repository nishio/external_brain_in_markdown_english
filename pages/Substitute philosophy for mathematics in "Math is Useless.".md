title: 'Substitute philosophy for mathematics in "Math is Useless."'
---

Many disagree with the assertion that "learning math is useless."
- Rebuttal Patterns
    - People who think it's "useless" just don't understand math.
    - Math is useful for solving familiar problems, but people unfamiliar with math are not able to apply math to problems

Substitute "philosophy" for "mathematics" in this composition.
- People who think philosophy is useless simply don't understand it and can't apply it to familiar problems.

I believe the second half is of course True too. Philosophy is probably more useful than mathematics because of its wider applicability.

- [[Is philosophy useful?]]
- [[Philosophy as a practical science]]
