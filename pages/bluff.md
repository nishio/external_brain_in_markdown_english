title: "bluff"
---

It's obvious to [[those who try it for themselves]], but [[the world is]] full of bluffs.
- People who don't try it for themselves [[take the bluff]] and [[Resources]] move on.
- So [[one must see with one's own eyes]].

The world is a complicated place, and some people don't understand it when I describe it honestly.
- Show a simple, beautiful lie and some people will gladly choose it.
    - I had a feeling this wasn't a bluff.
    - But the same is true for the fact that the deviation from the accurate description makes it more useful than the accurate description.

Do you really think that system will work? Have you tried it yourself?
- Aren't you trying to sell someone else a system that you tried yourself and didn't work, lying to them as if it would work?
