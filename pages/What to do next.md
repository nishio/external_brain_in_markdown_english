    - [[grouping]].
    - This was done:
        - Operation to record the relative positions now and convert multiple slides into a single mass.
            - Bundle.
            - The one closest to the pointer is the temporary nameplate.
                - A nameplate should be able to be added.
                    - Essentially, slides need to be able to be added.
        - Must be able to move from one place to another in clumps
    - Later "open" operations need to be restored to their original positional relationship.
        - Relative positions should be recorded at the start of group selection
            - Do you want to add fields to Slide?
            - →I did it.
    - There are likely to be cases where multiple selections are removed at some point during multiple selections, other than the trigger Up.
        - →When multiple slides are selected, hovering over a slide that is not selected causes a single highlight to run and multiple selections to be canceled.
        - Correction Done

- Done Physics should stop before the zone where the physics stops when you go far away from it.
- In some cases, highlights are blue when hovering Done


- Distributed as alpha version
        - [[distribution]]

    - Use [[Status display on controller]] to display FPS?
    - Check the speed on the actual device with [[Remote Monitor]].


- Fixed a problem with buttons being white all the time once pressed
    - Should I just fade at *0.99 or something?
    - The buttons are monolithic to begin with, but they are not very appropriate because they are more often placed in the downward direction of the field of view (because you have to look at them from an angle).
    - It would be better if it were spherical and the label faced the camera direction.

- Camera rotation with keyboard, left/right and then up/down is wrong.

- Can a single-slide move also be encompassed as a pattern of only one copy of a multi-slide move?
    - Inconvenient to move slides closer or further away?
