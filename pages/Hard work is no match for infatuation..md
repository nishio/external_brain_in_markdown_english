> [miyasaka](https://x.com/miyasaka/status/1834556582253990339) You can't beat someone who is doing it for their own money. Hard work can't beat infatuation. People who are spending their money and time are strong.
- [[You can't beat someone who's doing it with their own money.]]
        - [[use one's own money]]
        - [[Ignore those who haven't cut themselves.]]
    - [[effort]] is no match for [[crazy]].
- People who are cutting [[their own money and time]] are strong.
    - [[People who are willing to pay their own way are strong.]]

- [[He who strives cannot win who enjoys it.]]
    - [[who enjoys]].
            - [[enjoy (oneself)]]
