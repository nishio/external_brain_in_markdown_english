The [[digital public]] of 2030 has [[audio input channel]].

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1957134385465172341) I've noticed that when people talk about how to design digital democracy in 2030, many people implicitly imagine smartphones. I'm thinking that in 2026, local LLMs will be fluent in Japanese, so in 2030, window affiliation services will be voice-enabled.

Even Shinkansen tickets are not all at the counter, but [[automatic ticket vending machines]] and [[online purchase]] are available. Self-service cash registers are becoming more common in convenience stores. All of these digital tellers will speak fluently.
