- > This market will resolve to "Yes" if the results of the paper titled "The First Room-Temperature Ambient-Pressure Superconductor" ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12008)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12008)) regarding LK99 are replicated at least two times by independent researchers unaffiliated with the authors of this paper by December 31, 2023, 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to "No".
