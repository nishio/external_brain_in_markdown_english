title: "No arguments worth making."
---

Discussions among people who share a common goal of understanding the world are beneficial for "understanding" because they can bring information from different perspectives and verify each other's interpretations.

There are types of people in the world for whom their own interpretation of the world is more important than understanding the world.

We can distinguish them by their reactions when they encounter "observed facts that contradict their interpretation."

There's not much to be gained for the effort of arguing with the latter.
