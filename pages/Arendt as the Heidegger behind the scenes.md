- A passionate love affair between teacher and student (1924-28) became the "original experience" of Arendt's thinking.
- They continued to exchange correspondence after the war, and Arendt behaved to a certain extent as a "defender" of Heidegger's Nazi past.

2. the core of Heidegger's philosophy
_
| Concept Overview |
| -- |
| Dasein (present presence) Ourself cast as "world - within - being". |
| Subjectivity The condition of not being able to choose the circumstances of one's birth and fall. |
| Pioneer to Death Seek in death the basis for the "decision" to recover one's essential self. |
| The World-In-Presence Worldliness Our relationships with others are often buried in an anonymous "worldliness. |
(Source: "Heidegger" entry in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)


Arendt's shift from "ontology" to "political theory
_
| Heidegger → Arendt Replace/reverse Representative work |
| -- |
| Subjectivity → Birth (Natality): the ability to give birth to a beginning The Human Condition (1958) |
| Forerunner to Death → Initiation into Action: Practical Freedom to Open the Future Ibid. |
| Buried in the world → Plurality: affirmation of coexistence with others Ibid. |
| The Internal Decision of Presence → Speech and Action in Public Space On Revolution (1963) |

point
- The analysis of "world-inside-existence" was pushed outward, and the question "with whom do we share the world?
- "Authenticity" is not confined to the inner life of the individual, but is re-measured in terms of the visibility of public acts.

Significance of reading as "Heidegger behind the scenes
- Reuse of conceptual frames
    - Sorge (care) → to political ethics as a responsible act.
- critical succession
    - Where Heidegger closed the time line with "death," Arendt opened it with "birth.
- A Rift in the Nazism Experience
    - Arendt, who saw his mentor's political blunders, analyzed [The banal evils of "thoughtlessness."

summary
Reading Arendt as "Heidegger behind the scenes."
- I see a circuit from ontology to political theory,
- The shift in perspective from internal self-determination to public interaction becomes easier to understand,
- By understanding the Heideggerian depths, we can grasp in three dimensions why Arendt's pluralistic and emergent view of politics was born.

By being aware of this "other side," Arendt's text can be read not as a mere political philosophy but as **another "ontology "** built on the bedrock of existential philosophy.
