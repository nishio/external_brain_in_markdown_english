    - [[social physics]]
    - The most important concepts "[[Idea flow]]" and "[[social learning]]"
    - quest
        - Definition: the use of social networks to gather ideas and information
            - Part of the flow of ideas
        - Found a good idea
        - Link to good decision making
        - What is a social network?
            - Twitter can be seen as a person writing a small blog post.
            - Verbal conversation included
            - Information exchange through people
    - Idea flow
            - Foundation of [wisdom of crowds
        - [[engagement]]
        - What is Engagement?
            - Occurs primarily within groups of peers [[social learning]].
                - [[code of conduct]] formation
            - Formation of coercive [social pressure
        - For example, [[Cybozu]] has a code of conduct that considers [[information sharing]] to be a good thing, and [[social learning]] is actually taking place by watching other people share more and more information.

- [[Is information sharing a good thing?]]

- p.47
- It has been observed that when the information distribution rate is high, [[echo chambers]] occur and performance drops.

- Horizontal axis "speed of flow of ideas" is the amount of imitation of transactions

- Interventions to ensure an appropriate level of speed at which ideas flow
    - Specifically.
        - Informing the Isolated.
            - [[Mixing the flow of ideas to increase the diversity of ideas]]
    - Improved performance

- The quest for good results
    - Social learning is extremely important
        - Combining successful imitation of others with personal learning is superior to personal learning alone
    - Diversity is important
            - Avoid [echo chamber
    - People who behave irrelevantly to others are important.
        - May have information that counteracts the effects of social impacts
        - I can't tell if you're a wise man or a freak.
            - In the case of Eatlo, we could determine this by looking at the performance
        - See if there is a common opinion
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I don't think that would filter out the common trait of "going against the grain of common sense" when there is simply an innocent who goes against the grain...

- [[collective intelligence]]
- Groups perform better than isolated individuals.
- Patterns of interaction that contributed to the emergence of collective intelligence
    - [[Evidence for a Collective Intelligence Factor in the Performance of Human Groups]]
- Most Contribution
    - Participants in the conversation are speaking equally.
- next in line
    - Social intelligence of members
        - Ability to read the [[social signals]] of others
        - Tends to be higher for women.
        - Groups that included women fared better.

- p113
- If you talk only to one person, the circle gets closer to that person.

Flow of Good Ideas p111
- Number of ideas
- Density of exchange
    - Like" for a statement What?" and other reactions
- Diversity of ideas
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>How do we distinguish between many and diverse?
    - Methods for Evaluating Diversity of Ideas p139
        - Distinctive Idea Methods
        - bronze-vessel and bell inscriptions found at the imperial palace, etc.
            - Predicting what others will say
            - If the prediction is correct, we ignore that information because it's already common knowledge.
        - the wise
            - Find people who can predict other people's behavior and yet act differently
            - Being predictable means you have a good understanding of common social perceptions.
            - If you act differently on it, there's some reason for it.
                - You have information that others don't have, etc.
                - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Maybe it's just a blessing in disguise?
        - Third way
            - People who often hold similar opinions are not considered independent

- [[Social Network Incentives]]
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/5c164731efd56100550e852918b3670a/thumb/1000)
- Cybozu's [[work bar]] is a system that rewards "support for activity expenses" for actions that "involve people from other departments in a joint event.
