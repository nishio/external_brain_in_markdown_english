title: "Work so much that you want to concentrate in a situation so relaxing that you can sleep."

> My biggest [[productivity]] contraption is to work on the couch or in bed during the day. In other words, I put myself in a situation where I can sleep at any time and not spend energy (or sloth, w/e) on time I don't have to do anything.
>  It means that you only do enough work that you want to [[concentrate]] in a situation where you [[relax]] enough to sleep.
