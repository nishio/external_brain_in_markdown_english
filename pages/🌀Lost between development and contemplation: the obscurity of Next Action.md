The paper explores the hesitation between development and contemplation and the criteria for making a decision to choose an action. The question of how to distinguish between escaping into speculation when no concrete action is in sight and prioritizing speculation when there is doubt about the development path was referenced in Nishio's "Lost between Development and Speculation: Uncertainty of Next Action" and "The Tradeoff between Speculation and Development."

He also submitted questions about the optimal balance in intelligent collaboration between AI and humans and how to guarantee the quality and accuracy of AI's new functions. He also suggested the possibility that AI could express its own search behavior in words, which could then be coupled with a system that would receive them and perform search actions on its behalf that AI is unable to do.

He further suggested that in order for humans and AI to share the same objectives, it would be useful to write the objectives in microformat. This could allow humans and AI to share the same objectives.

### Deep thoughts and questions

The ability of an AI to verbalize its exploratory behavior is an important step toward performing exploratory behaviors on behalf of humans that they are unable to do. However, it is not yet clear how AI will acquire this capability and how it will use it. In addition, the notion that AI facilitates productive discussions by organizing discussion traffic requires a detailed explanation of how AI organizes discussions and how it makes them productive.

Also, a detailed description of how objectives are written in microformat and how this facilitates human-AI sharing of objectives is needed.

Explore the criteria for deciding whether to choose specific actions or to deepen speculation when the direction of development is unclear. Question how to distinguish between escaping into contemplation because of the lack of concrete next actions for development and trying to prioritize contemplation because of fundamental doubts about the development path.

Nishio's "Lost between Development and Contemplation: the Unclear Nature of Next Action" is found to be relevant. The trade-off between contemplation and development" is also helpful. Clarity of project objectives is important, and AI has the opportunity to help users express their own ideas more clearly by understanding their input and asking questions about areas that are difficult to understand.

In "Mentor Personality," future-oriented thinking patterns and an emphasis on helping the creator identify the process of identifying the cause of a bug are indicated. In addition, "The KJ Method: Letting the Chaos Speak for Itself" lists elements such as understanding the situation, evaluating, making decisions, and planning policies, concrete measures, and procedures.

In the "Textbook of Design Research," finding out that "something you don't know if you can do" can be done is an expansion of the scope of what can be done, moving it to the difficult side on the axis of technical difficulty. However, this is also an unconscious narrowing of the scope of search.

In "Teamwork with AI," questions are submitted about the optimal balance in intelligent collaboration between AI and humans and how to ensure the quality and accuracy of new AI capabilities.

We explored the criteria for judging action choices between development and contemplation, drawing on Nishio's work; submitted questions about the optimal balance between AI and human intellectual collaboration and how to guarantee AI's new capabilities; and suggested that a system in which AI expresses its own exploratory behavior, receives it, and performs instead exploratory behavior that AI is unable to He suggested the possibility of combining the two. We also proposed a microformat for humans and AI to share objectives.

### Deep thoughts and questions

Detailed explanations are needed on how AI acquires and utilizes the ability to express its search behavior in words, how AI facilitates productive discussions by organizing discussion traffic, and how to write objectives in microformats and facilitate their sharing between humans and AI.

### Relation to Fragment
.

The fragment "🤖🔁 Neri Neri" is related to the content of the note, which states that an AI can express its exploratory behavior in words and then combine with a system that receives it and performs exploratory behavior on its behalf that the AI cannot. It also shares the idea that AI can organize discussion traffic and facilitate productive discussions.

### Summary of thoughts

It is important to explore the optimal balance between AI and human intellectual collaboration and to think deeply about how AI can acquire and use the ability to express its own search behavior in words.

When the direction of development is unclear, explore the criteria for choosing a specific course of action or deepening contemplation. Contemplation may be prioritized when concrete next actions for development are not visible or when there is doubt about the development path. Recognize the importance of accelerating linguistic contemplation over time and reaching the edge of experience.

## Relation to Fragment
.
The note is related to the fragment "Accelerate Contemplation and Reach the Edge of Experience". The note discusses priorities for action and contemplation when the direction of development is unclear, and the fragment emphasizes the importance of accelerating contemplation and reaching the edges of experience. These provide an answer to the question of how to balance contemplation and action.

## deep thinking
When the direction of development is unclear, new perspectives and solutions can be found through deepening contemplation. However, it is important to gain experience not only through contemplation but also through concrete actions. Contemplation and action influence each other, and a well-balanced combination can produce better results.

## Digest 1
When the direction of development is unclear, we explore the criteria for choosing specific actions or deepening contemplation. Something is likely to emerge, but it is not clear, and you are not sure whether you should proceed with development or see what might emerge. How can you distinguish between escaping into contemplation because you cannot see a concrete next action for development and trying to prioritize contemplation over development because you have fundamental doubts about the current development path? Over time, it has become "accelerating contemplation to reach the edge of experience".

## Digest 2
.
The fragments of "Equivalent Transformation Theory" provide a direction for solving the problem of "how to search for the starting system A." This is one answer to the question that explores the criteria for choosing a specific action or deepening speculation when the direction of development is unclear. The "Thinking Node 2021 Unexplored Junior" fragment provides perspectives such as "when what you want to do is ambiguous" and "investigate different solutions to similar problems," which provide a means to avoid escaping into speculation when the specific next action for development is unclear.

## deep thinking
When the direction of development is unclear, it is more important to deepen contemplation than to choose specific actions. However, the contemplation should be done in such a way that it leads to concrete actions, and it should not be just vague thinking, but rather a search for specific problem-solving directions. In addition, deepening contemplation can lead to the discovery of new perspectives and means of solution.

## one-line summary
When the direction of development is unclear, deepen contemplation and search for specific problem-solving directions.

.
"Direction of Development and Deepening Contemplation."
