title: "UBI to avoid monopolizing access to AI"
---

Productivity gains from AI will accelerate business around the world. Uneven access to this technology will widen social disparities: if access to AI can be purchased with existing currency, the existing "rich" will compete to purchase AI, depleting limited resources and thus making it unavailable to the "poor".

The company providing access to AI could issue its own currency and allow people to buy access to AI only with that currency. If that company distributes this "[[AI access currency]]" to everyone as [[universal basic income]] ([[UBI]]), then everyone can get access to AI. So [[universal access to AI]] is guaranteed.

If individual recipients of AI-usage currency in the UBI do not use up their entire allotment, they can exchange their remaining AI-usage currency in the marketplace; entities that can generate a lot of existing currency using their access to AI (e.g., businesses) have an There is an incentive to do so.

This is where a competitive market is created. Each purchaser can pay for AI usage currency up to the amount of existing currency they are able to generate. As a result, the entity that can use AI most efficiently will have priority in gaining access. Individual sellers, on the other hand, would receive a share of the profits from the most efficient AI users.

This is analogous to the existing economic system, which taxes the profits of highly profitable corporations and provides a universal basic income to the people. The difference is that it is not achieved by the power of the state, but by a private corporation issuing its own currency and refusing to pay for the services it provides [[in the existing currency]]. This [[source of power]] is [[monopolization]] over the provision of services.
