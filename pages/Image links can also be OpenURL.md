title: "Image links can also be OpenURL"

Functionality that becomes an image sticky when a Gyazo URL is pasted, implemented because it is better to open that Gyazo page with Open URL.

I wondered why the border of the sticky was now showing, but it was simply hidden because it is usually a much larger image. I can't think of any particular need to turn it off, so I won't do it.
