- Thoughts.
    - What do we do with the condition that any five different additions are a composite number?
    - From the condition of being distinct primes, when 2 is included, the sum is even, so the composite number
    - In other words, we can consider the condition that the composite number is obtained by adding five odd prime numbers that are different from each other
    - For example, if all of them are "divided by 5 and less than 1", then any of them can be chosen and added together to make a multiple of 5.
    - If there are 55 prime numbers divided by 5 and less than 1 by 55555, it is OK.
- Official Explanation OK
