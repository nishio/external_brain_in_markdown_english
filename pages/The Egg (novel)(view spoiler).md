> The story has a protagonist, "you" (second person), and a god, "I" (first person). A 48-year-old man dies in a car accident and meets God, the narrator. God tells him that you have been reborn many times before and that you will be reborn next as a Chinese peasant girl in the year 540. God then tells him that you have, in fact, been continually reborn over time. He explains that every human being who has ever lived and will ever live is an incarnation of you. You describe yourself as Abraham Lincoln, Adolf Hitler, and Jesus Christ. God adds that you were once John Wilkes Booth, the victim of every holocaust, and every follower of Jesus.
> God explains that there are, in fact, godlike beings elsewhere, and that you will one day be a god. When the entire universe is created as the egg of the protagonist (i.e., all humanity) and you live the life of every human being who ever lived, you will be born as God. God created the universe because the protagonist said, "Every time you sacrifice someone . You have sacrificed yourself. Every act of kindness you have done, you have done to yourself. Every happy or sad moment mankind has ever experienced, you have experienced or will experience." This was to understand that.
