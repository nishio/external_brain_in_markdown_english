What do you do when you are required to output knowledge that cannot be "simply copied and pasted from a source"?

- If it is an unknown field, buy about three books by different authors in that field and read them at the same time
    - Doing this will not make you the world leader in your field, but you can reach "I know more than 99% of the world" rather easily.
        - Will it go to 99%? I doubt it.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/miyamonz/icon' alt='/villagepump/miyamonz.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - But for now, the act of parallel book reading <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/miyamonz/icon' alt='/villagepump/miyamonz.icon' height="19.5"/>does it too, and it's good!
    - Perceived by the top group in the field as "well educated and easy to talk to" and by the majority of others as "someone who knows a lot".
    - Just by doing a pipe where information flows on demand, we'll be able to gather more and more useful information.
    - I'll do this.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - childcare
        - Unknown programming language
- When it comes to programming, you think, "I want to make ~," and then you ask, "What do I have to do to make ~?" to find out how to do it.
        - [[Delayed Evaluation Study]]
- High value of non-public and non-electronic sources of information
    - Because information that's publicly available and digitized can be found in a search.
    - Books are OCR'd and made searchable.
        - I have PDFs in Dropbox.
        - It is sufficient if I can search for the electronic version of the data, even if I cannot publish it.
            - If given the chance, claim that you "meet the citation requirements" and publish it yourself.
            - Specific examples [/nishio/information card](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/information card).


- How do you choose your books?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/はるひ/icon' alt='/villagepump/はるひ.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - [[How to Choose an Introductory Book]]
        - I might take the time to read that one book if it's in a field with decent books like this.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Basically, most fields are not systematized properly, and people say different things, so you have to read more than one person's work.
            - I felt that when I was researching this for childcare.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - You'd think that if all you do is technical research in the IT world, the world would be full of such things, but of course it's not....
        - Difficult to choose<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/miyamonz/icon' alt='/villagepump/miyamonz.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - Criteria for a decent book,[/villagepump/miyamonz.icon
                - amazon review
                - Google and read the stray article.
                - twitter search
                - I found all of the above to be "unreliable sources".<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
                    - I agree that it is an unreliable source.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/miyamonz/icon' alt='/villagepump/miyamonz.icon' height="19.5"/>
                    - But it's true in that "someone wrote an opinion that ____" and I'll refer to it rather often.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/miyamonz/icon' alt='/villagepump/miyamonz.icon' height="19.5"/>
                        - Regardless of the opinion claim, if the book is mentioned even n=1 times, the book is likely to be read quite a bit more than n=0
                        - What does it mean that such a review is written? to be used as a basis for making a decision.
                            - I won't make the decision not to read it because it has a bad reputation.
                            - In some cases, it could be because of a bad reputation that you read it.
            - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>in the case of
                - Whether the material is designated as reference material from the university's syllabus
                - (not bestsellers) [[long sellers]] or not.

                - Whether it is recommended by someone you trust.
- Why 3?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/はるひ/icon' alt='/villagepump/はるひ.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - You might see people say 3 is just the right magic number every so often.
    - No deeper meaning.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - [/nishio/read three books in the same field and you will become an expert](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/read three books in the same field and you will become an expert).
        - I'd rather have two than one.
        - Even if you buy 10 books at once, you'll read a little at a time anyway.
        - I've amended that to "about three books."
            - It's not a magical ritual, so it's not important here at all.
- PS: If I trust a particular person very much, I may take the approach of reading three books by that person.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I recently bought three of Audrey Tan's books.
