    - Concepts used in [[reinforcement learning]].
    - exploitation-exploration trade-offs
    - There are variations on whether to say "use" or "exploration" first and how to translate "exploitation.

- If one chooses an option that seems useful, the opportunity to discover that other options are more useful is lost.
    - Selecting the optimal solution based on past experience prevents new searches and gets stuck in [local minimum

- On the other hand, if they repeatedly search for more useful options, they will not benefit from the useful options they have found.
    - To find another minimum from [[local minimum]], you have to go up once.

- Significant development in the field of reinforcement learning, but first published much older.

        - By getting information through a filter that matches your ideology, you get stuck in the [[local minimum]] of the ideology.

        - Often used as an excuse to reduce search costs

### Summary of notes
.
This section describes the "trade-off between search and use" in reinforcement learning. By choosing a useful alternative, one may miss other possibilities, and by searching for new alternatives, one may not benefit from known useful alternatives. This concept has been applied in other areas such as organizational learning and information filtering.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The fragment "Revised Differences for the Fourth Printing" describes the trade-off between exploration and exploitation and is directly related to the note. Specifically, it states, "If you only choose the option that you think is best based on past experience, you will never find a better option. That is not enough exploration." This part of the note is consistent with the main theme of the note.

### deep thinking
The trade-off between exploration and exploitation represents a balance between pursuing new possibilities and maximizing the benefits from known useful alternatives. This is an important consideration when choosing how to obtain information and learn.
