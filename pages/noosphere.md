- The word was coined from a combination of the Greek words [[νοῦς]] (nous, meaning "intellect" or "spirit") and σφαῖρα (sphaira, meaning "sphere") and was proposed by the Russian geologist and philosopher Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadovsky.
- He divided the evolution of the Earth into three stages.
    - Lithosphere: solid surface layer of the earth
    - Biosphere: the environmental area in which organisms live
    - noosphere: information space or intelligent system of an intelligent body
- The noosphere is believed to influence the earth's ecosystem and environment as human intelligence, culture, and information technology evolve and interact with the biosphere. This concept is sometimes used to capture the expansion of human intellectual capacity in the 21st century, including the development of information technology and global knowledge sharing.
