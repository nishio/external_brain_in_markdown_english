[(film) Matrix (film) - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/マトリックス_)
> The world you are living in is a virtual reality created by a computer," he is told, and is faced with the choice of continuing to live in the virtual reality or waking up in the real world. Thomas, troubled by the discomfort of everyday life, chooses to wake up in the real world. He takes a red capsule, and in a moment of cardiac arrest, he realizes that he is trapped in an incubator-like capsule, unable to move. What Trinity and his friends told him was true: in the real world, human society had collapsed due to a computer uprising, and the majority of humans were being cultured to power the computers. Thomas, who has awakened, is discarded as defective, but is saved by Trinity and Morpheus, who are waiting for him.
