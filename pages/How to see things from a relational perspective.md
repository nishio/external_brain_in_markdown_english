- How to see things in terms of [Relationships

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679777115993157635) (I know it's a rather formal name) [[social constructivism]] is a pretty interesting concept.
>  In the United States, public opinion is split down the middle on the issue of abortion. When pro- and anti-abortion groups debate the issue, they attack each other for what is wrong with the other's arguments and appeal to the correctness of their own arguments. The conversation ends in a parallel line, and the relationship remains disconnected. However.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679777454695813120) When I asked them to stop fighting the rhetoric and tell me why they had come to oppose or support abortion, they said that they had come to an understanding and reconciliation with each other. When I asked them to share their personal experiences that led them to become opposed or supportive of abortion, they said they came to a mutual understanding and reconciliation, saying, "Oh, it's natural to have such an opinion when you have such an experience.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679777918833299456) This phenomenon is interesting. There is an assumption that rythms are universal because they are seemingly logical and logical. From this universal logic, the other person's opinion is very strange and full of contradictions, and one can only think that one's own theory is correct. However, the other party is thinking the same thing. This is where the disconnect arises.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679778338884456449) However, personal experience, which is generally considered to be very individual, a special case, and without universality, strikes a chord that transcends differences in position and claims. But personal experiences, which are generally considered to be very individual and specific cases and not universal, strike a chord beyond differences in position and claims. Why did I become opposed to abortion, because of this sad event that happened to a relative? Why I am in favor of abortion, because of this sad event that happened to my sister.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679778687456268291) Yes, it is strange, but it is the personal experiences that are often thought of as individual and special cases that transcend positions and arguments, It is the personal experiences that are often thought of as individual and special cases that have the universality of empathy. And relationships that were once thought to be impossible to mutually understand are set in motion. Social constructivism is characterized by its focus on such "relationships.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679779100234485761) Another interesting case study. An experiment on "Asaichi". In the experiment, several parents and their children were troubled by a child who kept running out of the road no matter how much they scolded him or her. The parents were blindfolded and told, "You have to cross the street to be safe. The children were blindfolded by their parents and told by the staff, "You have to let them cross the road safely. Then.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679779422021513216) A child who had previously darted out without looking left or right frantically checked left and right again and again, and even after being assured that it was safe, carefully pulled his parent's hand across the crosswalk. Even though they were sure it was safe to do so, they still carefully pulled their parents' hands and crossed the pedestrian crossing. Every single child. All the parents were surprised. They had always jumped out without looking left or right, no matter how many times I had told them to do so!

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679779766063472640) This is probably because the "relationship" has changed. Until then, children were probably "outsourcing" their safety checks to their parents, thinking that their parents must be checking both sides of the street, and were moving according to their own interests. Parents also did not trust their children's attentiveness and called out to them ahead of time, which led to an even greater state of outsourcing.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679780231824175105) However, when the parent blindfolds the child and the child is forced to rely on the child's attention, the child is well aware of the responsibility of "I am responsible for the life of my parents" and tries to cross the road safely by checking both sides to the best of his/her ability. The child must have been well aware of his or her responsibility to "take care of my parents' lives," and tried to cross the road safely by checking both sides of the road to the best of his or her ability. The child's behavior changed dramatically as a result of the change in the relationship between the parents and the child.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679780659643158530) The reason I suggest "don't get ahead of yourself, get behind" is to change the "relationship". When you tell a child to do something ahead of time, the child loses motivation, saying, "I was going to do it this way. If the child is told ahead of time to do something, he or she will think that he or she did it because he or she was ordered to do so. That is the way it should be.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679780985427345409) You did the tidying up, you did the homework, but the credit goes to the parent who gave the instructional order. The child realizes that the "relationship" is "you cleaned up, you did your homework because of me who gave you instructions, and you are the lazy one who didn't move unless I gave you instructions" and becomes completely fed up with it. But.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679781397660327936) When you "backtrack". Wait until the child starts to move, for example, if they happen to lift a toy and try to move it, and then say, "Oh! You're going to put it away? You're great, even though no one told you to do it." When you are surprised, they will happily start to put it away even though they had no intention of putting it away.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679781784802967553) When a child who has not been doing his or her homework late at night says, "I have to do my homework," just as it is time to go to bed, you may ask, "Why don't you do it earlier? When a child who has not been doing his/her homework even late at night says, "I have to do it," I say, "Why don't you do it earlier, it will make you late for bed. You'll be late tomorrow! I always want to complain, "You're always.... But I have to hold it in.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679782195211411456) "I like your spirit of trying to do your homework! But it's already late at night, so do it early. But it's late at night, so you'll have to do it early. If you can't do it by the end of the night, we'll try again tomorrow morning," and show surprise at the child's willingness to do it actively and spontaneously. Then, they begin to plan to surprise their parents by being proactive.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679782633340014594) "I already did my homework today!" [[Shin Shinohara95]] "Eh! You didn't even tell me to do it! When you show surprise, the attitude of actively working on it will come into play.
>  If you try to command and make them obey, the relationship between "the child who doesn't listen" and "the parent who thinks he can get by thanks to my command" becomes fixed. However.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679783112308584450) If parents have the "backward" attitude of waiting for their children to become active and then being surprised when they do become active, the children will realizes that the more active they become, the more they can surprise their parents, and they become more and more active in order to surprise their parents. This attitude of waiting and being surprised by the child's active behavior changes the relationship.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679783392580366341) We tend to label people "because he/she is ________" and thereby fixate our relationship with them. Define yourself as a righteous being. Define the other person as an evil being. When we focus on "existence," the relationship stops changing and the situation becomes rigid. However.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679783730565742598) How do we stop focusing on "being" because "the other person is this way" or "I am that way" and move or change the relationship? How can we change the relationship? When we shift our thinking to "How can I change?", interestingly, as soon as the relationship changes, both the other person and ourselves change. The "existence" that we thought was impossible to change, changes effortlessly.



> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679968691566579712) I was wondering if there are any social constructivist comics? I was wondering if there are any manga about social constructivism. In my own way, I recommend "The Iesai Man". This manga is filled with episodes in which "beings" who were thought to be "out of control" are dramatically changed by changing their relationships.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679969426039504896) A boy can't stop using paint thinner and his father is a drunk. A lawyer and a judge who happen to be involved in the trial try to rehabilitate the thinner boy, and the father tells him to cut back on his drinking and get a job, but again, he reverts back to being a thinner addict and a drunk. The lawyer and the judge are determined to throw up their hands and say, "There's nothing we can do about this father and son.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679970321754132480) That's where Judge Kuwata comes in. There may be nothing more we can do as lawyers or judges, "but we are human beings, aren't we?" He asks.
>  The lawyer and the judge sat down with the father, who was drunk, and started drinking. The father asked, "How long are you going to hang around me?" He asked. Then the lawyer said.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679970969857978368) "Until you have a friend." Then the father started shaking and crying.
>  Actually, his father was a skilled craftsman, but he fell off the job site and was badly injured. Since then, he was too afraid to stand on the job site and became a drunkard because he was ashamed of it. He was also rough at home, which is why his son became a thinner addict.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679971545190649857) To stop a boy's addiction to thinner, we must consider the problem of the father's loneliness. This was the attempt of a lawyer and a judge who thought that this was what they could do as "human beings".
>  Don't try to change the other person, change the relationship. Design the relationship and when it changes, human behavior is transformed. This is an episode that illustrates this well.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679971764905086980) A girl with excellent grades and a good reputation at school is now prostituting herself. I have tried to make her a prostitute, but she shows no signs of remorse. When I asked her why she was prostituting herself, she replied, "Because I wanted money! When I asked her why she prostituted herself, she replied, "Because I wanted money! She was very light-hearted. But she comes from a wealthy family, so I don't think that's the reason.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679972082745221120) An investigator is in trouble with no solution. The main character, Judge Kuwata, advised him to look at the house. When the investigator visited the home, he noticed that the house was strangely too clean. Then, on the way home, the girl's younger brother chased after her and asked, "Is your sister going to be in jail for a long time? Her mother said she got dirty.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679972393744502785) This is where the investigator found a clue to the problem. In fact, when the girl first got her period, her mother told her. You learned that in school. Go to the bathroom early. You're making the house dirty!" With these words, the girl was shocked to hear that she was regarded as a person who polluted the house.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679972512099368960) "If I am so dirty, if a clean house is more important than my daughter, why don't I just get dirty? This was the cause of his turning to prostitution.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679972693414932480) Judge Kuwata reprimanded the mother in strong terms, "Children are not just objects that follow the values of their parents!" She reprimanded the mother in strong words. The mother is shocked to realize that she was the cause of the child's death and begins to tremble. Seeing her mother trembling in shock, the girl regrets what she has done for the first time and asks, "Please let me go home! and begs her to go home.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679972814076653568) Judge Kuwata's blow to the mother's bizarre love of cleanliness transforms the relationship between mother and child, which in turn changes the child's consciousness, This is the story of a mother and her child.

>  The cartoon "The Iesai Man" contains so many good examples of social constructivism.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679973265056604162) Dragon Ball could be good. Piccolo and Vegeta were originally supposed to be Son Goku's rivals, but before long they became friends who cooperate to defeat their enemies. This is while Piccolo and Vegeta always take their opponents as rivals, Goku.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679973813122121728) The story is about a group of rivals who, because they only confront each other in the form of a "I want to fight the strong guy" relationship, before they know it, their rivals have been drained of their venom. The story is that the rivals are drained of their poison before they know it.
>  Instead of trying to change the other person, try to change the relationship. Design the relationship. Then we "beings" are surprisingly transformed.

> [ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1679974381882347529) Calling it "social constructivism" is a bit formal and difficult to understand, but if you think of it as "a way of looking at things from the perspective of relationships" and look at manga in a different way, you will find many hints lying around. However, if we look at it as "a way of looking at things from the perspective of relationships" and reexamine the various examples in manga, I think we can find many hints lying around.
