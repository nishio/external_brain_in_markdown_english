title: "A discussion of why my task management doesn't work."
---

from [[Hatena2009-10-07]]
Consideration of why my task management doesn't work: In addition to the MUST TO DOs, I have a lot of WANT TO DOs in my TODO LIST that I come up with that I don't have to do. LIST is overflowing.

MUST TO DO tasks often have deadlines. If you imagine how much time it will take and look at your current to-do list, and if it doesn't look like you can fit it in, you can decline by saying "I can't do it because I'm working on something right now. Also, tasks are not left over because they disappear before the deadline, or because the deadline has passed and there is nothing left to do but to give up on them. So tasks don't accumulate beyond a certain level. On the other hand, I have 700 lines of tasks recorded in "howm". If I accumulate that many MUST TO DOs, I will die.

@kazmaro My conclusion today is "WANT TO DO should not be written where you can usually see it. Just looking at a long list of things will discourage you from doing them.

Maybe it's better to keep the TODOs that are visible empty all the time or something... I felt better when I boldly threw away the old tasks that had accumulated in RTM.

@ssig33 RT WANT TO DO and I think it's good to forget everything you can't do on the spot, if you can remember it later, that's fine, if you can't remember it, you didn't have a connection.

No, but some of them are "new ideas" and may be useful later... haha, this task list that I keep saying it may be useful someday, is the same as the large amount of stuff in this room that I keep saying I may use someday? As for the stuff in the room, I'm beginning to think it's the same as if I can't get it out of there quickly when I need it.
