[[Windows]] has not reached 100% market share, nor has it dominated forever. It had strong market dominance in certain areas for a certain period of time. I'm predicting the same situation will occur with [[OpenAI]]+MS.

Of course, in such a monopolistic situation, it is good for society as a whole that individual engineers invest their time in minority options.

The technologically superior products do not necessarily spread, but the first ones to spread exert the [[network effect]], and there is a dynamic that makes their dominance more secure. This is because the masses are unable to evaluate technology, and they imitate and use what those close to them are using.

It is understood that individual effort can contribute. It is the difference between taking a position proactively after understanding the situation in detail and taking a position somewhat without understanding it well or being forced to take a position by others.
