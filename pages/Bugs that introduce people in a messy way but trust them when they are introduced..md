> People tend to trust people they don't know well when they are introduced by someone they know well, but people tend to introduce others to others without thinking twice.

If Mr. A says to Mr. B, "Introduce [[introduce]] someone with attribute X," Mr. B will think of someone with attribute X and introduce the person who comes to mind. Most people are "trust neutral."
On the other hand, A [[trusts]] B and has a "positive trust level" and tends to give a positive trust level to the person B referred.
