> [@isawmydevil](https://twitter.com/isawmydevil/status/1593729077118398464?s=20&t=SDTxQXd61WmM-h4YOEPdnw): If an idiot and a moron were arguing, and their positions were If you swapped them, it just became an argument between an idiot and a moron. It is just a low-level bickering, not a universal argument. It's not a [[reversibility test]], it's just mirroring (harassment). (14/n)
