title: "People who want you to make the rules."
---

If you force [people who are not confident in their own [[judgmental]] abilities] to do [[judgmental work]], they want you to make rules because they don't want to [[take responsibility]] for the consequences of their decisions.
- The "[[rule]]" also includes "[[language of decision criteria]]" etc.
- Creating a "line of defense" to say, "[[It's not my fault for following the rules]].


At first I wrote "[[someone]] who wants to make up rules," but I thought not.
- I don't even make up my own rules.
- They suggest, "I think there should be rules," or "Let's make rules," but when you say, "Okay, then let's make a slapstick," they generally do nothing.
- Because if I set the rules, I can't say, "[It's not my fault.

Is this "[[Escape from Freedom]]"?
