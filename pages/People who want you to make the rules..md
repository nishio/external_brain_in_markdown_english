If you force [people who are not confident in their own [[judgmental]] abilities] to do [[judgmental work]], they want you to make rules because they don't want to [[take responsibility]] for the consequences of their decisions.
- The "[[rule]]" also includes "[[language of decision criteria]]" etc.
- Creating a "line of defense" to say, "[[It's not my fault for following the rules]].


At first I wrote "[[someone]] who wants to make up rules," but I thought not.
- I don't even make up my own rules.
- They suggest, "I think there should be rules," or "Let's make rules," but when you say, "Okay, then let's make a slapstick," they generally do nothing.
- Because if I set the rules, I can't say, "[It's not my fault.

Is this "[[Escape from Freedom]]"?

- Some people are more likely to participate because of the rules and some are less likely to participate because of the rules.
- Are there really "people for whom having rules makes it easier to participate?"
    - If you have to know the rules before you act, the more rules you have, the harder it is to act.
    - After all, if you make rules, "you can't act because there are too many rules," and if you don't make rules, "you can't act because you don't know how to make decisions.
    - If you don't act either way, isn't the social utility negative for the "people who are less likely to participate because of the rules"?
