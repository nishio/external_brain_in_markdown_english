title: "The idea of wanting to do something new is old."

> The first thing I was told when I went to art school was, "Artists who came before you have already come up with all the 'novel ideas' long before you were born. Instead of focusing on [[originality]] and [[novelty]], find value in the inevitability of [[what you do]].

Context: art college
[[The necessity of what I do]].
- [[Inevitability over novelty]]
- [[inevitability]] rather than [[novelty]].
- [[novelty (patentability)]]

In the case of science, we survey the research of our predecessors and think about how we can produce our own ⊿t, right? There may be "new approaches" there, but I think "[[The inevitability of what I do]]" and "Peer review will not pass. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kur/status/1427153738821554185?s=21)
- Context:.
    - The phrase "does not pass peer review" implicitly assumes "the value of passing [[peer review]]."
    - Context: a community that believes in the value of writing papers and passing them through peer review

The two may be a difference in [[community values]] of whether to value "novelty" or "[[The inevitability of what I do]]" ([[storytelling]]?). Maybe it's a difference in [[community values]], which they value more

What caused the value system that emphasizes "the necessity of doing what one does?"
- Because without it, it's difficult to "[[Keep doing it.]]"?
- The type of behavior that takes 10 years to produce results is a big advantage in being able to continue because most people "can't keep up".
    - The only way to go to extraordinary places is to accumulate the little things.
    - I guess [[starting a business]] or something like that would fall into this category.

    - Context, not technology, is the value.
        - How it happened.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I was just thinking about how the value of "context, not technology, is the value" arose... and then I thought of the case of the femtosecond laser that created a fairy that you could touch with a femtosecond laser.
        - ref: ["Fairy Lights in Femtoseconds" Interview with Yoichi Ochiai: "Art is nothing but technology anymore | Gizmodo Japan](https://www.gizmodo.jp/2015/08/fairy_lights_in_femtoseconds.html)
                - [[Yoichi Ochiai]] [[Art will be nothing but technology now]].
        - I think it's just that the majority of people doing art tend to run in the direction of creating value through context (storytelling) because they are too technically inept to create value using technology...
        - If we insist on "human drawing," we will have to "fight on the same level as many people in the past" because human ability will not progress that much.
    - > <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/tokoroten/icon' alt='tokoroten.icon' height="19.5"/> I think art as a market has [[uncopyability]] (it is an object made by human hands) as part of its value, and context as uncopyability by information is added to it.

> <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/kur/icon' alt='kur.icon' height="19.5"/> By the way, I was just talking with an art college graduate at my company, and he told me that nowadays it is more common to use a collection of works as a point of reference [[originality as a surface]] rather than a single work as a novel idea. I thought that this might lead to the creation of value as [[authorship]] or [[The inevitability of what I do]].

So, if we do several similar jobs, projects that say, "Maybe we can do this too," will fly in.
- > <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/kur/icon' alt='kur.icon' height="19.5"/> Maybe that's also in a sense authorship.
