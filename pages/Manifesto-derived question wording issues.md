I thought it was a typical [[false dichotomy]], but I guess it has to be as long as the parties and candidates are making that kind of argument.

- There was a suggestion to split [[public opinion map]] into two parts: "Aim to be carbon neutral, neither dependent on fossil fuels nor on nuclear power, and aim for 100% renewable energy generation by 2050".
- This is a trade-off with the requirement to provide a political party icon
    - I would like to have a "question" for or against a political party in order to produce a political party icon.
    - When a political party says "A & B" in its manifesto, "interpretation" comes into play as to whether it can be split into A and B in favor of each.
    - Interpretation can't be reduced to zero anyway, so you have the option of interpreting it all over again and apologizing if you get angry.
        - If you want to reduce that risk, you're going to want to use the language as it's written in the manifesto.
        - Well, after all, I think the risk reduction effect of "using the wording as written in the manifesto" is limited because it doesn't reduce the risk of people saying "This is not what it looks like! I think the risk reduction effect of "using the language as written in the manifesto" is limited because it does not reduce the risk of people saying "This is not what I meant!
        - The strategy of "AI did it" without human judgment by "AI that judges whether it agrees or disagrees" is also...

After all, a political party has to show how it's different from other parties, so there's a bias to choose language that seems divisive.
- I'm beginning to think that asking questions like that is why we can't find a point of agreement.
- Maybe we need to be able to add questions for people without those biases and incentives.
    - [[Open up agenda-setting authority to people]]
