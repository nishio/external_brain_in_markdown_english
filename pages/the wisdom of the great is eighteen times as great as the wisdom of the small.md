title: "the wisdom of the great is eighteen times as great as the wisdom of the small"
---

from  [[About Faith]]
    - [[Enlightenment is not a dichotomy of "got it" and "not got it".]]
            - [[enlightenment]]  /  [[False dichotomy]]
    - I agree with [Hakuin Huizuru](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%99%BD%E9%9A%A0%E6%85%A7%E9%B6%B4) that "[[the wisdom of the great is]] eighteen times as great as the wisdom of the the small]".
        - [[Daigo]] / [[Kogo]].
    - Even if you feel enlightened, [[there may be further enlightenment]], so the path of seeking enlightenment must continue until death.
