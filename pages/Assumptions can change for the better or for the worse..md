> [hrjn](https://x.com/hrjn/status/1828702479623807424) There is a lot of talk about how using MySQL will destroy your company, but don't worry.
>  I have also seen articles about PostgreSQL crushing it.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1828733092938625242) There seems to be a correlation between the existence of people who believe the article "using X will destroy you" about a rather arbitrary X and the company going under.
- "People who believe articles that say 'using X will destroy you'" have a poor understanding of technology, and therefore, companies with such people in their ranks will probably go under. Intention.

>  It would be scuffly cool to use [[strong language]] unconditionally [[no good]], but the truth is that it often comes down to "I can't say whether it's good or bad, because it depends".
- A reasonable and understandable expression of what I wanted to say.
