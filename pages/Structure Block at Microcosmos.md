Convenient!

If you have trouble selecting a range, you can use the corner mode to specify a corner.
If you don't need to save to a file, you can use the /clone command to increase the number of files.
Sometimes you want to move something you've built to a new location later.
Entities can also be duplicated, so you can add or move entire shopping malls that trap villagers.

As for JE, the file format was found in the Wiki, so it may be possible to generate and load it programmatically.

48x48x48 was the maximum size in JE.
