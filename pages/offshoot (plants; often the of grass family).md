Philosopher Gilles [[Deleuze.]] stated that modern society is moving from a disciplined society to a managed society and proposed the new concept of the "divided person" ([[individual]]).
- ⇔[[individual]]( [[individual]] )

The "individual," as discussed by Gilles Deleuze, represents a shift from the "[[autonomous unity]]" assumed by the traditional concept of the "individual. The individual is seen as a single entity with a [[boundary]], whereas the "divider" is seen as more variable and plastic, an entity that is constantly changing according to factors and relationships.
Deleuze points out that in a capitalist managed society, subjects are more likely to be coded and divided and reassembled as information, and he believes that "subjects" are treated as fragmented and fluid "minute persons" rather than as coherent individuals. This leads people to use multiple facets of themselves according to the demands of the social system rather than maintaining a consistent self-image.
In other words, "alter ego" is a concept that breaks down the fixed unity of the traditional "individual" and is constantly transforming within the social and technological environment, generating different selves depending on the relationship.
