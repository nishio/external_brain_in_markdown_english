title: "There are two ways to behave toward new things"
---

There are two types of behavior when confronted with a new tool.

Some people say, "Wow, what's this, how does it work?" or "What, you can do that? How do you do that?" and they quickly learn how to use the tool and [[enjoyment]] using it.

Another person feels [[dissatisfaction]] by saying, "What's this? I don't understand it," or "It's not good, this part is bad, it should be improved," and is satisfied by saying, "This is no good," with someone who feels the same thing.

It was very impressive to observe both those who were enjoying and those who were frustrated using the same tool for the first time in the same way.
