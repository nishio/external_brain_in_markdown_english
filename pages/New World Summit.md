- An example of a direct incorporation of [[democracy]] processes into a work of art is New World Summit by the Dutch artist [[Jonas Stahl]]. New World Summit is positioned as an "artistic and political organization," a series of projects that provide an alternative parliamentary forum for dissident groups excluded from the state (governments in exile, ethnic minority organizations, groups considered terrorist, etc.). The project is a series of projects. In this project, a circular parliamentary (parliamentary) structure is actually constructed in a museum or public space, where representatives of each organization are invited to present and discuss their ideas and policies. Spectators (the general public) participate in the process as observers and sometimes join in debates. Stahl has organized several summits in Europe and the Middle East, and in the Rojava Autonomous Region of Kurdistan, he explored the possibility of a stateless democracy by building a domed parliament building with local people. The New World Summit can be described as "the art of experimenting with democracy itself," and is an extremely radical practice in that it presents a model of the public sphere that is not bound by the existing framework of the state. Here, the process (discussion and decision-making) is the work of art, and the participants are at the same time both viewers and creators. This is a remarkable example of how art can extend the imagination of social institutions.
