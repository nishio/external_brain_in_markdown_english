I want AI to manage tasks for long-term parallel projects.
[[Multi-header systems]] are not necessarily suited for "[[task management of long-term parallel projects]]".
- I mean, maybe it's not for me. It's getting more and more messy.
- Tasks are a complex network of interconnected units that must be divided into actionable units in order to complete a task.
- The [[Neri Neri system]] is more like connecting more and more.
- There is disagreement on whether we should "[[do]] the task" efficiently.
        - [[Efficiently handling tasks would implement a fast fucking application.]]
        - [[Efficiently performing barren tasks is barren]], so we need to first properly create the network and determine what really needs to be done.
- The object of Neri Neri is more of a project objective
    - This is different from project task management.
    - The goal of the project is a distant goal
    - Now feasible tasks of the project are one meter way in front of you
    - What tasks are not feasible now?
        - Is it just a note that maybe there will be a road in that area and we will have to go that way?

### digest of notes
.
Discusses task management for long-term parallel projects with AI. He pointed out that a multi-head rooted system is not necessarily suitable for task management. He expressed the view that efficient handling of tasks does not necessarily lead to good results, and emphasized the importance of organizing the network of tasks and determining what really needs to be done. He also stated that project objectives and task management are different, and clarified the difference between them.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The Notebook and Nishio's fragment "The Intellectual Production of Engineers: A Full Hierarchical Table of Contents" share insights on how to manage tasks. The Notebook emphasizes the importance of organizing a network of tasks and determining what really needs to be done. Fragments, on the other hand, provides insights into how to manage and prioritize tasks and offers specific techniques for improving productivity.

### deep thinking
Task management by AI requires not only efficient processing of tasks, but also the ability to organize a network of tasks and determine what really needs to be done. This suggests that AI will not merely perform human tasks on behalf of humans, but will also serve as a higher-level decision support entity.

### Summary of notes
.
Discusses task management for long-term parallel projects using AI. He pointed out that a multi-header root system is not necessarily suitable for task management. He also discussed the pros and cons of handling tasks efficiently, emphasizing the importance of organizing the network and determining what really needs to be done. He stated that project objectives and task management are different, and explained the characteristics of each.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The fragments "multitasking confusion," "AI could manage tasks," and "task repartitioning" are relevant to the note. The note discusses task management difficulties and the potential of AI, and these fragments complement them in terms of task management problems, AI-based solutions, and task repartitioning, respectively.

### deep thinking
Through notes and fragments, we will consider in depth the difficulties of task management and its solutions. Particular attention will be paid to the possibility of AI-based task management and the possibility of efficiency improvement through task re-fragmentation. However, we must not forget the realistic viewpoint that those methods do not necessarily solve all problems.

### summary of thoughts and title
.
Possibilities and Limitations of Task Management with AI and Task Repartitioning is discussed. The title of the paper is "Possibilities and Limitations of Task Management with AI and Task Redivision.

### Summary of notes
.
Discusses task management for long-term parallel projects using AI. He pointed out that a multi-head root system is not necessarily suitable for task management. Efficient handling of tasks is not necessarily good, and it is important to determine what really needs to be done. He also stated that project objectives and task management are different, likening objectives to a distant goal and tasks to the road in front of you.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The fragment "Letting AI Neutralize Unclear and Long-Term Tasks" (Diary 2023-09-12) is related to the content of the note. The note points out the problems of task management for long-term parallel projects using AI, and the fragment proposes letting AI twist obscure, long-term tasks as a solution.

### deep thinking
AI-based task management has the potential to be a tool not only for simple efficiency, but also for identifying what really needs to be done. However, this requires AI's ability to understand task complexity and project objectives and make appropriate decisions.

### Summary of notes
.
Discusses task management for long-term parallel projects using AI. He pointed out that a multi-head root system is not necessarily suitable for task management. He expressed his view that efficient processing of tasks does not necessarily lead to good results, and emphasized the importance of understanding the intrinsic value of tasks. Stated that the NeriNeri system is effective for project objectives, noting that project objectives and task management are different.

### Relation to Fragment
.
Fragment "pProject" points out problems in task management, which is related to the task management issues described in the note. In addition, the fragment "Future Past" explains the importance of recording and looking back on tasks, which is related to understanding the intrinsic value of the tasks described in the note.

### Deep thoughts and questions
AI-based task management has the potential to provide a new perspective on understanding the intrinsic value of tasks and processing them efficiently. However, it is not yet clear how AI will understand the intrinsic value of tasks and how to leverage it. Further research is also needed on how AI manages tasks and how it can help humans find the details and context of tasks.

### Summary of notes
.
Discusses task management for long-term parallel projects using AI. He pointed out that a multi-head rooted system is not necessarily suitable for task management. It is important to act on a complex network of connected tasks by separating them into executable units. However, the multi-root system tends to connect tasks together. It is not always good to handle tasks efficiently, and it is necessary to determine what really needs to be done. The object of Neri-Neri is the purpose of the project, which is different from task management.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The fragments "Circulating Task Lists," "Task Shoot Time Techniques," "Forcing Task Organization," "Multitasking Experiments 2015," and "Scheduler" are relevant to the content of the note. They contain discussions of task management and efficiency, and are related to the problems and improvements in AI-based task management described in the Note.

### deep thinking
The combination of notes and fragments provides a new perspective on the efficiency and effectiveness of AI-based task management. In particular, considerations regarding task clarification, prioritization, and task switching are important elements for improving AI's task management capabilities.

### summary of thoughts and title
