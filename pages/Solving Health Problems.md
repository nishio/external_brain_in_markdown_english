I've been told that "in about 15 years, all health problems will be solved at once"....

> [fladdict](https://x.com/fladdict/status/1841819297779482985) If Jeff Bezos gets back pain, 500 billion will be invested in back pain treatment, and if Sam Altman's tooth falls out, about 50 billion in research will be poured into tooth regeneration. I don't know. Probably.

From now on, they will invest in "the strongest pharmaceutical development AI", "the strongest health prediction AI", "the strongest protein combination discovery AI", etc. Medical research in which AI explores space will be gunnier.

It costs more to make something "widely available to the world" than it does to pour 100 million into your own health, 100 million is not enough at all. The new technology would not be covered by insurance and would be available only in certain countries, or something like that.
