title: "A profitable company is not a good company."
---

- There are two ways a company can make a profit
    - Increase money (sales) received from customers
    - Reduce the cost you pay

- Increasing sales is a decision left to the customer.
    - Customer decides to buy the product.
    - So ultimately uncontrollable.

- If you want to ensure increased profits, you have to cut costs.
    - Stop Investing for the Future
    - Curtail employee salaries.
    - Stop social contribution activities that do not lead to profits

A company with high profits does not equal a good company.
Drucker: [[Profit is a condition, not an objective, of a company]].
