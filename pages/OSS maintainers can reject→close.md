OSS maintainers can reject→close
> [dmikurube](https://x.com/dmikurube/status/1801178696990261372) Speaking of which, I'd like to throw this at the open source policy discussion. I think that the people who dream about "open source" sometimes forget that it is of course up to them to decide which proposals to include and which not to include, even though it is possible to send down proposals from outside.
>  >dmikurube: Open source is not "decision making with democratic input from all...? The decisions are made by the "people in charge" in a self-righteous manner, and there is nothing wrong with that. It's just "you can use it or make derivatives of it as long as you comply with the license".
> [dmikurube](https://x.com/dmikurube/status/1801181748778176563) The above is from an open source software maintainer who has recently been watching with a rather delicate feeling as "open source" gets a strange boost. Thank you very much for your understanding.
> [dmikurube](https://x.com/dmikurube/status/1801186135571673546) Well, of course, I'm talking about the fact that each process of deciding "not to incorporate" is expected to have its own discussion, and that discussion is what makes it worthwhile.
> [dmikurube](https://x.com/dmikurube/status/1801187143731318814) Well, in the case of a maintainer, you are allowed to give up on the discussion and reject → close the proposal (after all, you are the maintainer). But it is actually quite difficult to say "No" to a proposal that comes to you. I am not sure if it is really acceptable in the context of "politics," after all.
> [dmikurube](https://x.com/dmikurube/status/1801187893937115438) I know it's a lot of work, but I'm eager to see how the transition actually goes, and with that in mind, I'm not saying I don't have high hopes!
> [dmikurube](https://x.com/dmikurube/status/1801195975261983215) Well, actually, the bigger the open source project gets, the more people involved, the more it becomes "the politics", unlike the fluffy image of open source. If you have serious experience in this area, you may be able to play a political role in that sense.
> [dmikurube](https://x.com/dmikurube/status/1801199134537642093) I feel like this kind of talk is better suited for the executive branch and government offices than the election-based legislative branch and Congress.
> [dmikurube](https://x.com/dmikurube/status/1801204442660024785) Come to think of it, Audrey Tang is exactly that. He is a stiff in the middle of an open source project, and yet he is not a so-called [[delegate]], but only a [[cabinet member]] of the Executive Yuan.
