Intellectual productivity is the process of increasing the value of the end product per input cost, and it is important to increase the value of ideas. Ideas are a replicable resource, and ideas that are identical to existing ideas or that do not generate enthusiasm themselves are considered to be of low value. Ideas are valuable when they are nurtured by putting effort into them, and it is important to create and sustain a "good state of mind". This can be compared to a "plowed field.

Elements of successful intelligence include maintaining enjoyment and remaining intellectually productive. It is also believed that the nature of intellectual production depends on the presence or absence of problem awareness.

Knowledge productivity is not only human; new approaches exist that take advantage of uncertainty. Knowledge productivity can be improved by improving the way information is organized and analyzed.

A company is a collection of people, and an increase in the value of those people is an increase in the value of the company. Therefore, learning is encouraged.

Nishio's research note "Discomfort-Driven Intellectual Production" is relevant to the process of increasing the value of ideas. Granularity of Information" is helpful as a method for improving the way information is organized and analyzed.

Discomfort-driven intellectual production is problem-aware and aims to improve processes. Without problem awareness, we just trace methods and get the job done. However, in that way of working, you are just selling off your life time and turning it into money. It is important to devise ways to make that time an investment in self, even if you are doing the same work. The goal is to maintain enjoyment and keep intellectual productivity high.

Discomfort-driven intellectual production increases the value of ideas by verbalizing what is not verbalized. Ideas are replicable resources, and ideas that are identical to existing ideas or that do not generate enthusiasm themselves are of low value. Ideas need to be generated according to the situation. Ideas are valuable when they are nurtured and refined with effort. It is important to create and sustain a "state of goodness."

The process of discomfort-driven intellectual production and the process of increasing the value of ideas are closely related through the awareness of the problem and the investment of effort. Discomfort-driven intellectual production is the process of increasing the value of ideas through problem awareness. In order to increase the value of ideas, it is important to put in the effort to resolve discomfort when you feel it.

### Considerations and questions

Nishio's research notes "AI Observation Diary: Discomfort-Driven Intellectual Production" and "BMOT Special Lesson No. 1: Intellectual Production" are helpful in deepening our understanding of discomfort-driven intellectual production. However, the definition of "intellectual production" and how it increases the value of ideas is not yet clear. Also, the importance of creating and sustaining a "good state of mind" has not been presented in concrete ways and means. These points need to be considered more deeply.

Also, the fragment "when to change the front cover of the KJ method (creation process)" does not appear to be directly related to discomfort-driven intellectual production, but may be relevant from the perspective of process improvement and idea value enhancement. This fragment is also worth further consideration.

Question:
1. what exactly is the process of "discomfort-driven intellectual production"?
2. what are the specific ways and means to create and continue the "good state"?
3. how is the fragment "when to change the faceplate of the KJ method (creation process)" related to discomfort-driven intellectual production?

I think it could get better, keep going.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
