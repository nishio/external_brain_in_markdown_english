    - Regarding the scientist's research
    - Research is original only if the problem is original
    - The Paradox of Search" presented by Plato in "[Menon.
        - If you know what you're looking for, the problem doesn't exist.
        - If you don't know what you're looking for, there's no way you can find it.
    - If all cognition is explicit, then we are stuck in this paradox. So if scientific discoveries are made by solving problems, there must be some "thing that can be recognized but not explained in words"!
    - > Tacit knowledge is about implicitly sensing something that will one day be discovered, but for now is hidden.
- Other Expressions
    - > Sense of oneself sensing that one is closing in on a solution.
    - > Belief that there is always something to be discovered
    - > Like the discovery itself, it may end up being an expectation, a delusion, about the discovery. That said, it is futile to search for strictly impersonal criteria to judge its validity.
