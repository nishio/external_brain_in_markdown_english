<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Pascal's Wager is a [[thought experiment]] proposed by the 17th century French philosopher Blaise [[Pascal (Blaise)]]. This idea plays an important role in the debate about the rationality of belief in the existence of God.

Pascal's Wager uses a form of wagering to explain whether it is rational to believe in the existence of God. Pascal argues that, although certainty about God's existence is impossible, the choice to believe in God's existence is nonetheless inevitable.

In this wager, one will choose one of the following options

- Belief in God: If God is real, believing in Him will bring eternal happiness (heaven). If God does not exist, we have little to lose.
- Not believing in God: If God does not exist, there is no benefit from choosing not to believe. However, if God does exist, there is a risk of eternal misery (hell) for not believing.

Pascal concludes that, given these alternatives, belief in God is the most reasonable bet. This is because even if God does not exist, we have little to lose, and if God does exist, we have very much to gain.

This thought experiment has been widely cited in discussions about the rationality of faith and the justification of religious beliefs. However, there are many criticisms of this bet, pointing to a number of problems with it, including the truthfulness and sincerity of religious beliefs, the choice between different religions, and the lack of certainty.
