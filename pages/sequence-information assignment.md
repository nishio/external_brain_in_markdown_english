- export
- Output in Markdown
- I didn't think much of the export function.
    - I'd like to be able to export bullet points to Scrapbox."
    - In order to be able to do that, ordering information must be given
    - You can connect them one by one, but it's tedious.
    - Draw a rough curved arrow
        - Each sticky is mapped to the nearest point
        - That one-dimensional information determines the order.
    - It would be nice to have a view to edit the order
        - Easy to move up and down
            - So-called "outliner-like
    - Groups are indented with the nameplate as the parent
