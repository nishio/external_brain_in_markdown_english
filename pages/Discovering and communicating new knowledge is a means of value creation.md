[Discovery and transfer of new knowledge is a means of value creation. [Knowledge is transformed and passed on to others, creating customer value. And [[the value of knowledge is measured by the real benefits of its use]].

[[Knowledge is stacked in a pyramid]] and [[new knowledge is generated based on existing knowledge]]. However, simply collecting [[concrete knowledge]] is half-hearted and loses value. The goal is to [[obtain meta knowledge through abstraction]].

While the cost of "[[writing knowledge]]" is going down, the time has come when "[[having knowledge]]" and "[[being able to write and publish knowledge]]" are not enough. The ability to communicate in detail [[what you want to do]] and [[what you think is good for you]] is important.

### Deep thoughts and questions

- How should the value of knowledge be measured?
- Are there ways to reduce the burden of updating knowledge?
- What means of abstraction and meta-knowledge acquisition are effective?
- What is the best way not only to publish knowledge, but also to demonstrate it?
- How can I improve my ability to communicate my intentions in detail?

### digest
.

The discovery and transfer of new knowledge is a means of value creation ("knowledge generation and utilization"). Knowledge is transformed and transmitted to others to create customer value ("knowledge transfer" and "monozukuri"). The value of knowledge is also measured by the actual benefits of its use ("tokoroten").

Knowledge is stacked in pyramids, and new knowledge builds on existing knowledge ("propagation of new concepts"). However, simply collecting concrete knowledge is half-hearted and loses value. The goal is to obtain meta knowledge through abstraction ("Hatena2014-10-25", "Nada School Saturday Lecture 2014 Questions").

Updating knowledge is more burdensome than learning new knowledge. This is because it requires negating existing knowledge ("Updating knowledge is more burdensome than learning new knowledge"). By investing in the technology to produce knowledge, knowledge capital is expanded and reproduced ("BMOT Special Lesson #1: Intellectual Production").

While the cost of "writing knowledge" is going down, there comes a time when "having knowledge" and "being able to write and publish knowledge" are not enough ("An Age When Writing Knowledge Is Not Enough"). The ability to communicate in detail what you want to do and what you think is good for you to become is important ("Passing on the Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production to Younger People").
