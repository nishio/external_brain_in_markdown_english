People who are not actively gathering information.
- Often the information that comes to this person is bad information
    - Is it an exaggeration to go so far as to say that
- Do not spread information unless the spread of that information would be beneficial to person X who has the information.
    - Derived from this
        - Information that is spread is not beneficial to the receiver, but information that is beneficial to the sender to spread
        - When you add the "buy and sell" or "zero-sum" factor here, you derive "information spread is bad information".

The original story of "The Shoeshine Boy."
- You can find it by searching.
- An episode, supposedly made up, by Joseph P. Kennedy (father of U.S. President John F. Kennedy).
