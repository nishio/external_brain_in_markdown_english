Scrapbox Link Colors: Differences between "[[Red Links]] / [[Blue Links]]"

The color of links in Scrapbox is not determined by whether the linked page's body is empty or not.
- Even if the body of the linked page is empty, it turns blue if it's connected to another page through other links.

If compared to roads:
- Red Links are [[dead-ends]].
- Blue Links indicate that the road [[continues further]].
- Whether there are buildings beside the road is irrelevant.
    - = Whether the page has body text or not is irrelevant.
