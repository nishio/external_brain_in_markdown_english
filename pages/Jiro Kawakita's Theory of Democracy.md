Through his writings and activities, Kawakita has been calling for the realization of a "[[participatory society]]". When he launched the experimental educational movement "[[Mobile University]]", his catchphrase was "### Create a participatory society
" and he urged citizen participation as a way to improve the quality of civilization. This demonstrates the belief that in order for democracy to take root in every corner of society, a "[[culture of participation]]" in which every citizen is actively involved is necessary.

As a specific method of citizen participation, Kawakita utilized the ### [[KJ method]]
 (also known as the Jiro Kawakita method of thinking) that he had devised himself. For example, to hear the "true voices of citizens" on an issue, he carefully interviews as many different people as possible (workers, students, farmers, housewives, etc.) and collects their opinions by writing them on cards. The collected information is then structured and illustrated using the KJ method, which is then used to interview the next person, and so on, until there is almost no new information left after the seventh or eighth person is thoroughly interviewed. The needs of the citizens thus organized into ### hundreds of cards (labels)
 are further categorized and analyzed, and presented to the citizens, who are asked to mark the points with which they agree, thus enabling a more accurate understanding of public opinion than is possible by tabulating questionnaires. This process is an attempt to scientifically support consensus building through citizen participation by combining qualitative dialogue and quantitative consensus confirmation.

Kawakita himself was involved in various "* citizen participation movements," and based on his experiences, he wrote an essay entitled "[[Prospects for the Participation Movement I was Involved in]]" (Regional Development, Vol. 51, No. 6, 1976). In it, he discusses the challenges and prospects in the transition period from administrative initiative to citizen initiative, and it can be seen that Kawakita was an early advocate of the importance of residents' movements and citizen participation in Japanese democracy. His arguments echoed those of his contemporary, such as Arnstein's "[[ladder of participation]]" theory, which emphasized the need for [*[[grassroots democracy]]] ([[bottom-up decision-making]]).

Kawakita also focuses on ### "[[tradition]]"
 and ### "[[creativity]]"
 as the foundation of a society that supports democracy. In his book "Creation and Tradition: The Search for the Deepest Human Nature and the Roots of Democracy" (1993), he discussed the nature of the individual and the group from multiple perspectives, and argued that the healthy exercise of the deepest aspects of humanity (creativity and cultural traditions) supports the foundation of democracy ([[Creation and Tradition]]). Thus, Jiro Kawakita saw democracy not as a mere political system, but as a ### comprehensive system of participation
 linked to human creativity and culture.

# Implications and Implications for Political Institutions
.
Jiro Kawakita's ideas have influenced the design and operation of Japan's political institutions and governance. The influence is particularly evident in the areas of local government and urban planning.

The ### KJ method (Idea Generation Method)
, which he advocated, is not only a method for generating ideas, but also a tool for organizing and visualizing citizens' awareness in consensus building and planning ([[Genealogy of Citizen Participation in Public Architecture]]). Architecture]). Kawakita's KJ method has been useful since its early days, and was utilized in the consensus building process of urban planning and public architecture as a method to organize and visualize the opinions and values of many participants in a step-by-step manner. For example, the KJ method workshop, in which residents' ideas are written on sticky notes and cards and grouped together, became a standard method in community planning with the participation of residents, and played a role in enhancing the quality of dialogue between the government and citizens ([[way of thinking: for creativity development / by Jiro Kawakita | Books by Urban Research Institute Spacia https:// www.spacia.co.jp/Mati/tosyo/hasoho.htm]], [[way of thinking]]).

Thus, Kawakita's conception method and ### participation-oriented philosophy
 provided practical tools and frameworks for Japan's democratic policy-making process and contributed to the ### institutionalization of political participation
. Not only in administrative planning, but also in corporate organizational development and project management, KJ-legal methods have been applied to consolidate opinions and solve problems that transcend the boundaries between upper and lower levels.

Kawakita also proposed the concept of ### "[[party studies]]"
 in his theory of organizations, exploring the nature of creative groups (included in his Collected Works, Volume 7, "Organizational Development: Party Studies...Toward a Participatory Society"). The "[[party]]" here refers not to a political party but to ### [[a group that gathers for a purpose]]
, and is a theory of [[internal organizational democracy]] and the exercise of creativity. Kawakita was also interested in ### [[democracy within organizations]]
 and advocated the creation of organizations that solve problems with the participation of all members, rather than relying only on hierarchical relationships (so to speak [[democracy within organizations]]) ([CiNii Library - Organization Development Theory : Party Studies The Origin of Creativity Creativity and Organization Development In Search of Participatory Society [https://ci.nii.ac.jp/ncid/BN15128706#:~:text=,%E7%A7%81%E3%81%AE%E9%96%A2%E3%82%8F%E3%81%A3%E3%81%9F%E5%8F%82%E7%94%BB%E9%81%8B%E5](https://ci.nii.ac.jp/ncid/BN15128706#:~:text=,%E7%A7%81%E3%81%AE%E9%96%A2%E3%82%8F%E3%81%A3%E3%81%9F%E5%8F%82%E7%94%BB%E9%81%8B%E5) %8B%95%E3%81%AE%E5%B1%95%E6%9C%9B]). This idea has also been used in subsequent organizational development and [[team building]] theory.

Kawakita's fieldwork approach was also applied to regional development in developing countries. He conducted research in Nepal from the 1950s and pioneered "participatory research," in which rural Nepalese residents themselves investigate problems and devise solutions. For example, he worked with residents of mountain villages to devise measures to secure safe water supply and a simple ropeway to transport goods, leading to the improvement of local livelihoods. For these achievements, he was awarded the ### [[Magsaysay Prize]]
 (also known as the Asian Nobel Prize) in 1984 ([Jiro Kawakita - Wikipedia [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B7%9D%E5%96%9C%E7%94%B0%E4%BA](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B7%9D%E5%96%9C%E7%94%B0%E4%BA) %8C%E9%83%8E#:~:text=]), Kawakita's philosophy of "problem solving through public participation" was highly acclaimed internationally. In the context of political institutions, this is a model case of decentralized decision-making and citizen autonomy, and it was a precursor to the ### participatory development
 and ### resident-centered governance
 that would later be emphasized in many other countries.

In general, Jiro Kawakita's ideas ### "design of participation"
 pulsate through contemporary political systems. The processes and methods advocated by Kawakita offered concrete suggestions on the issue of how to utilize citizens' voices in parliamentary democracy and administrative procedures. For example, in recent years, there has been an increase in ### [[deliberative democracy]]
 ([[deliberative democracy]]) attempts in Japan, and Kawakita's opinion aggregation process is sometimes referred to in these discussions. His philosophy has continued to influence the institutional design and procedures for realizing his vision of democracy as "[[a]] politics in which each and every individual participates and creates.

# Influence and evaluation of Jiro Kawakita's thought
.
Jiro Kawakita's theory of democracy was initially viewed as heretical in some respects due to its originality, but in the long term it has had a multifaceted impact and has been passed on in a variety of theories and practices.

[In the field of ### [[citizen participation and collaboration]]
, Kawakita's legacy of the concept of "participatory society" and methods [[KJ method]] served as a foundation for later research and practice. For example, the various ### [[workshop]] methods
 that have become popular in Japan since the 1990s were inspired by Kawakita's methods and refined. Workshop designers [[Tamio Nakano]] and [[Isamu Kinoshita]] have systematized the methodology of citizen participation in their books "[[Workshop]]: A New Place for Learning and Creation" (Iwanami Shinsho, 2001) and "[[Workshop]]: Methodology for Resident-Oriented City Planning" (Gakugeishuppansha, 2007), respectively, In the book, he systematized the methodology of citizen participation, referring to Kawakita's achievements. In other words, the path of citizen participation pioneered by Kawakita has been inherited and developed by subsequent researchers and practitioners, and theorized in the fields of [[public policy]] and [[community design]].

Kawakita's approach is also highly regarded in ### pedagogical and anthropological theories
. The ### Mobile University
, which combines cultural anthropological fieldwork and education, has had an impact on Japanese sociologists of education and educational practitioners. In recent years, ### "[[learning community]]"
 and ### [[inquiry-based learning]]
 have become keywords in the world of education, and Kawakita's ideas were the forerunners of these concepts. There is a trend among contemporary researchers to look back on Kawakita's attempts to "create a place for learning outside the system" (e.g., the ### [[Traveling University]]
 project led by working people), and to reexamine and carry on his ideas.

The importance of ### [[whole-person education]]
 and ### [[interactive learning]]
 advocated by Kawakita is increasingly highlighted today, and is sometimes cited as a suggestion for a curriculum that fosters [[critical thinking]] and [[collaborative skills]], which are necessary skills for a democratic society.

Internationally, Kawakita's "[[Participatory Rural Appraisal]]" method was highly regarded, as mentioned above, and was also a common approach to participatory methods such as ### [[Participatory Rural Appraisal]] (PRA)
 and ### [[Participatory Learning and Action]]
 that were later advocated. The idea was to help people in the development field in Asian countries to understand the importance of the local people's participation. Kawakita is regarded as a pioneer of this approach, which has much in common with the methodology practiced by Kawakita in the development field in Asian countries, where experts collaborate with residents to solve problems. One researcher who was influenced by this trend is Ryuzo Takayama, a regional development theorist, who analyzed Kawakita's views on space and society in his article, "[[The Path to a Participatory Society]].

In addition, studies that discuss Kawakita's work from the perspective of deepening democracy can be found in Japanese civil society theory, and his name is sometimes cited in ### Democratic Considerations of Contemporary Japanese Society
.

In sum, Jiro Kawakita developed an original philosophy that organically links democracy, civic participation, political systems, and education, which has had a broad impact on practice and scholarship in Japan. He is highly regarded for his foresight in explaining the importance of civic participation and showing concrete methods, in bringing the perspective of creativity to the democratic management of organizations and society, and in his attempt to reform education and foster the foundations of a democratic society. His arguments are still fresh today, and his vision of democracy as "a creative community based on participation and dialogue" continues to inspire many people and theories.
