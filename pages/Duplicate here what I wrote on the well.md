title: "Duplicate here what I wrote on the well"

I think it would be better to duplicate what you wrote on the well ([/villagepump](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump)) here
- Various ways to connect multiple projects are being explored, but they are not officially supported.
- I hope it's easy to do.

I wonder if what you write on the date page is the equivalent of a "thought node" for this project here.
- There may also be a "development diary" equivalent in the mix.
- Like this [[Wellhead 2022-01-17]].
    - Don't break the icon.
    - Would it be nice to have a user script that inserts and copies the project name into the icon notation?
    - Tsukkaked [[ToMyProj]].
