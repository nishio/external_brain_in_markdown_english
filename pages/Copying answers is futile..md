- Copying [[answer]] is [[useless]] because the question is different.
- Learn [[manner of solving]] and apply it to [[New Issue]] #Abstract

How do you learn how to solve it?
- Solve lots of problems
    - However, if the "problem" is a "managerial issue," the authority to "solve" = "decide resource allocation" is not given.
    - To gain authority, one needs to acquire high competence, but to acquire competence one needs authority for experience
        - [[Chicken and Eggs]]
- Observe many problems and their solutions as the next best thing.
    - This has [[parallel work]] enabled.
    - This is also the purpose of [[case study]] in [[MBA]]/[[MOT]], etc.

- When you say [[knowledge exchange]] between organizations, some people are concerned about [[NDAs]] or [[trade secrets]].
    - When we talk about the benefits of knowledge exchange, we are not imagining such raw information, but rather abstracted "[[(key to) solution]]" knowledge.
    - We are not advocating violating NDAs or leaking trade secrets in the first place, and such actions should still be tried as illegal acts.

- [[knowledge transfer]]

    - [[ability to abstract]]
    - It would be good if I could abstract my problem and discuss it with you.

    - > One of the reasons why having high abstraction skills helps you do your job much better is that you can avoid [[NDAs]] and ask people for advice by explaining your problem in different words....
    - > If you have poor abstraction skills, you will die if you follow the NDA to the letter and can't discuss it with anyone.
        - [[Increased abstraction capabilities will help avoid NDAs]].
        - [[abstract and distribute]].

- > [@shiology](https://twitter.com/shiology/status/1005276465892429824?s=20): As we say in class, [[legal thinking]] is [[going back and forth between concrete and abstract]]. Since [[three-stage legal argument]] is a combination of concretization and abstraction, the core of education in law schools and law faculties is to train the ability of concretization and abstraction through repeated training of legal three-stage argumentation.

> [@tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1688907776339431424?s=20): a long time ago, I wrote about how having good abstraction skills allows you to follow your NDA and talk to people,
> I wrote a book about how ChatGPT is a great match for this.
> Tweeting a monstrous document rarely often becomes a book n years later.
