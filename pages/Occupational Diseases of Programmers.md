- Since [[a flesh-and-blood person]] is moving considerably more ambiguously than a machine, it is needlessly burdensome to try to treat it in the same way as you would treat a machine. You should [[treat someone ambiguously]] without exerting effort against something that is moving ambiguously.

> I think I understand why I am not very good at documents, because I was wondering whether the date should be the day I wrote the document, the day I submitted it, or the day I was told to submit it on. In programming, it is rare for something to "work even though it is slightly different," and even if it does work, there is a notion that writing code that "just happens to work" is a bad thing. So, even in writing documentation, we often think, "What's the right way to write it?" In reality, however, it is an operation that says, "As long as it is approximately correct, it is OK," so no matter where you look, you will not find the correct way to write it, or you will find multiple ways to write it and be confused as to which way is correct.
