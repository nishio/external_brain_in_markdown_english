title: "hybridization"
---

    - Inverse pattern of [undifferentiated
- What used to be separate, over time, has come to combine characteristics of both.

Example
    - [[Flow/stock is a false dichotomy]]
    - Now characterized by both flow and stock
    - [[Draft addition to "The Difference Between Named Type Systems and Structural Type Systems"]]
    - Nomenclatural and structural type systems are no longer in opposition to each other.
    - [[pass by reference]]
        - [[cross-valued]] and [[call by reference (computer)]] are now "pass-by-reference".
            - [[The two options are misinterpreted as opposing concepts.]]

- A simple inversion of "[[undifferentiated]]" would be on the diagram, but the two things were not in conflict, were they?
- As shown in the lower part of the figure, for the state with no features (white circle), the two states with feature A and with feature B are juxtaposed to the state with both A and B
