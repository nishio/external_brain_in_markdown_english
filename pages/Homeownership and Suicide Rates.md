[Homeownership and Suicide Rates
I had GPT4 do some research on [[aging]] and this is what they came up with.
I think that interpretation may be going a bit too far, but I thought I'd record it once and for all instead of filtering it through human prejudice.

- As of 2021, the population of Japan aged 65 and over was about 35 million, accounting for about 28.9% of the total population. This ratio is expected to rise to about 33.3% by 2024, when one out of every three persons will be 65 years of age or older. The number of elderly people is expected to peak at about 39.35 million in 2024, after which it is expected to decline (Cabinet Office website).

- The majority (over 80%) of those aged 65 and older live in owner-occupied houses, and the number of suicides among this age group is increasing (Cabinet Office website).

- The population aged 15 to 64 (working-age population) has been on a downward trend, and in 2021 it was 74.5 million, or 59.4% of the total population. In the future, the ratio of the working-age population to the population aged 65 and over will further decline, and by 2065, 1.3 persons of the working-age population will support one elderly person (Cabinet Office website).

- These statistics show that the economic burdens and social roles between the young and the elderly are affected and can be a source of intergenerational dissatisfaction. To address the aging of society as a whole, efforts are being made to build a sustainable social security system and to strengthen the social security system for all generations. Much more detailed data can be found on the website of the Statistical Bureau of Japan (Statistical Bureau of Japan).

I've seen the data, but it's crude, causation is unclear, and the number of suicides, not the suicide rate, is not good.
We should at least verify if there is a significant difference in suicide rates between owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied cases.

Probably because I was reading this right before.

This is thought to be influenced by changes in social security and the introduction of long-term care insurance. Increasing contact with the elderly and deepening mutual understanding may be the key to solving this intergenerational issue (JSTAGE).
    - > The following is a report on the results of a survey of the attitudes of 20-year-olds before and after the introduction of long-term care insurance. The 1977 survey was a questionnaire survey, and the 2012 survey was conducted using an Internet Google survey with the same questions as those in 1977. RESULTS: Analysis of the 1977 and 2012 responses showed significant differences in awareness of [[special nursing homes]] (p<0.01), attitudes toward their use (p<0.01), and whether the elderly are a social problem (p<0.05), as indicated. Before the long-term care insurance, the adolescents had a high awareness of the importance of family support for elderly parents, and were less aware of and less willing to use special nursing homes for the elderly, and thus had a higher awareness that the elderly would become a social problem.

            - >  "Do you feel that the elderly (geriatric issues) are a problem close to your heart? 11 out of 20 respondents (55%) answered "yes" in 1997, which was significantly different from the 22 respondents (84.6%) who answered "yes" in 2012 (p<0.05).
            - To describe this as "old people becoming a social problem" is a bit of a stretch.
