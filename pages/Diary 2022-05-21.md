Let's take it easy today.

- A: KJ method study group exchanges.
- B: Consider introducing [[pin-diary-X]] to this project
- C: Consider Scrapbox backups for other projects
- D: Porting past articles written for shared projects here
- E: Create a landing page for people new to this Scrapbox.

C to E are ambiguous and huge tasks

[/villagepump/mystery of declining well pages](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/mystery of declining well pages).
- Get backup of villagepump
- I went so far as to check the difference.
- I'm relieved to know that what I wrote doesn't seem to have been erased.
    - But that doesn't change the point that anything you write in a collaborative project can be erased at any time, so you should back it up yourself if you don't want it to be erased.

B: Consider introducing [[pin-diary-X]] to this project
- I didn't customize the template, but I got it to work.
- I customized the template to work.

- Ask for an hour who is the one who got sick due to lack of sleep...don't...just go to sleep (4:20).
- I got plenty of sleep (but I'm told it's not enough).

    - Oh, but I slept for two hours in the evening when I forgot to put my Apple Watch on, so I guess that adds up.
- [[Pikmin Bloom]], it's a 10,000 steps walking day and it's raining!
    - I heard it was sunny in the morning (my wife was cleared).
- Find out how to install [pin-diary-6
- I figured out the bundled scripts, but I didn't know what to do if I wanted to change the makeDiary or change the target project.
    - What is [[scrapbox-bundler.vercel.app]]...
    - This or [[scrapbox-bundler]].
    - I wonder if I can copy [[pin-diary-6/template]] and [[pin-diary-6]] to my project, rewrite them, and then bundle them.
- Looks like a bundle is ready.
    - I looked at the list of files you're reading and confirmed that it's not a villagepump, but an import from takker99/scrapbox-userscript-std or something like that.
- Now I just need to change the format to my liking...
- No `ReferenceError: lightFormat is not defined`.
    - Ah, you've bundled the deps and template implementation into one when you move it.

    - I was able to do it!
        - 🎉<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/Mijinko_SD/icon' alt='/villagepump/Mijinko_SD.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Thanks for your time!<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/Mijinko_SD/icon' alt='/villagepump/Mijinko_SD.icon' height="19.5"/>
- If we had a bundler that would cache the bundle results for 10 years or so until we explicitly refreshed them, we wouldn't have to put the bundled code in Scrapbox!
- It stopped raining, so I'm going [[vibram walking]].
    - I also want a medal for [[Pikmin Bloom]].
    - Let's walk far away and fill the neighborhood with [[Fog of the World]] just in case it rains again.

    - It looked to me like he was saying, "That way.

    - ( ・3・)ツ🍵
    - 30x3
- I'm sleepy after dinner.
- When I was writing the introduction to pin-diary, I was thinking that if you import script Y in X from UserScript in an unlocked collaborative editing project X, there is a possibility that malicious code could be put in Y, so even if you cut out the template part, putting it in X is dangerous.
    - Well, in this case, the problem is the "unlocked" part.
- [/nishio/pin-diary-X](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/pin-diary-X)I wrote an introduction memo.
    - I'm not sure what you mean by the deps being split into separate files.
    - If there is a plan to change the template in the future, I thought it would be easier to use launch as the entry point of the bundle and inject the template written in JS for trial-and-error.
