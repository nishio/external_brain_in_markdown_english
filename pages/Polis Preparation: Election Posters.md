# ver. 3.0
You are preparing for a productive deliberation. a is the opinion that has come up so far. a is a list of short statements that people can agree or disagree with. B is additional unorganized commentary on this opinion; extract opinions from B that do not overlap with A to form a short list of opinions that people can express for or against.

A
There should be restrictions on the content of election posters.
Police intervention in the removal of election posters is a threat to democracy.
Obscene election posters are within the scope of freedom of expression.
Selling election poster slots as advertising should be regulated.
The deposit system is necessary to protect democracy.
Odd campaign posters are a legitimate strategy to attract voters' attention.
Election posters that cannot be shown to children should not be displayed in public places.
Regulation of election posters infringes on candidates' freedom of expression.
Mass media should increase election coverage.
Regulation of election posters runs the risk of arbitrary operation.
Running insane candidates is also important for democracy.
The regulation of election posters should be clearly defined by law.
Radical posters are a sign of the health of democracy.
Police intervention is more problematic than the content of the election posters.
Any attempt to use the electoral system for personal gain should be regulated.
There should be restrictions on sexual expression in the content of election posters.
The police should provide a voluntary service to pre-check the legality of election posters.
Only candidates themselves should be allowed to issue election posters.
Election posters should always include the candidate's name and claims about the election.
Election posters should be abolished and replaced with other means of election publicity.
Election posters should be subject to the same laws and regulations as general advertising.
The purpose of election posters should be to provide information rather than freedom of expression.
A distinction should be made and regulated between pornographic expression and artistic nudity.
The method of placing election posters should be standardized and barriers to new entrants should be lowered.
As a consideration for those who "don't want to see it," the display of sexually explicit election posters should be restricted.

B
This series of discussions on election posters should be seen as an opportunity to revise the Public Offices Election Law.
If the expression is rooted in the candidate's identity, it should not be restricted
To begin with, the current election poster system is out of step with the times. It is too much to the disadvantage of candidates who lack financial and organizational strength. We need to think about a way of doing election bulletins that is more in tune with the times.
"Election posters should always include the candidate's name and a statement about the election." The answer to the question "is it about laws and regulations or ethics?" depends on whether you are talking about laws and regulations or ethics.
Obscene posters have the effect of rather driving some of the viewers away from the billboards, which in itself is an obstruction to free electioneering.
I think it's okay to create (insane) candidates the first time around, as long as they are re-elected until they get more than a majority of the votes.
All election posters should be restricted for those who do not want to see them.
Displaying posters interspersed with other election posters, which significantly increase the number of people who do not want them in view, is also an infringement on the freedom of expression of other candidates to promote their policies.
For the police to make any kind of judgment about the content of an election poster is prior censorship.

The discussion on election posters should be seen as an opportunity to revise the Public Offices Election Law.
Expression rooted in a candidate's identity should not be restricted.
The current election poster system is disadvantageous to candidates with limited financial and organizational resources, and a method of election bulletins that is appropriate for the times should be considered.
Obscene posters have the effect of keeping voters away from the board and interfering with free electioneering.
A system of re-election should be introduced until a majority of the votes is obtained.
In order to protect the freedom of expression of other candidates, we should restrict the display of posters that will noticeably increase the number of people who do not want to see them in view.
Police making judgments about the content of election posters constitutes prior censorship.

Human Judgement<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- > "Election posters should always include the candidate's name and a statement about the election." is a different answer depending on whether we're talking about laws and regulations or ethics.
    - This is discarded as an expression that is not possible to agree or disagree with.
    - Let's work with humans.
    - The law should clearly state, "Election posters must include the name of the candidate and his or her claims about the election."

You are preparing for a productive deliberative discussion; A is what you are discussing; B is an additional argument to it; with reference to B, make a short list of statements that people can express their opinions in favor or against that should be added to A.

A
- There should be restrictions on the content of election posters.
- Police intervention in the removal of election posters is a threat to democracy.
- Obscene election posters are within the scope of freedom of expression.
- Selling election poster slots as advertising should be regulated.
- The deposit system is necessary to protect democracy.
- Odd campaign posters are a legitimate strategy to attract voters' attention.
- Election posters that cannot be shown to children should not be displayed in public places.
- Regulation of election posters infringes on candidates' freedom of expression.
- Mass media should increase election coverage.
- Regulation of election posters runs the risk of arbitrary operation.
- Running insane candidates is also important for democracy.
- The regulation of election posters should be clearly defined by law.
- Radical posters are a sign of the health of democracy.
- Police intervention is more problematic than the content of the election posters.
- Any attempt to use the electoral system for personal gain should be regulated.

B
Not only election posters, but also sexually explicit postings should be discussed keeping in mind that there are people, including adults as well as children, who do not want to see them.
In Taiwan and Scandinavia, I think I have seen fewer sexually oriented posters, but I think they are concerned about the way people are sexualized, their own choices, and people's comfort. Election posters should be free by nature, but I recommend using the police to check in advance if it is an expression that breaks the law. However, the use of the police is voluntary. Election posters should be issued by the candidates themselves. The use of election posters as a means of advertising by anyone other than the candidate himself/herself is prohibited. The restrictions should be that the candidate's name must appear on the poster and that the poster should be his or her own statement for the election in question. We believe that the significance of posters is becoming less significant in the first place, and that abolishing them is a better idea. Even election posters should be subject to other legal systems In the first place, what is required of election posters is not expression Pornography and nudity are different. The problem this time is the former. Rather than increasing the number of prohibited items, election posters should have more restrictive conditions in the first place. Posters are a barrier to new entrants, so they should be posted with the posters attached from the beginning.


Below is a short list of statements that people can express their agreement or disagreement with, based on A and B:

There should be restrictions on sexual expression in the content of election posters.
The police should provide a voluntary service to pre-check the legality of election posters.
Only candidates themselves should be allowed to issue election posters.
Election posters should always include the candidate's name and claims about the election.
Election posters should be abolished and replaced with other means of election publicity.
Election posters should be subject to the same laws and regulations as general advertising.
The purpose of election posters should be to provide information rather than freedom of expression.
A distinction should be made and regulated between pornographic expression and artistic nudity.
The method of placing election posters should be standardized and barriers to new entrants should be lowered.
As a consideration for those who "don't want to see it," the display of sexually explicit election posters should be restricted.

These short statements allow you to express your opinion from a variety of perspectives. To further the discussion, you can express your opinion in favor of or against these statements.

> [osaka_seventeen](https://x.com/osaka_seventeen/status/1804337463172960376) Whether an obnoxious candidate runs for office, whether naked posters are put up, whether an idiotic candidate runs for office, whether 100,000 people exercise their right to non-election at the same time. Democracy does not regress, but every time you add some restrictions to it, little by little you increase the means to abuse democracy and move towards dictatorship.

> [shirai_satoshi](https://x.com/shirai_satoshi/status/1804342735236907341) There have been many comments about the strange posters in the Tokyo gubernatorial election, saying that it is a destruction of democracy. In the first place, for the past 10 years or so, the major media outlets have clearly reduced their coverage of the election during the election period, the voter turnout is only 50% or so in national elections, and people are marginalized for having "strong ideologies" when discussing politics,


> [tadashi_ohta](https://x.com/tadashi_ohta/status/1804079500616954281) When I posted about the issue of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly election posters, "Japan has been born with people who consume and eat up the fruits of democracy without hesitation," I received many comments in agreement. I received many comments in agreement, but as expected, there were also many condemnations. One that stood out was "the subject is too big," but this is a problem that needs to be said with a big subject.

> [kikumaco](https://x.com/kikumaco/status/1804106363183783999) The nude poster in question, "good or bad", is obviously bad, but the police intervention in the election during the election is far worse than that. This is a major incident that shakes the very foundation of democracy.
>  I hope you understand that.

> [kikumaco](https://x.com/kikumaco/status/1804001622626046116) I am surprised that not a few people endorse police intervention in election posters. It's election interference by police power. It is a major incident that goes to the very foundation of democracy.

> [EzoeRyou](https://x.com/EzoeRyou/status/1803811448084160762) Democracy doesn't break down just because a curious poster is displayed for a few weeks, but it breaks down when it becomes harder to run for office.
>  >osaka_seventeen: While there is certainly a hack way of saying "it's cheap publicity considering that if you pay a deposit of 3 million you have a chance of being featured on national TV," I think it is important for democracy that bubbly candidates with strange and bizarre opinions can also run for office. The electorate should be solemnly elected.

> [kikumaco](https://x.com/kikumaco/status/1804064734255206538) I don't see a problem with rather strict regulations on campaign posters.
>  No person other than the candidate should be included, or the name of the candidate should be written in more than a few points. The name of the political party should be written in at least how many points.
>
>  Just don't put restrictions on the political claims you write. Because that is at the heart of democracy.

> [kikumaco](https://x.com/kikumaco/status/1804058984967737462) So you have to decide in advance what to do if a photo deemed obscene is used on an election poster.
>
>  Posting a poster and then issuing a warning for possible violation of the Nuisance Prevention Ordinance is an improper intervention in an election by the police.
>
>  To protect democracy, we should be free within predetermined rules

> [mcranagalle](https://x.com/mcranagalle/status/1803940957118959812) If you go to a campaign poster with a warning for violating the ordinance, but you get a free pass for pre-campaigning, you're ultimately deciding whether to go or not based on the strength of your opponent.
>  If the other party is a big group and has lots of lawyers, there is no blame.
>
>  Is the future of democracy really going to the dark side?

> [ito_yusaku](https://x.com/ito_yusaku/status/1803713820227158430) According to the principle of democracy, election posters should not be peeled off even if their contents violate the crime of indecent display. The 3 million yen deposit is intended to prevent this kind of thing, but there is nothing that can be done if this is breached.

> [awesomenewways](https://x.com/awesomenewways/status/1804309569696600383) I think this should be thoroughly enforced as a democratic or public principle. If I find something offensive at first impression, I would like you to protect the expression, the person or the group. If you think the poster is gross, you should take its side, and if you think it is a terrible poster, you should make sure it is not removed.

> [shinmegane1974](https://x.com/shinmegane1974/status/1804201736120439033) It is the foundation of democracy that anyone can run for office, no matter how terrible the poster, no matter how terrible the claims, no matter how frothy the candidate, and claim their own theory ...
>  However, not you, the N-party, who abused the legal system to generate profits.



> [hage_255](https://x.com/hage_255/status/1803949945290207420) Yusuke Kawai, the candidate who put up malicious obscene posters on the bulletin board of the Tokyo gubernatorial election, seems to be in bed with a semi-nuisance YouTuber who has been arrested many times.
>
>  It's still not very good.
>  ![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQjq12jbUAA7uU9?format=jpg&name=900x900#.png) ![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQjq12FakAAf15y?format=jpg&name=900x900#.png)

> [zackys](https://x.com/zackys/status/1804389173648068803) The obscene poster candidate who made the Tokyo gubernatorial election a playground was not that nude woman, but Kawai, who harassed and earned impressions from the women's protection group Colabo.
>
>  Have you found out who these people are who are interfering with Colabo's activities?

> [gorogor71105327](https://x.com/gorogor71105327/status/1804115309529567267) As expected from N... Senator Kana Shindo.
>
>  I checked the picture I took this morning that number 23 is more offensive to Japanese children than the M-shaped legs, and it refers to Renho.
>
>  Because it's funny when you compare a significantly obscene poster with a simple mug shot!
>
>  I was in the middle of writing this and tried to post it, but it was deleted and I couldn't post it, so I scrubbed it.
>  ![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQmBTjzasAAoSU1?format=jpg&name=900x900#.png) ![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQmBTj3akAMDcha?format=jpg&name=900x900#.png) ![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQmBTj1akAIooPB?format=jpg&name=900x900#.png) ![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQmBTj1akAAZjQT?format=jpg&name=900x900#.png)

> [succeed1224](https://x.com/succeed1224/status/1803714425834365179) The definition of "obscene material" is vague, so I can't immediately judge its illegality, but to me at least, this looks like displaying obscene material, and I don't want my child to see it because I think it is a vulgar act that doesn't fit the TPO of an election poster. I don't want my child to see it because I think it is indecent and not in accordance with the TPO of an election poster. I admit that there is a sense of guilt, but I still think it is against public order and morals.
>  >sakuratsukisima: It's been modified to a level where it's safe for children to view and it's legal.
>
>  The only reason I think they should not be shown is because I myself look at women's nudity with a guilty conscience.
>
>  I can't shame my kids because if I see them, I'm going to get my dick wet.
>  If you're saying "up", well, I understand.
>
>  I told him that kids ain't gonna think nothing of it when they see it. x.com/hirox246/statu...


> [KyokoKuroda](https://x.com/KyokoKuroda/status/1803790877070102562) The election for Governor of Tokyo has begun.
>  but what the heck? I've never seen an election billboard like this before. In addition, obscene posters are said to have been put up. Bulletin boards are often set up in elementary schools and other places.
>  Aren't you ashamed of yourself as an adult? I feel like it's the end of the world already. We must calmly judge the governor of Tokyo.
>  ![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQhaPddb0AAdUix?format=jpg&name=medium#.png)

> [_____zoe_____](https://x.com/_____zoe_____/status/1803747632608911410) At least the poster in question is not "obscene" under the current law, since it has some modification to the local area (but that doesn't mean it's okay to do it). (But that doesn't mean it's okay to do it.)
>  >ogino_otaku: I understand that you find this offensive and don't want your children to see it, but I think it is difficult to say whether it immediately constitutes indecent display under Article 175 of the Penal Code. I'm not sure if it is a violation of any law or regulation.
>  I feel like we are testing the strength of our democracy, including whether we vote for or elect candidates who put up posters like this. x.com/chantichanti22...


> [kikumaco](https://x.com/kikumaco/status/1804060291388576150) Whether it is obscene or not is related to Article 175 of the Penal Code, but it is dangerous to apply it to elections because it can be arbitrarily applied by the police.
>  If you are going to ban them on election posters, I think you have to make sure that the Public Offices Election Law is properly set up so that they cannot operate arbitrarily.

> [kikumaco](https://x.com/kikumaco/status/1804551361411076141) That poster is not obscene to begin with, where did you judge "obscene"?

> [ojimakohei](https://x.com/ojimakohei/status/1803792279410536894) In this case, it appears that the Metropolitan Police Department has called the candidate in question and issued a "warning" on suspicion of violating the Nuisance Prevention Ordinance. If the multiple locations where obscene posters were confirmed to be displayed are not dealt with promptly, there is a possibility that the candidate may be arrested. Elections, the foundation of democracy, should not be something that cannot be shown to children. Good thing it was taken care of in a hurry.

> [st_memoRYes](https://x.com/st_memoRYes/status/1804122415221407869) Ikebukuro East Exit. The NHK party's slot is advertised by a person who seems to be a distributor. The person who runs for office in order to use the election poster as an advertising space is the one who buys the space, but the person who buys the space is also the one who buys the poster.

> [kino_gala](https://x.com/kino_gala/status/1803986394052001942) obscenity, dating sites, scam criminals, hate, etc.
>  I wondered why there were so many election posters this time, were they advertising space?
>  Currently, the election board can't regulate it, but I think it's a bad idea to take this opportunity to think about it.
>
>  I have never felt more grateful for the right to vote than I did in this gubernatorial election.
>  This right must be exercised.
>  >[kamo_kamos](https://x.com/kamo_kamos/status/1803203801706537168) Tokyo gubernatorial election. There are so many candidates of NHK party, but they don't put their pictures on the column where election posters are put up, it seems they are doing it for business to sell it as an advertising space.

>  I doubt the morals of both these parties and those who advertise.
