title: "Is the viewpoint the camera position or the center of the field of view?"
---

I was aware that "[[point of view]] = [[viewpoint]] = [[Camera position]]", but I learned that some people are aware that "viewpoint = [[Center of View]], [[standpoint]] = camera position".

> The word "viewpoint" is usually used in two different senses: one is the [[standpoint]] from which one is looking at an object, and the other is the [[viewpoint]] from which one is looking. In this article, the former is used in principle.
- [Perspective - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%A6%96%E7%82%B9)
- The phrases "from where" and "where" are soft and nice.

- > The position from which something is observed or considered; an angle, outlook or point of view.
    - [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/viewpoint](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/viewpoint)
- > viewpoint (on something): a way of thinking about a subject
- > a direction or place from which you look at something
    - [https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/viewpoint](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/viewpoint)
- English viewpoint seems to only mean "from where".

The thought of distinguishing "from where" and "where to" seems useful, but it makes no sense to use a word that is used for both "from where" and "where to" as a word to describe the "from where" side of it.
