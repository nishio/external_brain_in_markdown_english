preorder
- [[semi-sequential (e.g. equations)]] minus [antisymmetric law

> Usually, economics and game theory assume that preferences are pre-ordered - [Game Theory [[3rd ed.]]].
The relation a=b, in which the elements a and b are identical, and the similarly preferred relation a~b are different, and the former is derived a posteriori from the relation given and the latter is pre-ordered
- The two relationships do not necessarily coincide, allowing for non-incidence is pre-sequence, and requiring coincidence is [[semi-sequential (e.g., equations)]].
- It is easy to forget that there are two different relationships and confuse them because they are often represented by the same symbol when they match
