title: "Annexation of Scrapbox projects"
---

Project merged in [[Scrapbox]] [[case]] 2018-10-29

- I created a project to compile information about Oculus Go [/oculus-go](https://scrapbox.io/oculus-go) 2018-06-01
- But no one wrote in, even though I published the edit link.
- I wrote down everything I thought about as I was working on my [[KJ method in VR]] project on Oculus Go.
- Maybe that's part of the reason it was so hard to write (all the general info on Oculus-go has sunk far below).
- We decided to annex it because there would no longer be a need to separate it from this project.

- Export this project with meta information just in case

- Then export the project over there in the same way and import it here

- You are warned that the two pages will be overwritten, so edit the title on this page.
- Import JSON from the other project into this project
    - Looks like the pin is off.
- Restore the page that I renamed the project here.
    - Because nishio's pin came off, I had to unpin all the other pages to pin the first one, tedious!
