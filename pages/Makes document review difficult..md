Makes document review difficult.
> [hiro5550](https://x.com/hiro5550/status/1886832576117264538) Deep Research premise is that it is very hard to evaluate a person's character in a pre essay assignment, and interviews are going to become more important in person, and dependence on the ability of the listener. Will it become more dependent on the ability of the listener?
>  Will coaching skills be important?
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1886945890252071226) I'm only talking about my personal screening process, but the value of "something you can write about if you look it up on the internet" falls to "something that's better than nothing, but doesn't get much extra points just because it was there". It's like, "What exactly did you do?" I think the focus is going to shift to something like "What exactly did you do?
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1886946540553670875) In that sense, we often need a credit card for the experience of generated AI, and even if elementary, middle, and high school students are interested in it, it's amazing that they don't get the opportunity to experience it without their parents' understanding. I think it's a loss, and we need to be proactive in creating opportunities to experience it.
>  >teramotodaiki: For all U-17 students who want to try using generative AI but don't want to pay for it, we will give you an API Key. There is an upper limit, but it is enough to start small experiments and prototype development.
>  We would like to support you in any way possible, even outside of money, so please take up the challenge!

So, it may become mainstream to headhunt people who already have good reputations?
> [yutkat](https://x.com/yutkat/status/1886974733717266527) For me, I think the most important thing is whether you're doing something on an ongoing basis (it's always been important, but more so).
>  I want to know what you're interested in and what you're doing by investing time in it, because it's pretty easy to create articles and simple products now and it's impossible to tell.
