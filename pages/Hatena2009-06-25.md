Digital camera unearthed -> I put batteries in to try it out -> it worked -> but I have a digital camera battery charger on hand... looks like a digital camera that was used before the digital camera I'm looking for.

Introduced in 1999 as a low-cost machine: http://202.218.223.135/docs/article/990602/kodak.htm

What works works, and the lens should be a lot better than a cell phone, even though it has fewer pixels, so I'm keeping it for now. The brassic on the handle is melted and sticky...
