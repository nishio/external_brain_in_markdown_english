title: "Head of the Executive and a member of the Legislature"
---

> A [[prefectural governor]] is "the head of the [[administrative]] branch. On the other hand, to be a [[member of the Diet]] is to be "a member of the [[legislative]] branch. That's the job of making laws.
> So, being a [[governor]] or a [[mayor]] and being a congressman are two different jobs that are so different that you could call it a "career change."...
> If you have a specific thing you want to do, there's not much of a mix of executive and legislative. If there is, it's when you want to be [[a politician]], no matter what. If you want to win elections anywhere.
