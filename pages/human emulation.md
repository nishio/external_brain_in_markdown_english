title: "human emulation"
---

By collecting information like "Drucker said this" is concrete information, and by thinking "why did Drucker say that", a model is created, and by using that model, a person can think "Drucker would have done this in this situation". The emulation process is almost like analyzing the behavior of a program.
You have such a high regard for the greats of the past that you pay a learning cost, but instead of deifying them, you recognize them as systems that respond to environmental inputs and return outputs, and you think you can easily emulate them for some coverage.
