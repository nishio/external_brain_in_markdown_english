Slope, Curved 2 x 1 x 1 1/3 with Recessed Stud
Item No: 6091  Alternate Item No: 32807
Is there any good abbreviation [[G Curve Top]] I tentatively read it as [[G Curve Top]], but I'm not sure if it's called Curve Top in English.
With Recessed Stud is the best feature, so maybe "[[Dent Curve]]" or something.

Block 2 x 1 x 1 & 1/3 [[Curve Top]].

In brickers, slope > curved slope, not [[block (lump of something)]] > [[Curved top block]].
