> [toyotaka_sakai](https://x.com/toyotaka_sakai/status/1865396419605180538) I only thought "very useful" until GPT-4o, but don't think GPT o1 is even "smart and physiologically likeable".
> [minicoohei](https://x.com/minicoohei/status/1865401160523550957) I totally understand. Clever. I like it.
> [toyotaka_sakai](https://x.com/toyotaka_sakai/status/1865401424353579341) I like you like a smart student who asked me a numbing question in class. I like them.

> [shi3z](https://x.com/shi3z/status/1864964490028327094) I hired o1pro, but he's so-so stupid that I'm starting to wonder when I'll restructure him.

Closer to the sense of Dr. Sakai's person.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1865707791278846239) When I see the arguments for and against o1 pro, it reminds me of what I and others have been told over and over again, that a higher education is hard to use, and that having a PhD is useless.
>  I guess for most people, "a slave who can give vague instructions and still get their feelings and work faithfully" has more utility. That is understandable.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1865709697740988452) The "ability to understand intent even if the other person is expressing it ambiguously" component of "intelligence" that is not X is growing. In the past few years, the growth of X has caused a trend whereby "even those who do not have the ability to communicate their intentions in a programming language can use the power of computers".

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1865711212048372126) "I associate it with people who have high intellectual ability but are not well regarded because they are not good at cutting out appropriate problems from society and solving them, or at communicating their results in an easy-to-understand way. [[nishio]] [nishio

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1865711770742235309) As for GPT4, for a while I had the feeling that "I'm devoting resources to dealing with the idiots in the world, and my peak intelligence is going down". I feel like o1 pro is abandoning that "making it easy for everyone to understand".

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1865714684432904472) I was thinking that this sounds like a certain group of people I've seen before, and I couldn't verbalize the "certain". It just occurred to me that it might be this: "people with too high an IQ who are socially maladjusted."

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1865719943893016702) o1 Pro's comment after reading this series of stories:.
>  "o1 Pro" may seem difficult to approach at first glance and may not work with vague instructions, but that is its strength. By requiring theoretical and systematic thinking, rather than superficial "noticing," so to speak, users themselves are able to set up essential issues and decompose problems. The result is enormous productivity and flexible idea realization once you get used to it. I hope that it will not be seen as a "high IQ, socially maladaptive" entity, but rather as a tool of long-term value that conveys real value to intelligent users.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1865720580508639233) (My opinion) It's very much like a certain group of people when they are miffed at the expression "high IQ and socially maladjusted" and say things like "intelligent users will see the true value of this. W

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1865741661206352146) ugh, I like o1 better.

I'm starting to feel like there are two kinds of wise.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1865750111521001899) [The illustrated guide to a Ph. (Tool usage and Japanese fluency), so 4o might be fine for everyday tasks (or so says OpenAI itself, 4o for everyday tasks).

The author points out a structure in which "slaves" who faithfully follow vague instructions are welcomed by many people, while those who have "pure intelligence" but cannot respond to vague requests (o1 pro and high IQ individuals who are maladjusted to society) are disregarded. In short, the insight is that social evaluation requires "the ability to accurately grasp the intentions of others" and "adaptability to understandability," and those who do not (or the system) tend to be difficult to understand and lowly evaluated. This perspective highlights that the balance between "true intellectual ability" and "social adaptability" of tools and personnel determines their evaluation and usage value.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
I don't like the expression "true intellectual ability" because it sounds false. I think if you break down the abilities that enhance social adaptability into about three categories, and then break down the provisional term "true intellectual ability" as well, you would see it a little more clearly.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>
For example, it may be clearer if we break it down into the following elements
- Three elements of ability to enhance social adaptability (e.g.)
    - [Contextual awareness: The ability to accurately sense what the other party is implicitly seeking, the atmosphere of the place, and prerequisite knowledge, and to clearly understand their requirements.
    - Expression and [[Explanatory Ability]]: Communication skills to convey one's ideas and results in a clear and concise manner. This includes the ability to translate specialized content for a general audience.
        - [Flexibility: The ability to fine-tune one's own output to meet the expectations and demands of others, and the adaptability to respond flexibly to requests that are more unclear than expected.

- Three elements of "pure intellectual capacity (tentative)" (e.g.)
    - Abstract problem-solving skills: the ability to structure problems and use abstract principles and models to solve them, even in the face of ambiguous issues and complex situations.
    - In-depth expertise and ability to pursue logical consistency: In-depth knowledge in a specific field and the ability to organize and apply it as a rigorous logical structure.
    - Ability to secure a long-term, multifaceted perspective: An intellectual attitude that takes a more comprehensive view and makes strategic decisions by viewing issues in a long-term context, rather than short-term demands and immediate responses.

Contrasting these two, we can organize that "ability to enhance social adaptability" mainly strengthens external interaction skills such as communication and situational response, while "pure intellectual ability (tentative)" refers to internal logical construction, abstraction skills, and the ability to utilize deep specialized knowledge.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
What would you name (tentative) again?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>
Since the name "pure intellectual capacity (tentative)" seems vague and involves a value judgment, how about a more neutral and descriptive name, such as "[[higher cognitive qualities]]"?

This name indicates mainly internal thinking, analyzing, and decision-making abilities, such as abstract problem solving, pursuit of deep expertise and logical consistency, and securing long-term and multifaceted perspectives, and can be easily understood as representing "multifaceted and strategic cognitive characteristics" rather than simply "high intelligence.
