    - Photo taken 5T after the switch was turned off.
    - Items are gone from the upper hopper before 3T and the lower hopper has items from 3T
    - Four ticks were present in the lower hopper.
    - So here's what I mean.

        - Huh? Then you can't put items in the chest with a 5-tick pulse?
- PS: I think this happens after the comparator checks for the presence of the item and then the item moves, delaying detection by 1T.

- I'll sleep there or...

- Items not put in by hand by humans but sent in by hoppers are sucked up by one tick into the hopper below.

- Same "item sent by the hopper" but when a human turns it on, it's a 2T.
- In other words, if it's already on when you enter the upper hopper, you move in 1T.
    - If OFF, move 2T after it is turned ON.
    - Would that be inconsistent with moving at 5T?
