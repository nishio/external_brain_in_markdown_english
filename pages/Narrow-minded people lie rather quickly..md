title: "Narrow-minded people lie rather quickly."
---

from  [[Diary 2023-07-09]]

- People with a narrow [[field of vision]] lie rather quickly.
- Often there is no [[malice]] in the person.
- Often he doesn't even realize he's [[lie]].
- It is perceived as true by the person simply because of the narrow scope of observation
- If that is the case, then in some situations you must be on the narrow side of the vision, and then you are assuming a lie to be the truth.
    - How can we improve this situation?
