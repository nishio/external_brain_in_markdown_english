Examples of AI-assisted awareness

- [[🌀Exchange Form D]] had the following AI output based on the keyword "Exchange Form D" (T1: 2023-09-01 09:01)
- > We also reaffirmed the [[Importance of exchange in the problem-solving process]] through the practice of the KJ method and the content of the "Let the chaos speak for itself" study group. These provide clues to putting the theoretical framework of exchange style D into a concrete problem-solving context.
- This got me thinking, "What's the importance of exchange in the problem-solving process?" I wondered.
    - It could be called [focus on discomfort
- So I had the AI generate it based on this phrase.
    - This act would later be called [[Extending the Red Link with AI]].
    - I noticed that "[[Information exchange is exchange]]" in the generated results from "[[Importance of exchange in the problem-solving process]]" (T2: 2023-09-01 13:01).
    - [The question "Is the exchange style of knowledge exchange A?" was born (T3: 2023-09-01 15:00~2023-09-02 11:44).
- From there the branch grew and became "[[New Exchange Style]]" (T4: 2023-09-06 9:35)
    - > The style of [[knowledge exchange]] that has been customary especially among IT engineers is neither A nor B nor C in [[Yukito Emaya's]] [[interchange format]].
    - The fact that the subject of the exchange is not specified in advance
            - [[Reciprocal exchanges made after identifying the other party]]
- Later, I realized that it is also "[[Reciprocal exchanges made after identifying the other party]]" to have a conversation with that party after identifying the other party (T5: 9/6~8).
        - [[Conversation with a specific partner is reciprocal]]
