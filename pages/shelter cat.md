title: "shelter cat"
---

My cat is a shelter cat, but I have trouble explaining it when we talk about cats in English conversation school.

- [[Today's Nishio Family]]
- Me: When we talk about cats, we usually end up asking, "What kind of cat?" I: When we talk about cats, we usually ask what kind of cat they are, but it is difficult to tell because we don't know what breed they are, and it is also difficult to tell that they are shelter cats. A stray cat is a "stray cat," but I get the impression that stray cats are outside the house.
- Wife: I think that's what they're expecting, an answer like "it's a white and brown bicolor", many people don't know what breed they're talking about.
- Me: I see!

By the way, I was conversing with the instructor and came across the expression "We took in a stray cat", but that seems a bit different. It sounds like I just yanked a stray cat walking around the neighborhood, doesn't it? In reality, it was a stray cat that a shelter cat organization was taking care of, and I went to a giveaway and took it in...
