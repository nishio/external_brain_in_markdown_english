Public opinion map OSS public work 2025-05-08

Public Opinion Map OSS Release
- Ah, I see, I was preparing to go public in February, thinking that Tonfi would speak on 2/25, but it was decided that Tonfi couldn't come, so it was left untouched in favor of other things.
work
- private repo X making
- Internal repo to cp -r
    - Delete .git
    - git init
- add commit?
    - POLIS was a SUBMODLE, deleted.
- push to X
- Move the published README
    - This is from when only the data was released first
- Have Devin improve the README
    - Explanation of Mielka and JAPAN CHOICE
    - Explanation of Public Opinion Map
    - The fact that only the part of the public opinion map of JAPAN CHOICE was cut out and converted to OSS.
    - The license shall be AGPL.
- CI falied.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I guess CI can delete it since it's just a public disclosure, what kind of error are you getting?
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/devin/icon' alt='devin.icon' height="19.5"/>The CI checks were generating a TypeScript error (window.polis property not defined). We have added a typedef file to correct this, but the format and lint checks are also failing. One option is to remove the CI workflow if it is just for publishing purposes.
- The link is broken because the image is only on the DATA NO RIVER.
    - The content will overlap, but it should be here because more people will be coming here to see it.
- Public✅
- If I can afford it, I'll try to get Devin to actually start it up.
    - Let them ask questions about things they don't understand in the process.
    - I had DEVELOPER_GUIDE write it ✅.
> Now I remember the repo is called `yoronchizu2024-data`!
> I think I will create `yoronchizu2024` and put it there, and link it to `yoronchizu2024-data` in the README.
- ✅
