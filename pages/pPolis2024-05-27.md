I've tried two different ways of rounding a 5-point scale to 3 with no particularly interesting results...

Essentially, the clusters aren't separated, so the boundaries when divided into two clusters are in close proximity.
- Of course, the initial swing will replace the area around the boundary.

I've tried changing the colors by political party, but I can't find the meaning, something is buggy...

`Explained variance: [0.29123858 0.18823937]`
Hmmm, this doesn't represent more than half of the variance in two dimensions, and the projection into a space stretched by a few people with extreme answers makes it hard to tell the difference between the parties.

Oh, is that possible?
- I'm told that the data is divided into clusters and mixed with data that is only for the LDP and the Constituent Assembly.
- It must be a bug.

I tried to cut them down to five each from the Liberal Democratic Party and the Communist Party.

Ehhh, so the party still won't split? Really? Not a bug?

Eh, I knew this was buggy.
The mapping of data points to names and political parties seems crazy.

:

```
labels_=array([0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], dtype=int32)
```

I see the order of the PCA results has changed.

Ahhh, okay.
- To increase stability when the data size is large, the first 100 kMeans are multiplied, where the order is randomly shuffled.
- `plot_embedding_with_clusters(centers, clusters_K_star)`
- and
- `def plot_embedding_with_clusters(embedding_, labels_):`
- This embedding_ is not the same as embedding as a result of PCAing the matrix, because it is received in

I'm so happy for you!

If you take 30 from the Liberal Democrats and 30 from the Communists, they split up nicely.

All data again, colored by party, giving up on naming names.
A little meaningful bias in color, but hard to tell.
Polis-like cluster boundaries do not make much sense.
- The proper interpretation is "there is only one cluster" or "the algorithm is 2-5, so I'm just forcing it into two clusters."
It would be more interesting to draw boundaries for each party.

Reiwa and the Communist Party are in small clusters, while the NHK Party seems to be scattered. There seem to be two or three separate clusters inside. Japan Restoration has a tight core, but there are people scattered around the periphery.

![image](https://gyazo.com/77f9fc60c241159a0062e4842a7435cf/thumb/1000)
- LDP (right) and Reiwa, Social Democratic Party, Communist Party (left)

![image](https://gyazo.com/ab6048235f3ddca8794afce5eaec42c7/thumb/1000)
- Democratic Party of Japan (left), New Komeito, People's Democratic Party (lower right), Japan Restoration Association (upper right)

I'm limited to seeing three or four at a time.
I didn't enjoy it in simple Polis, but this is much more interesting.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>Q: Do the left and right sides of the PCA coincide with the political ideological left and right?
A: I didn't manipulate it to do that, I think it just happened.
Well, the X axis is the first principal component axis, so it is the direction with the largest variance, and it is perhaps not strange that it is strongly correlated with the political left and right.
I think there's a 1/2 chance the left and right will be reversed.
