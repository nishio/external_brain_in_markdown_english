- [[Reflective thinking]] involves five steps: (i) [[perceive difficulty]], (ii) [[define problem]], (iii) [[suggest solution]], (iv) [[elaborate suggestion by reasoning]], and (v) [[confirm by observation and experiment]].
- To foster reflective thinking, [[curiosity]], [[suggestion]], and [[the habit of ordering]] need to be cultivated. Schooling tends to inhibit this.
- [[Language is]] an indispensable tool for thinking. Language education should help develop thinking skills.
    - [Observation and information transmission provide the basis for reflective thinking. Observation should be [[active]] for [[problem-solving]].
- Flexibility is needed in the classroom to capture the child's [[train of thought]]. Teachers need to have insight into children's [[habits of thought]].
- [It is important to have a balance between [[play and work]], [[process and result]], [[concrete and abstract]], [[unconscious and conscious]], and so on.
- It is the skill of the educator to respect the child's [[free development of thought]] while consciously nurturing [[habits of thought]].

As mentioned above, Dewey discusses how to foster reflective thinking from a practical perspective. Recommendations for making school education a place for [[the development of]] thinking skills are found throughout.
