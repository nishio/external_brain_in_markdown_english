title: "I don't read it first and then remember."

Read first and then remember the way things were done when machine [[search (e.g. for someone using a search engine)]] was poor
- By search, first [[recollection]], then read

The "remembering" is an abstraction.
- Human "remembering" is the process of drawing out deep knowledge that has not risen to the conscious mind and bringing it to a place where it can be consciously handled.
- The "recall" of a search is to pull out the knowledge in the machine that has not gone up to the human brain and bring it to a place where humans can handle it.

I saw the beginning of "[Work to open up the forest of what has yet to be written.
- > A world where a huge language model is created and we understand better than homo sapiens by reading more sentences than homo sapiens can read in a lifetime.
