title: "Historical Compilation"
---

> [DaisukeMAN](https://x.com/DaisukeMAN/status/1813556510116720886) [[startup]] I've been talking about how one of the extremely important jobs of a founder is to "compile [[company history]]" from inception to today, and to keep it updated. Today, we all talked about it. In a startup where the number of people keeps increasing and things change day by day, there is rarely a tool that can unify everyone in the organization as much as the "history from inception to today".

> [DaisukeMAN](https://x.com/DaisukeMAN/status/1813558209493291151) When Akita-san, formerly of Cookpad and now of Kufu Company, was asked, "What is the most important thing for a company in its start-up phase?" Akita, formerly of Cookpad and now of Fuu Company, was asked, "What is the most important thing for a company in its start-up period? Take pictures. You can get money and people for whatever you want, but you can't get your memories back. But you can't get memories back." I thought this episode captured the essence of the question very well.

No - I sympathize with that idea, [[legitimacy through continuity]] or [[prehistoricism]].
However, actual startup founders are fighting on the brink of "life or death," "success or failure," and they do not have the luxury of securing the "resources needed after the organization grows to success.
And then, after it is lost and can't be recovered, they say, "We needed to secure the memories.

I think it's not a bad idea for a start-up organization to take on the history record as a way of [[Peripheral Participation]].
- It helps me understand it, it helps others around me, and it's not a critical path, so it's not a heavy responsibility.
