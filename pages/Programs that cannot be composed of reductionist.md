title: "Programs that cannot be composed of reductionist"
---

- Possibly incorrect to try to configure with [[reductionism]] in designing the program
    - [[systems thinking]] [[Network of Interdependence]] See the whole as it is
- Scrapbox Implementation Process
    - [[Split into modules]] in [[design]] is a traditional approach
- A straightforward approach in the design of physical products, since the components were physically localized
    - [[Modular and Integral]]
- Software components are not localized in their interrelationships.
- The [[Limitations of Cognitive Ability]] of humans has given birth to the [[Module Concept]] in software.
- This is about the 70's?
- Modularity is inferior in global performance.
- Appropriate modularity is determined by tradeoffs with design and maintenance costs
- If the human cognitive side is to be enhanced by software or other means, the appropriate modularity should be more integral than [[a flesh-and-blood person]] is designed to be.
        - [[Software enhancement of humans makes them more integral.]]
