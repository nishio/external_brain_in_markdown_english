The word "shikarami" in Japanese originally referred to a "fence" or "obstacle" placed on a river to "stop the flow" of water. However, the word "shikarami" came to be used to mean [[restraints]] or restrictions [[that prevent]] free action in society or in human relationships.

For example, people may feel unable to express their opinions or take the actions they desire due to ties at work, at home, or in the community. In these situations, ties are thought to function as inhibiting factors in people's behavior and decision-making, and may limit personal freedom and autonomy.
