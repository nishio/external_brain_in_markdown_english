(DeepL) "The Philosophy of Implicature" is based on the work of [[Eugene T. Gendlin]], a professor of philosophy at the University of Chicago. The most important way to learn this is to read [[gendlin]]'s work directly. Classes are regularly offered by the International Focusing Institute and by members who have studied Gendlin's work and often received direct instruction from him. Classes can be found by searching the Courses and Events section of this website. For an overview for beginners, watch the video below.
