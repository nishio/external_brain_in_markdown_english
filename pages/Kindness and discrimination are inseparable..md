title: "Kindness and discrimination are inseparable."

> [takiuchi](https://twitter.com/takiuchi/status/1712981789151735830) [[A]] [[friendly society]] inevitably attracts [[nail biters]] from all over the world. Because they are kind. However, we don't want to make a [[harsh society]]. To prevent that, we have to discriminate between ourselves and others. Maybe [[kindness]] and [[discrimination]] are inseparable.

[[Distinguish between self and others]].
