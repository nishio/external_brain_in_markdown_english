- Previous [RoboMasterS1 dark driving movie
    - Comparative brightness composition in Premiere Pro
- This itself is an experiment in "how to make a commentary video from a PC screen recording.
    - Experiment with [[Record your screen on your Mac]] and use it as a source material for editing videos in [[Premiere Pro]].
    - Recorded at 3360 x 2100 at 52 FPS
    - Osmo Action is 3840 x 2160 at 30FPS (16:9)
    - YouTube is 16:9, so 3360x1890 when combined horizontally.
    - Often freezes for about 5 seconds, even though there shouldn't be much difference in resolution.
        - Is it the FPS that is suspicious?
        - Should I have rendered the video at 30 FPS first?
            - or [[proxy video]].
            - I'll experiment next time.
        - [RoboMaster S1 was rotated at high speed!
        - This is also 59FPS, but it was an iPhone, so 1334 x 750

- Audio is recorded
    - [Frame retention is useful.
    - Or that an important scene is only on video for a moment.
    - You have a long audio explanation, so you want to stop the video during that time.
    - Retain specific frames of video in such cases.
- Conversely, the [[Rate Adjustment Tool]] is useful when you want to shorten the video to match the audio.

- I couldn't figure out how to duplicate the video selection elsewhere.
    - I'll give you a quick rundown of what I'm about to explain first" in the beginning of the video, and I'm using some of the latter part of the video.
    - I thought that if I set up an in/out and copied it, that area would be copied, but it wasn't.
    - I thought I could set up an in/out and drag-drop it onto the timeline from the preview screen, but not so.
    - I had no choice but to cut it with leather and copy and paste that area only.
    - If you do this, you will have to be aware of the separate clips when you apply effects or duration settings to the range later, which can be a hassle.
