The following is a quote from Audrey in [[Meetup with Audrey & Glen]] where he talks about the "trend of expanding local projects with government funding and turning them into infrastructure" (original in English). The points are then briefly explained.

> (Audrey Tang) “Started this idea called presidential hackathon and we use quadratic voting to let people have a say in what future projects are the most likely to harness this conflict into creation. Then we will make sure that those local projects get the national funding to become infrastructure the next year. But at the time we used the science fund funding for it. The problem of science funding is that it usually runs for three or four years, and then if you do not publish a paper, you don't have more maintenance anymore.
> So, when we encountered this issue in 2022, when we started the additional (Digital) ministry, we talked to our legislators about which committee we should be in. Because, you see, we are in charge of the AI platform, of buying some NVIDIA chips — so that sounds like the economy committee. Or we’re in charge of cybersecurity — that sounds like interior or defense. Or we are in charge of scientific research that can be used by the public web — that sounds like science or education.
> But we didn't go to those committees. We ended up going to the transportation committee. The reason is that by going to the transportation committee you have access to a different kind of budget — it’s called infrastructure budget in Mandarin. That kind of budget is like really building an airport, really building a train station. The argument is that, for example, when we built air quality sensors or water sensors, they have a property that, unless everybody interoperates, it has no effect. If each region runs their own measurement system and doesn't share a ledger, there's no common good. It’s something that only works supermodularly. It’s very much like a train station or an airport: if one airport only serves a single airline and you have to go to a different airport for another airline, there would be no real air industry.
> So, this interoperability qualifies for the infrastructure budget — just like building a highway or a train station. That is how we successfully got the infrastructure for privacy-preserving computing, for different government agencies to share statistics, or how we got the shared computation and digital signature infrastructure for small or medium enterprises.
> Long story short, it is three steps. First, it always starts from conflict — from civil society pointing out a problem. Second, the civic prototypes that prove supermodular synergy can then be promoted to a national scale (using something like quadratic voting to pick them). And third, you make it ‘infrastructure,’ i.e. permanently funded. That’s how local initiatives become part of the national system.”

explanation
- Mechanism for turning locally initiated projects into a national infrastructure
    - Solicit locally initiated ideas at presidential hackathons, etc., and select teams with "high supermodularity" in a second round of voting (Quadratic Voting).
    - Selected teams will receive funding from the government and will be implemented as national-level infrastructure in the following year.
- Why use an "infrastructure budget" instead of a "scientific research budget?"
    - Regular research funds (science and technology) are limited in duration, and it is difficult to provide continued support without paper results.
    - However, sensors and digital signature infrastructures are similar to "public infrastructures" whose value is enhanced only when many entities cooperate (interoperate) with each other.
    - The city then entered the "Transportation Committee" (which has jurisdiction over infrastructure budgets) and secured a budget for "social infrastructure" similar to that of airports and railroads.
- Conflict → participatory tool → public infrastructure
    - The key is a trend to successfully address local issues and resident conflicts, find "a system that benefits everyone who uses it," and budget it as a national government.
    - In particular, the higher the "[[interoperability]]" is, the more likely it is to be established as infrastructure.

In short, in order to "budget and continue to operate local experimental projects as public infrastructure for the entire country," Taiwan has adopted a structured approach from the selection of congressional committees to the use of infrastructure budgets instead of research funds. In this way, the government formally takes up ideas that originate locally and nurtures them as nationwide public goods.
