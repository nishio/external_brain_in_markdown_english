> When you are learning a "new language" that you can use without difficulty, it consists largely of what you have already learned, and you are learning few new concepts.

In this explanation, I write "new language" because I am using the example of learning a new programming language as an example, but in general, it seems to be better to say "new concept".
Concepts that can be learned without the hardships of confusion, shock, disorientation, and conflict with one's past ideas are not significantly different from concepts already acquired. It is a bad state of affairs to misperceive that one is learning well by rapidly acquiring concepts that are not very different from the ones one has already acquired. Related: [[comfort zone]].
