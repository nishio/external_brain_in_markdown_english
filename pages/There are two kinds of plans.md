from  [[Orientation of stacking varies from person to person.]]
- > [@tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1576764695997915138): @4bata @nishio After reading tweets from Nishio and Harasun,
- >  "[[conceptual design]] and [[detailed design]] are different."
- > "The place to focus on in conceptual design is the place where [[uncertainty]] ([[Implementation Uncertainty]] and [[Uncertainty in market valuation]]) is highest."
- > "I don't like it when people talk about detailed design when we're doing conceptual design."
- > I was able to get it down in my mind like that.
    - > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1576788383141011456): @4bata @tokoroten Whether or not the term "conceptual design" is understood, the two are different phases, and we don't want to mix the latter when we are doing the former. I agree with you that it's not good to mix the latter when you are doing the former.
    - > Jiro Kawakita also says, "[[There are]] two kinds of plans" (Hundo book, p. 110), which separates "[[Planning Procedures]]" from "[[Planning Structures]]".
    - > It is a plan to create a structure that, if realized as planned, would result in the fulfillment of a matter, a blueprint in the architectural sense, and even if the blueprint is the same, there are many ways to plan the procedure.
    - >
    - >  In another word, it could be divided like "[[what to make]] (what)" and "[[how to make]] (how)". The root would be the same.

- There are [[two types]] of [[plans]].
