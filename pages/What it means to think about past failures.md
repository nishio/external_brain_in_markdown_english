title: "What it means to think about past failures"
---

Some people say that [[thinking about the past is a waste of time]] because [[the past cannot be changed]].
There is a counterargument that it is beneficial to [[reflect on past mistakes]] and [[apply them to the future]].

When does thinking about [[past failures]] create value in the future?

    - [[a past (i.e. a personal history)]] situation $X$ and for a past [[failure]] $Y$,
- In the future a similar situation $X'$ is created,
- The status quo leads to a similar failure Y'.
- Can thinking about $X→Y$ hinder the flow of $X'→Y'$?

consideration
- Don't even think about it because $X$ is too rare for the same thing to happen.
    - Need to raise the abstraction level of [$ X
- The reflection at this point in time, which I recognize as a failure, is already enough.
    - Cases where there is no return on further investment of time.
    - [[hindsight]]
    - Consider that it was possible to make a decision to avoid $Y$ at $X$ based on information $Z$ that was not available at $X$.
    - but a meaningless consideration since $Z'$ is unknown at $X'$.
    - This is due to the predictability of $Z'$.
        - Useful if $Z=Z'$ or predictable.
