title: "The mode of information distribution affects the structure of the organization."

from  [[Isn't membership-based employment necessary to accumulate knowledge and social relationships?]]
The form of information distribution has a significant impact on the structure of the organization.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1756502065789219107) In order to store knowledge capital and social-relationship capital in a company, doesn't it inevitably have to be membership-based employment rather than job-based?

> [kawahiii](https://twitter.com/kawahiii/status/1756520323493900583) I personally think [[information distribution style]] is important.
>
>  In old-style organizations, information is closely tied to people, and business necessity compels them to engage with people. There is a necessity of [[gift exchange of information]], and [[SOC]] is formed. The organization also has a high affinity with the membership type. Gemeinschaft.
>
>  On the other hand, in new organizations where [[explicit knowledge (knowledge management terminology)]] is in place, information is not closely tied to humans, and the kicker for gift exchange that maintains human relationships because information can be smoothly obtained from text is This is a high affinity for the job type. This is highly compatible with the job type. Gesellschaft.
>
>  Therefore, I wonder if the stockpiling of knowledge capital will be membership-based if it is close to tacit knowledge, and if it is close to formal knowledge, then the job type will predominate.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1756677311469166676) I think the perspective of information distribution format is very interesting. I wonder if [[the formalization of knowledge progresses gradually as we do the same thing over and over again]], and conversely, in "[[situations where]] one unknown thing after another occurs" [[knowledge is stored within each individual in the form of unverbalized experience]]. In other words, it is affected by [[the speed of change in the world]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1756884714609324515) If [[verbalization is the bottleneck]], then "[[the inventory of what has not yet been verbalized]]" will keep piling up.

next  [[Isn't formal knowledge impossible?]]
