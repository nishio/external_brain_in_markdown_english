title: "Consideration of the fact that Madamis is not weak."
---

I should be weak in the normal sense of the word, but somehow I'm not, and I'll discuss why.

First of all, my self-perception is that I have a weak sensor for people's facial expressions and emotions, and I am not good at sympathetic behavior toward others.
- Such a person would normally have a hard time lying.
    - Like when you're lying and your eyes swim and it's obvious.
- However, in reality, the real culprit succeeds in hiding in Madamis, why is this?
- I suspected the influence of relationships since I've done most of my Madamis at one particular host's place, but I guess not since it's the same for store-based Madamis and werewolves I've done at other places.
    - I think I'd rather have a higher success rate in those areas.

Hypothesis 1
I've come to understand that having an "aura of cleverness" is detrimental, and I've come to understand that and to control my aura.

In an environment where returns are determined by "smartness" (like graduate school), there are players who want to invest in "smart people" to get a return, so it is beneficial to be perceived as "smart" by those players
- Therefore, actions that produce as much of an "aura of cleverness" as possible are chosen.

However, in an environment where "[[ordinary person]]" is in the majority, and power is allocated in a near-equal manner, such as "[[one vote per person]]" and is a "zero-sum game," it is detrimental to create an "aura of cleverness.
- Because in a zero-sum game of competition for resources, "normal people" have a higher probability of losing resources to "smart people," and it is in their interest to eliminate them in advance.
- A typical case is a multiplayer game where direct harassment is possible, and when the top player goes solo, the rest of the members all jump on each other [[sabotage]], [[the nail that sticks out gets hammered in]].
    - When you have an "aura of cleverness," harassment is concentrated on certain people, even when they're still in the dumplings in the early stages of the game.
    - When they do these things, it's not funny because it's like bullying for the person being done to.
- Werewolf games are multiplayer games with direct harassment of "voting for execution"
    - The reason why people tend to be executed on the first day or early in the game, regardless of the game situation, is a problem with aura control before the game starts.

I've come to understand this and take control of my aura.
- For example, this time he introduced himself by saying, "I played werewolf only twice a few years ago, and both times I was executed on the first day, so it wasn't any fun.
- I won't mention that I've played Madamis dozens of times since then because there's no merit in mentioning it.
- In retrospect, this self-introduction also has the effect of making it harder to be a target in the early "let's randomly execute someone because we don't all have a clue" situation (I didn't think that far ahead).

Aura of being a little out of the loop."
- The opposite of "aura of cleverness."
- Giving off an "aura of being a little out of the loop" is very useful in places like Madamis.
- Even when logic fails, you can say, "Oh, I see..." and cover it up.


Critique of Hypothesis 1
- Hypothesis 1 could certainly work in "a place where the majority of people are normal people meeting for the first time".
- But it's not valid at all "when you have a series of madamis that include many smart members.
    - If hypothesis 1 is the main factor, then I should observe a difference in that I repeatedly lose in the madamis place and win in the outside place.
- Even hypothesis 1 is not a reason to hide on the wolf side in the first place.


consideration
[[Aura of Goodness]]."
Understanding aura control and repeatedly adapting to the madamis environment has resulted in a different kind of aura

The best solution is unknown because the settings probably vary from mada-mis to mada-mis, but the current tentative solution is
- If you are on the side of the detective who first identifies the culprit and makes the culprit get the most votes
    - Better to be believed by others to be on the detective side.
        - Of course, it is possible that the killer has the means to kill the detective.
        - But it is equally possible that someone has the means to stop the violent means of the criminal.
        - So it's probably better to be widely believed to be a detective, and if that's the game design that kills you, so be it.
    - So create an aura of "I am actively working to identify the culprit.
    - This is the "aura of goodness."
- If you repeatedly envision a madamis environment, you should have the same "aura of goodness" when you are on the culprit's side.
    - Otherwise, you'd be able to guess from the difference.
    - As a result, even if it is the culprit, actively lead the discussion to identify the culprit early on.
        - The basic premise is to lie as little as possible.
        - I don't particularly attach myself.
        - Ensure that the focus is on statements that are incorrect or ambiguous due to the lies or mistakes of others.
            - If a discrepancy with something is revealed, you are not the one to be questioned.

Specific examples of expansion of misinformation originating from others
- 'There are three A's, B's, and C's, A having attribute P, B also having attribute P.'
    - From here, you can't say "C also has attribute P", but people often make the mistake of assuming that and talking about it.
    - When someone says "C also has attribute P" or makes an assertion using it as an implicit premise without explicitly stating it, we take it as a matter of course and develop an argument based on it.
    - It is difficult to think "it must be different" for something that everyone takes for granted, so the more the debate rages, the more this "false hypothesis" is believed.
    - I am not lying, so if someone points out an error, you can take it as "I see, sure.
        - If it's not definite, just take it as "sure, that's one interpretation."
    - Once an argument based on a false premise is spread to some extent, people will not be able to understand to what extent the argument is cancelled, even if they later realize that the premise was wrong.
        - Wrong premise Q, R, ... derived on the basis of wrong premise P A state in which
        - It is preferable when the composition of the discussion is that two people other than me are discussing the idea based on the wrong premise Q and saying "no, that doesn't mean P is right", they recognize each other as "the person who misleads / refutes the discussion" and the people watching the discussion see it as an argument between the two of them.

There are various types of madamis: the "logic-confirmed culprit type," in which the answer is confirmed by hard logic once a clue is given, and the "culprit-like" type, in which the answer only becomes more "culprit-like" and is not confirmed.
- The former "logic culprit confirmed type" is hard.
    - You can't win a quicksand when there's full disclosure of information.
    - Especially when there's more than one smart player, it all works out logically and there's no room for confusion.
    - So it is better to mix a lie and not be noticed that you have mixed a lie, which is difficult.
        - I don't want to lie myself, but sometimes I can't wait for someone else to make a mistake and expand on it in time if that's the style I'm going to use.
    - 'Lies mixed in! Who mixed it up?" and when the pursuit begins, they'll know.
    - The pattern of this not working out has become obvious.
        - I couldn't win because of the obvious contradictions and the conditions that increased the other party's credibility.
    - The pattern that worked was that the lies I told were ultimately predictive of other people's disclosures, and I could attack them by saying, "Isn't it funny that you said the same thing after I told you?
        - But instead of attacking the other party as the culprit and creating a confrontational structure, he put the other party on board with the idea that "this is not a clue to identify the culprit, but a misleading one".
        - As a result, I was able to discard the author's prepared line of reasoning as "this is misleading".
- The latter "culpability type" is relatively easy
    - It is very difficult to make a "logic-criminal type" game that does not break down no matter how the player plays, so most games are "criminal-like" games.
    - Read the win condition carefully and ignore what is not in the win condition.
    - In a "did A, did B, did C, killed him" situation, if you disclose A and B before others point them out, and then when they point out C and say, "Isn't he the murderer?" Then, when someone points out C and says, "Isn't he the murderer? Then, when someone points out C and says, "Isn't it true that A and B look very suspicious?
        - Especially for smart people who repeatedly make madam mistakes, "If the design is such that a single clue determines the culprit, it becomes a game of who drew the clue, so why wouldn't such a suspicious clue determine the culprit?" This tends to unconsciously cause a meta-reading of the game as
    - I consider myself a "detective who has been suspected of being the murderer," so I naturally do the "Well, it sure looks like I'm the murderer, hold on, I'll remember the details (and read the handout)" behavior.
        - This is where the "aura of goodness" comes in.
            - The bet is not on logic, but on whether the viewer will have the interpretation of "a detective who has been suspected of being a criminal" or not.
        - No big lies here.
            - If you lie because of the attention, because you can counter if someone has facts that conflict with it
            - Either look for and talk about facts that could be interpreted as evidence that I am not the culprit, or honestly admit that you don't have the evidence to prove it.

Related story: [[Geister.]].
- It's a board game with non-public information and [[brah]] elements.
- I'm expected to be weak at this too, but I actually tend to be strong, especially against people who are good at chess and stuff.
- This is playing "forgetting" the color information of your frames.
    - The opponent's guess of "it's probably a straightforward move" or "it's probably a bluff" has a 1/2 chance of being wrong because the color of your frames does not contribute to the decision on how to play the game.
    - Then they'll get confused on their own.
- I think it's a game of how to swing mental resources in the first place.
    - Some people think long and hard about the placement of frames in the early stages of the game.
        - I'm just pretending that I'm taking the same amount of time to place them, but in reality I'm just randomly shuffling the frames.
        - During the time they're looking at their frames and thinking, I'm also paying attention to their gazes and hand movements.
        - If you're just looking at your hand and thinking, and you swap frames A and B, there's a high probability that the colors of those frames are different.
        - If you are wondering which one to put on which of the other two, those two are different colors.
        - Conversely, if the last two are placed quickly, the probability of the same color is high.
        - Rarely do people bluff this, but they will check to see if you are looking at them, and if you pretend you are not, such as by swapping your frames, they will know that your bluff is not working.
    - In actual play
        - Shogi players tend to look at their own frame and think, "If the opponent does this, I'll do this..." on their opponent's turn
        - However, since I am destroying the premise of color inference, "the other party knows my color and acts on it as a basis for judgment," thinking resources are wasted.
        - I "don't know the color of my frames", so I observe my opponent's thoughts in his thought turns.
        - From the information that you are torn between options A and B, and you don't seem to think about option C, guess which frame and which frame are the same color.
        - Then, after actually taking the frame and getting the definitive information, they use it to guess the color of the other frames.
        - From the other side's point of view, it's like, "Well, your bluff doesn't work somehow." or "Somehow they know your color?" or "Why do they know my color?
            - On the other hand, the information to guess the color on my side doesn't leak out, which makes a difference.

Maybe Madamis and Geister together have something in common in that they "think 'forget' the information they know".
- Forget that you are the culprit.
- Forget the color of your frames.
In the case of the madamis, I think they only partially forget because the game is difficult to play if you forget completely.
- In that sense, are we breaking the premise that "the culprit knows he is the culprit and acts on that assumption"?
    - But there are actually some "madamis that the culprit doesn't realize he's the culprit.
        - When someone points out that you might be the culprit, you forget that you're the culprit, so you say, "I don't think I'm the culprit, but I can't argue with you if you say I'm the type of person who's unaware of it.
        - But this means "there are unaware culprits in this game," so other people who don't think they're culprits are also "possibly culprits."

In retrospect, I think it can be summarized as a self-perception that I am not good at lying, so I am processing the reality perception side to achieve my goals in that situation
- I don't see my colors in Geister.
- In Madamis, he recognizes that he is not a criminal, but a detective whose game is designed to make him easily suspected of being a criminal.
When "honest activity" is based on a perception of reality that differs from the facts, the resulting mix of factual and non-factual information in the field can be confusing and confusing to achieve the goal.
