[[Joseph Beuys]]
- > Social Sculpture
- >  A concept proposed by the German artist Joseph Beuys. Together with the "extended concept of art," "social sculpture" are the principles of Beuys' thought and activity. In general, Beuys's words, "Every human being is an artist," can be used to describe these in a simple way. The term "art" here refers to artistic activities and works of art in an expanded sense that includes educational activities, political activities, environmental protection activities, and religion. Beuys explains the social nature of any human activity, even the act of peeling a potato, as an artistic activity if it is a conscious activity. In other words, social sculpture is the idea of sculpting society for its own future.... Although all of Beuys' activities can be considered social sculpture, in terms of his works, the project "7000 Oak Trees," which was initiated at Documenta 7 (1982) near the end of his life and completed at Documenta 8 (1987) after his death, is the symbolic culmination of his work. In this project, basalt rocks were placed along with oak trees in the city of Kassel, the site of the exhibition. Oaks signify life, and basalt rocks, which do not change, signify death, representing the fact that the world is established through the existence of life and death.
