title: "Lost in translation might stimulate new ideas"
---

Translation may not fully convey the original meaning of the text, but rather, it might stimulate new ideas. I read your notes translated into Japanese by a machine translator. I'll share what it made me think of. This kind of two-way communication wouldn't be possible by publishing and distributing a book. It's a new form of collaboration made possible by digital information transmission technologies.
(Reading [[Gisele Chou]]'s note about [[Power and Modes of Exchange]] in [[Mandarin]])
