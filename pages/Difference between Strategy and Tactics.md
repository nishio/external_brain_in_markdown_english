> [FurukayBS](https://x.com/FurukayBS/status/1960863397345681806) I forget which post it was, but this concept of [[strategy]] and [[tactics]] is very useful for me in my professional management. I was looking back at the images I saved in the past, and I felt it was still good.

>  I recommend that the discussion be based on this definition, as it is a slippery slope.
>  For organizations with a mix of young and senior staff, it is better to first rub the strategic and tactical assumptions together before entering into discussions.
>  And the most important thing is to finish it, so once you decide, don't revisit it every once in a while, but all of you should commit to it.
