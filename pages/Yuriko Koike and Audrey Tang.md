[[Koike Yuriko]] and [[Audrey Tang]].
I didn't make the connection until [[Glen Weyl]] said to me, "[The current governor of Tokyo is a fan of Audery too](https://discord.com/channels/1133444567031627846/1133444568424132651/1250088951096541314)". I didn't make the connection in my mind.

> Governor Koike said, "We welcomed Ms. Audrey Tan, Taiwan's Political Affairs Commissioner for Digital Affairs, and I think we both had a lot to be inspired by. We have much to learn from Taiwan's measures in terms of crisis management." ... I think we have a lot to learn from each other.

- Even though it's only a one-character correction, the fact that the Taiwanese minister himself made a pull request to the OSS created by Japan is a big message.

You're building a relationship on an ongoing basis, not a one-off. So, either way, this opportunity will greatly advance [[digital democracy]] in Tokyo and plant the seeds of the concept of [[plurality]] throughout Japan. It's a good thing.
