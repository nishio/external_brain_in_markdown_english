> Highlights
>  	Plants emit ultrasonic airborne sounds when stressed
>  	The emitted sounds reveal plant type and condition
>  	Plant sounds can be detected and interpreted in a greenhouse setting
>  Summary
>  Stressed plants show altered phenotypes, including changes in color, smell, and shape. Yet, airborne sounds emitted by stressed plants have not been investigated before. Here we show that stressed plants emit airborne sounds that can be recorded from a distance and classified. We recorded ultrasonic sounds emitted by tomato and tobacco plants inside an acoustic chamber, and in a greenhouse, while monitoring the plant’s physiological parameters. We developed machine learning models that succeeded in identifying the condition of the plants, including dehydration level and injury, based solely on the emitted sounds. These informative sounds may also be detectable by other organisms. This work opens avenues for understanding plants and their interactions with the environment and may have significant impact on agriculture.
(DeepL)Highlights
- [[Plants]] emit ultrasonic waves when stressed.
- The type and condition of the plant can be determined from the sound emitted.
- Detect and interpret plant sounds in the greenhouse.
summary
- Stressed plants show phenotypic changes in color, odor, and shape. However, airborne sounds produced by stressed plants have not been studied. In this paper, we show that airborne sounds produced by stressed plants can be recorded and classified from a distance. We recorded ultrasonic sounds emitted by tomato and tobacco plants in an acoustic chamber and in a greenhouse while monitoring plant physiological parameters. We developed a machine learning model to identify plant states, such as dehydration levels and injury, solely from the emitted sounds. These informative sounds could potentially detect other organisms as well. This research opens the way to understanding the interaction between plants and their environment, which could have a significant impact on agriculture.
