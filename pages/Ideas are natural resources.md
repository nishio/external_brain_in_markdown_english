title: "Ideas are natural resources"
---

- [[IDEA]] grows abruptly, and we find it, pick it, and process it [[natural resources]].

Don't expect to get it consistently.

You can't walk in the same place all the time and it won't grow back.

Suddenly it occurs to me that it's been a long time since I've been on the road.
- I think it's true that it's being produced on the spot, but the sensation is that it's growing without your knowledge, and you just noticed it.

Tilling and placing the soil makes it easier to grow.
- It's easy to grow if you sow the seeds.
    - But this is not the discovery of something new because it grows the kind of seed that was sown?
