> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1466274971718586377): [[metaverse]] for people who don't like to communicate with others, [[Micra]] said that it would be a world where all blocks can be liked and the person who placed the block is notified of the number of likes (like [[Death Landing]]). I talked about a world where people who don't like to communicate with others can like all blocks in the [[metaverse]], [[Micra]], and the person who placed the block will be notified of the number of likes (like [[Death Landing]]).
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1466275260974522369): if you can like the signs, not to mention all the blocks?

context
- Wife: "I'm interested in [[VRChat]], but I don't want to be talked to."
- I said, "Maybe it's [[Minecraft]]."
- Wife: "I prefer installations like [[Death Landing]], and at least some loose communication through likes."
- I said, "Maybe Minecraft should have a like feature."

- [[I don't want to communicate.]]
