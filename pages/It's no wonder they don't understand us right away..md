It's no wonder they don't understand us right away.

- [[The cost of understanding ideas supported by multiple perspectives is high.]]
- So [[don't feel pain that they don't understand you]].
        - [[the pain of not getting what one seeks]].
    - Because of [[expectation]] of being [[understood]], the reality of being [[not understood]] is painful.
    - That [[it's not the other person who's creating the pain, but you]].
    - We should take it for granted that the [[cost of understanding]] is so high that it is not immediately understood.
- So what do we do about it?
    - We have to [[accumulate a lot of descriptions from different angles]].
