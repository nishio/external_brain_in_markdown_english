There are a myriad of ways to [[abstraction]] specific information. It varies from person to person.

- It is futile to start a discussion on the premise of [[Incorrect abstraction]], but somehow it happens, why?
Abstraction is information reduction.
When concrete information does not fit into an individual's cognitive capacity, he or she unconsciously discards the information and abstracts it.
The more unfamiliar a field is, the higher the probability of making "incorrect abstractions," so we should think more concretely, but the more unfamiliar a field is, the higher the cognitive load, so we unconsciously abstract from it.

People who are proficient in a certain field share a common "method of abstraction commonly used in that field.
So by doing [[Common Abstraction]], we can reduce information and communicate more efficiently.
The basic premise of "efficient information transfer through abstraction" is that "it is a common abstraction method."
