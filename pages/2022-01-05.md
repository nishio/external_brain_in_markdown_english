- [[Pulling and combining from the outside world what is not in the company]]
- [[The dilemma of acquiring knowledge from outside the company]]
- [[Invest to lower knowledge acquisition costs]]
- [[path dependency]]

- [[The next step is to get rid of the "hazy" feeling.]]
- In the context of the [SECI Model
- Keichobot helps to put subjective mumbo-jumbo into words = helps tacit knowledge to be expressed as formal knowledge
- Kozaneba helps discover connections and structures between written text fragments = helps linkage between formal knowledge
    - Personally, I think it also helps me understand texts that are difficult to comprehend = helps me internalize formal knowledge.

I'd like to solve this but I don't have time so I'll just make a note of it.
    - Is the relationship between "living" and "thinking" in [[Building, Living, Thinking]] related to [[Mind Palace]], [[clean space]], or the KJ grouping process?
    - Are the tools in [[Tools for Conviviality]] related to [[groupware]] or [[metaverse]]?
    - â†’ The word [[conviviality]] is a type of concept that should not be interpreted from the literal translation.
    - In the [[SECI Spiral]] of [[knowledge creation company]], [[collaboration]] is depicted as an essential part of the spiral.
    - It is good that there are two ways of communicating felt sense: a non-verbal collaboration and a verbal one.
    - I'm not sure there is any reason to assume that this would happen alternately.
