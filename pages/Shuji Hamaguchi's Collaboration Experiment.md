- [[collaboration]] experiment by [Shuji Hamaguchi
Comparative experiment between thinking alone and thinking with many people
- A: 1 hour discussion
- B: 20 minutes of silence and thinking alone, the remaining 40 minutes of discussion
- C: 20 minutes of silent thinking alone, then sharing, then another 20 minutes of silent thinking, then discussion in the last 20 minutes
- D: 40 minutes of silence and thinking alone, then discussion in the last 20 minutes

A is bad, B, C, and D are better than A, with C being the best

- Two sets of 202 building blocks (kuum) were given and the challenge was to "create an amazing piece of work" in 60 minutes.
- Definition of awesomeness and evaluation criteria are left to the team.
- This experiment is divided into three teams.
    - A: Leave the members free to do as they please.
    - B: 40 minutes of individual work, followed by sharing
    - C: 20 minutes individual work, then share, then consider bias model, then break bias
- result
    - Team A used up all of its time in discussion and did not complete its work.
    - Team B had an individual who came up with an interesting idea during the 40 minutes and the idea was adopted during the sharing phase
        - Started making parapara manga with building blocks.
    - Team C didn't come up with any interesting ideas during the 20 minutes.
        - However, after looking at the works that came out and discussing them, we discovered a bias that the works that came out "assume that they are stopped
        - The idea was to break that bias, and the result was a work in motion.
    - Teams B and C were tied.

- It is useful to think alone and make something concrete before discussing the cut-off
    - It is important to pair concrete ideas with abstract cuts
        - [[The combination of concrete and abstract is important.]]
    - Team A, which started the discussion from the beginning, ended up discussing abstract cuts.
    - >  [[The key to collaboration is not to argue.]]
        - Team C discussed bias for 20 minutes, but Hamaguchi thinks it would have been better if each of the seven had a parallel task here to consider bias
            - Another workshop was conducted based on this idea, and it was actually good, he said
