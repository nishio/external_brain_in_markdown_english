title: "Responsibility to accept criticism about choices"

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This series of tweets discusses the importance of "[[selection]]" and "[[liability]]" in [[creation]].
The main points are as follows
- Creation means choosing one from a myriad of possibilities and taking responsibility for that choice; even if an AI produces a large amount of output, if it does not take responsibility for choosing one from it, it is not truly creative.
- Human creators [[grow]] by publishing their work and receiving criticism. New works are created based on the accumulation of past works. AI, on the other hand, does not have this chronological change.
    - [[RLHF]]で変化してる、それを成長という人も劣化という人もいる<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- For AI to be as creative as humans, it needs a "personality," i.e., an entity that takes responsibility for its work. It is not enough to simply provide feedback on external evaluations; it is important to have what you want to do and compare it to what you have actually done.
    - AI masquerade personalities, maintained at the expense of the fans, take responsibility in the form of death if they lose popularity.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Simply learning the work of a deceased person does not reproduce the trajectory of change in that person's work.

In other words, we understand the argument to be that "choice" from a myriad of options and "responsibility" for those options are essential for true creation, and that this requires the existence of a "personality" that establishes itself over time.
I think this is a thought-provoking point that for AI to be truly creative, it is necessary to consider not only the technical aspects but also these essential aspects of creation. On the other hand, one may take the view that it remains to be seen how far AI technology will develop in the future. In any case, it can be said that the report presents an important perspective on what creation is.

>  About 35 years ago, I remember my father saying something like "I wonder if a lot of what humans 'create' is just a combination of things we've seen before" (sweat), but if that's the case, then generative AI would be the same as humans, which it shouldn't be.

> [anohana](https://twitter.com/anohana/status/1783509503566286968) This is often heard, but as a creator, you are missing a vital requirement: "Creation is to choose one expression out of a vast number of possible expressions, and to take responsibility for it as one's own expression. It is to select one out of a vast number of possible expressions as one's own expression, with responsibility.
>  In acting, "choice" is the key to creativity, which is said all the time in the creative field, but not so much in other fields?
> [anohana](https://twitter.com/anohana/status/1783509505193709945) After all, if a generative AI outputs 1000 pieces, the recipient can't see all 1000 of them, nor is there any point in seeing them. What is important is to put one of them out there as "this is my work" and take responsibility for accepting criticism about that choice.
>  For an AI to be able to do that, it would need a personality.

> [anohana](https://twitter.com/anohana/status/1783740845138850230) A personal perspective that I thought might not have been shared much in response to this.
>  A human creator changes (grows) by exposing what he/she chooses to the world at his/her own risk and receiving criticism. There are many things that can only be understood and learned by putting them out there.
> [anohana](https://twitter.com/anohana/status/1783740846694928877) A work of art may be evaluated on its own, but as long as it changes each time its creator releases it, a work of art is based on a group of works that the creator has released up to that point. A work of art may be evaluated on its own, but as it changes each time the creator releases it, a work of art is based on the works the creator has released before. It is rare, if not impossible, for an amazing work to appear out of nowhere without any context. Usually, there is a precursor work.
> [anohana](https://twitter.com/anohana/status/1783740847982616929) In other words, in order for a certain work to be created, the author had to have had the experience of creating and producing a precursor work before.
>  The view that "humans are also just combining the inputs they have taken in up to that point" feels like a major oversight in that it does not take into account this change in time series.
> [anohana](https://twitter.com/anohana/status/1783740849182126418) This is not simply a matter of letting the AI eat your work as well, but inevitably it seems to me that the step of "once you detach your work from yourself and accept the evaluation of others" It seems to me that the step of "once you detach your work from yourself and accept the evaluation of others" is necessary.
>  I wrote that for AI to do the same things humans do, AI must have a personality,
> [anohana](https://twitter.com/anohana/status/1783740850419462192) The intention is that it is necessary for the mechanism to work, to take that "feedback on what you have done (when you put your work out there, there is no excuse) personally, and let it change your next choice. I think it is necessary for the mechanism to work.
> [anohana](https://twitter.com/anohana/status/1783748306902159739) I'm not simply talking about putting external evaluations into reinforcement learning. If you do that, you will just be pandering to an external evaluation axis.
>  The effect of an outside perspective is that it allows for a three-way comparison between "what I didn't know I wanted to do, what I wanted to do, what I actually did, and what it achieved.
> [anohana](https://twitter.com/anohana/status/1783748308131070222) To have that effect, you have to have "something that you don't know, something that you wanted to do". That is the "personality" or the subject of the creator who takes responsibility.
> [anohana](https://twitter.com/anohana/status/1783750514288845128) I'm skeptical of "learning the work of a deceased creator to create a new work" for the same reason, at least I think great people never thought it was a good idea to settle for self-imitation. I don't think they were comfortable with self-imitation. They must have changed every time they produced a work. If there is no such change, then it can only be an epigone.
