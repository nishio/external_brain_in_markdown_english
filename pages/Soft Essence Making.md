title: "Soft Essence Making"

> Rather than writing "[[Corrective statements of the effects of alcohol consumption]]", it is better to write "[[one should drink alcoholic beverages]]".

- Tips for creating [[Essence of Meaning]], [[Concept Handles]].
This is true when creating one-line headings for [[KJ method]], but I believe the same is true for page titles in Scrapbox.

> There is one very important thing to keep in mind when creating [[essence]] of meaning. It is very important not to be overly [[abstraction]]. Rather, it is better to use as many [[soft words]] as possible to capture the essence of the speaker's point. For example, let's say there is a favorable comment about drinking alcohol. To compress it into a one-line headline, it would be better to write "You should drink alcohol" rather than "[[Corrective statements of the effects of alcohol consumption]]".
> In this regard, experience has shown that there is an interesting problem. Japanese men often make a mistake in this regard. They tend to create one-line headlines that, without any need to do so, over-abstract the essence of what is being said to a strangely high degree, using difficult terms of art and rigid idioms. This is not good. It is better to be as soft as possible, so that the [[skin texture of the original statement]] is conveyed as much as possible. One-line headings that convey the [[Aroma of soil]] of the original statement as much as possible are better.
