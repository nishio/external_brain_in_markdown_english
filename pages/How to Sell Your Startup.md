- [[Paul Graham]]"Spend every moment of every day doing two things: building products or talking to users."
    - Most of what we talk to users about is sales
- Advantages of the founder being a salesperson
    - passion
    - expertise
- Sales is a funnel
    - potential customer
    - conversation
    - closing
- potential customer
        - [[chasm theory]]
    - Only 2.5% of companies would consider buying a product from a startup
    - You have to talk to a lot of people.
    - Three methods of acquisition
        - My Network
        - Industry conferences: know who's coming and make an appointment
        - cold mail
- conversation
    - Sales is about listening.
    - Understand their problems and build rapport
    - First understand what their needs are.
        - Then consider if you can help them with your solution.
    - Examples of questions
        - Can you tell us about the problem you are having?"
        - How are you resolving this now?"
        - Why did you pick up my phone?"
        - If you had an ideal solution, what would it look like?"
- follow-up
    - Need a lot
    - It's not over until they say no.
    - We should assume the best case that they are simply too busy to think about anything else.
    - No reply -> 5~7 days later, poke around, not rude or pushy.
    - Be thoughtful and personal
        - Simultaneous emails, no one likes them.
- closing
    - I just need one more feature."
        - Contract ahead of time
        - Delay until other customers request it.
    - I want a free trial."
        - Sign an annual contract first
        - Create a cancellation period
- When you get a no in early sales conversations, is it because you are not an [[early adopter]] or because you don't have [[Product/Market Fit]]?
    - No means no.
- Which to attack first, small or large companies?
    - Go to the people who need the product the most and act quickly
- Price
    - Patrick McKenzie says most startup founders set their prices too low and need to charge more
    - One strategy for pricing: if you can close the deal, double it.
- Products of $50
    - I can't high five you.
    - The only page that existed was one that described the product. That was enough.
