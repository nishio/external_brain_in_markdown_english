from [[pRegroup2020]]
PC version should have shortcut keys.
- It would be nice if Cmd+Enter could be used to send.
    - One line of text is recommended, so rather press Enter to send, Shift+Enter to break line.
- Switching tools
    - Align shortcuts with Adobe products
        - P:Pen
        - T:Text(Add Piece)
        - Space: Hand(Move)
        - E:Erace
        - Q:Lasso
        - G:Group
        - C-Z: Undo
        - C-R: Redo
    - [[Cmd+0 to display the entire display]]
- Cmd+1 to display full size
    - Zeros and ones are fine.
