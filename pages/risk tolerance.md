title: "risk tolerance"
---

People with too high a risk tolerance learn from their mistakes, but when the mistakes are too big to bear, they can die.
People with too low a risk tolerance can learn from "I screwed up, but it didn't hurt that much."
If your risk tolerance is very low, you can't learn because you can't try things that could go wrong in the first place.
