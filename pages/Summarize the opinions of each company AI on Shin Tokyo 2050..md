title: "Summarize the opinions of each company AI on Shin Tokyo 2050."
---

- I was curious what would happen if I let ChatGPT [[o1 Pro]] read the argument of the interim report of [[Shin Tokyo 2050 Broad Listening]] as is. After that, I tried it with Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini 2.0 Experimental Advanced.

## o1 Pro
It was too long as it was, but sampling by 1/2 was OK.
No specific prompts were given, the data was given as is.
After a minute and a half of thinking, the following output was produced
> The following is a summary of the above group of opinions on the image of Tokyo in the 2050s.
>  general direction:.
>  In the 2050s, Tokyo is expected to protect the natural environment and promote greening, strengthen disaster countermeasures, realize a sustainable society, eliminate garbage and waste problems, promote decarbonization and carbon neutrality, take measures to mitigate climate change such as the heat island effect, and establish a resource-recycling society. In addition, many opinions aim to alleviate crowded trains and traffic congestion, reduce the burden of travel through the spread of remote work, build a safe and secure disaster-prevention city, take into consideration foreign tourists and promote the city as a world-class tourism and entertainment center, and protect historical and cultural assets and coexist with nature.
>  Furthermore, importance was placed on creating a society in which it is easy to raise children, young people have hope for the future, and communities in which multiple generations can coexist in harmony, overcoming the declining birthrate and aging population. Improvements to the working environment and education system, reforms to work styles such as childcare leave and a three-day workweek for both men and women, measures to combat poverty, and stability in daily life through improved welfare were also called for.
>  On the other hand, negative scenarios were also presented, such as higher temperatures due to climate change, increased risk of disasters, uniform landscapes due to excessive redevelopment, security and cultural friction due to the increase in the number of foreign residents, concentration in one area and disparities with rural areas, and concerns of hollowing out due to population decline.
>  general:.
>  The vision for Tokyo in the 2050s is "a clean and beautiful city that is in harmony with nature and is well-prepared for environmental and disaster prevention measures. An advanced green city that realizes a recycling-oriented society and is prepared for climate change. A society in which all people, from the young to the elderly, can live with peace of mind, with progress in child rearing and work style reforms. Many people have the ideal of "a world-class city that is sustainable and respects diversity, with no overcrowded trains, international tourism and cultural areas, and that values its history and cultural assets. On the other hand, there is also concern about a dystopian future in which problems are not solved and worsen, and the success or failure of measures is key.

Overlapping prompts.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Make a list of claims that satisfy at least 10 people.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>The following is an example list of claims that are likely to be widely agreed upon and supported (expected to satisfy at least 10 people) in Tokyo in the 2050s. All of the arguments take into account multifaceted values such as the environment, ease of living, safety, culture, and support for child-rearing.

- Urban heat island control through increased greenery, parks, and street trees
    - It is thought that many people would desire a city rich in nature due to the alleviation of extreme summer heat, health and mental stability, and the maintenance of ecosystems such as wild birds and insects.
- Protection of historic trees and green spaces such as Jingu Gaien
    - Protecting venerable landscapes, cultural assets, and urban green shade and passing them on from generation to generation is easily supported by many citizens.
- Conversion of roadways to electric vehicles and transportation to clean energy
    - Efforts to significantly reduce exhaust emissions, clean the air, and reduce noise are likely to be appreciated by health-conscious and environmentally conscious citizens.
- Expansion of sidewalks and bicycle lanes and barrier-free access
    - The development of an environment in which pedestrians, bicyclists, the elderly, people with disabilities, and households raising children can move about with peace of mind will increase life satisfaction in the city as a whole.
- Realization of a clean and beautiful environment for roads and parks by promoting waste reduction and recycling
    - A clean city free of litter is favored by tourists and locals alike, and efforts to reduce littering and plastic dependence are supported by the environmentally conscious.
- Enhancement of urban infrastructure and disaster prevention planning to ensure resilience to natural disasters
    - Almost all citizens welcome the earthquake resistance and disaster mitigation measures, rapid recovery system, expansion of stockpiles and evacuation centers, and information sharing system in preparation for large-scale disasters such as an earthquake directly under the Tokyo metropolitan area.
- Strengthening childcare support (e.g., improving daycare centers, children's centers, and children's cafeterias, and enhancing childcare leave systems)
    - Measures to increase support for families raising children and to create an environment in which children can grow up healthy are likely to be widely supported as a measure to address the declining birthrate.
- Improvement of a safe environment for the elderly (medical and nursing care services, sidewalks with no steps, community space)
    - In anticipation of a super-aged society, many people of all ages feel the need for a living environment that takes the elderly into consideration and a system of mutual support in the community.
- Increase food self-sufficiency through the spread of urban agriculture for local production for local consumption and balcony vegetable gardens
    - It will help ensure healthy and safe food, reduce food loss, and increase green vision, and is likely to gain support from food- and environment-conscious segments of the population.
- Development of tourism and leisure facilities and events that take advantage of history and culture
    - Creating an attractive cultural center by taking advantage of Hibiya Park, the outer gardens of the Imperial Palace, the downtown atmosphere, and traditional performing arts will increase satisfaction for both residents and tourists.

All of these arguments are expected to satisfy a large number of citizens, as they are likely to be met with a certain degree of support from people with different values, such as the environment, quality of life, cultural preservation, child rearing and coping with aging, disaster prevention, and so on.

## Claude 3.5 Sonnet
> Conversation is 45% over the length limit.
o1 Pro would be OK, but this one overflows, so I switched to 30% sampling.
