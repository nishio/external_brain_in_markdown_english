title: "You're abstracting too much."
---

> [[doorplate]] comes to mind because a one-line headline on a few "friendly" pieces of paper has an [[associative mood]] surrounding it, surrounding the center of its meaning, not just the meaning of the letter-symbol surface. This is the point at which I cautioned against "Never [[You're abstracting too much...]]," "Don't get hung up on stiff idioms and jargon," or "[[Leave the scent of the earth...]] as much of the original material as possible" when creating a one-line headline. This is the point. The minimum necessary "[[conceptualization process]]" is important, and should not be unnecessarily reduced to a "concept.
- Ideas p. 141

The string on the label is a [[hook]] to recall specific things associated with the string.
    - It is better to keep [[suggestion]] from [[abstract concept]] as long as possible, rather than to keep [[abstract concept]] separated from [[context]].
    - Increase opportunities for [[associative connection]].

- [[Abstraction is not a good thing.]]
- [[abstraction]]
- [[conceptualization]]
- [[concept]]
