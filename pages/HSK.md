Chinese (language)] qualification recognized by the Chinese government
All conducted in Chinese (to measure comprehension of Chinese, not translation from Japanese).
- It's right up my alley.

Next time 2/15, I may be able to take both levels at the same time.

Decide which grade to take
- I'm feeling unsure about level 2, but I scored 92, so I'm not sure if I'll take level 2 or 3.
- I failed to read that there was listening.
    - Listening for the first level is no good.
    - Only the reading is growing first, so we need to focus on developing the listening.
- Official HSK App
    - You can test yourself by listening to the words and answering the meaning.

You should solve past listening questions.
- I'll try the reading comprehension questions for level 3, probably over the passing grade.
- Then you can see that "it is the listening that needs to be trained."

- Unfortunately, you can't "retest only the questions you got wrong".
    - Retest "a set of 10 questions including the wrong question."
    - In the upper grades, every set is wrong, so they don't compress.
    - I can only listen to the wrong questions.
    - I can't distinguish between reading wrong and hearing wrong.
        - It's different...
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/37e60c043719ecb3f2fb9bc9341ed5ef/thumb/1000)
    - I know what you mean, but I can't distinguish between you and sato
    - Trivial and also below.

- They'll be asked to solve a fourth-grade problem.
    - Too difficult!
- Reduce the level by setting

    - Is this bread? It looked like a watermelon.
    - They only give me letters when I make a mistake.

    - Looks like I'll have to pay more than $3,000 to solve the other problems.
