[ChatGPT and other interactive AIs should be thought of as "word calculators" not "search engines" that look for the right answer. GIGAZINE](https://gigazine.net/news/20230404-chatgpt-language-models-calculator-for-words/)

[[LLM]] is [[Word Calculator]].
- I'm convinced, but most of the public thinks [[calculator]] is "something that returns correct calculation results," so I'm not sure if it's [[parable]] that they don't understand properly.
