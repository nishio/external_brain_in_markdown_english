- Thoughts.
    - If K is small, you can greedily take from the lowest cost side, but K is 10^8
    - From the cheapest" means that there exists the highest x among the selections
        - Possible extensions below x for each building are required in constant order
        - So "the total amount of possible extensions below x, f(x)" can be obtained in the order of 10^5
        - We can use a binary search to summarize the smallest x for which f(x) is K
                - [Maximization with bisection search. This time it's minimization.
- Official Explanation OK
