Towards Digital Nature: Bridging the Gap between Turing Machine Objects and Linguistic Objects in LLMMs for Universal Interaction of Object-Oriented Descriptions
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04498](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04498)

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This paper proposes a new approach, "[[Abstract Language Objects]]([[ALO]])," to bridge the gap between linguistic objects (LO) and Turing machine objects (TMO) using the Large Language Model (LLMM). The main contents are as follows.
- ALO leverages the abstraction capabilities of LLMM to enable seamless communication between human-perceived real-world entities and their corresponding computational entities.
- ALO enables the efficient implementation and management of real-world simulations and ultimately promotes the concept of a "digital nature".
- Three case studies are presented: a smart home environment, an interactive educational simulation, and an IoT scenario.
- It shows how to generate ALOs and convert them to JavaScript and image generation software.
- It compares ALOs with prompts, TMOs, and LOs, and discusses the characteristics and relationships between them.
- It also mentions security risks and limitations such as lack of domain knowledge and token length issues.
- Future directions include the integration of domain knowledge into ALO and the possibility of extending ALO by linking it with databases.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The paper cites the following advantages of ALO
- It enables seamless interaction between real-world objects and their digital simulations. ALO bridges the gap between the two by providing a level of abstraction between human-perceived real-world entities and their corresponding computational entities. This allows for smooth operation between real-world objects and their digital twins.
- Enables efficient implementation and management of real-world simulations. ALO allows for more efficient implementation and management of real-world simulations. This is because ALO provides a high level of abstraction for representing interactions and relationships between complex objects.
- It has the potential for more sophisticated object-oriented descriptions and interactions. ALO can be viewed as an extended version of Linguistic Objects (LO) and has the potential to allow more complex object-oriented descriptions and interactions.
- Advancing the concept of digital nature. By automating the creation of digital twins, ALO contributes to the realization of a digital nature in which the real and digital worlds are closely connected and can be easily manipulated through computational means.
With these benefits, ALO is expected to play an important role in human-computer interaction, breaking down the barriers between the real and digital worlds to enable more seamless and natural interactions.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The specific composition of ALOs is described in the paper as follows
- Name and describe real-world objects. Use LLMM to extract object features and properties (shape, color, size, function, etc.) and enter these into LLMM as natural language prompts to generate unique names and descriptions for objects.
- Build a world in which linguistic simulation is possible. Leverage LLMM's abstraction capabilities to build a world in which generated linguistic objects can interact with other objects in a semantically relevant way.
- Integration with high-level programming languages. Integration with high-level programming languages (such as Python and JavaScript), hardware, and neural network platforms by automatically converting LLMM-generated natural language descriptions and interactions into corresponding object-oriented code and prompts. We do this by.

As a specific example, the paper shows how GPT-4 is used to generate ALO.
- Set a system prompt and ask GPT-4 to generate an ALO in JavaScript.
- Convert the generated JavaScript code into a single JavaScript class.
- Import the generated class into the simulator's main program, instantiate it, and register it within the JavaScript animation loop.
- Also shown is an example using Three.js as a way to represent ALO in a 3D simulation environment. In this example, the ALOs are all represented as cubes of the same size, and for visual clarity, images generated by the image generation model (DALL-E 2) are used as textures.

These specific configuration methods enable ALO to be used in real applications and simulations.
