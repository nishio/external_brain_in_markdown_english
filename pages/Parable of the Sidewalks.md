title: "Parable of the Sidewalks"
---

During the meeting, I was answering a question from a newcomer, when someone who had been there before pointed out that it is not interesting when Dr. Nishio answers the points that everyone wants to hear head-on. This is quite an interesting incident.

The image that came to mind when I was thinking about what it means.

I want to go from start S to finish G.
- However, it is difficult to find a side road to the destination.
- So many people follow the path and go to dead end A.
- I'm having trouble with dead ends.""Which direction is G?" Many questions will be asked.
- But if you try to go from A to G, the pause is a bush.

The appropriate action in this case is not to answer the questions that come up.
- It's about putting signs on side streets and giving them an overhead "map" in advance.
