<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3-mini-high/icon' alt='o3-mini-high.icon' height="19.5"/>The "arms dealer composition" is a business metaphor for the relationship between arms dealers and their customers. As shown in Masaaki Hatano's notebook article "We are arms dealers," for example, the following composition is meant.

- [[client]] = soldier on the battlefield
- Customers are always fighting in [[(the) market (as a concept)]], and they need the best "[[arms]]" (i.e., tools and services) to win.

[Arms dealer = provider of the best weapons.
- The arms dealer is responsible for providing customers with the best weapons they need to win the battle and increase their sales and [[competitive edge]].
- In other words, we must always seek the best so that our customers cannot stand on the battlefield without weapons.

Thus, it means that the basic business composition of "[[providing]] the strongest tools to win" is always expressed in the simple two-party relationship of arms dealer and customer.

- [[Composition of competitive relationships among customers]].
        - [[competition]]
- Be careful not to use the "arms dealer" analogy carelessly, as it can be triggered by [[anti-war sentiment]] and other [[unexpected backlash]].
