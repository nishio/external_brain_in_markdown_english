title: "Companies and Families"

- [[becoming independent]]

- [[family]] metaphor

- When we say [[family-oriented management]], what we imagine differs from person to person. Different people have different experiences with families.

- It's not right that "the grandchildren have to put up with a lot of food so grandpa can eat a lot."
- It's funny that "when an adult child wants to leave home and try something, you say, 'Don't think you can go anywhere but here and expect it to work.'"
    - Sends the message that you are willing to send them off and that they can always come back if they stumble.
