title: "The process of understanding difficult texts"

- The reason why [[difficult sentence]] is difficult is that the word is not used in the dictionary sense (i.e., it is a non-parallel symbol).

    - [[Felt Sense and Symbol Diagrams]]

1: Symbols are not parallel, so even if you know the meaning of the symbols themselves used in the book, you don't know what is represented by their combination.
    - [[There are two patterns of "I don't know."]]

2: Then I said, "Oh! Is this what you mean?" And then there is a realization. This is a new felt-sense imagination, and there is no confirmation that this is what the author wanted to express
    - [[Understanding is a hypothesis]]

3: By repeating this process, the relationships ([[RELEVANCE]]) between symbols become visible, and as they form a consistent network, the confidence that "this is what the author meant" increases.
    - [[Grounded in consistency]]

The process from 2 to 3 is strongly related to [[Gaining Stability]] in [Interference Effects of Ideas

Scrapbox facilitates the identification of the felt sense an author has for a non-parallel symbol by presenting a summary of "where the non-parallel symbol is used" for that symbol.
- So don't [Auto Bracketing
    - Mixture of parallel symbols in a set of pages with links is detrimental
    - It's not about whether it's a string match, but whether it's consistent with the author's felt sense.
    - If it's a string match but you don't feel comfortable linking to it, the string side should change.
            - [[There are three patterns in the results of direct matching]]

The "integrity network" being created in 3 is related to the "author's emulator" spoken of in [[The weight of "read."]].

Thinking about this process from a digital perspective
- If the felt sense is a word2vec-like n-dimensional vector.
- There are 2^N ways to mix two felt senses.
- I don't know which one the author intended.
- Select from among the possible mixtures those that seem to be related (vectors are not orthogonal) when randomly sampled and matched.
