- The five objectives of 1on1 are set for the mentee's growth: strengthening relationships, promoting action and learning, motivating, sharing and facilitating information, and facilitating problem solving.
- The 1-on-1 is both a mentee time and an opportunity for the mentor to grow.
- The 1-on-1 format is not fixed and will be improved through dialogue with the mentee. Specific items such as physical assessment and goal review are also introduced.
- Many practical techniques are introduced, such as how to use teaching, coaching, and mentoring, and how to ask questions that help mentees verbalize their ideas.
- We will conduct a review every three months and improve the way 1on1 itself is conducted.

[Third-rate managers love "1-on-1" and listening. So what about top-notch leaders? | Mask of a Leader | Diamond Online](https://diamond.jp/articles/-/342672)

This article is based on the book "The Mask of a Leader" by Kodairo Ando, President of Sentaku. The main points are as follows
- Third-rate managers place too much emphasis on "1-on-1" and listening. Excessive leaning may inhibit the growth of subordinates.
- Consultations from subordinates should be limited to matters that cannot be decided by the authority of the subordinate or where the scope of the decision is unclear. Otherwise, subordinates should be allowed to make their own decisions.
- The relationship with subordinates is a relationship defined by company rules and should not be like a friendship.
- Leaders should set aside emotions, manage by rules, and be mindful of communication by "position".
- The five points on which leaders should focus are Rules, Position, Profit, Results, and Growth.
