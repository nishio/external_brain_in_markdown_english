- In the late 17th century, [[Newton (Sir Isaac)]] and [[Leibniz (German newspaper)]] independently formulated the integral
- 1730 [[de moivre]] was [Sterling's formula [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AA%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%81%AE%E8%BF%91%E](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AA%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%81%AE%E8%BF%91%E) 4%BC%BC] #Stirling's formula Found
- In 1773, de Moivre formulated [[normal distribution]] as an approximation of [binomial distribution
    - Binomial distribution becomes normal with n → ∞
        - [[Laplace.]] elaborated, this approximation is called [Laplace's theorem
- 1838 [[Poisson distribution]], mathematician [[Simeon Denis Poisson]].
    - When p is small enough, the binomial distribution can be approximated by a Poisson distribution

- 1922 [Central Limit Theorem](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E5%BF%83%E6%A5%B5%E9%99%90%E5%AE%9A%E7%90%86) #Central Limit Theorem
