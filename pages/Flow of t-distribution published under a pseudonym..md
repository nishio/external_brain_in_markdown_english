William Sealy [[Gosset]] (William Sealy Gosset)
- The t-distribution was discovered by William Sealy Gossett, a researcher at the Irish brewing company Guinness.
- Gossett was researching statistical methods to improve the efficiency of quality control of raw materials and products at Guinness.

Guinness' [[confidentiality]] policy
- Guinness imposed strict restrictions on the writing and publication of research papers to prevent employees from giving competitors an advantage by publishing their research results.
- Therefore, when Gossett published his paper on t-distribution, he was not allowed to use his own real name.

Adoption of the pseudonym "Student."
- Gossett, using the pseudonym "Student," published his paper "The Probable Error of a Mean" in 1908.
- In this paper, we present the "[[t-distribution]]" which allows statistical estimation even when the sample is small.

Importance of t-distribution
- The t-distribution proposed by Gossett provided an effective method for estimating population means based on small sample size data.
- Today, it is widely used as a basic tool in statistics, including hypothesis testing and the calculation of confidence intervals.

「Student's t-distribution」
- After Gossett's pseudonym "Student," the distribution he discovered became known as "Student's t-distribution.
- In fact, it resulted in his pen name being more widely known than his real name.
