- Cases of [[intellectual production]] in the process of transferring data from other media to [Scrapbox
- I tend to think it's a hassle and can't be transferred mechanically.
- Especially when the source of information is digital, we tend to think that we can't just copy and paste.
- But the subject of intellectual production is the human being, not the data.
- Once you have your own output data
    - In the process of passing this information through the body again, development by [[suggestion]], [[refinement]], and [[coupling]] with other information takes place.
- Lose that opportunity by copying and pasting mechanically.
- Data that cannot pay the cost of going through you again is useless, so you don't have to import it.
    - [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]] p.99 "[[The process of creation deepens understanding.]]" also explained why it is better to create your own learning content instead of trying to find and download it [[Craik&Tulving 1975]] as a basis for explaining why it is better to create your own learning content instead of trying to find and download it.
