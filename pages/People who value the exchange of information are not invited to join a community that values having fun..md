title: "People who value the exchange of information are not invited to join a community that values having fun."

- People who see [[information exchange]] as a [[community value]] are not invited to [[Community]], where [[having fun]] is a community value.
- Never invite someone for the purpose of "taking information", even if the process of having fun may unexpectedly lead to an interesting exchange of information.
- Even if you can "provide information," it does not directly contribute to "having fun.
- I don't enjoy playing with the type of people who think they should be respected for being "informed."

Go to a community where the exchange of information is a community value.


[[community values]].
- [[Strengths of weak ties]]
