Is it not good to lose face?
- In the process of change, people who liked it before the change should change their faces to austere or dismayed faces, but we don't understand it because we only recognize it in numbers.
    - Maybe [[The Devil of Approval]] is not one individual, but a form of "the faceless multitude."
    - It reminded me of "My name is Legion, for there are many of us."

    - Hmmm, I don't get the feeling that you're too caught up in the approval process with the original.
    - Arrangement: [[The demon of approval takes the form of a faceless multitude of admirers.]]

- [[Much Admiration]] goes crazy when it looks like a number.

The word "approval" alone doesn't distinguish between wanting approval from a specific individual and wanting approval from an unspecified number of people.
- Language resolution is low.
- When you feel happy to be approved by an unspecified number of people, you are being enchanted by the devil.
