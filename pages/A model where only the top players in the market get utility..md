title: "A model where only the top players in the market get utility."

- Context: [[Optimizing the allocation of time for learning]]
- Ah, a model where only the [[top player]] in [[(the) market (as a concept)]] gets the [[effect]], that's surprisingly interesting. One would think that the non-linear effect would affirm specialization in a particular domain because the points of contact would be far apart, but a strategy could be established to create a niche by multiplying multiple domains to make it easier to get to the top. Interesting. #Multi-domain niche-top strategy
    - Model where only the top players in the market get utility = [[one-size-fits-all market]] #WTA

    - nishio> The preliminary stage was a flatter image. My first image of an example where only the market leader could get utility was a professional chess player or a professional gamer.
    - tokoroten> I think it's personal salary based, the vertical axis. On a corporate value basis, I think the front end would be much flatter. Because the strength of a company is that it can multiply more multiple domains than an individual.
    - nishio> Ah, I see, the first part becomes [[fat tail]] due to the effect of [[minimum wage]] or the effect of increased [[recruitment and training costs]] if it is too low and they get away with it.
