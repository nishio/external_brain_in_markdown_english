- Some people believe that it is in the red ocean that the best talents are honed, and that "[[one]] has to become someone" is like a [[curse]]. It was also argued that there is much to be learned even in the "mamori" stage of "[[shuhari]].
- Although there are some who do not think it is a good idea to stray from the "path," those who create the "path" must want many people to participate in it. However, some point out that it is problematic to easily associate the "path" with identity.

This is the language that was used to describe them.
>  Internal activities and their evaluation do not establish an identity, so we seek it outside the company.

- >  I remember when people were raising their hands in the air.

- >  This is the same as saying, "Programming is not valued fairly within the company, so I want to develop OSS that is valued fairly. I thought.

>  If it was "10,000 yen a month," people would rush here because it would be easy to do and feel a sense of identity.

>  But in reality, it's fucking hard to get a "$10,000/month side job", on the contrary, there are plenty of "$100,000/month side jobs": ......

>  >tokoroten: The "road" is a convenient way to establish identity, and ... This is the trap, the red ocean.
> [ryushi](https://twitter.com/ryushi/status/1773941414281523250) I think you should walk your own personal path, going back and forth here and there on a road that leads somewhere. Maybe you should try buckwheat noodle making, or bonsai, or guitar. There's a lot to learn and a lot of fun to be had just by joining a community.
> [ryushi](https://twitter.com/ryushi/status/1773941417053970928) I believe that the need to be something is just a misconception and a kind of curse. Life is enriched just by being able to recognize someone who is superior in some area as superior.

> [dmikurube](https://twitter.com/dmikurube/status/1773887966869635411) When you say this, then, just because you stop going into the "path", it's just one more person below mediocre who can't even "defend" himself!

> [dmikurube](https://twitter.com/dmikurube/status/1773898376276513105) The one who builds the system (the road) is rather building the road with the intention of getting more people to come in, so just get on the road you can get on. It's okay to be on the road that can be taken. It's just that just being on the path may not be enough to call it an identity, but it's not...

> [dmikurube](https://twitter.com/dmikurube/status/1773898915596960124) If you don't get on the road and go in your own direction from scratch, it's about as good as getting into conspiracy theories.

> [dmikurube](https://twitter.com/dmikurube/status/1773970340278067258) If you try anything, and ask for help, you will get something out of it. If you want, it's worth it just to be able to think, "There is a deep world out there that I couldn't reach, but there is a deep world out there.

> [dmikurube](https://twitter.com/dmikurube/status/1773970548848259077) It is unfortunate to superimpose one's identity on other things, just like anything else. I think that there is a religious community that gives religious guidance to people who want to "superimpose their identity on other people's identity," and I wonder if there is anything that can be done about that.


> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1773933275616293175) tokoroten are not good at getting on the road, so relatively speaking, the difference between "the cost of moving on the road" and "the cost of moving off the road" shrinks and they are running off the road. Most people have lower travel costs on the road (Civ).

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1773936665486405840) get on the road → throw it away because I don't understand → [[suddenly understand it years later]].

>  all the time, so by the time you understand it, you're not on the road: ......

> [dmikurube](https://twitter.com/dmikurube/status/1773946411408818468) Well, "suddenly understanding after a few years" is like that, isn't it? From the side of those who maintain the road, it is good if more people understand it, even if it takes some time. It may be unwilling if people find their identity in it.
