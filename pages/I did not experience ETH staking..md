title: "I did not experience ETH staking."
---

It's been a year since I wrote in my memo, "I want to experience [[ETH Staking]]."
I turned it off.

The application you write about that seems to be easy to do? but stopped without a clear error message, so I lost motivation and left it alone.

According to people who have actually experienced it, it does indeed work properly, but it seems that protocol? updates occur, and they are required to properly update their environment accordingly.
Maybe what I stumbled upon was a protocol? I think I stumbled because I tried to update the protocol? Maybe I stumbled because I tried it in a state where the update of the app did not follow the update of the protocol.

After all, this is a system that rewards you for your work as an engineer who keeps maintaining the system.
So that's what you're getting paid for doing the labor to maintain the Ethereum infrastructure.

They say the rewards are going down because there are enough staking nodes.
Well, it will get less and less difficult and more and more people will join in!
If it's harder, fewer providers, more engineers' share.
If it were easy, there would be more providers, more competition among services, and more share for the capitalists.
Things will get easier.

Ether, which I had left alone after changing it to experience staking, where I plugged it into the appropriate Staking-as-a-service.
- [[Binance]].
- You left your account open when [[STEPN]].

In addition, capital gains were by far the largest.
