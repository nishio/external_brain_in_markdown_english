Nodal point of thought 2024-05-11
- [[singularity]]
- I think it was after Kurzweil's book in 2005 that I heard the term
- I'm in my late 20s.
- Metaphor for [air resistance
    - Since air resistance increases with increasing speed, it is more significant for objects moving at high speeds.
- We thought at the time that the higher the speed of change, the greater the resistance, so at a certain speed it will be in equilibrium.
    - Speed of falling raindrops

Thoughts now in 2024
- [[Fallacy of approximating society by homogeneity]].
    - [[approximating an expanse by a point]].
        - [[Different things belonging to the same thing]]
        - [[Identifying things that are not equal and cannot be identified by increasing differences]]
- There are people in society with greater and lesser resistance.
- The magnitude of resistance is affected by, for example
    - cognitive ability
    - available time
    - disposable income
- As a result, society is stretched because it produces fast and slow people.
    - [[Stretched]]

By May 2023, "society will be stretched.
- [[torn]]
    - [[Torn of the world]].
As of May 2024
- Tearing down will create opportunities for [[connecting business]].
- So don't worry about it.
    - [Fixing things after they break is more valued than preventing them.
        - Whether that's a good idea or not is beside the point.
        - It doesn't help that people are stupid.
        - Social costs incurred by stupidity
- The "loss-making position" and the "gain-making position" are created.
    - It is important not to keep standing in a position where you are "losing money".
        - [[Don't stop where the tsunami is coming from]].
                - [[flood of tsunamis]]
    - It's not [[the ability to understand]] enough to know where the position is a loss.
            - [[A sucker is someone who doesn't know who is a sucker.]]

[[dropout]] and [[stretchout]].
    - [[Need to raise the bottom line?]]
    - [[overextend the top]]
    - [[Formation of early adopter groups]]
- Where it is profitable to trade depends on the situation.
    - Abundant resources can be distributed to many people.
        - Abundance of things that can be duplicated
    - Rare resources are sold to the highest buyers.
[[Cost Structure Changes]]
    - [[Time of Life]]
