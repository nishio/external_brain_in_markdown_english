Appropriate level of abstraction for groupware in the LLM era
Summary: In the age of LLM, the current level of abstraction in groupware may not be appropriate and may need to be closer to customer operations.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>

- [What I thought while listening to the last session of Matsuo Lab Summer School 2023 Large-Scale Language Models.
- Groupware is an abstraction of each company's "business" and provides services for the common parts.
- Its design was abstracted based on the perception of the world before the advent of LLM
- I don't see how the appropriate abstraction layer in the with LLM era is where it is now...
- Cybozu has the advantage of stocking the correspondence between [[data and communication]].
- But the current abstraction may not be correct regarding how to leverage that correspondence to create customer value.
- Maybe I need to get closer to customer operations.
- Considering the addition of LLM functionality as a generic feature based on the current product design implicitly assumes the current level of abstraction
