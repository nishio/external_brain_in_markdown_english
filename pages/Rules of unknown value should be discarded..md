title: "Rules of unknown value should be discarded."

- A [[rule]] is a [[constraint]]. A rule is created at a time when it is better to have a rule. But rules are maintained even after they lose their value due to the thought that "that is the rule. Optimization under unnecessary constraints will not yield the correct solution. Rules whose value is not clear must be discarded.
