It is a lot of work to convert a video with a lot of Japanese explanations into English, but I tried it because it is easy to convert a video that has only the intro and outro in Japanese into English by replacing only those parts. If there is Japanese in the intro, people who don't understand Japanese will just watch the intro and leave without watching the main video.
