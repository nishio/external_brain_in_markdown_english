<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Digital identity in this context refers to information or attributes that identify or recognize an individual online. Specifically, it includes the following elements

Main Elements
- personal information
    - Information that directly identifies the user, such as name, email address, phone number, etc.
- Online Activity History
    - Data such as browsing history, purchase history, social media posts and likes.
- Authentication Information
    - Login information via password or biometrics (e.g., facial recognition, fingerprint data).
- digital attribute
    - Profiles derived from data analysis, including preferences, interests, values, and behavior patterns.
- Blockchain and distributed ID
    - A new form of identity that allows users to manage and share their data in a self-sovereign form.

significance
Project Liberty's focus is to return these digital identities to the control of the individual. Currently, many platforms (e.g., Google, Facebook) collect users' digital identities and leverage them for profit. For this reason, Project Liberty aims to create a system where individuals can decide "who owns the data and how to use it".

Simply put, digital identity = [[one's online alter ego]], and the goal of this project is to enable people to manage it for themselves.

impressions
- I have wondered whether the word [[identity]] in this context refers to [[self-identity]] from the perspective of the self, [[social role]] from the perspective of others, or [[means of authentication]] from a technological perspective.
- Accumulation of behavioral data in digital space is a social role of others' perspectives and can also be used as a means of authentication

- In digital space communication, B doesn't have direct access to X, so Z becomes Y when there's a discrepancy between X and Y.
