Summary: The Japanese phrase "the reader is me" is used by writers as the primary audience for their writing, "the[[Future self]] 」を想定し、その視点で文章を作成していることを示す。<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I would like to explain the concept of "self" in Japanese to an English-speaking person who is not familiar with Japan. In particular, about the interpretation of the short phrase "the reader is me". I feel this is a nuanced difference from "the reader of this article is me, not you.

The word "myself" is a pronoun with a very complex concept in Japanese. It is similar to reflexive pronouns such as "myself" and "yourself" in English, but often has different usage situations and nuances.

Considering the phrase "the reader is myself," it sounds like "the reader is oneself" or "the reader is myself" in English, which may seem a bit unnatural to English speakers.

The idea behind this phrase is based on the concept of "self" in Japanese culture and language. Japanese people often think of themselves in relation to others, including themselves. Therefore, the expression "the reader is me" is meant to emphasize the reader's own involvement with content such as articles or stories, or how that content affects the reader himself/herself.

The phrase "the reader of this article is me, not you" emphasizes the distance between the narrator and the reader, while the phrase "the reader is me" encourages the reader to become more involved and sympathetic to the story or article.

When explaining this concept to an English-speaking person, it is important to understand the background and nuances of the Japanese word "self" and its culture.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT/icon' alt='GPT.icon' height="19.5"/>
I am sorry. I will ask again for more details.

The phrase "the reader is me" often implies that the reader of a text or story is directly involved in, or is a major player in, its content. For example, it means that the instructions, advice, or events in the story are directly related to the "reader = me".

This expression has nuances that encourage the reader to become deeply involved and proactive in its content.

For example, if an article on health says "readers should take care of themselves," this means "you (the reader) should take care of your own body," a message that would require direct action from the reader.

To explain these nuances to an English-speaking person, one might say, "The reader is oneself" or "You, the reader, are the subject."

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I see that "I" is neither I nor You.

Yes, you are right. Myself" is a pronoun unique to Japanese, and depending on the context and situation, can correspond to many English pronouns such as "I," "you," "he," "she," "we," and "they." The Japanese word "myself" is often used when the subject or object is not clear or automatically understood from the context.

For example, if you say to a friend, "I want you to take care of yourself," this means "I want you to take care of yourself." On the other hand, if you think about yourself and say, "I want to understand myself better," this "myself" corresponds to "I" or "myself."

So, the sentence "The reader is myself" refers to the reader himself/herself, and depending on the context and situation, will often be equivalent to "you. However, it is important to understand the unique nuances of the Japanese word "myself" and the context in which it is used, rather than translating it as "you" as is.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>When you say "the reader is you," the "you" is not YOU.
It means that the writer should write with himself/herself as the reader as a way of feeling when writing.

Understood. The expression "the reader is me" implies that the writer should write as if he or she were the reader of his or her own text and content.

This concept can be viewed as an approach that allows the writer to take a deeper, more personal view of the content and create a more sympathetic writing style. By assuming the writer's own identity as the reader, the message to the reader will be more direct and persuasive.

When explaining this concept to English speakers, it may be easier to explain with phrases such as "When writing, consider yourself as the reader." or "Write as if you are the reader."

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
Hmmm, I still think there is a problem with the separation of I and you." I don't mean to say "Write as if you are the reader.", I mean that I write that way because I prefer to write that way.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT/icon' alt='GPT.icon' height="19.5"/>
My apologies, I understand again.

The phrase "I am the reader" indicates that the writer is aware that "I perceive my writing as if I were the reader, and I write from that perspective."

In this case, the English explanation would be something like "I write with the mindset that I am the reader." or "I approach my writing as though I am its reader." This expression indicates the writer's thoughts and awareness of the way he or she approaches his or her writing.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Hmmm, that's also a bit different. When a writer writes, the point of view is not on the reader's side. It feels like the intended reader is your future self.

I see, thank you for pointing that out.

If we explore the meaning of the phrase "the reader is me" a little more closely, we get the sense that the writer envisions his or her "future self" as the primary reader of the text. In other words, the writer constructs the text in such a way that its content will be useful and understandable to him or her when he or she reads it again later.

This concept can be explained in English as follows:: "The

"When I write, I envision my primary reader to be my future self."

or

"I write with my future self as the intended reader."

This way of thinking is useful in the context of self-reflection and self-development, as a technique for clarifying one's thoughts and feelings and later reading them back to understand oneself more deeply.

Well, I feel that the English sentence seems to convey what you want to say. Think step by step.

When considering the difference between "myself" in Japanese and pronouns in English, it is necessary to take into account not only differences in language but also differences in culture and thought. Below is a step-by-step discussion.

Language reflections:.

Japanese is a language in which context is extremely important. Often, subjects and pronouns are omitted. For this reason, the ability to extract meaning from context is required.
English, on the other hand, is relatively context-independent, and the information contained in sentences is often explicit.
Versatility of "self":.

The Japanese word "myself" can correspond to many English pronouns, including "I," "you," "he/she," and "we." This versatility is one of the factors that give rise to expressions such as "the reader is me.
Acceptance of ambiguity:.

In Japanese culture, ambiguity is sometimes considered a virtue, and there is a preference for indirect expressions over direct ones.
Clarity and concreteness are often emphasized in English-speaking cultures.
Relevance to self-perception:.

In Japanese culture, reflection and self-awareness are often emphasized. As a result, reflection on one's own subject and facing oneself are considered virtues.
In English-speaking countries, individualism is often emphasized, and assertiveness and self-expression are often encouraged.
How to perceive time:.

The idea of "the reader is me" involves a relationship to the passage of time. This may be related to the way time is perceived in Japanese culture and religion, especially in relation to the past and future.
In English-speaking cultures, there is a tendency to emphasize the present.
The combination of these elements is thought to create a unique "reader is me" mindset and expression.
