Blame [[tool]] for [[use]] being wrong
- P1 creates a new one X
- P2 misidentifies it as a variant of the existing Y
- P3 reminds us that it is not a good idea to use X (like Y) for Z purposes.
- P4 abstracts [[Objective.]] to say "X is not good"

Formalization:
Leap from "∃Z : Bad(X|Z)" to "∀p : Bad(X|p)" (premature generalization) + "X ≈ Y" misclassification + sometimes strawmanning.

Related Fallacies
- False analogy/categorical error (X→Y mis-mapping)
- [Premature Generalization
    - [[straw man argument]] (paste Y issues into X)
- (Disadvantages of the use = disadvantages of the main body, replaced by the purpose-measure confusion)

GPT5 naming
- [[misidentification -> all-identification cascade]]
- [[strawman alliteration]]
- [[Body of application risk]]
