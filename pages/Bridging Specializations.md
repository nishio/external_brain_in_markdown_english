In 2018, a concept emerged as a derivative of [[The Illustrated Guide to a Ph.D.]], expressed with the term "[[The Gap Between Specializations]]."
- [[The Assumption of Being a Circle]]

Specializations often undergo self-reinforcing feedback, becoming very deep.
- Fields are high-dimensional, with attention focused on very limited areas.
- Thus, the "[[Areas Accessible to Humanity]]" become [[Spiky Structures in High-Dimensional Space]].
- By [[Connecting the Spikes]], there is a potential to significantly expand the "areas accessible to humanity."
- When one side is a local domain, it is sometimes referred to as [[Social Implementation]].
- As of December 2024, [[o1 Pro]] is perceived to be very effective in this specialization bridging.
    - [[Having o1 Pro Use PICSY+Birdwatch]]
