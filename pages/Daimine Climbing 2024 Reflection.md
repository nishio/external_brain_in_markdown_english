My right knee hurt again.

    - climber's tights
    - Preliminary morass

I should have bought lunch in advance and brought food with me.
- Wasn't it the lack of energy that made you dizzy on the way down?
- Base bread and Widerin jelly at 6 am, 2 dumplings before noon, descent 7 pm.

I didn't feel a lack of water because the teahouse offered tea rather than the other way around.
- Maybe a +1 500mm sports drink would be nice.

I should have removed the insoles from my climbing shoes and dried them after descending the mountain.
- However, there is a theory that footwear is better in the first place

stretch
- Right thigh front is so tight
    - Pre- and post-stretching, but only the lower half of the body is stretched.
- Stiff ankles, too.
- Where the knee should be softened and cushioned,
When it started to hurt to bend my knees, I switched to "landing with my knees extended" and it clicked.
- Maybe you need to learn how to move your body before and after your knee hurts.
