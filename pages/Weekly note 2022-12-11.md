- [[What is a weekly journal?]]
- Diary-like pages that stay on the same page for a week
- When the quantity is too large, it is cut out as needed.
- We'll do it manually for a while, there's no need to rush to automate something that's about 50 sheets to what?

from [/villagepump/2022/12/10](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/2022/12/10)
- I want to move the above Cybozu-style series to Scrapbox.
    - ✅ [[How to learn mathematics]]
    - I want to fix the broken link in the image of the [[technium (Tc)]] story [[Technology and Innovation Explained]].
    - This is a leftover from the days when PDFs were converted to images and then placed on your own server instead of on Gyazo.
    - This is what happened when Chrome started rejecting HTTP images for embedding into HTTPS services.
- Commentary on BERT when it came out 4 years ago, now that ChatGPT has taken off, it's "I didn't think this would happen 4 years ago", but I just put the link to the PDF, so I want to make it a little better.
        - [[BERT and Transformer]]
    - Or an explanation of the attention mechanism used in Stable Diffusion, etc.
- Did I download all the Slideshare PDFs in the first place?
    - These "broken image links" and "just put a link to a PDF" types.
        - I guess the best thing to do now is to put it in Gyazo.
- Increased desire to organize information
    - [/villagepump/ appropriate cut-outs are determined after the purpose of the reuse is determined](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/ appropriate cut-outs are determined after the purpose of the reuse is determined).
    - [/villagepump/ search to fly to it and then hang around in the related links to find it](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/ search to fly to it and then hang around in the related links to find it).
- On the personal project side, the diary page is being generated as empty.
    - Do you think we could reprint the diary here?
    - Mission to clean [[Black stains in bathroom]] with [spring cleaning
    - [/villagepump/bathroom cleaning](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/bathroom cleaning).
