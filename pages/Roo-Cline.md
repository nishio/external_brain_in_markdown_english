old title: Roo-Cline
- One of the many derivations of [Cline
    - Yasuno-san used it, so I copied him.
2025-01-25 I noticed that the name was changed to [[Roo Code]].

> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1876296301383766196) Cline is a VSCode extension and coding assistant, but it integrates well with VSCode and seamlessly puts Cline is a VSCode extension and coding assistant, and it integrates well with VSCode. Cline can also be integrated with MCP, so you can view your browser, Slack, and so on.

> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1876296910497353904) It has become the role of human engineers to watch the development at blazing speed while making tweaks on the side. Seriously, I think the productivity of coding has increased about 10 times.

> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1876297217700712682) And since we are doing so well as of [[Sonnet 3.5]], if o3 level agents come in, the majority of engineers usually won't be able to win. I think the majority of engineers will not be able to compete if o3-level agents enter the market. I feel like we already have most of the elemental technologies we need, so this has a crazy good chance of happening within 2025.

> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1876297847118995627) Of course there is more work to be done. I would like to have different agents out according to cleverness and task characteristics. I'd like to see Sonnet 3.5 be good for agent behavior, Deepseek for cheapness, and consult o1 when I want a wise guy here and there, or something like that, on its own.

> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1876298688534028423) I feel your pain in this area.
>  ・Importance of incorporating this into the usual communication that occurs
>  ・Convenience of having the context that humans are looking at shared on their own
>  ・Automatically accumulate knowledge that had become tacit in feedback communication, UX
>  ・The power of MCP collaboration
>  ・The power of automatic command execution

> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1876300177432260998) So you're an AI surpriseer, no seriously, I'm impressed.

> [kyutaro15](https://x.com/kyutaro15/status/1876297405282594890) Cline is good! I like the derivative plugin Roo-Cline!

> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1876298961369350414) I wrote Cline but I use roo cline too!

> [kyutaro15](https://x.com/kyutaro15/status/1876301598986829963) I see that you are also a Roo-Cline, Yasuno-san! I'm so glad to hear that, because it really is too much of a world apart. I hope you have a wonderful year 2025, Yasuno-san!
