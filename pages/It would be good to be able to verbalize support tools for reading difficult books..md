<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It would be good to be able to verbalize support tools for reading difficult books.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "reading" is that "reading"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Those who have a superficial view of the difficult text will "slip their eyes" and be left with nothing, but I want to make sure that some sort of felt sense is formed instead of just that.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "eye-slip" is that "eye-slip"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Some people read too fast; they have to read slowly if they can't read and understand something at normal speed, but they can't consciously switch gears to a slower speed
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "gear" is that "gear"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>A "gear" that switches speeds and needs to be switched depending on the situation, different from the gas pedal and brake.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is its "speed"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>The speed of following the text exceeds the speed of understanding, which means that understanding is skipped in the middle of the text, and the input is received in skips and jumps, which is more difficult to understand than reading slowly.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about its "speed"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>If you just want to slow down, you can do that without any support tools. You can copy or read aloud. What's not enough is to enhance temporary memory.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is its "speed"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>üëçSupport Tools
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "support tool" is this "support tool"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Reading slowly takes time and reduces the range of memory persistence in the length of the input text. This makes it impossible to find relationships between long-distance descriptions. The reading becomes localized and superficial. This is like extracting a phrase that strikes you and writing it down without regard to context.

- >  If you just want to slow down, you can do that without any support tools. You can copy or read aloud. What it lacks is temporary memory enhancement.
- Is there anything else you can tell us about this "support tool"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Therefore, support tools need to have the ability to extend the duration of memory.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Where are these "support tools" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I think Kozaneba is mostly that. I've never taken it that way before, I've never explained it, but when I read esoteric philosophers or try to sort through unfamiliar descriptions, I naturally activate Kozaneba because I implicitly understand its usefulness.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  So support tools need to have the ability to extend the duration of memory.
- Where can I find this "support tool"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Now it's basically what you use on a PC.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  So support tools need to have the ability to extend the duration of memory.
- How do you know about this "support tool"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>What features are missing for Kozaneba to become a reading support tool: chopping and not too much
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I want to go further by strengthening my cognitive functions. I use Kozaneba when reading difficult books. It will be easier to do so if I can compensate for the missing functions. If Kozaneba is improved, my cognitive function will be strengthened even more. This is the value.

- Where do these "support tools" come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Add functionality to Kozaneba
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "Kozaneba" is this "Kozaneba"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Can move fragments, draw lines between them, and organize them.

- What do you hope will happen regarding this "support tool"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Hope it works well.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to the "support tools" for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I'll have to try it out and test it out.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  Add functionality to Kozaneba
- Is there anything else you can tell us about this "Kozaneba"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Well, there's some bug fixes and stuff, and we'll be back to reworking it for a while.

- >  If you just want to slow down, you can do that without any support tools. You can copy or read aloud. What it lacks is temporary memory enhancement.
- How do you know what this "speed" is?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Indeed. That would be a nice feature to have in the support tools too.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What does that "support tool" look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Jet engines? [If the speed of comprehension itself is increased with the help of tools, the bottleneck is eliminated, and the whole thing can go faster. Will it allow me to move forward?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Where does that "speed" come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Maybe the tool itself could be a pacemaker to control the speed while watching comprehension.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen with respect to its "speed"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It is good to be at the appropriate speed. It is difficult for people who have not learned how to do this, and even if they have, it is burdensome, for people who are subjected to the cognitive load of reading to simultaneously observe their own cognition from a third-party perspective and control it at the appropriate speed. Computers should manage this.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to "velocity" for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I need a method to measure whether it's too fast or too slow.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
