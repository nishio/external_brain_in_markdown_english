Oh, I guess I had to write "people who do only one thing" instead of "people who do only one thing," or it wouldn't have been a tendon.

In the words of the first Matz, writing code is "grounding" [[even if]].
I don't think it's enough to have feet on the ground; having only one specialty is just as unstable as standing on one leg. I think you should [[stand on two legs]].
