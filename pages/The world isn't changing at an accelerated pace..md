title: "The world isn't changing at an accelerated pace."

Assuming the world isn't changing at an accelerated rate, I think we can come up with a consistent explanation.

- The world is changing at a constant rate.
- Individuals must first
    - A1: Born with almost nothing, [[catch-up]] ([[adapt]]) to the current world at a tremendous pace, and then [[catch-up]] ([[adapt]]) to the current world at a tremendous pace.
    - A2: After a certain period of continuous adaptation to changes in the world
    - A3: [[adaptability]] to changes in the world will decline, they won't be able to catch up, and they will die.
    - Looking at this from Individual A's perspective, it appears that the world change accelerated from A2 to A3.
- Even if individual A behaves that way, another individual B or C is supplied one after another, so that nothing in particular has changed for the whole set of humanity.
    - Even though more and more cells are being born and more and more dying in the human body, not much has changed on a human basis.
        - Skin cells die in about 28 days, but human appearance is not particularly changed in about 28 days

Since there is no particular material in this discussion that reinforces that the world is not accelerating, a hybrid interpretation is possible: the world is accelerating, but it is also being misinterpreted as being more accelerated than it actually is due to the decline of individual adaptive capacity.

[[world changes]].
[[World changing fast]]
