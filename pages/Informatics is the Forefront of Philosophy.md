> Whereas traditional philosophical discussions were conducted at the conceptual level, the American-developed [[Analytic Philosophy]] began efforts to make discussions more precise. Now, with the powerful tool of computers, [[Philosophical Discussions can be Empirically Refined]]. This ability will significantly influence the future of philosophy. If this modest book can indicate that starting point, nothing could be better.

- I think that [[Augmenting Human Intelligence with Computers]] is the path civilization will take, and I don't mind if some disagree. However, I don't pay much attention to those who think otherwise.
