I answered "I don't intend to be interested in Web3," but I felt that this was a difference in perspective, that is, I recognized "centralization of computing by machines" as a part of the history of computer evolution and did not see it as a feature of Web3.

It's better to have the concept of variables", "Writing to the Ethereum chain is slow, so there is Polygon", "Oh, memory is slow, so there is cache".

Then objects and member variables are created, access control of member variables is created, and things like "after specifying in the constructor, it becomes readonly" become possible, and so on. That's true.
