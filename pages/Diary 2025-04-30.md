I don't see how an OSS project can proceed differently depending on the status of the project.
- A few developers have to set the direction of something that is just being born until it is clear enough.
    - > If there is no related Issue, please create a new Issue first
    - >  Please post your implementation plan and get the support (reactions) from the maintainer and other developers before you start.
        - [https://github.com/digitaldemocracy2030/idobata/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/digitaldemocracy2030/idobata/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)
        - I get the sense that you're trying to control it very tightly.
- Some conditions are safe to swallow anything and everything.
    - If you're enthusiastic enough to want to make it, you might as well have it done.
    - This condition leads to "[[a TV remote control with a lot of buttons]]".
    - As long as the main function of "watching TV" is completed, you can go ahead and add more buttons.
- Shikinen Shikinen Refactoring] at the appropriate time?


e2e test, go ahead and do it!
