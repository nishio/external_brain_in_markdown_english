- I stopped using ChatGPT / GPT4/ GPT3.5 because it became too much trouble
- Initially, a distinction was made between Playground completion and ChatGPT conversations.
- Later [[GPT-4]] came along and I felt like expressing the difference as well.
- The ChatGPT Plugin came out, and it seems that the model behind the scenes is not identical, making the distinction meaningless.

- I think the notation is still GPT4, but changed to GPT4-turbo.

    - If you're chatting, it's usually ChatGPT (miscellaneous).

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/ChatGPT/icon' alt='ChatGPT.icon' height="19.5"/>GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) is a large-scale natural language generation model developed by [[OpenAI]]. It achieves high accuracy in natural language processing tasks because it employs a deep learning method called [[Transformer]]. GPT is used for a variety of tasks, including document generation and dialogue system construction.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/ChatGPT/icon' alt='ChatGPT.icon' height="19.5"/>[[GPT-3]] (Generative Pretrained Transformer 3) is the latest version of GPT, which is even larger and has more training data than the previous version of the model, allowing for even higher accuracy in natural language processing tasks. GPT-3 also supports many different tasks and is used not only for document generation and dialogue system construction, but also for translation and semantic interpretation of sentences.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/ChatGPT/icon' alt='ChatGPT.icon' height="19.5"/>[[ChatGPT]] is a dialogue model developed by OpenAI, which is an extension of GPT-3 and specialized for building dialogue systems. It has a high capacity to understand natural language, and is capable of generating natural and appropriate responses to user input. In addition, by using training data specifically designed for natural language processing tasks, the model achieves high accuracy and high speed.
