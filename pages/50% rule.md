title: "50% rule"

>  "Within the scope of the R&D areas set by [[Cybozu Labs]], it is guaranteed that you can devote at least 50% of your work time to R&D themes that you set yourself. In a nutshell, we say, 'You can do whatever you want half the time,' but if you look closely, you may be doing what you like 100% of the time (laughs)" (Aono) [src](https://japan.cnet.com/article/20367070/2/).

An expansion that mimics Google's [[20% rule]].
