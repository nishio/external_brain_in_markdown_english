    - 1: Write about something you don't know
        - Write a hypothesis about what you don't know
        - What do I not know, what do I need to find out, where might I find the material, etc.?
    - 2: Write when you know something new
        - Write when you find out something you don't know.
    - 3: Write to explain to others what you know
        - I'm not writing about something I already know very well.
        - When you try to give someone else an explanation you have written in the past, sometimes a word is used that the person does not know.
            - Word links are empty.
            - It's like, "No, I'm going to have to explain this to you."
            - Write a minimal description to connect the path.
            - I'll copy and paste the description from Wikipedia or something and post the link.
    - I don't think I can write about something I know absolutely nothing about.
- All accompanied by intellectual production activities.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/はるひ/icon' alt='/villagepump/はるひ.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Research, teach others, formulate hypotheses


- [[Research -> Summarize -> Have someone check it out]]
