title: "Is review ability a questionable technology?"

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1786920324870946899) "[[The ability to review]] is [[the skill to doubt]], the missing piece in schooling."
>  I got a radio wave that said.
>
>  As one's experience in the field increases, one becomes able to review from the perspective of "if it were me, I would do it this way,
>  I think you could take a shortcut if you learned the skill of "doubt" in the first place.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1786941109995991129) I feel the need to describe the concept of "[[doubt]]" with higher resolution, but aside from that, my first thought when I saw this post was "doubt about [[the basic premise of educating humans]]". I'm not sure if it is more efficient to have LLMs acquire the skills to doubt humans than to have humans acquire the skills to doubt humans.

> [hrjn](https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1786960377684869524) My personal opinion is that a review is not about doubting, but [[a systematic check]].
>
>  There are two main types of requirements: "formal requirements" and "content requirements. Formal requirements are whether the format, style, and chapters are in order. The content requirement is whether the conclusions, logic, and rationale are sufficient.
> [hrjn](https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1786960978946732323) I would have a hard time being reviewed for this.
>
>  Formal requirements are a technique for arranging the necessary information in a readable manner. This is really hard to do if it's not consistent within an organization. These are rules, not experience. Even though experience helps to determine the rules.
> [hrjn](https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1786961518791479710) The content requirement must first be checked to see if the conclusion has the necessary content. If there is no necessary conclusion in the first place, it must be rejected. This is a question of necessity, not experience.
>
>  Requirements definition issues.
> [hrjn](https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1786962141406454130) Next, it is important that the subdivisions necessary to derive that conclusion are made. whether it is MECE. A certain amount of experience works here. It is easier to notice discrepancies if you are used to seeing a variety of logic.
>
>  However, this is just something that is easy to notice through experience, not something that can be pointed out at random. Specific exceptional cases are needed.
> [hrjn](https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1786962614771474485) Finally, is the evidence correct? So-called fact-checking. This is also a world where experience works, but it is not something that can be done casually. It is necessary to state obvious errors or lack of evidence.
>
>  So the review can be done in a rather systematic way, but the efficiency depends on experience.
> [hrjn](https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1786963456949989575) In that sense, I feel like doubt is a trigger for pointing out something, not the essence of a reviewer...




> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1786692462700061162) Is there a place where I can work for a wage until I acquire the ability to review?
>  I guess it all comes down to the question, "What is the best way to get the most out of the system?

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1786964336600403988) If "a place to work while earning a wage" is "just compensation for labor, a wage sufficient to live on," then I think it will disappear. Even now, during the new employee training period, the "wage you receive" is not compensation for the "value created by your labor," so I think the weight of that form of payment will increase.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1786667114868375971) For example, does the AI-generated test code correctly represent the requirements?
>  checks, which are slightly different from the programming skills themselves.
>  It's going to be skills like requirements definition and modeling.

> [kumarobo](https://twitter.com/kumarobo/status/1786690009724252161) The question is whether there is a path that would allow us to review that experience in stride.

> [golden_lucky](https://twitter.com/golden_lucky/status/1786920415807602982) I think I am good at expressing requirements in my native language, but I don't think I can create a lot of value in this world. The reason is that I don't have anything in me that would be of value if I could give it shape. I am reminded of the fact that magic is a world of images.

> [otchy](https://twitter.com/otchy/status/1786881036443639951) I've thought this since the beginning of Copilot. I thought that the career path for juniors was becoming critical. Since then, I have been trying to find some kind of solution, but so far I have not come up with any good ideas.
>  I think we can still save the junior people, but it will be very hard for those who are still students.
