In composing the tree, there is a difference between going from general to special or from special to general.

- [[Jiro Kawakita]] argued that [[Classification.]] of data in [[top-down]] assumes [[Existing Structure]], which hinders the discovery of [[New Structure]]. He created the [[KJ method]], which emphasizes [[bottom-up]] assembly of data.

On the other hand, Buzan's [[mind-map]] and Barbara Minto's "The Art of Thinking and Writing" recommend a top-down tree structure.

The card itself is also assembled from the bottom up. First, concrete examples of blind spots that were noticed or perspectives that changed are collected, and then abstractions are made.
