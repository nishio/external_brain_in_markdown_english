title: "Blog post generation experiment from Scrapbox"
---

- In the context of [[Scrapbox Automatic Translation]], I wrote [[blu3mo]] about the idea that "GPT can be used to write instead of translate" ([[Blog text generation instead of translation]]).

I figured I'd factor it out and try "Japanese" "Scrapbox -> blog post" instead of "Japanese Scrapbox -> English blog post" first.
- I happened to have a bulleted list of fragments that I didn't feel like I had written everything I wanted to say, so I converted it.
- [[An experiment in having GPT create blog posts]].

Here is a memo for blog entry. Write draft in Japanese.

- [[Overestimation of the value of ideas]]
- I realized that I had a fragment of a writing after I converted it: `so I came up with my own`.
- GPT` because those feelings are the result of sticking to "what I have come up with. I saw that you generated ` and I thought, "That's a nice word," and wrote "stick to" back in the bulleted list.

- [[Inside perspective, outside perspective]]
- After converting it, I realized it was poorly worded and was interpreted differently than I assumed.
    - `When we look at it from the inside of the self` `Oh, that's how you interpret it, I was imagining the inside and outside of an organization or a community or something.
- I thought supplementing this and reconverting it would change it significantly, so I split the version.
- Updated ver. 2 bullet points in bulleted style based on ver. 1 blog post
- ver.1 bullet points -> ver.1 blog post -> ver.2 bullet points -> ver.2 blog post

- [[Voting is a contribution and a confidence builder]]
- ver.1 bullet points -> ver.1 blog post -> ver.2 bullet points
- A lot of text from the ver.1 blog post is used in the bullet points.
    - To begin with, there is an argument that an activity in the form of [[active reading]], "itemizing a sentence that is not itemized," is beneficial.

impressions
- Turning this iteration around is quite beneficial to [deepen one's thought
- Bullet points are like drawings.
    - I just took a rough shape.
- By putting it in the form of a sentence, you'll notice that you forgot to mention important context or that there are leaps and bounds.
    - It's a kind of "intellectual production by changing formats.
        - When I created this term, I was imagining the transformation from spatial arrangement to text in the [[KJ method]].
        - Then [[active reading]] and [[Kozaneba Reading]] were born.
        - Both were human conversion processes.
        - With the advent of LLMs, the "LLM converts and then a human reads it" style was born.
- It would be easier to get the message across if it were in the form of a sentence and then in English.
    - If you put it in English, it's going to be like, "You're interpreting the subject differently..." or something.

- [[Importance of "digging" and "building up" knowledge]]
- I wrote down the idea, then did a vector search on the results, and loaded it into more prompts.
- Headings are highly constrained.
    - I've tried to maintain it.
