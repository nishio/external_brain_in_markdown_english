This design document is very comprehensive with a view to migrating to DB in the future, and I think it is very good that multi-layered defenses such as backup, audit logs, and integrity verification are well taken into account. On the other hand, we are currently at the stage of managing JSON files on GitHub repositories, so implementing all the features right now may have a large overhead. In the short term, I think it would be possible to balance operational overhead and design consistency by keeping the version control provided by Git/GitHub and logging to the minimum necessary, and then considering a two-step approach to fully incorporate multilayer protection and full auditing functions at the time of introducing a DB in the future.
Overall, the design document itself is highly scalable, and its great strength is that it clearly outlines a policy for future expansion of scale, so it would be more practical to maintain this direction and reconsider the balance with current operations.

# Task Persistence System Design Document

## 1. system overview

The Task Persistence System is designed as a comprehensive solution to the "lost task" problem in LLM-based task management.
The system provides multi-layered protection mechanisms to ensure data integrity, change tracking, and recovery from failures.

## 2. Design principles

### 2.1 Defense in Depth
The system has four layers of protection

1.**File-level protection**.
        - - Automatic backup creation before changes
        - - Time-stamped backup file management
        - - Provide restore points

2.**Change Monitoring**.
        - - Record all task changes in JSONL format
        - - Full traceability of change history
        - - Auditable operation logs

3.**Consistency Verification**.
        - - Task ID format validation (TXXXX format)
        - - Dependency consistency checks
        - - Check for the existence of required fields

4.**Notification System**.
        - - Immediate notification upon error detection
        - - Log-based alerts
        - - Tracking Important Changes

### 2.2 Data Immutability

- All changes are saved as a new version
- Complete retention of change history
- Restorable to any point in time

### 2.3 Auditability

- All operations are logged in the audit log
- Detailed record of changes (who, what, when, why)
- Track events in chronological order

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Core Components

```
TaskPersistenceSystem
├── Backup Manager
│ ├── Automatic backup creation
│└── Restore function
├── Audit log system
│ ├── Event record
│└── Change tracking
├── Consistency checker
│ ├── Format verification
│ ├── Dependency Verification
│└── Required field verification
└── Notification system
            - ├── Error Alert
            - └── Change Notice
```

### 3.2 Data Flow

1. task change request
2. backup creation
3. consistency verification
4. application of changes
5. audit log records
6. issuance of notice (if required)

## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1 Backup system

```python
def create_backup(self) -> Path:
            - Create a """time-stamped backup""""
            - timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
            - backup_path = self.backup_dir / f"backlog_{timestamp}.json"
            - # Backup processing
            - return backup_path
```

- Timestamp-based file name
- Complete data storage in JSON format
- Automatic backup directory management

### 4.2 Audit Log System

```python
def _log_audit_event(
            - self,
            - event_type: str,
            - task_id: str,
            - details: Dict,
            - user: Optional[[str]] = None
) -> None:
            - """Audit events are recorded in JSONL format.""""
            - event = {
                            - "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
                            - "event_type": event_type,
                            - "task_id": task_id,
                            - "details": details,
                            - "user": user,
                            - "event_id": str(uuid.uuid4())
            - }
            - # Event recording process
```

- Efficient log storage in JSONL format
- Event identification by UUID
- Record detailed change information

### 4.3 Consistency Verification

```python
def verify_task_integrity(self, task: Dict) -> List[[str]]:
            - """Verify task integrity"""
            - errors = []
            - # Check required fields
            - # ID format validation
            - # Verify status
            - return errors
```

- Rigorous format validation
- Comprehensive error checking
- Detailed error reporting

### 4.4 Secure Storage Process

```python
def save_tasks_safely(self, tasks_data: Dict, user: Optional[[str]] = None) -> bool:
            - """Secure task saving process""""
            - # Create Backup
            - # Integrity check
            - # Change monitoring
            - # Data Storage
            - return success
```

- Transactional approach
- Automatic rollback on error
- Complete audit log records

## 5. security considerations

### 5.1 Data Protection
- Setting proper permissions for backup files
- Audit Log Protection
- Access Control Implementation

### 5.2 Error Handling
- Properly catch and handle exceptions
- Recovery mechanism from error conditions
- Proper recording of debugging information

## 6. Operational Considerations

### 6.1 Performance
- Efficient log rotation
- Periodic cleanup of backups
- Resource Usage Optimization

### 6.2 Scalability

- Efficient management of audit logs
- Backup Storage Optimization

## 7. future development

### 7.1 Future Expansion Possibilities
- Support for distributed systems
- Real-time synchronization function
- Additional advanced analytical functions

### 7.2 Suggestions for improvement
- Automatic compression of backups
- More detailed record of change differences
- Customizable alert settings

## 8. Summary

This design ensures task persistence at multiple layers, while maintaining data integrity,
Ensure traceability of changes. The system is designed for scalability,
Future additions to the functionality can be accommodated.
