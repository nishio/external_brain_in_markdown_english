    - It is harmful for [[early adopters]] and [[speculators]] to have [the idea of being part of a chosen people
    - [[democracy]] was born and grew in power as a reaction against being governed by [[minority]] [aristocrat
- Early Adopters and Speculaturs are in the minority.
- That idea of the superiority of a minority is an attack on democratic thought.
- It is harmful to cause internal conflicts in a situation where everyone has to work together to face "difficult challenges".
- Early Adopters and Speculaturs may prefer to make an appeal to the Majority or [[Ranche]] that they are inferior!
    - E.g. I am crazy and love [[risk-taking]]. I like to fantasize and I don't like a stable life.
    - I can't think of an appropriate word to describe it, so let's call it a "[[clowning]] thought.

        - Clowns are not part of the [[hierarchical organization]] of the kingdom and are [[lunatic]], so they are not punished for criticizing the king.
    - Related: [[state of madness]].

- The pathology of the electorate
    - It's not right for early adopters to be elective in the first place.
    - A person whose values are so far off the average that they take unreasonable risks earlier than average, so it's unnatural to think of them as being comparable to average sensibilities.
    - Maybe that's an "early adopter pretender".
    - The [[anxiety filler]] theory.
        - People who choose the minority option because they really think it's optimal don't benefit from the electorate.
        - They are not sure if they are making the right choice, so they try to find reassurance by thinking that they are the chosen people.
            - [[self-assurance]] is compromised.
        - To make up for it, they're dabbling in elective politics.
    - [Brand value theory
        - Before the concept of early adopters, people who were the first to buy new products were indeed risk takers.
        - It was risk taking, buying something that may or may not be worth it.
        - If you see brand value in "I'm an early adopter who buys new products first," you are certainly an early buyer, but you are not a risk taker.
        - The same cluster of people who buy expensive watches to show off to others.

- Even the word "[[risk-taker]]" has an elective connotation, not a neutral one.
    - Just "people with lower than average [[risk sensitivity]]."
        - [[insensitivity]] ！
