Everyone should know more -> they already know.
![image](https://gyazo.com/356bf0e9bdb0f6931853ebb04ce0c788/thumb/1000)
- Mr. A thinks X is new information.
    - So I'm going to speak up and say, "People should know more about this.
- Mr. B doesn't think X is new information.
    - I know X, and I even know where another one was created that solved that problem.

Just because Mr. B knows, doesn't mean Mr. B is representative of all mankind.
- In many cases, those who know are in the minority.
- So there are those on the side of thinking that the spread of Mr. A's information is beneficial to society.
- On the other hand, there are those who believe that it is detrimental to society to spread old knowledge when it is already older and more useful at this point in time
    - Then there are those who think you should send out that "better information".
    - There are those who believe that the attitude of only complaining about the paid deliverables without paying the cost of information dissemination is detrimental to society on a meta-layer.
