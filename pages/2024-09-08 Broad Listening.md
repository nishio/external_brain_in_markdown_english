- It would be a waste to dissipate it by saying, "It's OSS, so look at the English repository."
- Japanese do not know each other and cannot communicate in Japanese.
- It would be nice to have some kind of place in Japan where people interested in broad listening can get together.
- It would be an online community, not a physical one.
- Nishio's idea of using the Plurality Japanese translation community -> I can secure my attention, but I feel that the project objectives are too blurred.

Broad Listening to "That Figure"
- Originally written to illustrate the story that LLM can change organizational structure.
        - [[Changes in organizational structure brought about by LLM]]
- Published in the special issue of 2023/8 of the Information Processing Society of Japan.
        - [[Not subjective or objective, but from the subjectivity of one to the subjectivity of many.]]
- He's more popular than he thought, so he made it CC-0 and free to use.

Talk to the city
- It's not a silver bullet.
- One of the many attempts by people around the world to improve society through software
    - [[AI Objectives Institute]]
- What kind of improvement is needed here?
    - It would be good to talk about something along the lines of, "We need a mechanism to encourage quality discussion."
