title: "Sexuality and sexuality are false dichotomies."
---

- [[belief that human nature is fundamentally good]] and [[the view of human nature as fundamentally depraved]] are [[false dichotomy]]

- From [[Thinking about people]] p.157 by [Konosuke Matsushita
- What to do about evil that cannot be extinguished
- To discern the power of evil and the workings of evil, and to make [[good use]] of them in community life.
- Accept the existence of evil as it is and consider ways to deal with evil in its own way.

Not "all humans are good, so we don't need to take measures to prevent abuse."
It's not a "we are all evil, so we need to take precautions so that we can't be abused."
We believe that there are both [[good]] and [[evil]] in a person, but that the distinction is only tentative.
The idea of "using evil for good" rather than fixed good and evil.

- [[The bad guy gets the better of the bad guy]]
