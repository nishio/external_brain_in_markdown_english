title: "Explain with verbs"

    - [[one should drink alcoholic beverages]] (example by [[Jiro Kawakita]])
        - [[obsession with the nominative form]]
            - [[verb form rather than noun form]]

    - >  I understand the temptation to add [[i-adjective]] to make the statement richer. But the more you do it, the more counterproductive it becomes.
        - [[Sentences rot from adjectives.]]

    - > When writing, you should consciously reduce the number of "adjectives and adverbs" and use [[verb]] to describe

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I'm not talking about the form of expression, like whether or not to use verbs when writing a sentence, but rather the part before that, "[[Focus on specific actions.]]"
    - [[concrete]]
    - [[action]]
    - [[(a) look]]
