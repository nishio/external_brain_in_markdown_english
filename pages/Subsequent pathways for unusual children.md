title: "Subsequent pathways for unusual children"
---

- A: [[self-assurance]] goes down because you think "I can't do X that [[usually]] people can do
    - It's usually parents and teachers [[who nip it in the bud]].
- B: "[[C]]ombination" that thinks "I am [[special]] and the world is stupid not to understand that."
    - I think it's good up to "[[I'm special]]."
        - The source of self-affirmation is the belief that you are special.
    - The world just doesn't get it."
        - This is a common fact in most cases (B2).
    - The bad part is that this combination creates "disrespect for others".
        - That [[contempt]] attracts [[incomprehension]], so a [[feedback loop]] occurs.
- C: "[[Growing up]] in a greenhouse" where "I'm special and the world understands that."
    - A case of an evaluator who happens to be a good evaluator.
        - I entered a different pattern at B2.
    - They fail to learn the fact that "the world doesn't understand."
        - A case where the moment you know about it, your worldview is broken and you panic.
        - Cases that become B after knowing
        - Cases where the scammer understands and is successfully taken advantage of before the individual understands that he or she "doesn't know it."
- D: Exposure to a community of unusual children and becoming "normal there"
    - By experiencing both communities where you are treated as "unusual" and communities where you are treated as "normal," you come to feel that others' evaluations of you as "normal/not normal" are subjective to them and not to your own value
