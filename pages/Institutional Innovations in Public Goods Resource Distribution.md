2. efforts and background of each organization
- Ethereum Foundation
    - Focuses not only on core technology development, but also on education and community support.
    - Use of quadratic funding and other means of financing public goods (especially open source development).
    - We value the independence of the community and do not want to be "foundation-driven" in any way.

- UNICEF (Innovation Sector)
    - Researching advanced technologies such as blockchain, drones, AI, and XR to solve global-scale problems.
    - UNICEF Crypto Fund:
        - A unique mechanism that permits the acceptance and distribution of virtual currency.
        - This is an unprecedented attempt for a UN agency, and contributes to improving the transparency and speed of fund management.
        - Strongly promote open source development as Digital Public Goods (Digital Public Goods).

- Japan Digital Agency
    - The main focus is on building domestic digital infrastructure such as the My Number system and data exchange infrastructure.
    - Historically, telecommunications infrastructure and other infrastructure have been developed with private funds, and there are a variety of financing models for public goods.
    - We see challenges/opportunities in international interoperability (e.g., global support for digital IDs).

3. themes facing digital public goods
- Sustainability of funding
    - It is essential to utilize global crowdfunding and virtual currencies, not simply government initiatives.
- Transparency and Governance
    - The challenge is to create a new mechanism that involves communities and individuals, rather than the traditional state, UN, and large corporations initiative.
- Importance of Youth Participation
    - If we do not involve the technologically advanced generation early, dissatisfaction with public infrastructure could explode in the future.

4. future prospects
- Accelerating Global Collaboration
    - The goal is to build public goods that transcend boundaries, working with international organizations such as UNICEF, community entities such as the Ethereum Foundation, and national governments.
- Open Source and Market Formation
    - Transform the Digital Public Goods Registry into a "marketplace" where funding and matching is available, rather than stopping at a "list".
- Changes in Organizational Structure
    - There are significant barriers to the inclusion of new technologies by huge bureaucracies (such as the UN), but success stories (UNICEF Crypto Fund) are emerging.
    - Digital agencies will also inevitably respond to international standards, and public-private + global collaboration is the key.

5. summary
- Digital public goods require new models for sustainable financing, transparency, and global interoperability.
- Diverse entities such as the Ethereum Foundation, UNICEF, and the Japan Digital Agency are collaborating to shape the next generation of public infrastructure by combining technology and governance.
- It is important to capture the voices of the younger generation as early as possible to create a truly global and open public good.

the key
- Fundraising Model Innovation
- Promoting Open Source and Transparency
- Governance with a focus on the younger generation
- Formation of new public infrastructure through public-private partnerships and international cooperation
