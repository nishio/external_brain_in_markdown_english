There is nothing to be gained by interacting with them. On the other hand, I think there is a lot to be gained by getting along with someone who declares, "I'm going to put O✕ in the near future and make it obsolete.

    - Those who say, "I'm going to make a compiler that's so smart it won't need tuning," are "[[doers]]."

    - [[Learn from those who do.]]
