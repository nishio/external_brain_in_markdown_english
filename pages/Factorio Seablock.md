title: "Factorio Seablock"
---

An extension of [[Factorio]]. [[Management Games]].
- Start from a scaffold one square above the sea.
- Slag generation by electrolysis of seawater is the basic resource source
- In vanilla Factorio, the depletion of the mine forced the plant to be rebuilt, but here [[Unlimited resources]] can be obtained from seawater.
- So the flavors are identical, but there are significant changes in the in-game economy.
