title: "Cancellation of publishing contract"
---

> [@deldelphin956](https://twitter.com/deldelphin956/status/1683665692162416640?s=20): you have a publishing contract on a per-work basis and it's automatically renewed, so even if it's terminated, the contract remains.
> If the popularity of a work is rekindled for some reason, a sequel may be decided upon in a hurry, so basically it is difficult to publish a continuation even in doujinshi.
> I think it would be a basic termination of the contract, unless we could work out an agreement through discussion.

> [MANZEMI_bot](https://twitter.com/MANZEMI_bot/status/1683674441501528066) There seems to be some misunderstanding about some of the publishing contracts.
>  Many writers think that because publishing contracts have an automatic renewal clause, they cannot cancel for a period of three years or so because they forgot to notify us in advance.
>  If a work has not been reprinted for three years, the publisher is considered to have no intention of continuing publication, and the contract can be terminated even during the contract period.
> [MANZEMI_bot](https://twitter.com/MANZEMI_bot/status/1683674443858731009) This is not well known because it is not good for the publishers.
>  Since reprints are rare for works that have been terminated, I would like to continue an amicable relationship with that publisher in the future, so I have the option of waiting until maturity. Termination of a contract is a recognized right of the writer.
>  In Japan, moral rights are recognized quite strongly.
> [MANZEMI_bot](https://twitter.com/MANZEMI_bot/status/1683674447893659649) It seems that the courts are more concerned with the actual situation than with the contract.
>  I guess it is a bit like if you have been separated for decades and one of you is stubborn and won't sign the divorce papers, the marriage is considered broken and the divorce is granted without the consent of both parties.
>  In any case, it is best to consult an attorney who is familiar with IP matters.

> [@JULY_MIRROR](https://twitter.com/JULY_MIRROR/status/1683846266554576896?s=20): By the way, I had a discussion with a publisher about a work that had not been published in e-book format for years. I had a discussion with the publisher about a work that had not been published for years and had not been published as an e-book. After that, I signed the contract for e-book and overseas publication by myself. If you are interested, please check it out.

> [@y_tsuduki](https://twitter.com/y_tsuduki/status/1683750580320337920?s=20): I'm also using this argument to get my publishing rights back when I'm making my own ebooks available for kindle.
> One company initially said to me, "You won't get your copyright back that easily," but a few days later they responded, "No problem.
> *Illustrations are copyrighted by the illustrator and we contact them directly to pay for their use.


Ultimately, it depends on the content of each individual [[contract]], but I got the impression that I misunderstood something about the first Tweet.
- In the early days, I didn't understand anything about contracts either, and thought they were simply something you put your stamp on because it was procedurally necessary.
- But a contract means "you have expressed this intention," so it is not right for the other party to decide the content of the declaration of intent and then stamp their stamp without understanding and agreeing to it.
- Like, what exactly is the right to publish?

I didn't understand it until I took a course in [[civil code]] at [[shio]].
- The concept of contract is still fuzzy, and the time is probably approaching when the concept of contract will be updated with [smart contract
- Chaos would ensue.
