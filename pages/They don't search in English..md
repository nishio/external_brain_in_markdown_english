[[Perplexity]] If I say "Search in English" in Japanese, you'll search in Japanese.

The pros and cons perspectives on whether AI should help customers throughout the value creation process are presented below:
Positive Perspectives:
- Hitachi, Ltd. is using AI to address retail challenges and create new value. [PDF](https://www.hitachi.co.jp/products/it/magazine/hitac/document/2018/05/1805a.pdf)
- Google Cloud is leveraging data and AI to drive supply chain efficiency and optimization, delivering superior results for customers.
    - [How supply chain organizations are using data and AI to drive efficiency and optimization | Official Google Cloud Blog [https://cloud.google.com/blog/ja/topics/supply-chain-logistics/drive-supply-](https://cloud.google.com/blog/ja/topics/supply-chain-logistics/drive-supply-) chain-efficiency-and-optimization-using-data-and-ai?hl=en]
Negative viewpoints:
- Survey results on corporate AI adoption indicate that there is little comprehensive company-wide review of whether AI creates value. [src](https://exploratory.io/note/kanaugust/AI-2135-ntW2Sgl8WK/note_content/note.html)
- While many companies have implemented AI-based systems and tools, it has been pointed out that an operational approach called MLOps is critical for AI to continue to generate value.
    - [AI does not get smarter by being "left alone". Rules to keep in mind when using AI in business](https://wisdom.nec.com/ja/feature/ai/2022011402/index.html)
This information suggests both pro and con viewpoints, including positive opinions that AI should support the entire customer value creation process and the need for a comprehensive review of AI implementation.

The idea that AI must help customers throughout the value creation process is supported by various studies and frameworks. AI technologies can be instrumental in creating value for customers by providing personalized solutions, enhancing customer experience, and reducing operational costs.

The process of value creation through AI involves activities such as identifying AI technologies, understanding their usefulness, and designing customer experiences utilizing AI. [PDF](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1400549/FULLTEXT01.pdf)

Research also highlights the importance of understanding the interaction between service providers and customers to enable value co-creation through AI technologies.
While AI tools can enhance the capabilities of customer service representatives and make the process more efficient, it is crucial to maintain a balance to ensure that human interaction, which is central to value co-creation, is not overshadowed by technology.
- [(41) The Impact of AI on Value Creation and the Role of Customer Service Representatives | LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/impact-ai-value-creation-role-customer-service-representatives/)
Frameworks like the one proposed in "Value Creation within AI-enabled Data Platforms" emphasize the role of information asymmetry and business platforms in extending the value creation process.
- [Value Creation within AI-enabled Data Platforms - Udo Milkau, 2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2394964318803244)
Additionally, a systematic literature review indicates that AI applications primarily support service providers but also enable value co-creation between firms and customers through resource integration.
In conclusion, the integration of AI in customer service operations can enhance value creation by providing data-driven insights, automating routine tasks, and improving customer engagement. However, maintaining a balance between AI-driven automation and human interaction is essential to ensure effective value co-creation throughout the process.
