[Higher voter turnout favors LDP? Shocking seat predictions for the lower house election by Yahoo!](https://www.huffingtonpost.jp/2014/12/07/voting-rate-variaton_n_6283444.html)

> [@hazuma](https://twitter.com/hazuma/status/541017009530499073?s=20): I think this prediction shows that the argument that we see on Twitter these days that "the ruling party will win because everyone is apathetic about politics" and "the ruling party can be defeated if all the birds take flight at once" is just sentimental and untrue. I believe that these arguments are mere sentiments, and are contrary to the facts. If the bird takes flight, the country will be full of Liberal Democrats. Please read this article.
