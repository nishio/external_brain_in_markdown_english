Context on the pros and cons of bots that automatically close issues
- I was just contemplating something related this morning.
        - [[Source code and developer resources need to be distinguished]]
    - these last (followed by a duration noun and a past sentence: time period before the present time of the speaker)<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - > Since source code is a resource that can be replicated at almost zero cost, it should be "available to everyone", while "actions that consume limited human time" such as inquiries and requests should only be allowed to those who are clearly demarcated, or is it that these two types of resources are somehow tied together? It's not a good idea to do so.
    - And this.
        - > Limited "Occupants" can participate in modifying the Rules of Use (Condition 3)
- Anyone is free to duplicate and use the source code because it is [[zero cost]], but the contributor's [[cognitive resources]] are limited, so don't make the mistake of thinking that they are free to use them.
    - I'm talking about how these two resources are completely different in nature.
- So if a contributor wants to automatically close an issue that is not moving, that is the contributor's decision.
    - > Limited "Occupants" can participate in modifying the Rules of Use (Condition 3)
    - No movement means that the person who wrote the issue is not moving things and is waiting for contributors to move them
    - In other words, from the contributor's point of view, not enough payment is being made.
- I think the reason why they want to close it automatically is because there are too many of them and they're annoying.
    - If you don't close it automatically, it'll just keep piling up and getting annoying.
