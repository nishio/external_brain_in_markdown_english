- (When?) When music was abundant with MIDI, I used MIDI of animated songs, Pfaffelbel's Canon, etc. as background music.
    - Playback at 3x speed with TMIDI
- MIDI faded into the age of MP3.
    - I was using PaceMaker, Winamp's fast playback add-on.
- I now play background music on my iPhone.
    - Make a 25-minute playlist and use it for Pomodoro.
    - Choose a song that is not playing at high speed, but the song itself is fast.
    - The last song is a slow one, which naturally expresses that the end of the pomodoro is near.
- I haven't used it for a while because I lost my songs during an iPhone upgrade.
    - [[I don't need to concentrate.]] Seeing that Hiroshi Mori also uses work background music to quickly start up his concentration, I think about resuming it.
- Put songs in Dropbox and play them on Evermusic, which can play songs in Dropbox.
