from [[The Art of Worldly Wisdom]]
obtain good will
cxii
Gain good will.

Thus, the first and best cause foresees and promotes the greatest end. By gaining the good will of others, we gain the goodwill of others. Some people are so trusting in merit that they neglect grace, but the wise man knows that a service road without grace is indeed a long road. Goodwill facilitates and supplies all things. Goodness assumes or supplies talents such as courage, enthusiasm, knowledge, or thoughtfulness. On the other hand, faults cannot be seen because we do not look for them. It is material, such as temperament, nationality, relations, homeland, or office, or formal, such as ability, duty, reputation, or merit, which are of a higher kind, communal, and arise from some common interest. Good will is difficult to obtain; it is easy to maintain. But good will must be sought, and when found, it must be used.
