title: "Paying the cost of understanding is an investment decision."
---

Whether or not to pay [[the cost of understanding]] is an [[investment decision]], and [[the results of the investment are]] one's own responsibility.

Losses from not investing are [[self-responsibility]], but [[choosing investments]] is also self-responsibility, and it is not always appropriate to [[invest]] in something that merely catches your eye.
