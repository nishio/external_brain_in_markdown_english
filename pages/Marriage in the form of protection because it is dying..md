title: "Marriage in the form of protection because it is dying."

> [@yuzutapioka](https://twitter.com/yuzutapioka/status/1671728232276824064?s=46&t=gkSZtjGEtUZPO0JCzBxCBw): I was talking to someone today and asked, 'Why did Rie-san marry Hanyu-san? Why did you marry Hanyu-san?" I thought about it and told her that it was because I came across a special protected species that lives deep in the forest and I felt that it would die if I left it alone, so I protected it. I thought it was a perfect expression for me.
