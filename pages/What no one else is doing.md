title: "What no one else is doing"
---

There are several varieties of "what no one else is doing."
- A: No one has succeeded because of technical difficulties
- B: No one is doing it because no one needs it
- C: No one is doing it because it's simply muddy work and not cool.
- D: There are people doing it, but they are simply not in range of observation.

C is all you have to do, so you should do it, but I'm surprised you don't.
- Many people want to be cool.
    - You try A for coolness and then fail because your skills are not up to par.
    - Concealing failures and giving the appearance of success.

Subspecies B.
- Appeal to novelty by doing something that no one needs.

About D
- Reluctant to seek out others who are doing what they are doing because they want to be intoxicated by their self-image of being the one who is doing what no one else is doing.
- I don't want to do that, I just want to do "me doing something no one else is doing", so when I find someone else doing it, I get less excited.
    - People who really "want to do it" will try to learn how to do it from other people who are doing it.
