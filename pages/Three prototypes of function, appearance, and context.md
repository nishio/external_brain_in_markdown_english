title: "Three prototypes of function, appearance, and context"
---

- [[Shuji Hamaguchi]]
There are three types of prototypes
- Feature
        - [[functional prototype]]
    - It can look ugly.
    - We just need to show that it works.
    - What makes the function experience
- outward appearance
        - [[design prototype]] (aesthetic prototype)
    - No need to move.
    - Shape and texture, weight, to showcase the UI
- context
        - [[contextual prototype]]
    - Promotional videos and faked catalogs
    - Product need not be real.
    - Conveying a Worldview

Make three in pieces
- cost reduction
- It's easier to get the message across.
- It is important not to mix them halfway.
    - Particularly prone to trying to do function and appearance at the same time.
    - As you're prototyping a feature, you're thinking, "It looks terrible," or "It could look a little better..." and so on.
    - Context and function tend to do the same thing at the same time.
        - When making a slide explaining what the software aims to achieve, what it will be able to do when completed, and how it will make the user happy, I include a "screenshot of what's being done now".
        - I would explain based on "features that can be implemented now."
    - I guess I had not thought of the three types of prototypes separately, so I was drawn to the one that was easiest for me as an engineer to create, the functional prototype.
