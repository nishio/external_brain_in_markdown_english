We will touch on some interesting psychological findings regarding emotions and political participation. Neuroscientist Antonio Damasio's ### Somatic Marker Hypothesis
 showed that emotions play an essential role in [[decision-making]]. In his research, he reported cases in which patients with damage to the brain regions that process emotions became extremely inefficient at making even everyday choices and were unable to make rational decisions. In other words, even when we think we are making decisions based on "reason alone," there is in fact an "emotional threshold adjustment," without which our judgment is paralyzed. This is also true for political decisions. When voters make decisions on complex policies, it is only natural that they do so based not only on theoretical cost-benefit analysis but also on intuitive feelings of favorable or unfavorable or on feelings of trust. If this is the case, then it is crucial for the democratic process to make group decisions while involving emotions in a healthy manner. The image of a "rational public sphere" that separates emotions from the realities of human nature does not fit the realities of human nature, but rather leads us in the direction that institutions should be designed based on the interaction between emotions and reason.
