title: "plate clip"
---

When we say plate clip, it is ambiguous what we mean
    - [[Plate 1 x 1 - Vertical Clip]]   4085
    - Plate, Modified 1 x 1 with Clip Vertical
    - [[Plate 1 x 1 horizontal clip]]  6019
    - Plate, Modified 1 x 1 with U Clip (Horizontal Grip)
    - [[Plate 1 x 2 horizontal clip]]  63863
    - Plate, Modified 1 x 2 with Clip on End (Horizontal Grip)
    - [[Plate 1 x 2 - Single Clip]]
        - [[Plate 1 x 2 Clips]]  92280
    - Plate, Modified 1 x 2 with Clip on Top

- I once mistakenly wrote plate clip for [[Tile 1 x 1 - Clip]].
