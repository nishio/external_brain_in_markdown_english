title: "People who have no second chances if they fail."
---

I saw someone respond to a statement like, "If you don't start, you don't start," by saying, "If you fail, there's no end in sight."

- When there is really no end in sight if you fail
    - I'm sorry for your loss.
    - Do your best not to fail.
    - I don't know if it would do any good if it didn't fail.
- When you just assume, "If I fail, there's no end in sight."
    - This case is more common.
    - We need to act, fail, and realize that it's surprisingly okay.
    - But the person's own assumptions get in the way of action.

- [[Why taking risks pays off.]]
