from  [[Study Session 1 on "Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning]]
Clean language: withholding interpretation of symbols
- [[clean language]] : [[Pending interpretation of symbols]]
- I realized that this framework could be used to explain how the clean language I presented last time works.

    - When a person tries to put into words something F that he/she can't say well and says A, it's not a parallel EXPLICATION of course because it's "not well said"!
    - So the FA that RECOGNITIONed by the person who heard it is of course not F
    - Stop RECOGNITION there.

    - Focus only on the phenomenon of "the other person said A."
- I understand why the rule is "don't change the words the speaker used."
    - Using the word A used by the other party can point to F, even if the word came from a non-parallel process
        - I don't know what that F is, but it's not a practical problem.
    - And asking a question to it F generates a CIRCUMLOCUTION
        - CIRCUMLOCUTION is the creation of RELEVANCE between experienced meaning
        - F becomes clearer as RELEVANCE increases.

- Keichobot's behavior can now be explained without attributing it to "that's the rule with clean language"!
