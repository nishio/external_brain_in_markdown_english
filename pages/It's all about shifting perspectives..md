title: "It's all about shifting perspectives."

- Tend to get caught up in the metaphor of sitting and working
- It is a constraint of the physical world that intellectual production tends to be tied to fixed devices such as desks and whiteboards
- Rent is expensive for larger rooms.
- In VR space, an unlimited number of whiteboards and desks can be used in an unlimited number of large spaces
    - No need to clean up.
- Software is needed to support intellectual production under these circumstances
- #Shift viewpoint
