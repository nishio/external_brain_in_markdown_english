title: "When they are satisfied, they are invisible."

- When the [[Observation range]] is [[filled with]] good things, you will perceive them as [[natural]], and the goodness will [[become]] invisible.

It's fine if she thinks that "the traditional way of childbirth is close to the ideal." However, the man's partner's comment, "In a sense, the Amazon is the 'safest' place to give birth," is indeed ridiculous. In what sense is it [[safe]]?

Still, I think it is the mother and child who bear the risk, not the partner. Incidentally, the [[maternal mortality rate]] and [[perinatal mortality rate]] of the Japanese are as shown in the image. I believe that childbirth in modern Japan is the "safest" of any country in history.

However, that safety is based on the efforts of obstetricians and midwives.
