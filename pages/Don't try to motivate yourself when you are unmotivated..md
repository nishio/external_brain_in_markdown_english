title: "Don't try to motivate yourself when you are unmotivated."
---

When we are unmotivated, we think that the "motivated state" is an unconditionally good thing, but is that really true?

Trying to be motivated for a certain task assumes that doing that task is the unconditionally right thing to do, but is that right?

Isn't it good to motivate yourself for tasks you shouldn't be doing?

- [[I'm not motivated.]]
    - [[I'm not motivated because it's not fun.]]
    - [[Let's make it interesting, not motivating.]]
    - [[If you're not motivated, you're not motivated to do the things that motivate you.]]
    - [[Remember what you tried to do, not what you're motivated to do.]]
- [[willingness (e.g. to do something)]]
