title: "Note to join us after 🤖."

The design problem makes me feel that "even if I write something, it might be overwritten", which inhibits output and is not good, so I put it here.
I wrote 🤖 so as not to be made to crawl in a strange way.

> Furthermore, "Wiki as a Living Text" discusses the concept of agile development, in which the phases of creating and using are not separated, but rather proceeded in parallel and gradually.
> "Speaking with Verbs" points out the importance of using "verbs" rather than "nouns" when discussing the world we are aiming for in the design of our experiences.
This lineup is interesting.
- When we call it by a noun, we implicitly recognize it as unchanging
    - [[Scheme of things]]
- When we speak in verbs, we see it as something that changes.
- A wiki is a living text because it behaves as a changing text, not as a collection of fixed articles
    - [[vegetatively growing wiki]].
        - As a form of human-AI interaction
