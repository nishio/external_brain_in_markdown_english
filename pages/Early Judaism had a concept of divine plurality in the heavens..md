It is true that there are several texts in the Hebrew Bible that are difficult to explain by monistic unitarianism (i.e., the view that there is only one God with one rank), such as (1) the "divine council" and plural Elohim, (2) Yahweh appearing in human form, and (3) Yahweh speaking to another deity. It is true that there are several texts that are difficult to explain with unitarianism ([thedivinecouncil.com](https://thedivinecouncil.com/Psalm_82_overview.pdf), [Desiring God [https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/](https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/) the-divine-council?utm_source=chatgpt.com]). On the other hand, as the Shema (Deut. 6:4) indicates, a strong confession of faith that "[[Yahweh is One]]" is also inscribed in the Old Covenant ([Crossway [https://www.crossway.org/articles/what-does-deuteronomy-64-mean/?](https://www.crossway.org/articles/what-does-deuteronomy-64-mean/?) srsltid=AfmBOoqMIi0eOOHhLTcmIc-gTfNgYYdPZYN6e6cg4DUJegKhF-E7SrW-&utm_source=chatgpt.com]). Thus, while there is ample evidence for the claim that "early Judaism had a concept of divine plurality in the heavens," it is not identical to the [[Trinity]] theory developed by later Christianity, and is currently subject to divergent interpretations even in academic circles ([Medium [https://medium.com/](https://medium.com/) interfaith-now/daniel-7-is-the-son-of-man-divine-human-or-both-27708b23d89c?utm_source=chatgpt.com], [[Scholar's Crossing https:// digitalcommons.liberty.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1276&context=lts_fac_pubs&utm_source=chatgpt.com]]). Below is a summary of the main issues.

1. "Council of the Gods" and Plural Elohim
- Psalm 82 is considered a prime example of a scene in which "Elohim (God)" judges other Elohim in a celestial assembly, and scholars are increasingly reading "divine beings" rather than "human judges" ([thedivinecouncil.com [https://thedivinecouncil.](https://thedivinecouncil.) com/Psalm_82_overview.pdf]).
- Deuteronomy 32:8-9 (Dead Sea Scrolls, LXX text) presents a composition in which "the Most High" allocates the nations, assigning them to "the sons of the gods (Elohim)" and Israel to Yahweh's portion. It has been argued that this too suggests a heavenly multiplicity ([Desiring God](https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/the-divine-council?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

2. text in which God appears in human form and eats
- Genesis 18
    - Yahweh visits Abraham as one of the "three men" and takes a meal
    - Physical/human manifestation (God=human figure) ([Biblical Hermeneutics Stack Exchange [https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/16941/does-genesis-18-show-](https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/16941/does-genesis-18-show-) god-visited-abraham-personally-theophany-manfiested-as-a])
- Exodus 24:9-11
    - Moses, Elders, and Others See "God of Israel" on the Mountain and Eat and Drink
    - The permissibility of "seeing and eating God" is shown ([Biblical Hermeneutics Stack Exchange [https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/5357/what-did-the-70-elders](https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/5357/what-did-the-70-elders) -see-if-man-cant-see-god-and-live?utm_source=chatgpt.com])
They are in tension with other texts in which "God is never seen (Deu 33:20)," and are considered examples of the ancient editors' inability to fully organize.

3. a scene in which God speaks to another divinity
1. genesis 1:26 - "Let us make man in our image." Jewish exegesis generally holds that "dynasties plural" and "God called to his angel" do not necessarily directly indicate multiplicity ([jewsforjudaism.org [https://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/when-god](https://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/when-god) -said-let-us-make-man-in-our-image?utm_source=chatgpt.com]).
2. Psalm 110:1 - "Yahweh says to my Lord." David's distinction between the two "lords" later became the cornerstone of the "Two Powers in Heaven" argument ([Biblical Hermeneutics Stack Exchange [https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com](https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com) /questions/11579/what-does-the-lord-said-to-my-lord-mean-in-psalm-110]).
3. the book of Daniel, chapter 7 - A growing number of studies read the scene where the "one who is old" and the "son of man" both share the throne and receive worship as suggesting a second divinity ([Medium [https://medium.com/interfaith-now/daniel-7-is-](https://medium.com/interfaith-now/daniel-7-is-) the-son-of-man-divine-human-or-both-27708b23d89c?utm_source=chatgpt.com]).

4. the second divinity and "Two Powers in Heaven
The classic study by [[Alan Segal]] has shown that the "two powers" were not necessarily heretical until the 2nd century AD, and that speculation about a second divinity was widespread in Second Temple period Judaism ([Two Powers in Heaven [https://twopowersinheaven.](https://twopowersinheaven.) com/]). It was later declared heretical in a way that overlapped with Christianity and was strongly rejected in rabbinic literature.

5. does unitarianism not conform to the old covenant?
- The "Yahweh is One" of the Shema (Deut. 6:4) is central to Old Covenant faith, a statement that excludes idols and polytheism ([Crossway [https://www.crossway.org/articles/what-does-deuteronomy-64-mean/?srsltid=](https://www.crossway.org/articles/what-does-deuteronomy-64-mean/?srsltid=) AfmBOoqMIi0eOOHhLTcmIc-gTfNgYYdPZYN6e6cg4DUJegKhF-E7SrW-&utm_source=chatgpt.com]).
- However, the fact that passages that hint at divine plurality remain in the same Bible is the basis for many scholars' assessment that "ancient Israel transitioned to monotheism in stages" ([Scholar's Crossing [https://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/cgi/](https://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/cgi/) viewcontent.cgi?article=1276&context=lts_fac_pubs&utm_source=chatgpt.com]).
- The Old Covenant itself juxtaposes "the only God" with "the heavenly host god (angel)/the second Yahweh," and it has been argued that the later Unitarian reading (one God = one rank) oversimplifies the multi-layered tradition of the entire Bible.

Conclusion.
- 'There was a divine plurality of heavenly beings in early Judaism' -- can be affirmed. Po. 82, Dani 7, Po. 110, Gen. 18, Deut. 24, etc. show a pluralistic view of God.
- Although the Unitarian reading is consistent with the Shema, it fails to account for the full data of the Old Covenant, and in scholarship the "exclusive unitive case" is often regarded as a theological convergence in the later period of the Bible's formation.
Thus, the Old Covenant is simultaneously a confession of faith in "one God" and a literary and mythological portrayal of multiple residual divine beings.
