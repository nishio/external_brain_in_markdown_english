Organized the sticky notes that I had left stuck in my sticky note book. This sticky note mind map I wrote on the train turns into this entry -> <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20110309/1299598527'>To Stop Slash-and-Burn Farming--- New Graduate Preparation Calendar Spring 2011</a>.

Lately I have been drawing only mathematics on my mind map, and I am having trouble expressing it in pictures and drawing it because it is not a shallow, branching branch but a deep, long and sly branch. How can I express a subject like mathematics well?
