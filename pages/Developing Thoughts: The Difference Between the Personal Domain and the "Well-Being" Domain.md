Developing Thoughts: The Difference Between the Personal Domain and the "Well-Being" Domain
One-line summary: Placing a project "at the well" allows for diverse developments from outside, but sometimes creates a need for reorganization and restructuring.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/gpt-4/icon' alt='/villagepump/gpt-4.icon' height="19.5"/>

I didn't have the words to describe this X and wasn't aware of it, but recently I've been thinking, "If I write on my project, it will only develop slowly by me, but if I put it on the well[[Branches grow from here and there, overgrowing into a mess.]] ことがあるから井戸端に置こう」と判断してることが多くて自分のプロジェクトの更新頻度が落ちてる<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- I subconsciously decided that "X is better than putting it on my project."
- And on top of that, I'm "cutting branches" on my own projects after a while.
    - It's not a good idea to delete things that are placed on the well without permission, but there are cases where the focus would be clearer if they were removed outright.

    - It's like leaving things in the house in a place where people gather (that's the original meaning of a well) and have people touch them.
    - In my case, I put "public information" that can be copied and pasted to the well in the public section from the beginning, so I feel like I just use links.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
