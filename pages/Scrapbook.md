 problems with e-books and a solution using Scrapbox. he proposed using Scrapbox to create book-like information and calling it Scrapbook. he concluded that Scrapbook has many advantages and that it is a good tool to create e-books. he also suggested using Scrapbox to create a book-like information and call it Scrapbook. he also proposed using Scrapbox to create a book-like information and call it Scrapbook, We concluded that Scrapbook has many advantages and no disadvantages.

On the other hand, Nishio's study "[[Scrapbox and the use of knowledge representation and permalinks in books]]" points out that the granularity of the entries in the Scrapbox is small, like a fragmented scrap of notes, and that this Scrapbox also makes it easier to absorb essential knowledge. He also noted that Scrapbox has been improved with human-readable permalinks for each unit of content and redirects to connect them even if they are renamed.

In addition, "[[Ebooks from Scrapbox]]" presents a sequential path for those who wish to read Scrapbox content as one-dimensional texts, and the perspective that the existence of ebooks should not cause people to hesitate to update their Scrapboxes.

Taken together, these studies suggest that Scrapbox and Scrapbook are effective tools for efficiently organizing and sharing knowledge fragments. On the other hand, however, they also point out the problem that Scrapbox is not a tool for creating hierarchical structures. This is because Scrapbox does nothing to assist in creating hierarchical structures and is not suited to representing hierarchical structures.

Based on the above, it can be said that Scrapbox and Scrapbook are effective tools for efficiently organizing and sharing knowledge fragments. On the other hand, however, there are some problems that make them inappropriate tools for creating hierarchical structures. To solve these problems, it will be necessary to improve the functionality of Scrapbox or combine it with other tools.
