In general, if Mr. A name-dropped Mr. C that he is "acquainted with celebrity Mr. B
- If Mr. C has no celebrity acquaintances at all, he tends to get more credit from Mr. C
    - Related: [[Communities where the appeal of acquaintance is valuable...]].
- If Mr. C has a celebrity acquaintance, it is "so what?" and neutral to negative.
    - When you then dig deeper and find out that he was name-dropping without a particularly deep relationship, it's a huge negative: "He's a name-dropper, don't trust him.
    - Addendum: Whether it's neutral or negative at the point of acquaintance appeal varies widely from person to person, but this composition is interesting.
        - The premise that "if you do this to someone high, you'll be evaluated negatively" carries the message, "you're low."
        - So a decision to say, "This appeal would be a plus," can be interpreted as an insult.
        - The more people who consciously do this act, the angrier they get when it is done, a sort of [[boomerang-like structure]].
