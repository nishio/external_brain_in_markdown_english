>  Objectivity and numerical evaluation were born in the 19th century and have somehow become permanent truths. Society and even the mind have been [[objectified]], [[the meaning of individual experience]] has been lost, and quantification is associated with [[utilitarianism]], [[competition]], [[elimination]], [[self-responsibility]], and even [[eugenics]]. This is the first half of the book.

> [yasuhikomurakam](https://twitter.com/yasuhikomurakam/status/1666584172541124609) The second half of this book considers "How then [[to capture the meaning of individual experience]]? We will show that a close analysis of the narratives captures the vivid reality and style of each individual experience. This is [[phenomenology]]. We will end with a discussion of how the landscape changes when we think of society in terms of [[individual experience]].

> [yasuhikomurakam](https://twitter.com/yasuhikomurakam/status/1666585931787423744) "The Pitfalls of Objectivity" does not mean to deny evidence, but [[overarching objective knowledge]] and [[understanding of the meaning of individual experiences understanding of the meaning of individual experiences]] are complementary. But [[objectivity alone is only one side of the truth]].
>  I think that good quality research that uses statistics (numbers) to deal with experience is actually supported by [[an understanding of individual human experience]] and imagination.
