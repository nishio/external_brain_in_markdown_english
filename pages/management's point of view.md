> [@iwam_rock](https://twitter.com/iwam_rock/status/1666792044403240961?s=20): I don't get paid the same [[reward]] as [[proprietor]], so I don't have a management perspective! I'm sure those who are mad at me for not being paid the same [[reward]] as the [[proprietor]] would be pissed off if they were told to "take the [[user's]] point of view" during a business meeting....

When I try to persuade them to do something like that, some people say things like, "I haven't done it, so there's no way to evaluate whether or not it can be done," or "I think this is what I should be doing in the first place, so I'm deciding it can't be done.

- I haven't done it, so there's no way to evaluate whether it can be done or not.
    - Decide you can't do it.
        - [[Prove you can do it first, reward comes later.]]

[[eye line]].
    - [[point of view]]
    - [[(a) look]]
