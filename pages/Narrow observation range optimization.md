I want them to realize that what I am saying is not rational. You may be able to optimize the 3-meter radius, but the overall efficiency is going down.

That's the point, please. Hira... Hira... Please forgive me." I told him that people won't move unless we ask them in a very [[(keeping a) low profile]] manner, but he didn't want to do that, so I told him, "Well, let's give up then! So, we just gave up.
