    - > The third pillar is the "Standard of Beauty" that defines the beauty of the town.
    - >  This standard of beauty is not a BEAUTIFUL beauty, but a collection of words that describe the LIFE of Manazuru. In creating this standard of beauty, we sought the help of architects, lawyers, and urban planners. We used as references the "[[pattern language]]" proposed by [[Christopher Alexander]], [[Prince Charles]]'s "[[Britain's Vision of the Future: Reflections on Architecture]]," and the "Aesthetic Standards for the Future" by [[Prince Charles]] and [[Prince Charles]] in 1989. The results (report) of the "Machizukuri Discovery Group," an event held in fiscal 1989 to uncover local resources by local residents before the enactment of the ordinance. Using these, we have picked up the unique beauty of the area and created it.
