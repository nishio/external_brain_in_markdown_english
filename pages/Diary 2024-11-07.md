>  Once upon a time, there was a local currency concept called [[NAM Generation]] by [[Yukito Emaya]]. The [[interchange format]] X proposed by [[Yukito Emaya]] has become abstract and splendid as described by [[Audrey Tan]] and others, but it is a simple idea that I can realize in [[Genron]]. I don't need great technology or a big story about resistance to capitalism.
>  It's about how to create a [[Community]] without getting > involved in violence on a larger scale, human to human. I'm thinking of something like an update of the community that was called [[utopian socialism]] before Marx.

> [fladdict](https://x.com/fladdict/status/1854337005767033075) Trump and Harris are just "[[external environment]]" from the Japanese point of view. If the election is over, it is more important to seek the top meta, [[strongest deck]], [[optimal playing]] in the current environment rather than complaining about the management.
>  If you want to talk about democracy, it is more important to "preserve your strength and survive until next season's apex" than "I'm going to retire from the shitty environment.
> [fladdict](https://x.com/fladdict/status/1854338536390152678) I've never seen anyone who says "I'm retiring from the shitty environment wow" in either [[trekking]] or [[gaming]] grow up or look up afterwards (by the absolute strongest). (except when they are saying it in jest).
>  So, "I'm going to retire to a shitty environment wow" is a good signal to go further down. You can't go that way.

Combining two completely unrelated stories that flowed together.
LLM Progress is a new set of cards recently released in the trading card game called The World, which naturally changes the optimal playing, and as the optimal playing changes, so does the optimal solution of the deck as a preparation for it.
- Related: [[As costs fall, structures change...]].

It's an option to come up with a strategy to use the new set of cards, or to prepare to defeat those who will use the new set of cards.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>In Magic: The Gathering (MtG), the metagame is the [[deck selection]] and [[strategy]] based on the [[environment]] of which decks are strong and which decks are competitive in a particular format or tournament environment. In MtG, it is important to understand the metagame because the strength of a deck is influenced by environmental trends and the deck choices of its opponents.
    - For example, "If there are many aggro decks in the environment, counter them with control decks," or "If combo decks are popular, decks containing many counterspells are advantageous," etc. Deck selection is done according to the metagame. The strategic significance of the metagame in MtG is to build and select your deck in anticipation of the metagame trends in order to gain an advantage in the matchups.

Whether the strategy is to use them or to beat the people who use them, I think the level of understanding of the new set of cards contributes to winning or losing.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1854386830025920830) That was a very good story.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1854393068801446203) By the way, I can't yet verbalize what's good about it, I have a feeling some good insights will be extracted after the fact.

- [[Japanese know Americans.]]

- [[The argument that programmers should study programming on weekends as well.]]

- [[In fact, the division is weakening in this election.]]
