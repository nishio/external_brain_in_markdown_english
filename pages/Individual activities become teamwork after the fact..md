I'm going to use this line.
- [[Individuals]] act [[spontaneously]] based on their judgment that "it would be better to act in this way" (= [[grandstanding]]).
- The behavior leads to [[posterior]].
    - In retrospect, it looks like [[teamwork]] (= [[Teamwork arising from stand-up play]])
- But they did not plan to work as a team from the beginning (= not a team player)
We recognize that this is the case.

relevance
    - [[If it's a good idea, don't ask permission.]]
    - Acting without asking permission is necessary for stand-up.
- [[Connecting the Dots]]
        - [[The dots are connected after the fact.]]
