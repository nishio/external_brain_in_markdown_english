When you see a press release that says, "Problem A was solved using method X," etc.

General public reaction
- Then you should be able to solve problem B, and maybe you can solve our company's problem C.

Expert Response
- Based on method X, it is likely that A was achieved just in time by combining know-how Y, which is not publicly available.
- You want to solve problem C, it's not suited for you, because it's a totally different direction than X, okay?

What people who want to sell Method X tell the public
- You want to solve problem C? I see!
- Incidentally, we have a track record of solving A with method X.
- It would be worth a try on problem C! (I'm not saying you can)
- You are indeed very astute to apply this technique X to problem C! (and flattery and bullishness).

What a bullish public says to a bearish expert
- Don't look for reasons why you can't do it, get on with it!
- If you can't do it this way, give me an alternative!
