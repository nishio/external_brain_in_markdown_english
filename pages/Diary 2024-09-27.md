- [[2024 wisdom teeth]]
- Tokyo Medical and Dental University
- I put the referral in the bag.
- I'm on the schedule at 10:00, but I think I was told to come earlier.
    - But there is no log.
    - It's also possible that I was being clever and putting in an earlier time for myself that I put in the schedule.
        - Keep a log of that care~!
        - A little less thoughtful.
- The root of all evil is that there is no log of conversations because reservations are made by phone.
- > After completing the initial consultation on the 1st floor, please come to the Outpatient Oral Surgery Department on the 6th floor.

- I showed up at 9:50 for what I thought was a 10:00 appointment, but it appears they scheduled a 10:30 appointment and put the time 30 minutes earlier in the schedule.
- He said it can take two to three hours.

Videoconference if you can be back by 1pm

- I woke up at 2:30 and 6:30, but successfully adjusted to the "sleep a lot" side.
- We were supposed to be up and eating at 8:00, but we were done at 7:30.
- I went to the University Hospital today to see a [[wisdom tooth]] doctor.
    - Well, it's the first day, so they won't pull it out of the bag out of the blue.
- I was supposed to be back home by 1:00, have a video conference, and be somewhere else by 5:00, but on second thought, was I wasting my travel time?
    - I felt like I should take my computer to the hospital and go straight to a private comic book cafe or something.
- Departure with PC on your back
- At 11:10, I was finally called by the receptionist.
    - I always make my appointments at the hospital or dentist at the beginning of the morning/afternoon because I don't like to shift the waiting time.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/Hiro Aki/icon' alt='/villagepump/Hiro Aki.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I see<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- They called me again, told me to take the paper and go downstairs to the basement, get an x-ray, and go back up to the 6th floor.
    - I almost forgot the floor I'm going back to...
- I'm going back and forth with the bar code, I was going to say, "I've taken an x-ray," and I said, "I've taken a bar code."
- I'm starving...
- It was decided to extract two teeth on 12/2.
- In the checkout line. 11:47.
    - If I buy lunch at a convenience store and go to an internet cafe, will I be able to make it by 1:00 p.m.?
        - I saw that there is a pleasant club a 10 minute walk away.
- They're waiting for their number to appear on the electronic board for payment.
- Umbrella broken!
        - [[folding umbrella]]
- I got a private room at Akihabara's Kai-Katsu Club without incident. 12:30 p.m.
    - You couldn't video conference from home at 13:00.
- [[MTG2024-09-27]]
- Video conferencing done
    - The line wasn't very good and the images stopped.
    - The second half went back to normal, so maybe it's affected by people in the same network watching videos or something like that, that's not good.
    - After all, you're charging for it, tethering and all?
    - Should I have entered the video conference from my phone in the first place?
- I had to enter a video conference from my phone tomorrow as soon as possible.
- It's interesting that the presidential election is moving the exchange rate and stock prices so much.
- I understood that it is, in essence, an accommodation facility, since there are four floors in Akihabara and there are only a few comic books in the corner, and the rest are mostly private rooms and high board booths with no view of the inside.
- 2:16 Sleepy
    - Tomorrow is Kasumigaseki at 11:00, so I only have to leave home at 10:00, much easier.
