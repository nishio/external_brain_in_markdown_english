- Interpretation of "no time."
- Is that a fact?
- First, we need to measure how much time is actually spent on what.
- Get the facts straight.
- Need to [[measure]] before tuning

- Maybe it's not that we don't have time, maybe we just don't have enough [[triggers]] to think about using our time for it.
