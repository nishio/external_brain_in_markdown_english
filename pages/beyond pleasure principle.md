In this book, [[Freud]] discusses the two basic impulses that govern human behavior. In this book, [[Freud]] discusses the two basic impulses that govern human behavior: "Eros" ("the instinct of life") and "Thanatos" ("Death Instincts").

The "pleasure principle" is basically the principle that humans seek pleasure and avoid pain. Freud, however, focused on the "death instinct" as a force that transcends this principle. He believed that all living beings have the urge to die, and that self-destruction and repeated traumatic experiences are manifestations of this urge.

This work is very important in Freud's theory and represents his late thought. Beyond the Pleasure Principle is considered a must-read for a deeper understanding of psychoanalysis.
