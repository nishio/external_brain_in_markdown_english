However, if I had done action C with the effort to do B three times, I would have been able to create more value. However, if I had done action C with the effort of doing B three times, I could have created more value.

From a short term perspective, B looks more promising; from someone who understands C, "B is a linear order of magnitude.

- [[Returns increase later.]]
        - [[being a lap behind (e.g. motor sports)]] in [[feedback]] is large and hard to recognize
    - From a [[short-term perspective]], B looks more promising; from the perspective of someone who knows C, "B is a [[Linear Order]].
        - [[Linear-order work]]: [[returns are proportional to the effort put in]].

# Context 1: [[follow-up after connecting]]

- [[The stench of those who connect]] discusses the role and responsibility of "connectors" in connecting people. Many believe that connectors are responsible for ensuring the goodness of the people they connect, but problems can arise because there is no clear agreement on the extent of their responsibility.

Relevance to content:.
- From a short-term perspective, the act of connecting itself appears to have value, but from a long-term perspective, follow-up and responsibility after the connection is made are also important.
- If the connector fails to follow up, the connector could be held responsible for any problems that occur among the people connected.
- In other words, it is not only the act of connecting, but also the maintenance and development of the relationship that leads to [[long-term value creation]].

        - [[Building Human Networks]]

# Context 2: [[3 variables of the game]]

In this context, the three variables necessary to win the game are "work fast," "keep doing it lazily," and "don't make mistakes. It is stated that all but these variables are useless and that vague concepts such as "trying hard" and "working hard" are unnecessary.

Relevance to content:.
- "[[Keep]] lollygagging" corresponds to behavior C. It does not create much value in the short term, but it is a winning behavior in the long run. It is an action that does not produce significant value in the short term, but leads to victory in the long term.
- Getting the job done quickly" corresponds to Action B. It appears to create great value in the short term, but does not lead directly to long-term wins.
    - This is subtle.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - There is value to be gained by acting fast/at the right time.
        - Sometimes that value is short-term value, but other times it is an appropriately timed trigger for long-term value formation
- Avoiding "mistakes" is a critical component of executing Action C. Taking the time to avoid mistakes will lead to long-term value creation.
    - I don't think this is it.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

As discussed above, this content is closely related to the "difference between short-term and long-term perspectives" and "actions required for [[long-term value creation]]" discussed in both contexts. It suggests the importance of people taking a long-term perspective and not being distracted by short-term profit and value.
