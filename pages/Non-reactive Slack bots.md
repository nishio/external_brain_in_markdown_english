title: "Non-reactive Slack bots"

They said, "Mention it and I'll respond." [[reactive]].
- How [[trigger]] is triggered by an event

Devin-like AI agents are a little different.
- Events are queued.
    - AI agents come to the queue in their spare time.
- Not [[preemptive]].
    - [[cooperative multitasking]] flippancy.
- Event-driven implementation, now, is usually this way.

[[Proactive Agent]] is going to go even further.
- Even if humans don't take action, they will act from that side.
- Implementation-wise, it's driven by a timer event.

That's the kind of Slack bot I want to build.
