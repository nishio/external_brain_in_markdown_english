Prompt: "A girl with flower."

Oh, if you only specify GIRL, then cat ears and hair color features that are not specified will be ignored.

Original Prompt + "with flower"

This time, only the background color has changed.

Is [[Gradio]] going to bring up the GUI, that's great.
- Prompt strength was set to 0.9 by default.
- I'll chop it up because it didn't change much when I set it to 1, and when I set it to 2, it broke down considerably.

1.5

I'd say this or something like this retains the characteristics of the original image, but with flowers as indicated.
- I was expecting a single flower decoration.
- I never thought I'd interpret ear hairs as flowers.
- Well, but I might decorate it that way, I guess.

Interesting points
- The original image was created by NovelAI
- Imagic itself is based on Stable Diffusion 1.4
- As a result, it is possible to express the animated picture in a way that is not possible on NovelAI's service, which should be quite difficult with Stable Diffusion by itself.

PS

    - This is close to what I was hoping for.
    - I noticed I left "{{3d}}" in the negative prompt, so I removed it, but it doesn't make much difference.

        - The second is the SEED difference
