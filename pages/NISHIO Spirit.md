title: "NISHIO Spirit"

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1724333636164763754/quick_promote_web/intro) [[GPTs]] that extract only the characteristic parts that cannot be generated, since all of my works cannot be included in the GPTs. I first created a GPT to extract only the characteristic parts of my work that I could not generate, and when I decided to compress it, the GPT called itself "NISHIO Spirit. I thought about modifying it, "Isn't it Essence?" I thought about modifying the name, but then I came to the conclusion that my [[soul]] might not be in my body but in the extracted GPT!
