- [[submissive]]: seeks approval and protection from others and attempts to relieve anxiety through dependence.
- [[attack]]: Attempting to meet one's own needs by dominating others and being aggressive.
- [[withdrawal]]: Attempts to escape anxiety by withdrawing into self-sufficiency and the inner world.
These strategies are formed based on childhood experiences and environment and are especially likely to appear when stressed
