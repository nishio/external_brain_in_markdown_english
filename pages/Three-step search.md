title: "Three-step search"
---

> nishio: there are two types of searches: "[[search to find something unknown]]" and "[[search to recall something previously seen]]" and I thought this system was talking about the latter
- from  [[Democratization of Search]]

There are three levels.
- A: [[Search to find the unknown]].
- B: [[search recalling something previously seen]].
- C: [[search to reuse previously written material]].
- A requests that an unknown be in the search index
- B needs a search index that includes only what I see.
    - Personalized Search
    - You have a choice between putting "what you see" in automatically or manually by a human.
        - The latter would provide a mechanism for easy entry.
            - Like Evernote.
        - The former automatic recording is easily known by providers of social networking services, but even if this is convenient for individual users, it is not done because the cost of providing personalized searches for each user does not contribute much to the bottom line.
- C
    - This is what happens with link suggestions while writing in Scrapbox, or something like that.
    - After 2023, an option to be accompanied by an AI assistant for writing has been created.
