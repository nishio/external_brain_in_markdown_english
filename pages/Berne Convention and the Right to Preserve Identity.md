- The [[Berne Convention]] (Berne Convention) is a treaty that establishes a basic framework for the international protection of copyrighted works. Article 6-2 (6bis) of the Convention recognizes a right equivalent to "[[the right of]] identity preservation" as part of the "moral rights of authors. Here are the key points: 1.

1.### Article 6bis of the Berne Convention (moral rights)
.
    - Apart from economic rights (such as the right to reproduce), authors have the right to protect the identity of their works and the right to display the name of the author.
    - Convention member states must implement this protection of personal rights in their national laws.

2.[* What is the right of integrity?
    - The right of an author to protect the content and form of his or her work and to oppose damage to his or her honor or reputation by unauthorized alteration.
    - Japanese law provides protection against unauthorized alteration as one of the moral rights of authors.

3.### Relationship between the two
.
    - The Berne Convention mandates the protection of the right of identity preservation as a minimum international standard, and its specific operation is left to the national laws of each country.
    - Therefore, Contracting Parties, including Japan, are required to protect the right of identity preservation under their national copyright laws.

In summary, the Berne Convention imposes on member countries the responsibility to protect the moral rights of authors, and at the core of this responsibility is the right to preserve the identity (the right to resist alteration). Each country has adopted this principle and established a mechanism in its national law to protect the work, honor, and reputation of the author.

supplement
- The Berne Convention itself was established in 1886.
    - It was the Rome Amendment of 1928 that clarified the provisions of moral rights (e.g., the addition of Article 6-2).
- The Berne Convention only establishes "minimum standards" and the actual operation and detailed protection contents are left to the national laws of each country.
    - Japanese law protects moral rights relatively strictly compared to other countries in that they are basically not transferable or waivable and have a strong veto right against modification.
    - For example, in the Anglo-American legal sphere, moral rights may be limited or may allow assignment or waiver under certain conditions.

- According to my understanding, in conjunction with the commentary in [[Reexamination of the scope of limitation of the right to preserve identity]].
- The Berne Convention requires, as a minimum line, "the right to oppose damage to one's honor or reputation by unauthorized alteration.
- In Japan, "The author shall have the right to maintain the identity of his work and its title, and shall not have them altered, mutilated or otherwise modified against his will." The new clause "The author shall have the right to maintain the identity of the work and its title, and shall not be subjected to alteration, mutilation, or other modification thereof against his will" has been added to the law.
- Moral rights were not clarified until 1928, so the situation where an ordinary consumer modifies a copyrighted work in the home was not anticipated.
