Discussion with Mr. Nojiri
> [nojiri_h](https://x.com/nojiri_h/status/1954018737516163217) It's a difficult page. What does "ChatGPT o3 has created 30 comments that can be voted for or against" mean?　By comments do you mean ballot items?　Where are those 30 items?

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1954019950613737925) Sure! Maybe there's a better way to explain it.

> [nojiri_h](https://x.com/nojiri_h/status/1954034441749422470) I fear that at this rate we are going to end up with a democracy in which only 1-2% of the population can participate. I think you should take serious measures such as having normal people peer-review it before it is published.
>  Also, tell Yasuno-san, "If you are a writer, write in a way that the general public can understand.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1954035585641029723)
>  1: Yasuno-san has not contributed a single line to what is written here
>  2: This is not intended for all citizens to participate
>  3: Comments can be submitted by anyone, so it's not a "normal people to peer review" kind of thing
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1954042911739588639) I should clarify that "it's not something Team Mirai is doing, it's something I'm doing on my own based on public GitHub data", tsk! Thank you very much!

> [nojiri_h](https://x.com/nojiri_h/status/1954049128763470137) Ah, I see. Sorry, I didn't distinguish between the two. I thought he was a close aide like Mask when he was good friends with Trump, and a sort of spokesman for Mirai.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1954069530046869984) I originally took the position that broad listening is an enhancement of human cognitive abilities and that the spread of this is important for human civilization to advance to the next stage, so even during the election period I was tweeting about the Restoration I was tweeting broad listening videos and so on. I'm also involved in party independent poll maps and dd2030.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1954086442210406667) "I have created 30 opinions on ChatGPT o3 based on the ~. You all can vote for or against this." I have rewritten this as. Also, added note (4) "This discussion forum was created by nishio personally because he thought that something interesting might happen with Polis, and Team Mirai was not involved in the creation process." I added the following.

> [nojiri_h](https://x.com/nojiri_h/status/1954132172480434238) I'm going to ask again, where are those 30?　Below that, "Welcome to a new form of conversation. Vote for other people's opinions" has about 70 questions, so that's separate, right?

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1954167943022981322) Anyone can submit a post, so the number of posts has increased from 30 to 70.
>  If you want to see the initial 30, you can see them in the detailed report.

> [nojiri_h](https://x.com/nojiri_h/status/1954183029464936605) If that's the case, then 30 cases is misleading.
>  And answering 70 questions was a pain, I was frustrated after about 10 questions.
>  I think this discussion can be summed up in one question, "Isn't it a polyglot stick to include human rights in the manifesto?

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1954184755647488123) The algorithm is designed to display the most informative first, with the expectation that some people will leave in the middle. I think the data will reveal if it can be summarized in that one question. You can also post that opinion and see how others respond.

> [nojiri_h](https://x.com/nojiri_h/status/1954188791708815637) I fear that excluding those who did not participate due to difficulty and tabulating the results of those who got tired of the long and too many questions and threw them away will only result in garbage in and garbage out! However, I wish you the best of luck.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1954211745947672690) The original discussion on GitHub was a garbage of unreadable text and emotional repartee. I think it's fair to say that the output is something better than garbage.
>  >nishio: It is not a dichotomy between "human rights proponents" and "conservatives" as is often imagined, but actually a three-way conflict. I think this is a very interesting finding.
