- Comparison of [[logistic regression]] and [naïve Bayes
Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I. (2001) [On Discriminative vs. Generative Classifiers: A comparison of logistic regression and naive Bayes](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020-on-discriminative-vs-generative-classifiers-a-comparison-of-logistic-regression-and-naive-bayes)

in short
- If there is enough data, logistic regression is advantageous.
- Naive Bayes is advantageous for timing with little data
However, since it is unclear "how much data would be needed to reverse the situation for this issue" for an individual problem, "try both" is probably the correct answer from a practical standpoint.
