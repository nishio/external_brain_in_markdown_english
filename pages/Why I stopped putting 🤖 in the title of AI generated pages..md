Why I stopped putting 🤖 in the title of AI generated pages.
Separate zones for blacks and whites to live.
I thought it was a natural distinction, but then I questioned it.
Is a distinction necessary?
Initially, the AI will not be able to read what the AI generates.
However, actual operation
A human reacts to a page written by an AI.
nature
write inside
That's not a target for AI to read.

There is no assumption of a collaborative editing forum.

AI will write for you what humans "haven't written yet".

It is unnatural to mark AI
Less convenient for humans.

### Summary
.
We discussed removing the 🤖 mark from the title of AI-generated pages. Initially, this was to prevent AI from reading AI-generated material, but during operation, it was felt that it was natural for humans to respond to AI-written pages. However, we questioned the fact that the content was not subject to being read by the AI. We also discussed the lack of assumption of a collaborative editing forum.

### Relevance
.
This note is related to a fragment of Nishio's research note, "Buried at the Bottom of the AI Page" The idea that it is natural for humans to respond to AI-generated pages and the problem of human thoughts being buried at the bottom of AI-generated pages are, in terms of information transfer between AI and humans closely related.

### deep thinking
The issue of information transfer between AI and humans leads to the larger question of how to set the premise for AI-human collaboration: the original idea of preventing AI from reading what it generates was predicated on the unidirectional nature of information transfer between AI and humans. However, the observation that it is natural for humans to react to what AI generates provides a new perspective that information transfer between AI and humans should be bidirectional.

### summary of thoughts
Information transfer between AI and humans should be bidirectional.

### Title
.
'Bidirectional information transfer between AI and humans.'
