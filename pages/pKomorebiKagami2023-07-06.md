Topic description and list of questions can now be read from Firestore

Next, try to put data into Firestore and PostgreSQL based on CSVs of past experiments you have on hand, and use them as a test bed for visualization.
- The original Polis has data on whether the comment is a seed post or not and who posted the opinion.
    - Do we need to indicate "who submitted the opinion?"
    - I feel like I don't need it.
    - I think the state of having opinions you post labeled as "yours" attracts things that are not good, like self-aggrandizement, fear of being rejected, anger, etc.
    - A record of "who contributed the opinion" would be useful for tracking contributions.
