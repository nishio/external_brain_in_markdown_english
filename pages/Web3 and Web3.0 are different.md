from  [[Why DeSci is "public" oriented]]
> The concept of "[[Web3]]" was also proposed by [[Gavin Wood]], another co-founder of [[ethereum]] (unlike [[Web3.0]], which was proposed by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] around 2006).

> Web3 is an aspect of the language for marketing to raise awareness of Ethereum, as well as a language that expresses what we are trying to achieve with the Ethereum system.
>
>  The term Web 3 as it is used today was originally proposed by Gavin Wood, one of the co-founders of Ethereum. In "[Less-techy: What is Web 3.0?" he summarized the Web 3.0 motto as the new web in an era of collapsing trust in the state, as exemplified by the Snowden affair.
>
>  Web 3.0, proposed by Gavin Wood, has since become a movement called Web 3 and its meaning has changed. It is summarized by Ethereum in four main characteristics (Figure 1, ref.)
