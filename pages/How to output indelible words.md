title: "How to output indelible words"
---

Words that come out of our mouths disappear quickly, but written words do not. In the past, the only way to output this "[[infallible word]]" was to write it by hand, but in this age of keyboarding, flicking, voice recognition, and other diverse methods.

I've been using a keyboard since I was in elementary school, and I put more weight on digital communication than verbal communication when I was in middle school through college, so I didn't understand the feelings of those who said "it's quicker to talk". But when I recently switched to thumb shift and my typing speed slowed down because I haven't mastered the keyboard yet, I thought, "Oh, this is how people who are not used to using a keyboard feel.

I now know what it feels like to "feel the pain of output with a keyboard that doesn't allow for speedy input."

But even in that situation, they are already familiar with flick input, so they can choose to use flick.
This is because they know the fast state, so they choose the fastest means when necessary, and those who have never had a speedy means of text output may be suffering [[handicap]] without even knowing it.
