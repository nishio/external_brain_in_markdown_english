Project success depends on balance, member interest, personalization of information, food for intelligence, expense, individual values, AI matching, new teamwork, leader's ability to complement self, tacit knowledge sharing between humans and AI, information from a broad perspective, exploratory nets and KJ method, tacit knowledge and discomfort relationships, uncertainty use of market value Family resemblance is the formation of a group with members who do not share common characteristics but share partial common characteristics.

When using the KJ method to form new teamwork, the approach of first gathering potentially relevant elements in one place and then explaining the group's content is effective
- So, if you're applying that metaphor to teamwork, you're "getting all the people who might be relevant in the first place in one place."<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

To connect stories smoothly, it is important to combine relevant information on a single slide and eliminate irrelevant information

    - Probably not.
    - So you [[Pruning bonsai trees left to grow]] from a state of diversity of behavior.

I would like to go deeper into how these ideas can be applied to the success of the project

Project success depends on balance, member interest, personalization of information, food for intelligence, expense, individual values, AI matching, new teamwork, leader's ability to complement self, tacit knowledge sharing between humans and AI, information from a broad perspective, exploratory nets and KJ method, tacit knowledge and discomfort relationships, uncertainty use of market value Family resemblance is the formation of a group with members who do not share common characteristics but share partial common characteristics.

Relation to Fragment
Nishio's note discusses group creation in the KJ method, which is relevant to my note on new teamwork. His note also discusses the relationship between connecting stories, which is related to my note on the relationship between tacit knowledge and discomfort.

New Thinking (Japanese)
Nishio's notes suggest that a useful approach to forming new teamwork using the KJ method is to first gather potentially relevant elements in one place and then explain the content of the group. It is also helpful to note that in order to connect the narrative smoothly, it is important to group relevant information on a single slide and eliminate irrelevant information. I would like to discuss in more depth how these ideas can be applied to the success of the project.
