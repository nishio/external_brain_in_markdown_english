title: "Limit the size of memory"
---

- The cost of searching for points in the neighborhood is O(N^2)
    - Humans may have hardware solutions.
- Instead of making a similarity determination from all past data, we will only start with the most recent input.
    - That would make it O(N).
- Even those that are not the most recent input are rarely successfully linked, but I'm not sure why that is.
    - Past memories are picked up in dreams, etc. and piled into the "most recent memory".
        - A [[Incremental Reading]]-like [[step-by-step procedure]] algorithm is fine.
- Limiting memory to reasonable values will limit the amount of computation.

- I searched for it by using the phrase "[[Memory size limit]]".
