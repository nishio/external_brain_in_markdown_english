Gain a reputation for being polite.
cxviii
Gain a reputation for being polite.

Develop a reputation for politeness; it is the only way to be liked. Politeness is the main ingredient of culture. It is a kind of magic, and will surely attract the attention of all, just as rudeness will earn their disgust and repulsion. If this latter stems from pride, it is abhorrent; if from bad breeding, it is despicable. Too much courtesy is better than too little. But it must not be the same for all, which would be unfair. Courtesy is especially necessary between adversaries as a sign of courage. It costs little and serves much. Everyone who gives honor receives honor. Courtesy and honor have these advantages and remain with those who show them to others.
