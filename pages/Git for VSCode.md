- I don't have to do anything special to get the git status results in the left panel.
- Click on it, and the differences for that file will be displayed in left and right splits.
    - A mini-map appears in the upper right corner.
    - It's a regular code editor, so you can use jumps to definitions and such.
- This diff can be edited on the fly.
    - I can do something like add -p and edit for each hank, looking over the whole file.
    - Allows stage, unstage, and revert for each selection.
- If you try to commit while the stage is empty, it stages everything, so you can just "write a commit message and Cmd+Enter" to commit.
- I've heard it can do a good job of resolving merge conflicts, but I haven't done it yet.
    - [https://futureys.tokyo/lets-resolve-conflict-on-git-by-vs-code/](https://futureys.tokyo/lets-resolve-conflict-on-git-by-vs-code/)
- You can operate it in a terminal.
    - The vscode side automatically changes to the latest display.
