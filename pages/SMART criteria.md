> In relation to "[[The goal is clear.]]" (page 10), I would like to introduce the SMART criteria proposed in 1981 as something to keep in mind when setting [[Targets]] Note 1: SMART is an acronym for [[Specific]], [[Measurable]], [Assignable 1 The SMART criteria are called SMART (an English word meaning "smart"), which stands for [[Specific]], [[Measurable]], [[Assignable]], [[Realistic]], and [[Time-related]]. A brief explanation of these five items is as followsNote 2.
>
>  ・Specific: Specific areas for improvement are clear.
>  ・Measurable: Quantity, or at least some measure of progress (measurable)
>  ・Assignable: It is clear who will execute the plan.
>  ・Realistic: Realistically achievable, given the resources necessary to realize it.
>  ・Time-related: It is clear when the results will be obtained.

> Because these are standards designed for organizational goal setting, they are somewhat over-specified for individual goal setting. If you think, "I have to meet these standards," then setting goals itself becomes a psychological burden. However, I think it helps us understand why bad goals are bad.

>  Some people consider A to be [[Achievable]] (realistically achievable, given the necessary resources) and R to be [[Responsible]] (it is clear who is responsible for the execution of the plan). Although A and R are interchanged from those presented here, the content is almost identical.
