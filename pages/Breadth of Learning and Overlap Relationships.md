title: "Breadth of Learning and Overlap Relationships"

Here is an interesting development from the "Learn from those with little knowledge." slide.

These two diagrams in this article convey the importance of [[diversity]] very clearly. #Knowledge distribution chart

On the other hand, when I see something like this that seems so obviously good on one side, I am tempted to think, heaven forbid, that it could be good on the other side. (SEE [[The "obviously good" trap.]])

Good point about the former.
    - [[communication]] Low cost
    - The person in front of you knows more than 90% of what you know, so even poorly worded instructions can be understood.
    - It's like, "Do me a favor."
    - I'd rather not have to say anything, but it's getting the message across and it's being done.
    - In the latter situation, the
        - What you take for granted may not be what the other person thinks it is, so if you don't check properly with your blabber, misunderstandings can occur.
        - The same word may be used in different senses
- From the perspective of owning the organization, [[truck number]] is large and low risk
    - Truck number = how many of the project members will be hit by trucks to make it difficult for the project to continue

If learning from each other is beneficial, it is better to create an organization with a high diversity of the latter, even if it means paying high communication costs, by blisteringly checking to see if there are any discrepancies in the assumptions of the conversation and the meanings of words.
I would like to think that this premise of "if it is beneficial to learn from each other" is true for me, but there are probably people out there who don't think so.
