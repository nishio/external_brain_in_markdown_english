title: '"Which parts are AI and which parts are human?" The question is "Which part is AI and which part is human?'
---

When two people get along well, have a lively discussion, and their comments influence each other, it is difficult to discern which part of the resulting material originates from one person.

The same thing happens with humans and AI. The idea of trying to identify this, or to make it identifiable, can be detrimental to the design of the UI.

## note digest
.
When humans and AI work together, it is difficult to discern which of their results originate from which of them, and attempting to do so can be detrimental to UI design.

## Relation to Fragment
.
The note is related to the "🤖🔁Boundaries between humans and AI" fragment. The note points to the difficulty of identifying the results of joint human-AI activities, while the fragment points to the blurring of the human-AI boundary. Both share a common theme regarding the relationship between humans and AI and the difficulty of identifying them.

## deep thinking
The difficulty in identifying the results of joint human-AI activities indicates the blurring of the boundary between humans and AIs. This indicates that joint activities between humans and AI can generate new knowledge and ideas, which can come from AI as well as from humans.

[[**Title of Thought]]
'The difficulty in identifying joint human-AI activities and their consequences.'
