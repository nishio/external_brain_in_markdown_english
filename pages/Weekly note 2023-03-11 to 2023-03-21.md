- He's sleeping with a fever of wisdom.
- There were a lot of exciting conversations at [[Unexplored Conference 2023]] yesterday, but I can't summarize them.

What did you do last week?
- Monday Keichobot+GPT with WebUI
    - More precisely, I added a flag to the existing Keichobot code to use GPT.
    - This feature is now in closed beta
        - [[Keichobot+GPT test 2023-03-06]]
        - [[LLM, regression testing and A/B testing]]
- Tuesday I added a summary function.
        - [[Summary functionality.]]
- Wednesday
        - [[I connected my Scrapbox to ChatGPT.]]
- Thursday
    - Released because people who saw Wednesday's experiment had high expectations that they wanted to do it, too.

    - Keichobot crashes when chat logs get long, fixed.
        - Longer chat logs also kill the summary function.

- Friday
        - [[Unexplored Conference 2023]]
