title: "Unlimited use of Advanced Voice"

Try "Unlimited access to advanced voice" that came with [[ChatGPT Pro]], which I signed up for [[o1 Pro]].

The quality of the transcription is high, no need to operate the screen, good for thinking while walking around.
- Developmental resolution of [[Keichobot]]!

Locking the screen interrupts the conversation.

    - Whoa, I can run it in the background.

- We were able to talk to each other even in a locked state!

I was wondering if I could talk to Custom GPTs that read my Scrapbox, but that seems to be the old voice mode.

Can you just transcribe it?

- Now if you turn off the audio, the conversation will be automatically logged.

If the base is 4o, it would be possible to direct a Keichobot-like listening posture with prompts

Connecting the headset and washing dishes while talking to the phone in my breast pocket to organize the work I'm going to do later.

- It was more comfortable than I had imagined.
- I'm done washing dishes and I'm going to do it from the top of my organized task list.
- Currently, the AI doesn't read desktop code or anything else yet, but it can be pair-proofed in the near future. Good listening skills in Japanese.
- Come back to the PC and do this

    - The AI's "memory" is in the cloud, so what you say by voice on your phone is there in text form when you come back to your PC.
- Especially in the context of training for newcomers, a single tutor for N newcomers is a one-person job for most of the time, but if the newcomer and the AI are conversing as they proceed, the tutor's "understanding of the newcomer's internal state" will be better.

It does indeed seem to cut out if you leave it plugged in silently.
- Smart speaker-like usage is not possible right now.
- However, it's only a matter of time, as it would be possible to do so by introducing the appropriate wake words
