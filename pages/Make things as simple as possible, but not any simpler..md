>  Make things as simple as possible, but not any simpler.
>  — [[Albert Einstein]]

It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience.

- The only confirmed expression that Einstein actually wrote was this form in 1933, and the famous form in 1950[[Roger Sessions]]がそれを解釈して書いたものだろう、とのこと<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Einstein's original statement was not disseminated because it was difficult, and what others "simplified" was disseminated as Einstein's statement
    - I don't know if this hasn't been made SIMPLER or not, because I haven't read the original text on Einstein's side.
    - Basically, I think he wanted to say something like [Occam's razor
        - Theory should be the minimum simple thing that can explain the phenomenon, but it should not be even simpler than that (i.e., it cannot explain the phenomenon).
- I found the PDF.





from Quote Investigator
> The New York Times published an article by the composer [[Roger Sessions]] on January 8, 1950 titled “How a ‘Difficult’ Composer Gets That Way”, and it included a version of the saying attributed to Einstein `[AERS]`:
- I also remember a remark of Albert Einstein, which certainly applies to music. He said, in effect, that everything should be as simple as it can be but not simpler!
> Alice Calaprice the editor of “The Ultimate Quotable Einstein” presented the following 1933 precursor quotation and comment in her reference work `[UQUE]`:
- >  It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience.

- >  From “On the Method of Theoretical Physics,” the Herbert Spencer Lecture, Oxford, June 10, 1933. This is the Oxford University’ Press version. The words “simple,” “simplest,” and “simplicity” recur throughout the lecture. The version reprinted in 1954 in Ideas and Opinions, 272, is a bit different. This sentence may be the origin of the much-quoted sentence that “everything should be as simple as possible, but not simpler,” and its variants.

> QI thinks that the existence of this quotation supports the plausibility of the hypothesis that [[Roger Sessions]] did read or hear something from Albert Einstein that catalyzed the dissemination of the maxim.
