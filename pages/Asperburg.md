I'm strangely fond of someone who called the phenomenon of a sophisticated workplace (rather than a city, where the typical developmental becomes maladjusted) by continuously giving each other rude and precise no-no's a "Asperburg", but since Eron Musk has been diagnosed with [[developmental disorder]], it's exactly what we're seeing now. Twitter is Asperburg

I'm not sure if this is a problem for the Asperburgers, but I'm not sure if it's a problem for the Asperburgers.
