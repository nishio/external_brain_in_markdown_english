- [[Scrapbox Onboarding]] Notes


- Create your own page.
    - Select `Create my page` from the top left menu
    - Your "own page" will then be generated!
    - If you don't like the generated user name, just edit the title of the page to something more understandable.

- You can place your own iconic image on your page
    - `[nishio.icon]` will be displayed as [nishio.icon
    - Images can be added to the page by dragging and dropping files or pasting from the clipboard
    - On PC, you can insert your own icon with `Ctrl+i
        - If you use Scrapbox from your phone, you may want to register the word

- Write a self-introduction.
    - This is so the other members understand who you are.
    - Bullet points with spaces or tabs
    - Select a keyword and press square brackets to make it a "link
        - Red links are links that have not yet led anywhere, blue links are links that have led somewhere
        - If you keep linking to keywords as if you are highlighting them, it will be interesting to connect with people who have written the same link in their introductions!
