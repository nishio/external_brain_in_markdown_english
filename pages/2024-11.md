[Progress made.
    - Continued to expand functionality of [New UI for Polis
- Real-time reflection of voting results, additional UI elements for improved usability
- Almost ready to move from staging to production environment
- Dissemination to the event community
- Conduct new UI demos at [[Social Hack Day #65]] (tentative) and other events to gather feedback from general users.
- Share "Democracy Update" type discussions in online study groups to deepen your knowledge

[[Being stagnant]].
- Documentation of data update process
- Manual creation for "a system that allows even administrators to easily update data," which had been an issue since the previous month, is running behind schedule.
- Public and private scheduling
- Other projects and private tasks increase toward the end of the year, making it difficult to find time for development.

Awareness and issues
- Event participation and demonstrations enable early detection of usability issues, but make it difficult to determine implementation priorities
- Internal and external sharing has not kept pace, making it difficult to keep track of "what was done and when".

[Points for the future
- Clarify timelines and manage tasks with sufficient time to spare in order to continue development in parallel with year-end progress
- Prioritize the collected feedback and complete the data update process and documentation by the end of the year.
- Promote consensus building by re-sharing and visualizing the progress and issues of the entire team through internal study sessions and online presentations
