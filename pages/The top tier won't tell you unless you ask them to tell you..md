> If you're a crazy good person, you can ask for [[advice]] and they will give you very serious and precise pointers. Without much care. In return, they will teach you thoroughly and carefully... But these people tend not to work on their own unless you say, "Tell me, point out everything!" They tend not to move on their own unless you say, "I want you to tell me, point out everything! They know that if they don't see how much [[real sword (as opposed to unsharpened or wooden practice weapon) (practice)]] they are dealing with, they will hurt them.
from  [[Do it right" is a mid-core philosophy.]]
