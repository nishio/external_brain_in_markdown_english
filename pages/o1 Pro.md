[[GPT3]](3.5)と[[GPT-4]]を区別する意味はあまりないな〜と、対話相手を表示するアイコンとしては区別しないで[[GPT]]<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT/icon' alt='GPT.icon' height="19.5"/>I have been using the GPT.icon, but as of 2024-12-08 I feel the need to distinguish between GPT-4o, which <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT/icon' alt='GPT.icon' height="19.5"/> means, and GPT [[o1]] pro mode, so I have created a new icon
- Available only with [[ChatGPT Pro]] for $200/month as of 2024-12-11
- Difference between o1 and o1 pro
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT-4.5/icon' alt='GPT-4.5.icon' height="19.5"/>The main difference between OpenAI's o1 and o1 pro is the amount of computational resources used and the associated increase in performance. o1 pro: Utilizes more computational resources than o1 and provides highly accurate answers, especially in areas such as mathematics, programming, and scientific research.
