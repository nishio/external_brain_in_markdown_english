title: "Resources.Load"

- `Resources.Load("foo")` reads `\Assets\Resources\foo
- Do you add file extensions or not? I wondered, but when the file is placed under Assets, the import process runs on the Unity side, and the file is referenced with the name without the file extension.

#Dynamic loading
