Treatment of nominal scale

Embed a nominal measure into a vector space on {0,1}. Embed the nominal measure into the vector space on {0,1}. Reduce by 1 dimension after embedding. Think of it as a discrete distance space.

### Summary of notes
.
Embed the nominal scale in a vector space and treat it as a discrete distance space by reducing one dimension.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The note and the fragment "{0, 1} for real numbers from 0 to 1" are highly related. Both share the idea of embedding real numbers in a discrete space.

### deep thinking
Embedding the nominal scale in a vector space allows discrete data to be represented in a continuous space. This allows for a more intuitive understanding of the relationships between data.
