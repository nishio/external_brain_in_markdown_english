title: "Row links are cut-out opportunities"

When you refer to something in Scrapbox with a [[forward link]], I think it's because the page is too big for you to see what you want to see, or the explanation at the beginning of the page is misleading. I think it's strange that it's on one page in the first place, and you're suggesting a chance to [[start a fire (with flint, by rubbing sticks together, etc.)]] on a separate page.

This article was written before the scroll-to-link feature (I'll find out later what it is officially called) was introduced. This feature allows mid-page content to be linked to without using line IDs, etc., which alleviates a lot of the earlier problems.

Actual example: [[Ideal, Reality and Helplessness]].

- [[If you want to link a line to a long sentence, cut it out on a separate page.]]
