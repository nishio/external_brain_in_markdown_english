title: 'There are two kinds of "communicative."'

> [kawahiii](https://twitter.com/kawahiii/status/1709727324013293799) Ahhhh, I get it. I see that "high [[communal skills]]" also includes [Two types.
>
>  One is [[the type that creates a kicker]].
>  This can be a crass thing to say and make the other person feel negative, but without [[cue]] in the first place, there would be no relationship, so it's a good communicator.
>
>  The second type is [[good at organizing traffic]].
>  This is an ability that is demonstrated in situations where communication is necessary in the first place, and is someone who reduces noise that other people don't like and makes the situation run smoothly. Therefore, in workplaces where communication is necessary in the first place, this type of communicative ability is demonstrated, but since they do not create opportunities on their own, the place becomes a bit awkward when this type of person gathers together.

>  Of course you do both to a greater or lesser extent, but the two are opposite abilities in the sense of "increasing/reducing noise," so if you are good at [[traffic control]], for example, if someone wants to create a kicker, you can't do it because you think, "Wouldn't this person hate being told this?" and they can't do it because they think, "I'm not going to be able to do that. Because that is an act of increasing noise.

>  I think I have found a classification that is very clear to me personally. By the way, I'm a traffic-clearing type. I think the "kick-starting" type is more rare today.

> [kawahiii](https://twitter.com/kawahiii/status/1709733215961821542) Conflicts are the source of understanding. I've been thinking about this for a long time, and this story can be seen as the occurrence and resolution of conflicts.
>  >kawahiii: I think this is similar to the idea that "[[the]] resolution of conflicts is what forms a community. As long as human relations are dynamic, we are always dissolving some [[complex inter-relationship (as in the struggle between two types of vine over one piece of land)]]. If we speak of it in terms of a [[gemeinschaft]] will, is that an understanding?

It can be said that [[creating a trigger]] is [[0 to 1]].
- [[Breakthrough]]
    - [[impetus]]
What is the traffic to be reduced to 90 when it should be 100, and then reduced back to 100?
- Maybe the axes are different to begin with.
    - [[maintenance]]
- [[Clear up confusion]].
    - [[Problem Solving]]


[[Communication skills]]
[[miscellaneous remarks]].
- [[Engulfing force]]
