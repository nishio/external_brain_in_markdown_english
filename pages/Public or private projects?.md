title: "Public or private projects?"
---

The beauty of [[Scrapbox]] is that it becomes easier to understand when the amount of pages in a project exceeds a certain amount (100-500)
So, if you are a first time user, I recommend that you first create a project where you can write about anything and not define a theme.
The next question that confuses people who want to create a project for the first time is whether to make it a public or private project.

Disadvantages of public disclosure
- For some people, the "possibility of being seen by others" leads to atrophy in writing and pressure to achieve a high level of perfection.
    - I've been blogging for over 10 years before Scrapbox and it didn't cause atrophy, but if you're not sure if you're going to atrophy, I'd say knock it on the safe side and keep it private.
            - It is important to write spontaneously with a sense of [psychological safety
    - There was pressure on me, too, to achieve a high level of perfection.
        - The form of expression "blog" distorts perception due to its strong affort to be a stand-alone and complete form.
        - The definition of "perfection" is vague.
                - [[Appearance as a reading material]] tends to be considered as perfection.
            - Even a three-line bullet list or a single sentence can have high value
            - A shift in perspective is needed: what is important is the value of the information, not its physical appearance.
- (Japanese) Copyright Act
    - Quoting is legal, but if you do it in a public project and say, "I was reading a book and this sentence really stuck out to me, so I'm going to take a note of it," it might seem like a violation of [[public transmission rights (e.g., putting copyrightable material on the WWW or an FTP server)]]. FTP server)].
    - If it is private, it is legal under [[Reproduction for personal use]] since it is not transmitted to the public.

Benefits to the Public
