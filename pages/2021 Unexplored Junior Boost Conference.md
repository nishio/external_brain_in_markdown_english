title: "2021 Unexplored Junior Boost Conference"
---

In 2021 [[unexplored junior]] [[Boost Conference]] a new attempt was made.

I'll sort it out later (after the weekend lecture).
- [[Asynchronous presentation]]
- [[Deepen mutual understanding with Scrapbox]]
- [[Wiki is a good place to introduce yourself.]]
- [[Tool Culture Issues]]
Volume of information transmission and sense of liveliness
- [[Legitimate Peripheral Participation]]

> I think the reason for the success of Unexplored Junior was that there were several Scrapbox heavy users on the management side (the people who create the place).

I think it was essentially important that there be more than one person.
- One person would have created a dictatorial atmosphere.
- An open discussion about "not erasing" between these two men took place.
        - [[Fairness + Groupware]]
        - [[The rule against erasing is too strong.]]
        - [[Rules are a product of past negotiations.]]

Quantitatively, the amount of written feedback for each project has increased dramatically.
- I doubt it's more than 10 times as much.
- We knew the day before that the amount of feedback on this scale was high.
    - The amount of feedback is already too much for voice
