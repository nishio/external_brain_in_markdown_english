title: "household handicraft industry"
---

> Household handicraft is a form of industry. The producer (and his family) directly owns the capital necessary for production. The actual work is mainly "handiwork" by craftsmen, and tools are usually necessary for production and require skill in their handling.
- > As wealth accumulation progressed and the volume of orders increased, the industry shifted to a "wholesale household industry" in which accumulated funds were used to invest in equipment, which was then rented out to others for work orders, and the products were purchased. However, since this system disperses equipment from one house to another and makes it difficult to manage progress, the industry then changes to a [[factory-based handicraft industry]] (manufacture), in which equipment and workers are gathered in a single factory.
- >  In families that do not accumulate enough wealth, they supplement their lack of work with orders from wholesalers in the wholesale handicraft industry, and eventually abandon their own equipment and become workers in the factory-based handicraft industry.
