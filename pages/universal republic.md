<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/> [[Kant's]] concept of a "world republic" was one of the central elements of his theory of peace, primarily detailed in his work [[For Eternal Peace]] (1795). This philosophy was proposed as the ideal political structure for achieving lasting peace.

Kant argued that lasting peace among nations is possible only through a departure from the state of nature and coexistence under the rule of law. He believed that individual states must remain independent, yet recognize each other and act in accordance with [[international law]]. In this regard, he proposed the concept of "[[world citizenship]]," focusing not only on relations between nations, but also on the rights and obligations that individuals have as members of the whole human race.

Although the term "world republic" was not strictly defined by Kant, his theory is based on three basic pillars
- Domestic Republic: For Kant, [[republicanism]] meant a political system that emphasized freedom, equality, and the rule of law. He believed that this form of government tended to respect the rights of citizens and avoid war.
- International Legal Framework: We advocated the establishment of a legal framework to promote peaceful coexistence among nations. This includes that disputes should be resolved by peaceful means and that all nations should be treated equally.
- World citizenship: the idea that individual human beings should enjoy basic rights wherever they are in the world. These include the right to cross borders in search of security and the right to promote dialogue between peoples of different nations.

Kant's "World Republic" has had a profound influence on modern international relations and international institutions. In particular, his ideas are reflected in the founding principles of the [[United Nations]] and in the development of international law. Kant's vision does not entail a complete abandonment of national sovereignty, but rather presents the ideal that nations should respect each other and act according to the rule of law.
