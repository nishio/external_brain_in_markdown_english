> In other words, "Only by focusing on [[contribution]] in one's work and in one's relationships with others can one have good human relations. This is how [[human relations]] become productive. The only definition of a good relationship is that it is truly [[productive]]."--- "[[Professional Requirements]]" ([[Drucker.]])
