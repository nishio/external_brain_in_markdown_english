> [komukaepapa](https://x.com/komukaepapa/status/1851635445555507590) This is serious. In the 6 years immediately after the earthquake, 15.5 trillion yen, 120,000 yen per person, or about 500,000 yen for a family of four, had to be sent overseas to cover the cost of stopping nuclear power generation with thermal power generation. And we are still being forced to buy additional fuel.

>  >syatekiya931: The people who are giving away the most money overseas are the ones who stopped the nuclear power plants and started the fire engines.


> [komukaepapa](https://x.com/komukaepapa/status/1851636456823157158) [[Baramaki]] is..! It's not ODA, it's not tied to international cooperation, it's not in the national interest, it's simply giving away money to oil-producing countries.

> [takesegsan](https://x.com/takesegsan/status/1851787499397615649) Japan continues to buy solar panels (made in China) in addition to fuel

> [IronKeepRonin](https://x.com/IronKeepRonin/status/1851779222857207896) You mean you want to be like Germany?
>  >KS_1013: Germany, which aims to be de-Russian, nuclear-free, and decarbonized, is facing a difficult situation for its industry due to high electricity costs. The government is offering tax incentives and subsidies to heavy industrial companies. Well, they have to.... It is now clear that the source of Germany's competitiveness was cheap energy. x.com/dpa_intl/statu...

>  Adult video stories.
>  Many people are going to foreign sites to see them because they are modified domestically, and if such things are uncensored domestically, money will fall into the country.
>  He said it would be the same to see anyway.
>  He said it is foolish to channel money to foreign countries.

> [Balsa60_53864](https://x.com/Balsa60_53864/status/1851778529924649156) This is also the former DPJ Prime Minister Naoto Kan.

> [NNHTSJ](https://x.com/NNHTSJ/status/1851771465164820487) The cause is the shutdown of nuclear power plants during the former Democratic Party of Japan and the demonstrations to abolish nuclear power plants in 2011 and after.
>  I managed to keep a thermal power plant running that was about to be decommissioned or refurbished.

>  If it disappears, people will die in summer and winter.

> [appledarwin](https://x.com/appledarwin/status/1851809398395633936) The merits and demerits of nuclear power are so many and troubling.
>
>  In the short term, it is difficult due to the rising cost of imports of many fuels
>  But in the long run, nuclear power is a "10,000 year loan with zero down payment", so it's hell in the long run.
>
>  That said, as long as other countries are using nuclear power plants, we cannot compete on cost with non-nuclear power generation.
>  We have to wait for nuclear fusion to be established.

> [99nyorituryo](https://x.com/99nyorituryo/status/1851967987626201589) If power generation methods that do not require fuel were more widely used, there would have been less impact even if nuclear power plants were shut down by accidents.

> [takahiroaoyama](https://x.com/takahiroaoyama/status/1851818589743194474) Japan is the only country that would not be competitive without nuclear power, and I think all those who had it stopped should use their private funds to make up for this.

> [nakanoda](https://x.com/nakanoda/status/1851948610793148866) To this we need to add the renewable energy installment under the FIT system....

> [kaidhuai](https://x.com/kaidhuai/status/1851894838213644434) The cost of dealing with several nuclear accidents in the next few decades is also included in the calculation.

>  You have restarted.

> [dai_001_2007](https://x.com/dai_001_2007/status/1851862180528005513) Moreover, from a global perspective, we are simply burning finite fossil fuels.

> [mobilaw2023](https://x.com/mobilaw2023/status/1851833753326498049) They say "decommissioning will cost a fortune!" I think we all know that the cost of decommissioning the plant is nothing more than a few dollars.

> [diizuka](https://x.com/diizuka/status/1851856423195677139) The risk that the area within a 20 km radius of the plant will be off limits for hundreds of years and that trillions of yen of wealth will flow overseas every year,
>  Which has more impact on the Japanese economy?
>  For the local people affected by the disaster, though, the loss of their hometown is an event that cannot be replaced by money.

> [snowboz](https://x.com/snowboz/status/1851780850800889865) Moreover, they are being ridiculed and ripped off by the Japan Premium...

> [skyblue465](https://x.com/skyblue465/status/1851775354387730851) Why don't you compare it to the cost of nuclear power? You have to include the cost of reprocessing and disposing of the spent fuel.

> [AZR65](https://x.com/AZR65/status/1851791975311380926) I wonder if Yubari coal won't do.

> [nobuomatsuura](https://x.com/nobuomatsuura/status/1851868158518542658) Let's move the nuclear power plant as soon as possible.

> [FPdKGP5EcC78863](https://x.com/FPdKGP5EcC78863/status/1851791868369211832) One of the merits of the Democratic Party administration...
>  Moreover, they have enacted the crazy Renewable Energy Purchase Law and continue to burden the public with skyrocketing electricity costs.
