## Diversity and the personal credit system
.
- Does technium evolution refer to a dynamic change in technology or is there a deeper meaning?
- Further study is needed on the relationship between collective free will and diversity.
- The balance between credit systems and diversity may lead to new value creation in firms and organizations. In this connection, aspects of lower costs and lower barriers to activation that cause discontinuous change should also be considered.
    - [[Balance of credit systems and diversity]] „Å®„ÅÑ„ÅÜÂØæÁΩÆ„ÅØËààÂë≥Ê∑±„ÅÑ<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Does implementing a credit system and placing a higher value on one individual than another undermine diversity?
    - To think that this undermines diversity assumes that each individual is of equal value, but that's like saying "bad because it's bad."
    - For example, if there are 10 people and 9 people have the same opinion, it is more diverse to give only 1/9 vote to 9 people
    - It is reasonable to assume that people's values are equal as an uninformed prior distribution, but perhaps the values should be updated Bayesianly by subsequent observations

## Transformation into a Critic and the Stretch Method
.
- Whether or not to avoid transformation into a critic may be a question that depends on personal values and social context.
    - I think so.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- In this connection, is there a process of taking out the flavor and discarding it, as the dashi metaphor suggests?
    - What you consider good taste itself depends on your personal values.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Specific applications of the stretch method will be investigated in relation to the possibility of parallel work and the concept of blue oceans near corporate boundaries.
    - Ah, that's a good idea.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - In other words, [[The Curse of Production]] is the obsession that you have to keep producing.
        - But this is swinging for "[[use]]" in [[trade-offs between use and exploration]].
            - Actions that attempt to squeeze the most value out of the learned self.
        - Explore blue oceans near the boundaries and in parallel work, rather than continuing to "use" in "companies" that are already adapted.
        - This may not produce in the short term, but investment for better value in the long term
        - This can be likened to the balance between exertion and weakness in the muscles
        - Stretching is important = exploration is important

Are hackathons and community activities associated with collective free will?
- Of course I think so.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - It's a different kind of collective will through an economic system, a system that uses attention and admiration as currency.

Isn't the exploration of metaphors from the dashi part related to the abstraction and reconstruction of knowledge?
- This is an interesting point<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - The phrase "[[use as a pretext]]" means "to extract flavor," i.e., [[abstraction]].
    - Using dashi for another purpose is [[abstracting and applying]].

## Speeches and technical/managerial perspectives
.
- Specific examples of IT technology in the real world and its impact need to be introduced and discussed in detail; the connection between the community and technology, such as the story of JA Miura, is important.
- Could the removal of barriers to communication in the Irodori system also be related to diversity and personal trust systems?
- Parallel work with the C part of ICT and advances in groupware may have some relevance to the curse of production.

## Other considerations
.
- Isn't the exploration of metaphors from the dashi part related to the abstraction and reconstruction of knowledge?
- How does the elimination of errors and the evolution of codes relate to the evolution of technium?
- Are hackathons and community activities associated with collective free will?

## Questions and Deepening Thoughts
- How are these topics interrelated?
- How should the bridge between human behavior and technology be built?
- While a wide variety of interests can deepen knowledge, finding connections between each topic may be a new challenge. What should be the focus?

These notes will help determine future research directions. We will continue to examine them to find even deeper insights and connections.
