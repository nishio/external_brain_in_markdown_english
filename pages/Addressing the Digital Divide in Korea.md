Older generations are less likely to use digital devices and services than younger generations, and in some cases feel inconvenienced and alienated in their daily lives. In particular, in recent years, the replacement of unmanned kiosk terminals for ordering at restaurants, paying utility bills, and other services has become a social issue, causing confusion among the elderly. For this reason, the government and local governments are working to subsidize the development of terminals with an elderly-friendly UI and to provide digital education programs.

The National Human Rights Commission of Korea also issued a recommendation in 2024 that "the elderly should be guaranteed access to digital access" and asked for support in terms of the right to access information for everyone.

Specific measures include the widespread use of smartphones with larger font sizes and voice-guided ATMs for seniors, and smartphone workshops at local public facilities. In addition, subsidies for the purchase of digital devices and support for communication costs are also provided to the disabled and low-income groups, and efforts are underway to ensure that no one is left behind in the digital society. The Korean government advocates an inclusive nation in the digital age, and has set the correction of digital disparities and social inclusion as important policy goals.
