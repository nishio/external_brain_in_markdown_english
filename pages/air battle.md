- A sterile conversation discussing using [[floating in midair]] [[abstract concept]] without [[one's feet on the ground]] attached.
Neither of us knows what the other is saying, but neither of us can say "I don't know".
What is your definition of AI in [[concrete]] terms?" and [[question]] is not possible.

Even if you don't understand, pretend you do and continue the conversation.
Why can't we say "I don't know" because we think it's a [[shame]].
- Rather than making [[An understandable argument]], I consider a conversation to be passable if it ends without the "I don't understand" being revealed.

relevance
    - [[Afraid to say, "I don't know."]]
