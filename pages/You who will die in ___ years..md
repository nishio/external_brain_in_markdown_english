- [You who will die in ___ years](https://shinuwani.netlify.com/)
    - [Live as if you will die tomorrow, learn as if you will live forever.
    - Most people don't feel the reality of "I could die tomorrow."
    - On the other hand, they somehow make the assumption that they are going to live longer, which is an incorrect perception of reality.
    - I wanted to get a correct perception of what the reality is, so I used the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare's [[Mortality Rates by Age]] data for my calculations.
