title: "May not be completed"
---

Lessons learned this time
- In the worst case scenario, when [[estimate]] a "task A" that is [[weak (in)]] and therefore [[we don't know how long it will take]] may [[conflict]] with other tasks and prevent other [[more important]] tasks from being completed...
- [Fear will not solve anything, so we have to start with A and improve [[estimation accuracy]].
- Increase estimation accuracy [[re-determine]] [[deadlines first]].
- Decide to cancel the least important task (in this case, preparation for the in-house study meeting) if what was started at that time swings badly and is unlikely to be completed
