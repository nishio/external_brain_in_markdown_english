title: "Assumption of intent in statements"
---

- [[proposal]] with [[intention]] [[assumption]]
- Some people make the unspoken assumption that statements made by others must be made with some kind of intention.
- Such people read non-existent intentions such as "I am trying to get the person who created this situation to change his/her behavior" from the mere [[information sharing]] "I think this situation is not good.

- There are those who believe that "everything should be open to the public except what we don't want to be seen."
- When such people observe the world and think, "I see, this is the structure of the world," they tend to write their "interpretation of the world" immediately.
- That's not to say that I expect anyone to change their behavior.
