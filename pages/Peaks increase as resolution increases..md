- [In response to the question, "Isn't listening to individual opinions a distraction from [[global optimization]]?" In response to the question "Isn't it a distraction from [[global optimization]]?
- First of all, the basic premise is that broad listening is [[glasses]] for a closer look.
    - Audrey Tang:  [[Wearing glasses does not make your eyes unnecessary.]]
- Without broad listening, the world is perceived as blurred and fuzzy (A)
    - For example, "People are two groups: supporters of the ruling party and regime change," etc. Perceptions
        - In fact, there are groups that say, "I don't support the ruling party, but I don't support the first opposition party either."
    - Going to the top of a vaguely perceived "rough cluster" is the optimal solution for individual politicians in this cognitive state.
- Having the means to observe in detail shows that there are many clusters in the world (B)
    - At this point, if there is "some size" for each cluster, then occupying the peak there is more advantageous than (A)
    - Focusing on individual politicians makes it look like they are optimizing for small clusters and moving away from the overall optimum, but they are not "moving away" because the reason (A) looked overall optimum is because of the low-pass filter that obscures the details in the first place.
    - Rather, as a whole set of politicians will better approximate the distribution of opinion by going for individual peaks.

This is not only about political opinions, but also about the distribution of customer needs when producing and selling products.
- If you look at the details, there are diverse needs.
- Whether or not it is a good strategy to produce small quantities [[of various products]] depends on production costs and other factors.
    - If individual production costs are high and cost savings can be realized by producing in bulk, mass production is advantageous.
    - If individual production costs fall, it is more advantageous to produce the best match for each customer's needs in small quantities for each individual customer.
    - [[Production costs]] often go down with technological advances, so there is often a shift from mass production to individual production.
