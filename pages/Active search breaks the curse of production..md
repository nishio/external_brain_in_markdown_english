## The transformation of a creator into a critic.
The change to critique and the relationship of the stretch method to the critique. The following issues are considered:
- How should the transformation into a critic be avoided?
- How can the stretching method be applied?
- Maybe we don't need to avoid it.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon' alt='/nishio/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - A related concept is [[The Curse of Production]].
    - Aversion to not engaging in productive activity makes it impossible to rest
    - If you think of this in terms of the stretching metaphor, it's like you keep putting pressure on a muscle and never stretch it, not good.

## Transformation into a Critic and the Stretch Method
.
- Specific applications of the stretch method will be investigated in relation to the possibility of parallel work and the concept of blue oceans near corporate boundaries.
    - Ah, that's a good idea.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon' alt='/nishio/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - In other words, [[The Curse of Production]] is the obsession that you have to keep producing.
        - But this is swinging for "[[use]]" in [[trade-offs between use and exploration]].
            - Actions that attempt to squeeze the most value out of the learned self.
        - Explore blue oceans near the boundaries and in parallel work, rather than continuing to "use" in "companies" that are already adapted.
        - This may not produce in the short term, but investment for better value in the long term
        - This can be likened to the balance between exertion and weakness in the muscles
        - Stretching is important = exploration is important
