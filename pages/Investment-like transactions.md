- An "investment-like transaction" is a transaction in which a present provision of goods or services is entered into with the expectation of future returns or profits. An investment-like transaction assumes that some or all of the profit will accrue in the future.

- For example, the purchase of a stock is a typical investment-like transaction. When purchasing a stock, the investor uses current wealth (money) to buy the stock and expects that the stock will produce a dividend in the future or that the stock price will rise, thereby earning a profit.

- Similarly, there are investment-like transactions in business.
    - When a company purchases equipment to start a new product line, it expects that the equipment will produce new products in the future, which will then be sold for a profit.
