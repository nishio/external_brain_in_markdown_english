People who are allowed to fail [[and who have grown through a series of failures]] [[can be kind to the failures of others]].
>  It's not about which is better, but [[in an environment where people can fail, more people will try]] and [[more challenges means more failures]].
>  It's important to think about which environment is best for you to grow in.
