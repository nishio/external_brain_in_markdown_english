Those who think, "I know [[the industry]] well, but recently [[those who don't know well]] have been making [[strange moves]]," only know "about [[the industry's]] [a past (i.e. a personal history)," and this [[pride]] prevents them from [[observing]] "about [[this]] in the industry" [[without distortion]]. This [[pride]] prevents them from [[observing without distortion]] "the industry's [[this]] thing".
