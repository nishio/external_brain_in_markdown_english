title: "There are two societies."
---

- [[community]] has two
- A: A society that is "the set of all people
- B: A society that is "the set of people with whom I interact".

B is a subset of A
- People can only observe B.
    - Many people think A "would be" but it is not [[observed fact]] for the individual
- There is no "right for others to exist" in the latter world.
    - If you don't want a person P in your observation range on a social networking site, you can mute him or her.
        - Can make person P non-existent from that society.
- Each individual has a subjective society and the right to ignore others P in that society.
    - No one else P has the right to be ignored.

Should be named.
- B: [[subjective social]].
- A: [[objective society]].
    - Objective society is a conceptual entity, and whether it is real or not cannot be verified.

How did this story come about?
- Broadlisting for Governor.
- We did some broad listening within the company.
        - [[Corporate Broad Listening]]
- Many people think of a city or a country when they hear the word "society," but a company is also a society.
    - The company is not a subset of the capital...(some people live in other prefectures).
    - Not even a subset of countries (can work remotely from other countries)
    - If "the set of all people" is society A, then there exists a "society X such that it is a subset of society A."
    - There may be people p who are forced to do child labor in Africa, but most Japanese do not observe it and usually ignore it in their lives.
    - No, wait, what? There's someone in your company who "doesn't know you exist because they haven't observed you and usually ignore you".
    - I mean, for each individual, there's a social B called "the set of people observing."
    - This is defined by personal observation, so of course it is subjective and varies from person to person

Q: What is the difference between [[Community]] and Society B?
A: If we believe that a community exists objectively, independent of individual perceptions, then it is a conceptual entity and cannot be verified as real.
    - [[The community does not objectively exist.]]
    - Explanation: [[Overlapping subjective communities.]]
