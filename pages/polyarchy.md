# "Polyarchy" Overview
.
Dahl defines the ideal democracy as "a system in which all citizens can participate, speak, and influence decision-making equally. In reality, however, this is difficult to achieve, so he named the democracy that is actually attainable as "polyarchy," and laid out the following two axes.

1.### [[participation]]
- The degree to which citizens participate in political decision-making. Refers to the involvement of citizens in politics through elections and freedom of expression.

2.### [[public contestation]]
- The degree to which dissent and opposition to political power can be freely expressed and competed. The existence of multiple political parties, meaning that a change of government is possible.

The higher these two axes rise, Dahl argued, the more pluralistic and democratic the polity will be.
