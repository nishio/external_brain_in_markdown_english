title: "Intellectual production with AI and the difficulty of organizing it"

SUMMARY: Intelligent interaction with AI using a smartphone brings new insights, but the resulting organization of fragments and long descriptions is constrained.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>

I ran a script that could interact with the AI that read my Scrapbox from my phone.
As a result, there's a lot of intellectual production going on, and because I didn't have a computer, I couldn't organize it, so now it's very difficult.

I couldn't organize it because I didn't have a PC."
→What is the state of this?

From my phone, it was inconvenient to write down only fragments in the first place, or to cut them out or search for them.

I see. I remember hearing something like "intellectual production is possible even without a PC" from Mr. Nishio before, so I wondered if the situation had changed since then.

That's what I'm talking about for those who assume that you can't produce intellectually unless you sit at a desk, that you can think and write down bits and pieces.

I understand recording fragments.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
What happened this time was not "humans thinking and writing down" but "AI developing fragments written down by humans".
The result was accelerated thinking and a lot of fragments that weren't properly organized.
The hard part was in sorting this out.

AI develops fragments written down by humans.
I was just wondering about that,
Did you enjoy having AI develop this for you, Nishio?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
It was a lot of fun and a huge amount of new awareness.
I didn't have time to write it down in an organized fashion.
I've been interrupted at funerals and such.
I need to make an observation without the condition of being interrupted at a funeral.

Why do you want to talk to humans despite having such a good time? So that's the question that came to mind.
    - [[Why would you want to talk to a human being when you can talk to an AI 24 hours a day?]]

I could "write down fragments" and "develop fragments into an AI" on my phone, but the fact that I didn't have time to settle down and write long sentences was the hardest factor.

The same is true when talking to humans.
- utter a fragment
- Fragments are developed by the other party.
- No time to calm down and sort it out.

### digest
.
Intellectual dialogue with AI using a smartphone generates new insights, but there are limitations in organizing fragments and describing long sentences. dialogue with AI facilitates intellectual production, but it is difficult to organize the resulting fragments. Also, operating from a smartphone makes it inconvenient to describe or search for fragments. Instead of humans thinking and writing down the fragments, AI accelerates thinking by developing fragments, resulting in a large number of unorganized fragments. It is difficult to organize these.

### Relation to Fragment
.
Fragment "Intellectual Collaboration between AI and Humans" shows new possibilities in AI-human collaboration and intellectual production, which are relevant to the notebook. Specifically, the commonality is that AI accelerates thinking by developing fragments written down by humans, resulting in a large number of unorganized fragments.

### deep thinking
While the potential for intellectual production through AI-human collaboration is great, it also highlights the challenges of organizing fragments and writing long sentences. This indicates the importance of finding the optimal balance between AI and human collaboration.
