    - The act of [[Organizing Information]] itself is classified into three categories according to its history.



- Scrapbox is "[[card]]-type smooth [[Wiki]].
    - [[level]] and [[flat]]
        - [[classificatory arrangement]] and [[Organizing for retrieval]]
        - [[The Art of Intellectual Production]]
    - [[Information Organization 1.0]]
        - [[Location-based organization]]
    - Hierarchy fits
    - Not suitable for storing items that have multiple roles or whose roles are not known in advance
    - [[Information Organization 2.0]]
        - [[hyperorganization]]   [[bat problem]]   [[your name syndrome]]
            - [[time series]]   [[extrusion filing]]
        - [[information card]]   [[Tadao Umesao]]   [[Don't classify, array.]]  →  [[search (e.g. for someone using a search engine)]]
    - [[Information Organization 3.0]]
        - [[hyperlink]]
        - [[Connecting by Link]] : Hierarchy is irrelevant
    - You can follow the link.
        - [[network-based organization]]
    - If it is a reference by link, it can be placed on either side.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Also related to [[shortcut]] and [symbolic link
    - Information is relevant.
        - When certain information is used, information that is related to that information is also likely to be used.
            - [[The "put it where you use it" principle]]
- Scrapbox is a
    - Project as a place to put = Information Organization 1.0
    - Pages are arranged flat = Information Organization 2.0
    - Pages are connected to each other by links = Information Organization 3.0

- Knowledge can change structure when added
    - Hesitant because it does not match the hierarchical structure, the hierarchy itself has to be rebuilt, and it is expensive.
    - Cost of Structural Change] due to additional knowledge must be low
        - I also wrote in [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]] p.159 [Disadvantages of creating classification criteria in advance

    - [[Information and Order]] Knowledge and know-how are embodied in people and their networks.

- p.132 Column [[Role of Trees and Networks]].
    - Comparison of the roles of networked Scrapbox and tree-based books
    - Meaning cannot be fixed without an array.
        - [[making finite]] and [[Array Determination]]
        - The second half of the [[KJ method]] process involves converting a two-dimensional array into a one-dimensional array, which is exactly what is done.
