title: "Knowledge not updated"
---

Thinking you have knowledge inhibits the behavior of keeping that knowledge up-to-date
- The advantages of cost savings due to reduced behavior and the disadvantages of mistaking [[old knowledge]] for up-to-date vary in magnitude depending on the rate at which outside knowledge is changing
        - [[Knowledge obsolescence rate]]

- Similar composition to [[Pessimistic Misconceptions]], but "[[Pessimistic]]" corresponds to "[[Think you know]]"
- I prefer to think I don't know.
