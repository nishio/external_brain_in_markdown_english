I'm relieved because it would be the most [[efficiency]] to study it after [[when the time comes]], not to catch up with it, but the timing may be now!

> [golden_lucky](https://twitter.com/golden_lucky/status/1644304534121115648) No, I'm not talking about [[necessary or not]]. I'm talking about weighing the desire to fulfill [[intellectual curiosity]] against the luxury of being able to throw away one's daily life.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1644305614473150467) I'm not sure what you meant in your reply, what did you mean by "impatience" in that case?

> [golden_lucky](https://twitter.com/golden_lucky/status/1644305856463519750) I'd love to know more, but I don't have the time or energy.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1644306663661527040) "[[I don't have time.]]" is "I don't think it's important enough to raise the time." so if you admit that you're not trying to know that much, the frustration will I think it would go away.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1644306932071796736) By the way, I've been thinking about creating my own world with VRChat for a few years, but haven't done anything about it.

I see a lot of people feeling [[a sense of anxiety]] because of the rapid development of AI-related stories, but I think that's just consuming [[MP]] to no avail.
- If you're going to do it, do it, and if you're not going to do it, affirm that decision not to do it, but by doing either, you're causing a futile loss of energy.
    - I came to the conclusion two weeks ago that [[Get rid of critics who don't take positions.]], [You are only responsible for your own actions that you think are optimal.
- You can either "do it" or "don't do it," whichever you want to do, and whichever you choose, you are responsible for the consequences.

- [[obsolescence]]`? The answer is, "Of course, it will become obsolete.`
- So how can [[Knowledge that is less likely to become obsolete]] be learned?
        - [[You can't learn directly from something that is "hard to change."]]
- I want to learn efficiently." is a line often heard from fledgling engineers.
        - [[If the efficiency of information acquisition is high, the efficiency of value creation is low.]]
        - [[Traffic jam after exiting the highway.]]
