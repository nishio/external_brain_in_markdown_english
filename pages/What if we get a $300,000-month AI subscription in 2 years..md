> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1867401299714879497) If an AI subscription of $300,000/month is available in two years, what conditions would justify signing up for it, and if you decide that you should sign up for it, what kind of money burden, and what we need to do now to be able to sign the contract.

Summary of previous discussions:.
Prerequisite:
- The company is considering whether to sign an AI subscriber contract for ¥300,000/month in the future.
- Currently on trial with an AI subscriber for ¥30,000/month, the efficiency gains of about 15 minutes per day are sufficient, and qualitative value (increased creativity and the challenge of new research) is also being felt.
    - Note: "15 minutes" means that "30,000 yen per month" is "3% of annual income," and if you work 8 hours a day, 3% of 8 hours is 14.4 minutes, so it's roughly on the order of that.
- However, it is difficult to directly evaluate a 300,000 yen investment in terms of ROI due to the type of work that is primarily focused on long-term, non-monetary value creation in research and development.
- While the number of projects and advanced research increased as a result of increased efficiency, there were concerns that the management burden would increase due to the increase in parallel projects.
- If a 300,000 yen plan is introduced in the future, it is likely to be for corporate clients and advanced project management functions can be expected.
- At this stage, it would be helpful to test the extent to which AI can provide project management support, measure its effectiveness, and accumulate know-how on its use, in order to clarify future investment decisions.

Important issues:
- Non-monetary value evaluation: The evaluation axis is not based on short-term earnings, but on long-term values such as creativity, innovation, and future competitive advantage.
- Concurrent project management: The key is whether AI can reduce management costs in order to handle an increasing number of tasks/projects efficiently.

Preparation stage ingenuity:
- Test the use of project management support with the current 30,000 yen plan and identify what is missing.
- Develop skills, workflow, tool integration, etc., so that when the plan moves to the 300,000 yen plan, it will be ready for maximum utilization immediately.

Next Action Proposal:.
- Project management experiments in the current environment:
    - We will test the current 30,000 yen plan to see how far we can go with project management features such as task organization, progress tracking, prioritization, and information summarization.
    - Document qualitatively and quantitatively how much automation by AI can reduce human management workload.
- Clarification of evaluation indicators:
    - Organize qualitative evaluation items not in terms of monetary ROI, but in terms of "number of ideas," "speed of issue discovery," "quality improvement of prototypes," and "degree of research scope expansion" obtained after one month, three months, or six months.
    - Measure the management time and stress associated with the number of concurrent projects and see how it changes.
- Workflow optimization and skills training:
    - Redesign the project management flow for AI implementation and prepare clear prompts and procedures.
    - Acquire the necessary skills (data organization, prompt design, tool integration, etc.) to be immediately ready when upgrading to a more expensive plan.
- Future functional needs identification:
    - List "missing functions" or "needs for more advanced analysis and management functions" found in the current trial.
    - This will clarify the functions and effects expected from the 300,000 yen plan and provide guidance when making the transition decision.

Through the above actions, we will be able to determine the justification and expected effects of the transition to the 300,000 yen plan in the future, from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives.
