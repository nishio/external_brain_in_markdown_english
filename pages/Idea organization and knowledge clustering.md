Idea organization and knowledge clustering
Papers in the HCI and information science areas dealing with computer-assisted research on KJ methods (e.g., information clustering, automatic knowledge graph generation) provide useful suggestions for structuring disparate memos and tasks and uncovering relationships.

Computer-aided research of KJ legal tools:
- Although the KJ method is an intuitive analog method, numerous related studies and tools exist, including information clustering, [[Concept Mapping]] ([[Concept Mapping]]), and mind mapping.

Related Research Example:
Idea Management Systems]: Tools are being developed that allow multiple users to submit ideas online and automatically categorize and summarize them.
Topic Modeling] (LDA and BERTopic): NLP methods that automatically extract potential topics from large groups of text are helpful in classifying ambiguous groups of ideas.
Knowledge Graph Construction: A technology that automatically extracts relationships between concepts from text and knowledge bases and represents them in a graph structure that helps organize related tasks as "connected knowledge parts" and present optimal combinations.
