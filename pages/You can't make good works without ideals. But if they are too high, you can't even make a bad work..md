title: "You can't make good works without ideals. But if they are too high, you can't even make a bad work."

> [kazakura_22](https://twitter.com/kazakura_22/status/1663768447770296321) There are a number of ideals, but the reality is this
>  Below are four [[creative realities]] that I didn't want to admit but had to.
>
>  ・Most of the readers allow a great deal of [[unfinished]] work.
>  ・・・(Ibid.) Not caring if you can't fold a big furoshiki.
>  ・ (ibid.) The author's real attitude is that he cares.
>  ・・・・(Ibid.) The fact that impressions are influenced by the authority of the work and that discovery also works.

> [kazakura_22](https://twitter.com/kazakura_22/status/1663768449116700674) I used to be the complete opposite. I used to think that we should be strict about unfinished works, strict about works that can't be folded, separate the author from the work, and have our own opinions without being influenced by the world or authority.

>  I've had to realize that's a minority after seeing all the different sales figures and opinions.

> [kazakura_22](https://twitter.com/kazakura_22/status/1663768450471464961) And seeing the "creative community with a strict ideology" going out of business, well, I understood that it is one thing to be [[proud]] individually and another to demand it of the whole. I came to understand that it is one thing to be "proud" as an individual, and another to demand it as a whole.

    - [[Bad Perfectionism]]

- You can't make a good [[work]] without [[ideal]], but if it's too expensive, you can't even make a bad work. But if it's too expensive, you can't even make a bad piece.
