title: "Why taking risks pays off."
---

- First, humans tend to view losses as greater than reasonable levels.
    - Tendency to be overly fearful of risk
        - [[prospect theory]]
- Then we see the "potential loss" as a loss rather than the actual expected value.
- Many people avoid that option.
- The market raises the price of what most people are trying to get.
- The result is a loss in a form that is difficult to see due to the fact that many people act together out of fear of loss itself.
    - Decreased margins due to price increases and lost opportunities
- People who understand how this works feel that the "risk of not dying instantly from a failure of moderate size" is a gain.
- This "[[Risk is a bargain]]" thinking mitigates the "[[Excessive fear of risk]] tendency" at the beginning.

- [[Losses due to being in the majority]]
