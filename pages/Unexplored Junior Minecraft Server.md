History
- I made it on 2021-09-12 with an eyeroll.
    - We got excited about the idea of having a micro server in the unexplored junior game chat.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>had no experience with the Java version, but decided to use the Java version because he thought it would be more interesting to extend it with plug-ins if he was going to manage a server.
        - I didn't know the difference between plugins and mods and set up a vanilla server, then I was told about PaperMC and made the change.
    - [[Transport-Pipes]]
- 2021-11-11 [[CybozuHackathon2021]]
