title: "The answer is not outside of yourself."
---

There is the idea that "[[the answer]] is outside of you" and there is the idea that "the answer is inside of you."
- In [[SCHOOL EDUCATION]], the emphasis is on problems that are [[CORRECT]], that is, problems for which the answer is outside of one's control, which can lead to the mistake of thinking that the answer is always outside of one's control.
But questions such as "How do I want to live?" and "What do I like?" have answers only within me.
What should I learn?" is also a question influenced by "what do I want to do?"

I changed the title "The answer is inside of me" to "The answer is not outside of me". It's the same thing, but it seems to make a difference in how it is received.
- If someone is looking for something and is told "it's in ~" but can't immediately find it there, they feel that "it's in ~" is a lie.
    - [[The Paradox of Search]]
    - If you know where to find what you're looking for, you don't have to look for it.
    - For problems that essentially require exploration by trial and error, it is no use thinking "where is the solution? The solution is not in this range.
        - Like bifurcated debugging.
- Constraints (information that says "not here") have the effect of narrowing the search area and increasing the efficiency of the search.
