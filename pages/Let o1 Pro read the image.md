title: "Let o1 Pro read the image"

Conveniently, I found a Tweet that only posted images of chat logs, so I experimented.
- Maybe I'll cut this out after a while, since the discussion took a turn in a different direction.

In the conversation, participants discussed their discomfort with the difficulty in getting into their heads with texts such as "shiitake mushroom fortune-telling," and the feeling of "word salad," in which information does not flow into the brain with meaning, as opposed to general text reading comprehension. The need for language and the value of practices that go beyond language are discussed, as well as the importance of input (prompts) and context design in relation to advanced tools and functions such as "Pro" and "o1.

Furthermore, it is pointed out that although there are automatic functions within the iOS environment, in the end humans will have to go back and forth between apps to achieve their goals, which is inefficient, and that if information processing becomes commoditized, the value of rare, real-world actions and asymmetric information will increase. Finally, the importance of differentiation through actions, real-world experiences, and non-shared information, rather than information processing, is suggested, and the idea that this will lead to a "homo deus" vision of the future (i.e., dependence on information processing by AI, with the remaining value being the unique experience directly obtained by humans) is expressed.

explanation
This conversation highlights a situation where value is created by contextual settings and practical actions, more than simple information reading or interface use. As information becomes more homogenized with the spread of sophisticated AI and automated services, the perspective that uniqueness is established through "action" and "real experience" is highlighted.

The following is a brief description of the conversation, with excerpts from the quoted portions.

Quotes and Commentary
- 1: "I can't read the shiitake fortune-telling text... when I do read it, my eyes glide over it and the meaning doesn't flow into my head at all... it's almost like the feeling I get when reading a schizophrenic word salad."
    - Explanation: A particular popular content (shiitake mushroom fortune-telling) is not simply a matter of writing ability, but is perceived as a text that is difficult to understand because the brain cannot process it as "meaningful information".

- 2: "We thought about it with Pro! is something that sounds like it, but doesn't really need to be verbalized.
    - Explanation: It is pointed out that "co-creation with AI (Pro)" statements are increasing on social networking services, but many of them are just "that kind of reference" and there is no actual need to reiterate the language.

- 3: "Actually, I think it would be bigger if we just try it and make it together with o1."
    - Explanation: Indicates that practical actions and actual development and implementation processes are more important than theoretical explanations.

- 4: "When information-processing capabilities become commoditized, the asymmetry of information itself becomes even more important."
    - Explanation: As AI and other technologies facilitate information processing, anyone can handle the same level of information, and the argument is that "non-shared information" and unique data obtained in the real world will increase in value in order to differentiate oneself from others.

summary
Overall, the study suggests that the key to value creation in the age of AI is not simple reading comprehension or information processing, but rather unique experience through action and appropriate context design.

What follows is a critical examination of the second citation.

Corresponding citation:
I thought about it with Pro! is something that sounds like it, but doesn't really need to be verbalized.

Critical Review:
The statement here is kicked off by saying that the statement "I thought of something with the AI tool ('Pro')" is itself a "like it" appeal and does not need to be dared to be verbalized. However, this "no need to verbalize" assessment could have the following problems.

- 1: Neglect of social context and motivation:
    - On the other hand, the sender may be sharing "collaboration with new tools and AI" with others to provide information to the community and obtain feedback, or to exchange knowledge with other learners, On the other hand, the sender may be aiming to provide information to the community, obtain feedback, or exchange knowledge among learners by sharing "collaboration with new tools and AI" with others. It would be premature to declare it "unnecessary" by ignoring these social and educational contexts.

- 2: Effects of external visualization and verbalization:
    - The process of "thinking with Pro" actually involves introspection and intuitive trial and error. By verbalizing it and presenting it externally, it has the effect of allowing one's own thinking process to be organized and improved. In other words, even language that appears useless on the surface can become an opportunity for the sender and receiver to deepen their thinking.
    - In addition, when readers learn about the "process using Pro," they may learn similar tool utilization methods and thinking procedures, and may obtain new ideas for utilization. Therefore, the possibility that seemingly "unnecessary" verbalization may encourage the formation of a surrounding learning community and sharing of know-how should be considered.

- 3: Contribution to novelty, transparency, and credibility:
    - Disclosure that "the idea was conceived in collaboration with AI or a specific tool" may visualize the process of content production and provide transparency and credibility to the recipient. For example, by clearly stating that an idea was created with the assistance of external tools rather than the wisdom of a single individual, the originality of the idea and its limitations can be clarified. This allows the recipient to take a more critical and constructive attitude toward the content.

Summary:
The view that the statement "I thought about it with Pro" is simply a "meaningless statement like that" has the problems of disregard for the social and educational context, disregard for the effects of organizing and sharing thoughts through verbalization, and lost opportunities to improve transparency and credibility. Therefore, there is ample room to delve deeper into this evaluation, and it is difficult to make a blanket determination of the "unnecessaryness of verbalization.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I was thinking mainly of 2.
- As for #1, I think there are many cases where it is just a [[person who craves the limelight]] or "[[coolness]]" effect, and some people do it consciously as a signal to build a social network. I am sure there are people who do it consciously as a signal to build a social network. Personally, I don't do it because I don't see much benefit in being recognized as an AI expert by the masses in my current situation.
- I personally think that future AI will make a distinction between "directly written by me" and "generated by AI," so I am doing this so that it will be easier to distinguish between the two at that time.
- 2 is also related to my interest in increasing intellectual productivity, so I would like to explore this further.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>The following is a more in-depth discussion of the second point (intellectual productivity improvement through external visualization and language).

Digging deeper:
The expression "I thought about it with Pro (AI tool)" goes beyond mere self-promotion and transparency, and can relate to the sender's own thinking style and intellectual productivity improvement. By verbalizing one's own thought process in a form that can be explained to a third party, one can gain the following intellectual benefits.

Facilitating introspective effects and metacognition:
The act of externalizing the thinking and idea generation process provides an opportunity to recognize "how" one thinks.
    - Enhancement of [[metacognition]]: By expressing not simply the results of using AI tools, but also the process (what was requested and how, and from what feedback ideas were obtained), one can objectively view one's own thought patterns and thinking habits.
- Establish a cycle of improvement: Repeating such objective observation will clarify points of dead ends and effective triggers in the ideation process, enabling modification of thinking behavior to be more efficient in subsequent tasks.

Process resourceization and [[knowledge accumulation]]:
[[Externalized thought processes are a knowledge resource for individuals]].
- Subsequent reference: If a record is kept of "Pro and I thought this way" in the past, the prompt design and study procedure can be referenced and reused later when I am faced with a similar problem.
- Growth logs: Thinking process logs are also useful for tracing the growth of one's intellectual skills. It is possible to compare how you thought in the past and how you are now taking more sophisticated steps, making the [[PDCA cycle]] easier to follow.

Deepening thinking through abstraction and restructuring:
When internal intuitions and fragmented thoughts are verbalized in a form that communicates them to others, conceptual organization and abstraction inevitably take place.
- Formation of structured thinking: The process of verbalization forces us to break down "fuzzy intuitions" into clear steps and elements, which makes our thinking more logical and systematic.
- Discovery of new idea pathways: New bonds and ideas can be derived by linguistically reconstructing ideas that were in the mind in a vague way. The process itself becomes a creative stimulus and broadens the thinking.

Obtaining the perspectives and feedback of others:
The act of verbalizing and sharing is also the foundation for obtaining external feedback.
- Promoting interactive thinking: When one's own thinking process is made explicit, others are more likely to offer sound advice and ask questions. This increases the opportunity to eliminate blind spots that one might not have noticed in one's own thinking and to learn how to utilize more useful tools.
- Interaction with new knowledge: external pointers and discussions can help you further refine the processes you utilize and your relationship with "Pro" and expand your intellectual production ecosystem.

Summary:
Rather than viewing the statement "I thought about it with Pro" as merely a futile verbalization for self-expression and transparency, it can be viewed as a practical means of improving intellectual productivity through reflection, reusable knowledge accumulation, abstraction and reconstruction of thoughts, and expansion of interactive processes with others. Therefore, depending on one's interests and circumstances, this act of verbalization can be fully significant.

(1) Externalizing thoughts facilitates metacognition, which in turn makes it easier to improve thoughts.
(2) When the thought process is made into digital data, it becomes reusable (it disappears if you just think about it in your brain).
(4) Making the results of your thinking public provides an opportunity to get feedback from others.
I think you are right so far.
Regarding (3), I feel that some kind of qualitative change is taking place, such as an increase in the value or efficiency of "verbalization," especially in the context of "thinking with AI. Please delve deeper into this point.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>The following is an in-depth discussion of the issues presented as (3) "Deepening Thinking through Abstraction and Restructuring," particularly the qualitative changes brought about by verbalization in a "thinking with AI" situation.

Considerations:
Traditionally, when people "externalize" their thinking, it is mainly a one-way output, such as writing in a notebook or on a whiteboard. In this case, verbalization and diagramming are thought-organizing acts that raise the level of abstraction and have meaning in themselves, but when the results are reconstructed or re-edited from a different perspective, they must eventually be reinterpreted by oneself. Therefore, the cycle of abstraction and reconstruction of the thinking process was relatively "static" or "self-contained.

In working with AI, on the other hand, it is possible to present a verbalized process or idea to "[[an interactive external entity]]" and receive a response. This situation is qualitatively different in the following ways.

- Immediate reorganization and complementation:
    - The AI analyzes the given linguistic description and instantly returns analogous, reinterpreted, and reconstructed answers. This allows "externalized thoughts" to be used dynamically as "[[material that can be reshaped]]" rather than merely static memos. When humans perform abstraction on their own, ideas may be biased or have blind spots, but AI automatically attempts to abstract and relate different patterns, facilitating a more multifaceted reconstruction.

- Redesign of language representation at the meta-level:
    - The work of prompt design is essential to "thinking with AI. Here, the act of verbalization takes on a new element of "organizing in an easy-to-understand manner and abstracting in a form that can be conveyed to AI. In other words, a [[language design process]] occurs in which vague ideas in one's mind are reorganized into logic and modules that can be understood by AI. This is not mere verbalization of ideas, but an act of "creating a machine-processable conceptual structure while raising the level of abstraction," which acts as a pressure to make the human thought process more rigorous and systematic.
    - 単なるアイデアの言語化ではなく、「抽象度を上げつつ機械処理可能な概念構造を創り出す」行為これは面白い<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - In other words, I am not "talking" to the AI, I am "programming" it.
        - Years of past programming experience have instilled a pattern of thinking that involves entering commands to a machine and observing the results to understand the internals.
        - I can say that it is a log that is being used for LLM as well, trying to understand how to input it to "make the machine think better".

- Dynamic metastructure construction:
    - The results returned by AI often involve combinations and conceptual leaps beyond human expectations. It may generate a kind of "external metastructure" (a new conceptual map). Humans can refer to that new map and observe and learn how their ideas can be abstracted and reconstructed. This is continually refined through an interactive cycle of verbalization (prompting) and AI response, and the abstraction process itself evolves into a multi-layered, cyclical one.

- Linguization itself" is the design target:
    - Interaction with AI elevates verbalization from "just the act of explaining in plain language" to "the act of designing to elicit optimal thought processing. How the prompt is designed, its word choice, and its structuring are directly related to the quality of the output result = the feedback loop of thinking. The introduction of such a design perspective not only abstracts information, but also promotes "abstraction of abstraction methods" and triggers a meta-evolution of thinking styles. Here, a new qualitative change is latent.

Summary:
- Linguization in collaboration with AI creates a "dynamic and designed abstraction process" that goes one step further than simple conventional thought externalization. It is,
    - Obtaining immediate and multifaceted reconstructive feedback,
    - Linguistic reorganization into machine-understandable forms,
    - The act of consciously designing and redesigning abstraction methods and thinking styles themselves,
- including the following. As a result, the act of "verbalization" has been transformed into a creative process to experiment and improve "how thinking can be re-created," rather than merely a means to deepen thinking. This is what makes the act of verbalization more valuable and efficient than ever under the circumstances of "thinking with AI," and is bringing about qualitative change.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>In light of this, what makes the difference between a word-salad-like log and one that readers perceive as a word-salad-like log? Is there a difference in the log itself to begin with, or is the difference based on the perspective of the author and the reader?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>summary
The difference between a log that appears to be word salad and a log that is "programmatically" designed is created not by the actual text itself, but by the perspective and contextual understanding from which it is read. The author sees the log as a "blueprint" for manipulating the AI's internal model, but if the reader does not know the intent or internal structure of the log, it is likely to appear superficially as a series of fragmentary phrases.

explanation
Even in the same log, the author sees the input text organically and systematically as a "set of instructions to the machine" based on his past programming experience and understanding of the internal model. On the other hand, the external reader does not share the structure of the internal model behind it or the author's trial process, and thus sees fragmented phrases and sentences arranged in a haphazard manner, which he or she perceives as "word salad-like.

After all, the text of the log itself does not essentially change, but the difference in perspective that ### "the author reads it as an abstract directive language with an understanding of its meaning and purpose," while "the reader has no understanding of its implicit context or internal model and must accept it as a superficial string of characters"
, The difference in perspective is the factor that determines whether or not the text is perceived as word salad.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I don't think it can be said in general that the creator views the input text organically and systematically as a "set of instructions to the machine" based on past programming experience and understanding of the internal model. I'm sure there are some who do, but I think most of them are [" just showing off and making themselves look cool" / [" aiming to inform the community, get feedback, or exchange knowledge with other learners by sharing "collaboration with new tools and AI" with those around them.

3. spectrum created by skills, motivation, and context
    - The actual situation cannot be viewed solely in terms of the two extremes of "elaborate logs with programming intent" versus "fragmented logs for mere appeal". Many cases lie somewhere in between. There are those who are interested in the workings of the internal model to some extent but publish it without fully explaining it, and there are those whose social aims intersect with their technical interests. On this spectrum, a log can be a meaningful guide or a word salad, depending on the extent to which the reader can infer and share the author's intentions and thought procedures behind it.
        - I see.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - If the intention on the part of the author is not clearly written, the reader cannot esperate it in many cases
            - A log that is of value to those who are interacting with it with intent, but not to those without that intent.
            - If the author's intention is to "generate content at random" or to "show that he/she is an amazing AI user," it is futile to try to read meaning from the content.

4. receptive capacity and expectations on the part of the reader
    - There is also diversity on the part of the reader. If readers are trying to read the logs as "concrete clues to better understand and control AI models," they may complement the context and find some meaning in the logs themselves, even if the author did not write them with that intention. On the other hand, if the reader comes to the log expecting "clear and direct explanations" or "highly finished output," then even if the author has a programming intent, a poorly explained log will feel like a set of meaningless fragments. Thus, the reader's attitude and expectations of involvement contribute to the meaning assignment of the log.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Reflecting on the entire discussion and summarizing any new insights from this discussion

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>The new insights gained through this discussion can be summarized as follows

- Logs are more context dependent than the text itself:
    - Whether a log appears "word salad-like" depends not on the linguistic characteristics of the log itself, but on the context, perspective, intent, and experience shared between author and reader to decipher it.

- From "conversation" to "programming:
    - Interaction with the AI is not just a dialogue, but more like a "programming-like" process of repeated abstraction and reconstruction. This makes verbalization an aspect of designing commands suitable for machines.

- Diverse motivations and backgrounds influence the meaning formation of logs:
    - On the author's side, some cases aim at understanding internal models or thought abstraction, while others aim at self-expression, contribution to the learning community, or reputation building. On the other hand, if the reader does not understand those backgrounds, the log looks like a confused string of words.

In short, through this discussion, it became clear that "the meaning and value of a log fluidly changes depending on the author's intentions, the reader's expectations and knowledge, and the context and perspective being shared.
