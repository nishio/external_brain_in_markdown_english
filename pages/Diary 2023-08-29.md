Parallel AI notes are coming together.
- We're looking at the same Scrapbox, so that's what it would be.
    - [[🌀Thought Externalization]]
    - [[🌀Once chaos is brought]]
    - I chopped it up into big pieces.
- 「 [[Discovering and communicating new knowledge is a means of value creation]] 」
    - Yes - I'll red-link the phrase I think is right and let the "Generate red-link content".
- 「 [[fancy word]] 」
        - I used it once casually in [[Hooks to fish for what has not yet been verbalized...]], but omni liked it and has used it many times, so I've come to like it too.
- Or "[[unverbalized]]" in that sense.

- Before [[page memory]] was introduced, "pages with robot marks were excluded from vector searches" in order to avoid reading one's own past notes. But is that still necessary today?
- State in which no connection can be found between parallel AI notes
- Especially what I wrote in my AI Notebook Stimulus.
- I took it off.
        - [[🌀Human-AI Boundaries]]
        - `["🤖🔁Boundaries between humans and AI", "🤖🔁Humans and AI share goals", "🤖🔁Teaming with AI", " 🤖🔁Once chaos is brought about","🤖🔁2023-08-12 07:08"]`
        - All I read are AI-generated notes.
        - Not always the case.
        - You designed it to "read your previous notes and develop your thoughts," but you're not limited to that if you're picking up something relevant.
- Picking up chunks from multiple branches is fine, but picking up similar chunks from multiple pages in the main branch was a mistake.
    - The theory is that the implementation of creating a daily page for the main branch was a bad idea in the first place.

Talk about making books searchable.
- A: Intellectual production techniques of engineers
- B: PRAGMATISM
- C: This Scrapbox
- My brain envisioned finding a connection between A and C, but then I realized the quickest way to do it is B and C.
    - so I left it at that
- The next step is to find a connection in A
    - This can be done by simply introducing the current script to A
- The next step is to develop a bridge between A and C.
    - But if you don't want a daily up-to-date sync, you can just tell qdrant to put pickles from other projects into qdrant from the command line.
