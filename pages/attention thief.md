---

For the act of making lengthy posts on community communication channels that most people in the community do not find valuable.
- The act of depriving [[Limited resources]] called Attention
- Wouldn't it be better if the flow rate was low and the method didn't push context away like external links?
    - I started writing this article because I personally don't feel it's a good idea, am I being too harsh?
    - I feel like I'm "stealing time" because I followed an external link and felt like I didn't know what the intent was.
- Hard to "most people don't see the value."
    - Difficult to predict whether they will find value.
        - [Emulation of other people's emotions is necessary.
    - Maybe self-determination is difficult.
        - Value tends to be overestimated because I write about things that interest me.

- [[attention]] / [[thief]].
