- Interviews were conducted with staff members of the Digital Reform Promotion Division (Digica) and the Regional Development Division regarding how [[Nagoya City Hall]] introduced [[kintone]] and how it has been used since then.
- The purpose of implementing kintone was to improve operational efficiency and promote the digitalization of the entire city hall.
- In the early stages of implementation, we struggled with the use of sample applications, but eventually we were able to develop an application more suited to our business by rebuilding it from scratch ourselves.
- The Regional Development Division created three applications for support group management, case management, and activity history management to improve operational efficiency.
- With the introduction of kintone, centralized data management and information sharing became easier, reducing the workload.
- It also addresses security issues such as limiting the use of plug-ins and handling of personal information.
- After the introduction of kintone, staff resistance to digital tools has decreased and their awareness of business improvement has increased.
- Future challenges include collaboration with ward offices and expanding the use of kintone in more departments.
- The introduction of kintone in local governments has great potential for business reform and efficiency improvement, and is a case study that can be used as a reference for other local governments.
- Finally, for other municipal officials who are considering implementing kintone, he mentioned the importance of starting small and the possibility of improving operations through digitization.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>Yes, there were some interesting episodes:
- After introducing kintone, Mr. Murakami of the Regional Development Division confidently said, "I created it! I made it myself!" After introducing kintone, Mr. Murakami of the Community Development Department confidently said, "I made it myself! This is a good example of a non-engineer staff member becoming proficient in the use of IT tools.
- With regard to the use of the Toyohashi Plug-in, it had become so popular that it was difficult to get reservations and was only available once every two weeks. This is an unexpected "happy scream".
- It was interesting to hear Mr. Ito, who created a warehouse equipment management application, talk about how he was able to use his cell phone to manage inventory when he was not at work himself, but in the underground warehouse.
- There were occasions when staff members were frank in expressing their opinions about the difficulty of using the mobile version of kintone. In particular, they pointed out the problem of tables being displayed too long vertically.
- It was also interesting to hear about the difficulties encountered during the learning process, such as episodes during the training when people wondered why they couldn't look up this number, or experiences of getting "lost" in the manuals.

These episodes are stories that many organizations can relate to, such as trial and error when introducing new tools, unexpected challenges, and success stories.
