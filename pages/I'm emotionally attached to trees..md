title: "I'm emotionally attached to trees."
---

derived from  [[Tree metaphor]]
- I'm [[empathy]] with the tree.
    - I thought I had "low [[empathy]]," but actually have high empathy for non-homo sapiens?
    - Would you rather "have some empathy for non-homo sapiens"?
    - [[weak in comparison]]" because "the vast majority of Homo sapiens have strong empathy for their homologue, Homo sapiens"?

- "Thinking from the computer's point of view" is [[the ability to empathize with the computer]].
    - I wonder if the type of people who say "empathy for Homo sapiens" is short for "empathy for non-homo sapiens" are simply unaware of its existence because they have low "empathy for non-homo sapiens.
