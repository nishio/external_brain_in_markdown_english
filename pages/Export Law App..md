title: "Export Law App."

    - I want to make an app for [Writing Method
    - [[Scrapbox Export Tool]]
- If I make a Facebook app style export application, I can remove the icons, names, likes, etc. since I'm the only one writing. Should the time be out or not? Is it better without?

- The problem with the Facebook export method is that it's not easy to see what you exported yesterday.
    - It would be nice to be able to switch easily by swiping left/right or something.

- Drooling is fine while traveling on the train, but drooling on Facebook until you get to the office is a problem that doesn't feel right.
- I really should have worked on separating what is a task and what is a project after hanging it up here.
