title: "Stages of Approval"
---

- I thought there were several steps to [[desire for approval]].

- 1: I want to be approved by my geographically localized surroundings.
    - Primitive [[village society]], etc.
- 2: I want to be approved by everyone on the Internet
    - No longer geographically localized.
    - However, since it is transmitted in Japanese, it is [[linguistically localized]].
- 3: I want to be approved by everyone in the world.
    - However, it is [[temporally localized]] because it is not prepared for continued existence after death.
- 4: I want to be approved by everyone, including the future.
    - It gets to this point where it becomes something like "[[immortality]]."

I'm beginning to think it's a desire for immortality after all.
- I also want you to visit [[the grave]] every year [[for posthumous approval]].
