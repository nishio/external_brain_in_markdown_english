> The title of this book, "Revolution of the 1%," expresses my own personal desire for reform, that "the 1% of people who take on new challenges" will change the world. Throughout history, the innovative ideas and actions of the first 1% have brought about major changes in the lives and work of the other 99%.
>  My definition of "1%" refers to the challenge to the future by a small group of people, born from bottom-up ideas and creativity. Another implication is the technical concept of leveraging small technical innovations by 1% to create big changes.
