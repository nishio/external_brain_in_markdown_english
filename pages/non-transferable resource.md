non-transferable resource
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1657585374053695488) [[non-transferable resource]] is not marketable and therefore cannot be priced through market mechanisms. Some people misinterpret this as "worthless". However, when it is needed, it cannot be procured in the market and cannot be obtained no matter how much money is available. If we dare to express it in terms of monetary value, it becomes "when needed ∞. And you never know in advance what you will need.

Therefore, the act of destroying non-transferable resources is harmful to society. It is better to make it a crime like [[destruction of property]] or to make it an [[economic disadvantage]] through other mechanisms.

If we disregard distribution costs, information is A, money is B. If we take distribution costs into account, we get closer to C. Enthusiasm is a [[non-transferable resource]], a kind of C, because it decreases to almost zero when taken away from someone and given to someone else.

- [[Cash is weak capital]] came from the fact that the cost of knowledge transfer is very high and not something that is readily available in gold just because you need it.
- There has never been a name for this "difficult to buy with money," so I gave it the name "non-transferable resources."
    - Not only [[knowledge]], but also [[enthusiasm]] and [[SoulBound Token]] are non-transferable resources.
- SoulBound Token is easy to understand. The value is created by restricting the [[Non-Fungible Token]], which was originally technically transferable, to be non-transferable.
    - The Non-Fungible Token itself is a restriction on digital information that can be technically copied, but not copied.
