title: "Collecting the mess and telling the story"

> [@daijapan](https://twitter.com/daijapan/status/1655682943875174401?s=46&t=gkSZtjGEtUZPO0JCzBxCBw): i too am entering midlife. I feel that the solution to the so-called [[mid-life crisis]] depends on the reconstruction of the "[[who I am]]" narrative. I believe that [[it is the time of the young to be angry at messes]] and [[it is the time of the middle-aged to collect messes and tell stories]]. I look forward to seeing what the landscape will look like further down the road.

Personally, I don't think I resented [[the mess]] even as a young man, but...
- It's hard to argue with someone who says, "That's because I was blessed with a mess."
    - [[I'm lucky]]
- I'm not sure myself when the thought "[[I don't care what I can't control.]]" took hold of me.
    - I think I understood it in a clearly verbalized way because I heard [[Tasuku Ukai]] say

I sympathize with "collecting messes [[stories]]."
    - [[About Self-Introduction]]
    - I believe that's how self-introductions are supposed to be formed.
    - When you pull the gacha, sometimes you get an unusual shape.
    - Put them together to make a [[story]].
        - I have a favorite scene.
        - Sometimes the people who see it are amused.
    - The mess itself is just a small piece of plastic with some paint on it, not worth much.
            - [[I don't feel the medal is worth it.]]
    - Ah, so "what comes out of the gacha" is something you can't control, and "what kind of scene you create with the gacha you have" is something you can control.
