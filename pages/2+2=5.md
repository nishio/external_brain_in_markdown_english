> Known by [[George Orwell's]] dystopian novel "[[1984]]" (Part 1, Chapter 7). 2+2=5" is in contrast to the mathematically correct "2+2=4.
>  The protagonist Winston Smith wonders, "After all, when the party says 2+2=5, we must believe it. George Orwell has Winston say, "So-called liberty is freedom to say that 2+2=4. George Orwell had Winston say, "The so-called liberty is the liberty to say 2+2=4. To grant this is to grant the other freedoms as well."
[2 + 2 = 5 - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_%2B_2_%3D_5)

The "2+2=5 is incorrect" is also a kind of assumption, and in the case of [[supermodular goods]], $2 + 2 > 4$ is valid, which means that the mechanism designed based on the assumption of "2+2=4" is malfunctioning. This is why the mechanism designed based on the assumption that "2 + 2 = 4" malfunctions.
