title: "Belittlement is hubris"
---

> [[Buddhism]] has an important word, "[[servility]]". [Self-abasement" means to be contemptuous. Pride is "[[pride]]" in "[[boast]]" and "[[hubris]]" in "[[pride]]". In Buddhism, to be depressed or to think that one is not good enough is hubris.
[https://www.higashihonganji.or.jp/sermon/radio/detail08_02.html](https://www.higashihonganji.or.jp/sermon/radio/detail08_02.html) Futoshi Takehashi (Deputy Priest of Hoenji Temple, Hokkaido Diocese)

When one says "I am no good" [[self-abasement]], one's "self" is divided into "person A," who is the object of being called "no good," and "person B," who evaluates others as no good according to his/her own standards, and B's behavior is hubris.
Because "evaluating that it is no good" implicitly assumes "my rightness" that I am capable of evaluating others.

> Once upon a time, I made a disparaging remark about myself and a member who was less experienced than me got angry and said, "It makes me sad that we are less than you. It was just a comparison with someone stronger in my mind, but I thought it was better not to say too much.

- If you just think "I'm no good" in your mind, it doesn't affect other people, so it's less of a problem.
- An unfortunate pattern of "hurt others with presumptuous statements."

If the added person feels anger, it shows that the original "I'm not a big deal" was not the real intention. Let's add the angry person to another list.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1393001615175548932): I'm going to hang this over here as well, since some people may not get the premise from just this tweet. [[Belittlement is hubris]].
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1393003778823970817): Even though in Buddhism condescension is hubris, there is no problem if you only think it in your mind, because it does not affect other people. However, "thinking in one's mind" and "posting on social networking sites" are two different things, just as, for example, wearing no mask at home is different from wearing no mask in a park used by an unspecified number of people.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1393006848211488768): In a situation like "Mr. A, a senior whom I admire, is more amazing than me, and I'm not a big deal", cutting "Mr. A is more amazing than me" to "I'm not a big deal" is [[overgeneralization]] focusing on the negative aspect. It is [[overgeneralization]] that focuses on the negative aspect. In the same situation, a positive tweet might say, "My senpai is great, I have to learn from him! I have to learn from them." Some people tweet in a positive way.
