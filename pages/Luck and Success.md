title: "Luck and Success"
---

- Often, when we ask people who have [[succeeded]] in something why they succeeded, the answer is "[[fortune]].
- In the case of the other answers, even if you do exactly what they say, you will not always succeed, i.e., it is luck.

- I can only appreciate the value of trying something that may or may not work and actually works, [[after the fact]].

    - [[Increase the number of challenges]]
