XREAL Detox
A day off [[XREAL One]] because I had to go to a meeting.
- At first I thought "the screen is too small", but it's not too hard to work all day.
- After all, the wider screen will probably make you pack more tasks than your cognitive capacity!
- This is something I'm not good at using yet, and my cognitive abilities may improve while I'm doing it, so it may be important to use it well while doing the XREAL detox, removing it when it's hard.
