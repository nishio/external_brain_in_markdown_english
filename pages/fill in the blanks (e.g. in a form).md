Q: (Regarding submitting a 15-minute video) Some people said that the previous video was "too long and boring", can we have a 10-minute video?
A:
- I think "too long, I'm bored" is not "too long, shorten it" but "too little information density for a video of this length."
- If there's too little in it and it's 10 minutes if recorded normally, you can stretch it out with meaningless information and make it 15 minutes and no one will be happy, so just put it out at 10 minutes.
- But in that case, I think you should understand that "too little content and it was 10 minutes" is not a good state of affairs to begin with.
- It's like, "I'm on deadline, and I don't have a solution to that bad situation, so I have no choice but to submit it in 10 minutes."

The dualistic view that filling the frame is good or bad is a fallacy; what is important is the quality of the content and its proper selection. In the production process, it is natural for the content to be larger than the frame when it is first constructed. However, if, on the other hand, the content is smaller than the frame from the beginning, problems have already occurred at that point, and subsequent actions to fill the frame are likely to further degrade the quality.

Therefore, when creating content, the key to producing quality results is to first freely expand the content and then carefully select and keep only the important parts.

- So when I write a book, I have to waste a lot of time on word counts and storytelling, which is tedious.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/sta/icon' alt='/villagepump/sta.icon' height="19.5"/>

[[making up words]] is also frame-filling thinking.
- In actual writing, I'm crying out for what I've written.
- Well, it might depend on the author and editorial policy.
