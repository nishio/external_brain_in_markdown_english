title: "The opinion that it is expensive is not worth it."
---

Whether a product is considered expensive or inexpensive is subjectively influenced by an individual's perceived value and [[money sense]] for that product.
Except for "a product that suddenly achieves 100% market penetration after its release" (there is no such a thing), there are always people who think the price is high compared to the value, so the information content of "some people think the price is high" is zero.
The "[[value]]" felt by those who have not tried it is only a vague guess based on hearsay information. I feel that the price is high compared to the "value" of the product.
