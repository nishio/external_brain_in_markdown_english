title: "Should Scrapbox have a comment feature?"
---

- In considering [Comment Function
- A: An unspecified number of people can comment.
- B: Only certain people can comment
is something else

Regarding the latter, there's a growing momentum to "just make it a co-edit."

The resistance to co-editing may be a metaphor for the blog that has seeped in over the years.

Something I wrote a long time ago.
    - [[Proposal to add comment function to Scrapbox]]
    - When I wrote this I knew we needed a comment feature.
    - [[trackback]] is all I need?
    - does not look good
- As for the former, I figured I could just ego search Twitter with the Scrapbox URL.
