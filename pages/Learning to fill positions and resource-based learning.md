title: "Learning to fill positions and resource-based learning"

There is [[position-filling learning]] and [[resource-based learning]].

- Learning to fill [[position]] is [[positioning]].
The outside environment determines what you learn.
It was once said to me, "Since you are Japanese, why don't you learn Shinto and combine it with your existing philosophy?
Due to my current position as a Japanese speaker, I have a strategic advantage in learning something that is uniquely Japanese and transmitting it to the world. In other words, the [[procurement cost]] is lower than if someone from another country in the world were to do it, which creates a [[competitive edge]].
I understood this logic in my head, but didn't do it because it didn't sound fun.

Resource-based learning determines what you learn by the resources you have at the moment. For those who have little, the resource is "what [[interest (in something)]] feels good about. [[Interest is a factor that accelerates learning.]] [[Intrinsic motivation]] determines what you learn. [[Learn what you want to learn.]]
I have chosen to live this way.

What was learned on the basis of interest was later connected to the Japanese context through the work of Nishida Kitaro, Nonaka Ikujiro, and Sen no Rikyu's "Shori-ba-ri".
