title: "A metaphor for budding"
---

- Metaphor for [sprout
- You can't make it sprout, it sprouts naturally.
    - If you have water.
- After the budding
    - Let nature take its course
    - Fertilize or put in a greenhouse to grow better.

Is it a type of farming where VCs pour financial resources into a budding business to make it grow?
