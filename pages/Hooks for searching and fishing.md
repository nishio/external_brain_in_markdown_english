The metaphor of "[[Hooks for fishing]]" was used with the idea that "[[artificially, deliberately]] raise prices" means "verbalizing" experiences that are not verbalized by the individual, but a large amount of information that cannot be contained by the individual is in search engines. However, I now realize that the search (e.g., for someone using a search engine) is also "[[(artificially, deliberately) raise prices]]" because there is a large amount of information in search engines that cannot be contained within an individual, and it is necessary to search using appropriate keywords in order to extract the appropriate information. prices]".
