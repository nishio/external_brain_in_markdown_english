[The Identity of the Discomfort I Felt in Communicating with Young People｜Yota Nakamura (Writer & Consultant) |note](https://note.com/yota_nakamura/n/n9cb1d8b2068d)
The consultant implicitly wants to "clarify through a series of light, chat-like exchanges rather than clarifying the consultation in advance."
- The author of this article wants "clarification in advance."
- There's a discrepancy when "small start here for clarification" is received by "those who want clarification in advance."
    - This is a [[protocol]] mismatch
    - I think it's a discrepancy between thinking that "[[clarification]] is a responsibility that the inquirer should take on alone in advance" and thinking that "the consultation process is to collaborate on the clarification."
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Personally, I thought, "Indeed, there is nothing wrong with using the word [[consultation]] to refer to the latter.
            - [[Questions encourage verbalization.]]
    - It is a strange state of mind to think that when a protocol mismatch occurs, it is the other party's fault.
        - The phenomenon itself is symmetrical: [[Communication is symmetrical]].
        - From the use of words like "the young are," it seems to implicitly bring in asymmetrical [[bias]] like "I am the older and more righteous one."
        - Strict in transmission, tolerant in reception.
