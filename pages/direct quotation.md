> In the Kofun period in Japan, there is a unique pattern called "straight arc pattern". For some reason, there are no examples of this pattern in other countries, and there have been no traditions of this pattern in Japan since the late 6th century. This pattern was applied to stone shovels and sarcophagi of decorative tombs, and consists of a nearly square frame with two diagonals and a strip of tape intertwined with the frame.
