title: '0 to 1 capability" and "team-building capability."'
---

Unresolved but interesting subject.

> I have a feeling that "0 to 1" and "[[team building]] ability" are "different" and "independent" or "negatively correlated," but in several meetings over the past few weeks, conversations have implicitly assumed that they are correlated, and I've wondered, "Is there a positive correlation between the two in the world? Is the world aware that there is a positive correlation between the two?" I'm confused.
