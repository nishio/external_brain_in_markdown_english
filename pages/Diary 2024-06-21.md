- It's a relief to know that the social system is functioning properly.
- From a cynical point of view, it is possible that they had the intention from the beginning to put up radical posters and gain attention by putting them up, making the news, getting angry, and taking them down, because they thought it would be a win-win situation.
- I think that kind of flame war is a long-term loss.

> [kensuu](https://x.com/kensuu/status/1803931841944224229) I thought it was very decent, but I guess most people don't read these things properly and vote based on some kind of name recognition or image. I think it's a good idea,
>  The more the proper people continue to get the proper votes, the better the society will be, so I have recently been thinking that it would be better to let people know that "Oh, this is the way to get more votes" by voting one vote anyway, rather than thinking "It's useless because I won't win anyway.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1803931841944224229) "The more the proper people continue to get the proper votes, the better the society will be, so instead of thinking, "It's useless because I won't win anyway," it's better to cast a vote anyway and recognize, "Oh, this is the way to get votes.

It sounds as if it was written by a brilliant consultant, but the picture on page 74 that suddenly appears is lovely. It's good to see that you (or your small team) are really making this, after all.

> [mousu212](https://x.com/mousu212/status/1803857928417427691) I found the hand drawn diagram on page 74 easy to read. The other diagrams are somewhat bare of opinions.

It would be nice to have an alternative route to higher education led by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.
I drew it.
