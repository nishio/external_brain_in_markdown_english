- After the study session on [[Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning]], I think it would be good to do [[knowledge creation company]] by Ikujiro Nonaka.
The famous [[SECI Model]] is a cycle in which unspoken tacit knowledge becomes formal knowledge and then becomes tacit knowledge again.
We are talking about the same process by which "felt meaning" becomes a symbol or returns to felt meaning again in the experience process and the creation of meaning.

It focuses on the "individual," although the experience process and the creation of meaning is by far the more detailed description of the interaction of symbols and meaning.
Conversely, knowledge-creating companies have an "individual and organizational" axis, not just an "individual" axis.
Although it is abstract to call it an "organization," in the [[Cybozu]] context, it is "a process of [[knowledge creation]] in [[interaction]] between individuals and [[groupware]] (e.g., [[A Place for Communication]]).

When Ikujiro Nonaka wrote that, there was still little knowledge about groupware, and it was perceived as a passive, information-storing tool. The emphasis is on [[asynchronous communication]].
On the other hand, synchronous communication such as chat, [[video conference]], and notification mechanisms have developed considerably, and they are also different from "offline, verbal synchronous communication" ([[voice conversation]]) in that they are logged and recorded. and "offline, verbal, synchronous communication" ([[voice conversation]]) in the form of logs and recordings.
This area seems to be connected to the previous indication that there is something to be discovered around [[Flow and Stock]].
