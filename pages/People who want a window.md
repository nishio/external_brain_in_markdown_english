title: "People who want a window"
---

Interesting to observe several cases of people wanting [[window]].

It seems to me that creating a window will not solve the problem, in fact, it will make it worse.
What is the disconnect between those who want a window and those who don't?

AI's interpretation of the discussion.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3/icon' alt='o3.icon' height="19.5"/>The Core of the Discrepancy
- Model Differences
    - The user side assumes a hierarchical organization where "service = black box".
    - The DevOps side assumes a flat loop of "people who make = people who fix".
- Psychological safety vs. cognitive optimization
    - Users are safe to "not get angry or annoyed".
    - Developers are safe from "information dispersion".
- Visibility of "responsibility
    - Contact person = symbolic reassurance that "there is a department in charge".
    - The DevOps side believes that a "bulletin board that anyone can pick up" is the quickest way to get the job done.

- With a development channel in Slack, the "why don't you just write in the development channel" talk took place, so here we are.
    - Still not enough abstraction.
