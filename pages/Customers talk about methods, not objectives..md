title: "Customers talk about methods, not objectives."
---

- Say "what X" the customer wants you to do.
- But if you look closely, it is [[method]], not [Objective.
- Customers are not [[verbalizing]] their objectives properly.
- What makes you happy about doing X?"
- What problem do you want to solve by doing X?"
- We need to get this out of them.
- Do not proceed with development while the method has become an objective.
