title: "There's no point in doing that."

Mr. A. "There's no point in doing that."
Mr. B.: "You mean don't do things that don't make sense?"
Mr. A. "Yes, of course."
Mr. B: "What's the point of you making judgments about other people's actions if they make sense to you?"
Mr. A. "What?"
Mr. B: "Also, just for your information, what is the meaning of your life?"
