- French scholar Jacques Attali, author of the Dictionary of the 21st Century, chose "[[nomad]]" and "[[virtuality]]" as the two pillars leading the future society.
    - [[nomadism]]" and "[[virtuality]]."
- Atali, who has studied the concept of nomadism for many years, argues that human history should not be viewed from the perspective of the settlers, but from that of the nomads.
- Today, 4% of the total population of the planet (about 250 million people) live outside their homeland
    - This is about three times more than 40 years ago.
- The further into the future we move, the more the world is guided by nomadic values.
- Even if they do not have to travel, or do not have the time to travel, people are experiencing nomadic lifestyles through the virtual world. Moreover, more and more people will try to satisfy their nomadic desires through the virtual world.

- This desire has influenced inventions and innovations in modern society, such as automobiles, airplanes, the Internet, and cell phones.
- Nomadic desire means that people continue to pursue new experiences and information through physical and virtual travel.
