title: "Experience is a curve on higher dimensional space"
---

- [[Personal experience]] is [[Curves on higher dimensional spaces]], and no two points on the curve are identical because the [[time axis]] is included in one of the axes.
Humans observe this by projecting it in the appropriate direction. In this way, "dark" and "light" areas are created.
Even if they have the same experience.
- (Although it can't be strictly "the same" since people and time are different.)
    - [The direction of projection is different.
