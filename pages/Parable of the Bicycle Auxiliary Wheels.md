title: "Parable of the Bicycle Auxiliary Wheels"
---

X is [[a bicycle auxiliary wheel]]. It has the advantage of getting people used to bicycles. But only at first. No adult rides with [[training wheels]].

Just because adults are not riding with auxiliary wheels does not mean that it is wrong for children who are in the process of learning [[how to ride a bicycle]] to use them.
It is ridiculous to say things like, "I would rather not be able to ride a bicycle than use something as unnatural as an auxiliary wheel."
