Strengths are hypotheses and must be tested

- [[Understanding is a hypothesis]] and must be [[verified]].
- Multiply this by "[[understanding your strengths]]".
- → Strengths are hypotheses and must be tested.

Strengths Understanding Stage
- I don't have a hypothesis.
- Hypothesized but not tested.
- Hypothesized but tested and rejected.
- Hypothesis stands, but has been verified and affirmed.

[[Strengths are cognitive gaps]].
- I don't find what most people find painful, etc.
- It's hard to recognize yourself, because your cognition is misaligned.
- You see others who are different from you and you think there's something wrong with the other side, but upon closer examination, you're in the minority.

How do we formulate a hypothesis?
- Gather information without prejudice
    - [[Five Principles of Exploration]]

- [[Unexpected Success]]
- You didn't make a hypothesis, but it was tested and a positive result was obtained.
- The fact that you didn't make that hypothesis suggests the existence of a [[blind spot]].
    - In other words, there is a high likelihood of [[cognitive misalignment]].
