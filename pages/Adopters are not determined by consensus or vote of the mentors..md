Adopters are not determined by consensus or vote of the mentors.
    - From [Generalists are selected when evaluated by sum
- Consultations will take place
    - If two mentors try to adopt one person, consult with each other to decide which one to adopt.
    - In a case where Mentor A has a very high opinion of Person X, but cannot adopt Person Y who has an even higher opinion of Person X, Mentor B may persuade Mentor A to adopt Person X. In such a case, Mentor B will also decide how to evaluate Person X. Mentor B may persuade the other Mentor A to adopt the person X. In such a case, it is the Mentor B's decision how to evaluate the person X.
- I think this is positive for the mentor's enthusiasm because it brings the composition "I am 100% responsible for adopting this person" for the mentor
    - Conversely, when a "mentor team" supports a "person adopted because everyone voted so-so", it is difficult to create a sense of responsibility for individual mentors
