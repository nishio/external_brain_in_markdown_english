title: "Two Generations of Manufacturing"

>  1st Generation: can acquire all skills to do everything alone and gain [overall impression
>  2nd Generation: Rides on the [[specialization]] rails laid down by the 1st Generation, thus gaining high [[expertise]].
- [Why does the "first generation continue to hold the line" in game making?" and how to become one, and the pitfalls｜kaerusanu｜note](https://note.mu/kaerusanu/n/n6a5de71356e8)

Even as the second generation refines its expertise, there is not the same holistic experience at the end of that rail as there was for the first generation.

> The first generation only talks to other first generations, and as a result, the [[network]] between first generations is strengthened and further strengthened by connecting with first generations in other industries, so you find yourself with a huge difference in results.
