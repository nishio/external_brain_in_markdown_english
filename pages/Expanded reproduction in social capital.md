- Not enough understanding in 2017.
    - There is no need to convert knowledge capital or social capital into money in the middle of the cycle with respect to its expansion and reproduction.
        - I'd rather reinvest without converting.
                - [[Better to reinvest without monetizing.]]
        - There are [[resources that can be procured with money]] and [[resources that are difficult to procure]]: [[resources that cannot be procured with cash]]
            - Money does not change everything: [[Cash is weak capital]].
        - Only resources that can be procured with money can be acquired after converting to money.
