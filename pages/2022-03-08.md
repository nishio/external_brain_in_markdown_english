- I wrote an explanation about [[Line Drawing Function]] in English and Japanese, but I don't see the point of putting it in Scrapbox for forum use instead of [[mem]].
And it's better to put it in the MEM, so it can be connected to other keywords.
Should I just put the eye catching image and link in the forum and direct people to mem

I didn't think about it when I used the forum because I didn't have a mem.
I was still thinking of creating a system that would allow multiple Scrapbox projects to be pseudo-connected into one at the end of the year and the beginning of the New Year.

Done. [https://mem.nhiro.org/Drawing_lines](https://mem.nhiro.org/Drawing_lines)
I linked from mem to "comments and questions in the forum" and in the forum I wrote "the original version is over there, you may write on this page".
Let's do the same for the Japanese version.



We're talking across multiple projects.
