title: "Bias-ridden simple comparison"

> [@ManpukuYuichi](https://twitter.com/ManpukuYuichi/status/1563488067981570048): @MIKITO_777 I just got the vaccination history of the 7th wave of deaths in Osaka.
> The proportion of unvaccinated among the deaths is 16.5%. In Osaka Prefecture, the percentage of the population that has never been vaccinated is 21.8%.
> Who is it? Who was the one who was spreading the false rumor that most of the deaths and serious injuries were among the unvaccinated!
> Don't tell lies that are so easy to catch.

> [@MIKITO_777](https://twitter.com/mikito_777/status/1563489291699101696?s=21&t=NYA2tiPIitnjtgQ56lJQOg): the vast majority of the 20%+ who are unvaccinated are children at low risk of death.
> There are very few elderly people who are at extremely high risk of death who have not been vaccinated.
> Yet 16.5% of the deaths are due to unvaccinated people, which shows how dangerous unvaccinated people are.
> Simple bias-ridden comparisons that are not age-adjusted are meaningless.
