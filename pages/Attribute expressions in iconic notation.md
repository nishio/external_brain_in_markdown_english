- Operation to mirror all but a small portion of [/blu3mo-public/Scrapbox](https://scrapbox.io/blu3mo-public/Scrapbox).
    - The public/private flag is expressed in icon notation.
- Scrapbox itself does not provide a way to add attributes when you want to add Boolean attributes to a page.
- There's a way to use "whether or not it contains some specific string."
    - If you [[Use icon notation as a one-way link]], you can prevent related pages from becoming [[The Problem of Too Large Links]], and you can also describe the meaning of the flag, killing two birds with one stone.
