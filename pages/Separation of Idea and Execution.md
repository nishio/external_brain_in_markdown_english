title: "Separation of Idea and Execution"
---

A word I heard from a friend and thought, "I see.
- Spoken in a positive context
- Don't think about execution [[production requirements]] when you think about an idea.
        - Similar concept to "[[boiling water]] and cold water cannot come out of the faucet at the same time" in [Osborn.
- In particular, the constraint that "I am too busy to give you the man-hours to execute" should not be a hindrance in coming up with ideas.
- First, submit [[IDEA]] without considering the number of man-hours required to execute it.
- Then think about how to [[execute (e.g., program)]].
