title: "Japanese tend to use non-living things as subjects."
---

People skim over text written in languages they can't read.
Their eyes pass over text without reading it.
In these two expressions, the former has a human subject and the latter has an "eye" subject.
An instructor from Taiwan told me that Japanese people tend to do the latter, and I was curious if this was due to East Asian culture, so I asked her what it was like in Taiwanese, and she said that in Taiwanese, people are used as the subject.

This subject is interesting.
- I had assumed that the pattern of thinking in which people, rather than things, were the subject was influenced by the Christian worldview.
- The Japanese Shintoistic worldview in which all things have a personal spirit is the cause of the non-living subject.

The idea that a focus on humans as subjects may be influenced by a Christian worldview, while a Shinto-inspired view might attribute person-like spirits to all things, possibly leading to non-human subjects in language. Different cultural backgrounds certainly can shape how we perceive and express ideas.
