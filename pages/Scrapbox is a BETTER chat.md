title: "Scrapbox is a BETTER chat"
---

Scrapbox is an improvement on Wiki as an origin, but it may be more appropriate to see it as an improvement on chat as a value perceived by the average user.

- [[Scrapbox supports convergent moves]], so "logs that would be scattered and dissipated in a normal chat room" naturally come together via links.
    - [[red link]] need to get people to understand the concept of [red link

Value perceived by business users

    - Third: "I enjoy connecting knowledge and expanding possibilities."
- Apparently Chat.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/scrapbox-drinkup/sawachin/icon' alt='/scrapbox-drinkup/sawachin.icon' height="19.5"/>

- If it's just the documentation part, I think that anything other than Scrapbox would be an option at all.
    - Rather, in terms of document management, other tools with approval flows, etc., are often superior.
- If you want to include more than just documents, we recommend Scrapbox
    - I also value learning,
    - We help each other,
    - Expect spontaneous movement from the individual or...
        - I think it would be better to change from communication (Chat) with Scrapbox in such cases.

- I also use [[Slack]].
    - But I get the impression that Scrapbox conveys the temperature of the discussion better.
    - There are like three arguments, and I can't get the assumptions, context, and other complex things across in slack.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/scrapbox-drinkup/shokai/icon' alt='/scrapbox-drinkup/shokai.icon' height="19.5"/>
