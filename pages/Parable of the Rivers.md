title: "Parable of the Rivers"
---

The "river's flow" exists continuously, but its waters are not the same.
When you look at water, it comes and goes. It is not continuous in itself. The continuous flow of the river exists through the constant repetition of the "coming and going" of countless individual bodies of water.

Hercules beetle (Dynastes hercules)
    - [[You can't step into the same river twice.]]

- [[Book of Joujoukei (of the Northern Court) (1332.4.28-1333 CE)]]
>  [[The river flows constantly, yet it is not the water it was before]] 。

relevance
    - [[civilization]] is the flow of a river
    - Individual humans have limited lives, but the movement of civilization created by countless humans is continuous
