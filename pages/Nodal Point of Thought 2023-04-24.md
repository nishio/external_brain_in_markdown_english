title: "Nodal Point of Thought 2023-04-24"

- T: Since last month, I have been giving a lecture on "adult learning" at a certain place, and I have been saying that [[learning is a process of connecting]]! I was wondering where this concept came from, but now I know it is the KJ method.
    - More accurately, he says, "If you don't connect, your learning remains incomplete."
- N: Good, you are doing the KJ method [[seeds take root and sprout new shoots]] in Mr. Tachikawa!
- T: Maybe this is a corollary of what Nishio-san said
- N: I didn't say that.
- T: I don't remember that.
- N: "What is the completion of learning?" N: "[[There is]] no such thing as completion in the first place, is there?" That's what I would say.
- T: I already expected that!
    - If you have any good expressions like this, please let me know.
- N: I would say, "[[Behavior changes]] only when 'connections are made between things that were not supposed to be connected,' or else [[we are]] just reproducing what we already know."
    - Well, this is my way of expressing what [[Jiro Kawakita]] is saying in the abstract.

- [[KJ method Let the chaos speak for itself]]  p.337
- >  [[Technologizing the Dialectic of Conflict]]
    - >  [[Fireworks to think about]], and strangely enough, it's easy to follow the conclusions drawn.
    - >  The following two articles are considered essential requirements.
        - > All data frames must be aligned.
        - > The overall picture must be in hand.
    - > In the fireworks to think about, the former is by net-making, and the latter is by integrated illustration.
- >  [[net work]] expresses the contradictions and conflicts inherent in the body honestly and beautifully. In other words, it is an "externalization" of "[[experiential perception]]" and an expression.
- > In contrast, [[Integrated Diagramming]] honestly and cleanly overcomes the expressed contradictions/conflicts. In other words, it is a [[dialectical creation]] of "[[intellectual awareness]]. Fireworks of thinking are established when both of these are in motion.
p.338-339
- > To be able to follow a conclusion means that we [[take action]] based on that conclusion.
- >  Let's think about the two-tiered world.
    - >  Net-making is [[a process in which the body creates language]] and constitutes the world of bodily perception.
    - >  Integral diagramming is [[the process by which words create bodies]] and constitutes the world of intellectual cognition.
    - >  Once an intellectual perception with logical consistency is formed, the body that formed the original experiential perception moves to the level of intellectual perception, on the process of [[dialectics]].
    - >  In other words, words create the body. Intellectual awareness then becomes a new experiential awareness as an idea, and this created body creates action.
    - >  ... And the actions created by this will lead to new perceptions of the experience, and will embryo new contradictions and conflicts.
            - [Take a step forward and the scenery changes.
- > We humans sustain our life forms through daily ingestion of food and nutrition and breathing. At the same time, we burn "life" by making judgments, decisions, and actions in various situations. The contradictions and conflicts in our perception of experience described here, along with food and air, are the "source power" of the generation of our "life" and the mother of wisdom and creation. Therefore, it can be said that fireworks that think are in principle inherent in the process of generating "life," which originates in contradiction and conflict. It is truly an expression of the workings of the mind, and a technological embodiment of the "workings of the mind" as it is. Moreover, it teaches in a practical way what it means for a human being to think and what it means for a human being to be troubled. In this sense, it is, in principle, a technology that externalizes the principle of contemplation of living organisms at the human level.

- T: [[experiential perception]] is a good expression. I see, experiential perception and [[intellectual awareness]].
- N: [[foggy]] If it's bothering you (the experience), just get the fuzziness out on paper first, then you can resolve it with intellectual awareness.
- T: So you need [[whiteboard]].
