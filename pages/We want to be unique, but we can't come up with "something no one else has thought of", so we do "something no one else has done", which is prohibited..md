title: 'We want to be unique, but we can''t come up with "something no one else has thought of", so we do "something no one else has done", which is prohibited.'

- I want to [[originality]], but I can't think of "[[something]] that no one has thought of," so I do "[[something]] that no one has done"[[prohibited action]].

> [@Reo19077530](https://twitter.com/Reo19077530/status/1672233977497939968): q. Why do all [[photographers]] want to take the same pictures in the same place?
> The first premise is that a train photographer and a train shooter are two completely different things.
> Railroad photographers enjoy it like an art form, painting a picture with a railroad in it.
> The "sport" of shooting is a way of having fun, similar to [[sport]], in which you try to reproduce the composition that is considered to be the correct one without any deduction in points....
- [[Correct reproduction sport]]

> [@stepney141](https://twitter.com/stepney141/status/1672820290659950592?s=20): "Shooting is more like a sport of how to reproduce the composition that is considered correct without any deduction."
> That's a great way to put it. I think this is it for sure.
> [@stepney141](https://twitter.com/stepney141/status/1672833348170051589?s=20): Photography is more a game of maximizing points to meet the constraints of "correct composition" such as "no skewer panning" and "no shadow on the car" than it is a game of artistry. It's a game to maximize the score to meet those constraints.

>  I know why they trespassed on the tracks.
>  I also understand why they are all clustered in one place and in the same composition.
>  Everything connected.
> [kiritannplum](https://twitter.com/kiritannplum/status/1672971624516308993) Photographers use their own [[creativity]] in their compositions, but photographers don't because they don't know what originality is, which is vague and without rules or laws. The reason why photographers don't do it is because they don't know what originality is, which is vague and has no rules or regulations.
>  But if you have a fixed composition that is considered correct, just get as close to it as possible.
>  That's why photographers gather in one place where they can get the right composition.
> [kiritannplum](https://twitter.com/kiritannplum/status/1672971627662024708) But just because you don't understand originality doesn't mean you don't want to create originality,
>  "Composition considered correct" + "originality, [[originality]]."
>  The answer to this question is,
>  "Shooting in the right composition in a place where no one has ever shot before."
> . So the easiest way to understand this is to shoot from a no-go area.

>  Since ASD is prone to obsessiveness and poor social skills, they tend to feel strong discomfort when they are restricted from sticking to the "correct composition".
>  I wonder if the combination of this and poor social skills that prevent us from successfully imagining other people's feelings and the public's view of us spurs us to trespass for our own obsessions?
> [kiritannplum](https://twitter.com/kiritannplum/status/1673228496402010112) And I don't know if this is related to ASD, but when you want uniqueness,
>  "Something no one had thought of."
>  because it's hard to think about it,
>  "What no one else has done."
>  There are a certain number of people who try to gain a sense of uniqueness and identity by doing > something about it. I am one of them.
> [kiritannplum](https://twitter.com/kiritannplum/status/1673228519084814336) And if the "reason" why no one did it is simply "because it's inefficient and hard," that's fine, but if it's "because it shouldn't be done," it's easy to do it. But if it's "because it shouldn't be done", it's easy to do, and people tend to do it out of a desire for identity and so on.
