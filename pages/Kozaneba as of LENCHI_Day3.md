I have yesterday's next to it, so I'll merge them.

It's done.

Though I do it casually and unconsciously, "organizing today's minutes and then merging them with yesterday's minutes" is better than "organizing yesterday's minutes while merging today's minutes". What is better is that in the latter case, "yesterday's thoughts" become "the frame of existing thoughts" and "new information is applied to the existing structure. That makes it difficult to create new structures.

Renamed "Kozaneba as of this point in time" to "Kozaneba as of Day 1". Renaming "Kozaneba at this point today" to "Kozaneba at this point today" does no harm as a book heading, but it is inconvenient in Scrapbox, where the name is the URL. Different contents should have different names, and having the same name is a sign that the naming does not properly reflect the contents. After some consideration, I decided to use "Kozaneba as of Day 3. Scrapbox allows us to rename the links while maintaining the connection, so we can change the names to "appropriate names" without worrying.

In the process of sorting this out, a new idea came to me.
