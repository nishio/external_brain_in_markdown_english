State Limits and Participation in Decision Making:.
- The fundamental question was raised, "Shouldn't [[decision-making]] involve all those affected by it?"
    - For example, the idea is that when a decision regarding manufacturing in one country affects the environment in another country, the circle of decision-making should extend beyond national borders.
- This was a challenge to the [[nation-state]] framework itself, and suggested that the Internet and digital tools could form new forms of community that transcend geographical constraints.
