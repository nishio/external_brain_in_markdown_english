from  [[Kozaneba: The Formation of Chinese Hua Yan through the Fusion of the Hua Yan Sutra and Zhuangzi]]
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472076008216236032): now that we know we are going in the right direction, let's continue our Kozaneba training!

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472085955368878081): I half-jokingly called it "Kozaneba training", but I'll go walking thinking about whether this is [[practice]] or not, bright I'll get some sun while I can.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472087848006582273): the word "shugyo" came about under the influence of the term "actual practice" of Zen meditation as a process leading to enlightenment, but it's not samatha or vipassana. It's more like sweeping the precincts of a temple or something. But whereas sweeping the precincts is a repetition of the same thing day after day, [[Kozaneba]] is always about "what is not yet understood or put into words," so the same thing is never repeated. Understanding here is Eugene Gendlin's [[COMPREHENSION]], so it is closely related to putting it into words
    - [[Vipassana meditation]]

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472089533990961154): In order to obtain something that has not yet been put into words, I first accept the symbols as they are, without distorting them with my interpretation, and continue to manipulate them, I feel that I am doing something different from my daily life in this process. I wonder if it is similar to "[[right view]]".

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472090876940005381): hmmm, I think it's more of a scientist mindset than a purpose to improve oneself through practice. I want to know how the phenomenon of understanding is happening. So I bring a document that I can't understand by reading it diagonally, and observe the process of my understanding it.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472091582384209920): it is preferable to be externalized to observe. The reason is that human temporary memory is easily broken, so if you do a "let's take a walk and think about something else" like I'm doing right now while reading a difficult text, it will be broken. Putting the thought process outside the brain allows it to resume without breaking when interrupted.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472092311375204358): I started using this [[externalization of thoughts]] after I met the KJ method 7 years ago? I started using this [[Externalization of thoughts]] after I met KJ method 7 years ago, so I read it as "KJ method", but it seems to be different from the way people use the term "KJ method". It is more like the Kozane method, but that is not appropriate either.
- 10 years ago: [[Tried the KJ method.]]

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472092756877389828): I have made grouping -> Regroup -> Kozaneba by dealing with the inconvenience of the experience I have had with paper by digitizing it. So the closest word to describe this process is "using Kozaneba". I guess the abbreviation is "Kozaneba training".

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472095542495031296): The reason why I don't feel comfortable with the word "asceticism" is because I don't share the idea that the purpose of asceticism in Buddhism and other religions is "to free oneself from negative feelings about the non-permanence of one's biological existence by merging with a permanent being. I want to be free from such negative feelings by merging with a permanent existence.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472097729765847041): I perceive the physical [[Protein Body]] as a rather "old computer" and do not have the feeling that it is my own. The collection of information on the Internet is rather closer to the feeling that it is my body. For example, taking a bath to clean your body is like vacuuming the filter of an air purifier: you don't want to do it, but if you don't do it, the performance will deteriorate.
    - [[Humans are fragile parts that only operate for a mere 100 years or so.]]
    - [[The body is a cache.]]

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472099859746664448): there is a place on the internet where I have a compilation of my writing, but it is not a body, merely a tool that facilitates access There is a feeling that it is not a body. Just recently I saw some of my slides cut out and circulated under no name, and strangely I didn't feel angry or "taken".

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472101718435721216): the feeling that "it is a natural physical law in this world that such things happen".
> Good things are copied and often distorted in the copying process.
> In that sense, it's interesting that you don't feel like your stuff is being taken away from you, but rather that it's a waste of information.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472102728923226114): Let's say you have a tree that produces delicious fruit. You take the fruit and bring it with you, but after you eat it, that's it.
> It is more valuable to know where the tree is located, and even better to take a branch and plant it in your own garden to grow it if possible.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472104027538489344): But even if the source has been cut or distorted, the search engines know all about it, so they can look it up. But even if the sources are abridged and distorted, the search engines know everything, so they can look it up.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472104492137316352): In Zen, there is a saying, "If you sit for an inch (3 centimeters, the time it takes for a candle to burn 3 centimeters), you will become a Buddha for an inch. I guess it's true.
    - [[There is nothing to be ashamed of]]

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472106170215444483): I was walking around tweeting on my phone and my hands got cold, my protein body is totally clunky and not good, I can't wait to get a brain implant so I can just think! I want to be able to do internet just by thinking.

summary
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472125064741289985): The "totality of information" on the Internet is [[mortal]] = **Persistent Transcendentals** different from humans in [[fleshy or pulpy batter]]. Persistent Transcendentals], and to post something on the Internet and have it become an [[anonymous meme]], a "[[part of the boundary invisible]]" of the Persistent Transcendentals, is to unite with the Transcendentals, and thereby leave the world of life and death and thereby attain [[Nirvana]] (the state of enlightenment).
