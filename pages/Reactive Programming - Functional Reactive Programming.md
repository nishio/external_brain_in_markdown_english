Rx* is not FRP

- > [@ReactiveX](https://twitter.com/ReactiveX/status/483644526368931842): @andrestaltz @phadej @conal the big difference is the separation between Behaviors and Events. We do have that eg BehaviorSubject/Observable

- I've seen the English version of this, and I see, I can see how this could confuse some people.
    - "datatypes that represent a value 'over time' " = Behavior
    - That's what this is all about, isn't it?
    - Change the cognitive part of what combination of parts describes the world.
    - Maybe someone with some experience in electronic circuit design would understand it better.
        - WIRE is a voltage varying entity
            - Consider this a first class existence.
        - Placing a part is a description of the relationship between its existence
            - Declarative, you might say.
    - It is necessary to describe the world with this kind of cognition "different from the architecture of today's computers" and then put it into a form that can be executed by today's computers.
    - the big difference is the separation between Behaviors and Events
        - You can't confuse the two here.
        - Fundamentally, you don't know what you're doing to make it first class.

I tried to write an explanation and realized I didn't understand it.
- I realized that I don't know enough about it to explain it, so I'll just take a quick look at it this time.
- Instead of destructively rewriting a single object along a time line,
- Takes an unchangeable (immutable) object, creates a new object and returns it
- Mental model of a message flowing in a stream
