[[Daniel Allen]] Justice by Means of Democracy

> [9PAczNdpH0BrikD](https://x.com/9PAczNdpH0BrikD/status/1938955164649701533) note updated! This time I wrote a review of Justice by Daniel Allen, a major influence on Plurality. It is a very interesting book and I hope this article will be a catalyst for the publication of a Japanese translation. #plurality #digital democracy
