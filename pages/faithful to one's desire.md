title: "faithful to one's desire"

> [origamicat](https://twitter.com/origamicat/status/1708062727766519917) Parents who did not allow their children to "want to do" at all in child-rearing may ask their grown children, "What do you want to do? Just as a parent who has not allowed his/her child to "do what he/she wants to do" will lose his/her "passion" if he/she does not allow his/her own child to do what he/she wants to do.
>  "[[faithful]] to [[desire]]" sounds bad, but it's very important for [[self-nurturing]] to face what you "want" to do as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else!

- [[People who don't have anything they want to do.]]
