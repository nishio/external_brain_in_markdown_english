Why Japan's Policies Don't Work
> [rmaruy](https://x.com/rmaruy/status/1817441570796216337) [[Kazuya Sugimoto]] "Why Japanese Policy Doesn't Work" (Kobunsha Shinsho, 2024). The book solves the confusion about what "[[evidence]]" in [[EBPM]] means, based on the flow of research and the convoluted process of its introduction into Japanese public administration. I thought the author's emphasis toward the end of the book on "not separating the political element" was important.
