title: "Why the power crunch didn't happen in 2025"
---

No power crunch occurred in 2025.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3/icon' alt='o3.icon' height="19.5"/>On March 22, 2022 (in TEPCO's service area), the first "Tight Power Supply-Demand Warning" was issued, followed by another warning in Tokyo on June 27, 2022, and the reserve ratio temporarily fell below 5
- On social networking sites, there were those who said it was because we restarted nuclear power plants and those who said it was because we increased solar power generation.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3/icon' alt='o3.icon' height="19.5"/>This year (2025), there has not been a single "electricity supply-demand crunch warning" despite the daily heat wave. Comparing the factors behind this with the supply crunch in 2022, we can see that (1) an increase in renewable energy (especially solar power), (2) additional restart of nuclear power plants, (3) new construction of highly efficient gas-fired thermal power plants, (4) a rapid increase in large-capacity storage batteries, and (5) expansion of measures to secure reserve capacity have all taken effect in a multilayered manner.

Incremental (22 → 25 years)
- New gas-fired +2.34 GW
    - JERA is constructing a new 2.34 GW multi-unit gas-fired power plant in the Goi area of Chiba, Japan, which is scheduled to start operation in the summer of 2024.

    - solar power (generation)
        - As of 2022, Japan's installed PV capacity was about 79 GW
            - In recent years, new installations have been increasing at a pace of around 5 GW per year, and are expected to reach a cumulative total of over 100 GW by 2025. This represents an increase of approximately 21 GW over 2022.
        - Annual PV power generation in fiscal year 2022 (FY2022) was about 92.6 billion kWh (about 92.6 TWh)
            - The amount of electricity generated has expanded with the subsequent expansion of facilities, and is estimated to have reached approximately 110.1 TWh in 2023
            - Even more increases are expected as of 2025, with annual solar power generation increasing on the order of tens of TWh between 2022 and 2025 (e.g., +20-30 TWh increase)
    - nuclear power generation (of electricity)
        - After the Fukushima accident, many reactors were shut down or decommissioned, but as of 2022, there remained 33 operational reactors with a total installed capacity of approximately 31.7 GW.
            - No new reactors will be in operation in 2025, and the installed capacity itself will remain flat at around 32 GW.
            - Thus, there will be no significant increase or decrease in nuclear installed capacity between 2022 and 2025.
        - Annual nuclear power generation in FY2022 was approximately 56.1 billion kWh (56.1 TWh), down about 21% from the previous year and accounting for only slightly more than 5% of total power generation.
            - By 2025, 14 reactors will be restarted (cumulative), bringing the total nuclear capacity in operation to about 11 GW
            - In 2021, nuclear power plants generated about 70 TWh of electricity, and it is estimated that by 2025, when nuclear power plants are restarted, annual power generation will have increased by several tens of TWh (~70-80 TWh scale) compared to 2022. However, the situation is still far from the level of pre-2010 (power generation of about 300 TWh or more, supplying about 30% of electricity).

- [[not one factor, but multiple factors]].
        - [[the sound of one hand clapping (a classic Zen koan)]]
- So first of all, before 2010, nuclear power plants were generating a steady 300 TWh.
    - On 2011-03-11, [Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident - Wikipedia [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A6%8F%E5%B3%B6%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E5%8E%9F%E5%AD%90%E5%8A%9B%E7](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A6%8F%E5%B3%B6%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E5%8E%9F%E5%AD%90%E5%8A%9B%E7) %99%BA%E9%9B%BB%E6%89%80%E4%BA%8B%E6%95%85] occurred.
    - Nuclear power plants are down to 56 TWh in 2022.
    - And then came the power crunch of 2022.
- +30 TWh from solar power generation and +80 TWh from resumption of nuclear power generation by 2025
