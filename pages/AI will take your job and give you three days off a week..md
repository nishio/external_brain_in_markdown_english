title: "AI will take your job and give you three days off a week."
---

> What has happened with mechanization and automation is not an increase in unemployment, but a reduction in the number of hours worked per person.
>  From 2426 hours in 1960 to 1779 hours in 2009, a 27% decrease, and in the process, two days off a week has become the norm.
>  I think it is not the increase in unemployment but the [[five-day workweek system]] that will be caused by AI to improve efficiency.
> A 16% increase in efficiency from 6 workers working 6 days a week would create 6 workers working 5 days a week instead of 1 unemployed worker.
>  Similarly, I believe that a 20% increase in efficiency does not produce one unemployed person from five workers, but rather five workers working four days a week.

    - [[If AI doesn't take away jobs, there will be three fewer days off per month.]]
    - If AI didn't take my job, my workload would increase by 17% and I would have 3 less days off per month.
