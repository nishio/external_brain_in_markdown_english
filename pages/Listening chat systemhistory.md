- I've been working on putting a WebUI on it and publishing it since the beginning of the year.
    - With a closed chat bot, you can't offer it right away to people who say they'd like to use it.
    - I finished the work on 1/29, so I wrote the commentary page.
    - I didn't assign a specific version number, but it's like a 1.0.0 release, if you will.
        - The server and client are deployed by pushing, so we will continue to update as soon as we think of something new.

- Around 2014, I was working on a chat system that would ask me questions.
    - If there is a system for listening to others and asking questions, one can deepen one's thinking through [[dialogue]].
    - Example: [Experimental log where I was explaining a new feature and ended up going for a new world - NISHIO Hirokazu's Hatena Diary](https://nishiohirokazu.hatenadiary.org/entry/20150126/1422276973)
    - Use KyTea for keyphrase extraction, UI is a choice between CUI and self-made WebChat

- I left it for a while after that, but in 2019, I decided to connect to [[Mattermost]].
    - Convenient to talk to someone anytime from your smartphone as long as you are connected to the Internet.
    - The phone is now waterproof and can be used from the bathroom.
