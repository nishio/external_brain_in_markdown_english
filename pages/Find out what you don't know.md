title: "Find out what you don't know"
---

I think it is important to "look up [[Words you don't understand]] in a dictionary or something" when thinking about making the program perform intellectual activities.

- Find words you don't know
- →Check it out.
    - dictionary
    - Google Search
    - Wikipedia

- [[Forms of Knowledge Representation]]
- Given a sentence, a machine can create a Scrapbox-like network by creating links to words in the sentence that it does not understand, writing explanations of those words on the links, and repeating the process.

- [[Intellectual Programs]]
- [[Intellectual Production BOT]]
