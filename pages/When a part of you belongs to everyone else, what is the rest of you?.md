title: "When a part of you belongs to everyone else, what is the rest of you?"

When a part of what you vaguely thought of as "[[yourself]]" is no longer "[[one's own property]]" due to [[Anyone can do it.]] by [[commoditization]] by AI," what is left for you to say, "This is me.

Currently, [[Cognitive Resolution]] for "self" is low, and you have a vague idea of "self" as a whole, so you probably feel somewhat threatened.
- Need to clarify the concept of "self"

I first wrote under the title, "When part of what you vaguely thought was you is eaten by AI, what's left?"
- I thought "[[AI will eat you alive]]" could be interpreted differently from what I wanted to express.
- but, well, I don't know a better way to describe it because it's still vague to me.
- Expression with a little more bite
    - Commoditization through AI will make it possible for anyone to do it and not "own" it.
- Cut it down because it's long: When part of you is eaten by an AI, what's left?".
- I guess "a part of you belongs to everyone."
    - → When a part of you belongs to everyone else, what is the rest of you?

Example of drawing AI
- For those who originally thought "I can't draw", "drawing" is not "part of what I thought I was", so commoditization by AI is "gaining power".
- For those who originally "can draw" (and perhaps not only "I who can draw" constituted "I"), the commoditization of "a part of what I thought was me" by AI means that "a part of me becomes everyone else's".
