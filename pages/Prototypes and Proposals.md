title: "Prototypes and Proposals"
---

    - If the objective of creating [[prototype.]] is well articulated, when there are "things that are easy to implement but not very useful for the objective" and "things that are hard to implement but absolutely necessary for the objective", the latter can be chosen. If [[Objective.]] is ambiguous, you will only do the former.
    - When I said "it is better to have a prototype" regarding the [[unexplored junior]] proposal, I did not mean "make a prototype *before* writing the [[proposal]]". Making a proposal is the process of putting into words "what would make me happy about doing this project". The proposal makes the prototype better, and vice versa.
- So, I think it is better to make a proposal by [[itemization]], for example, and then make a prototype based on it, and then [[improve]] the proposal based on the [[experience]] of running the prototype, and then gradually improve it in a small cycle. I think it's a good idea to gradually make improvements by repeating small cycles. [Like a spiral staircase, you can go around in circles and gradually climb higher and higher.
