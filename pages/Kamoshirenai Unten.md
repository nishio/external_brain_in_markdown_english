It translates to "might happen driving." This approach is about always being cautious and aware while driving, thinking about what might happen. For example, a driver using this philosophy will be extra careful near pedestrian crossings, always ready for the possibility that someone might suddenly cross the road. This careful and considerate style of driving reflects the broader cultural values of safety and respect for others in Japan. It's a good example of how cultural attitudes can influence everyday activities like driving.
