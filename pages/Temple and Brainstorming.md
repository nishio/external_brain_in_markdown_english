But the people talking on there are not seriously trying to predict the future, they are just [[brainstorming]], and they don't mean to be right, you know?

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1883542108365373721) It is strange to ask for "correctness" in posts on a place where anyone can write for free, but people who consider it a "temple" tend to ask for it. The people who are brainstorming think "if opinions are diverse, it contributes to broadening horizons and reducing blind spots", so they find more value in diversity than correctness.
