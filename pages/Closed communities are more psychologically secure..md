title: "Closed communities are more psychologically secure."

> [izutorishima](https://twitter.com/izutorishima/status/1757256508331766012) I recently saw a tweet on Twitter lamenting that "the technical community has moved to Discord [[where knowledge is not made public]]". While this is true, [[psychological safety]] is much higher in Discord's [[closed community]].
>  If you open it to the public, you have to be afraid that Masakari might fly at any moment, but in a space where only comrades are present, you can have conversations in peace, and there is only incentive for that to happen.
>  I guess it's a reaction to the 10's when public internet flameouts caused a lot of problems, and it's becoming more of a closed community.
>  ...I posted a tweet about it on Bruska, and the response was unexpectedly positive, so here it is...

>  It's hard to consolidate information, and with Discord, there's voice chat, so it's very convenient.

> [izutorishima](https://twitter.com/izutorishima/status/1757260896781402576) I think you're right, it's easier to discuss things in a community, and there are more people with similar interests. In addition, since the context is continuous, there is less chance for people to come up with crazy ideas.

> [izutorishima](https://twitter.com/izutorishima/status/1757261057733865673) Twitter is basically a medium for writing things down, so it's true that information is dispersed. I think this trend is inevitable.

>  "The problem of no longer publishing Ji on the web" is exactly the same. I thought it was something like, I don't pay money to the media, but I want to read articles.
- > [izutorishima](https://twitter.com/izutorishima/status/1757272810781876698) I completely agree... It is hard to share knowledge for free on the public internet, where security is deteriorating day by day, when even psychological safety is not guaranteed (because I and others I know are already satisfied with the Discord server). Discord server).
- This point is interesting.
    - "Knowledge is not shared on the public Internet!" is a nuance of "the other party is dishonest", but from another point of view, it is a cutthroat way of saying "share your knowledge for free! from another point of view, "Share the knowledge for free!
    - To begin with, the OSS Discord community that is being talked about here is one that you can enter [[permissionless]] in many cases, with the ability to search within the server, and the knowledge is shared for free. You just can't find it when you do a Google search without entering the community.

I'm sure there are other options like GitHub, but that's a place to talk about specific code, not for unorganized discussions... so I think it's the best choice for now.

> [epouvante](https://twitter.com/epouvante/status/1757452529183732208) This is the function that [[mailing list]] used to perform.

Could lead to a fleshing out of the concept of "[[Bazaar and Clubs]]".
