title: "PokemonGo is back on."

Physical condition is important.
- You should get a good night's sleep.
- I'm going to try Pokemon Sleep.
- Reminds me of Pokemon Go.
- It's been a while since I logged in, but I found a lot of new features.
    - Especially the route function
    - Walking a course you set yourself earns you a bonus.
    - At first, I couldn't make it myself, so I walked the trails that others had made.
    - I can now make it (because I reached level 30?).
    - Quickly made and promptly approved.
