- Brainwriting - "The [[silence]] Idea Conference" that taps a large number of [[ideas]] in a short period of time.
- [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2tjxvlK)

    - Although [[brainstorming]] has a strong image of voice, in terms of generating many ideas, it is better for each person to write rather than to use voice, in which only one person can speak at a time.
