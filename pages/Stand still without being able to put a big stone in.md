title: "Stand still without being able to put a big stone in"
---

from [[Diary 2025-09-22]].
[[stand still]] without being able to put [[a large stone]] in.
[[first big stone in]].
- You have to put the big stones in first, because if you put the smaller ones in first, they won't fit."
- The disease is influenced by the notion that "I'm not doing anything," so the smaller tasks are not performed, but the larger tasks are not performed because [[the specific next action is unknown]], and the person is tormented by the feeling that "I'm not doing either one.
- I mean, tomorrow is a holiday, so wouldn't it be better to finish the small stuff and feel refreshed than to start on the big stuff and be a work in progress?
    - The big one here is, "Shouldn't we internationalize [[the conceptual map of the Plurality book]]?" That's what I'm talking about.

Yes, yes, [[first write down all the things that are bothering you]].
(I wrote out about one screen by hand on my iPad and used about two screens to move around and organize.)
