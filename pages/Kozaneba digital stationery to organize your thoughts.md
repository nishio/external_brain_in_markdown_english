- I find the KJ method very useful, but there are a lot of inconveniences in doing it on paper! I need good digital stationery! This is the motivation behind the open-source development and free distribution of the software.
- I use it to organize my thoughts and give priority to implementing the features I think I need.
    - fold a group
    - Make the important ones bigger.
    - Drawing lines of relationship between things

use case
    - [[The "Interesting" Exploration Net]]

Note: Kozaneba is currently in an experimental implementation phase, so development is not very stability oriented.
