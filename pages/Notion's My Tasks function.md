>
>  This is an amazing feature that allows you to visualize information from multiple data sources in one view. This is a tremendous feature that is hidden in the shadow of Home.
>
>  I think there are some situations in my work where I have to split the DB due to authorization reasons, but from now on, even if the DB is split, it will be completed in a single view instead of placing multiple linked views.
>
>  Moreover, I just discovered that this full page view of My Tasks can be registered as a favorite.
>
>  I honestly thought it would be too technically difficult to make it happen, but if you have the ability to map properties properly, you can do it... You've created something amazing... Thanks Notion.
>
>  * This feature has only been released to about half of the workspaces I have, so please be patient if you haven't yet!
