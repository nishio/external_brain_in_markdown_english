"Oubaitori" ([[桜梅桃李]]) is a Japanese concept represented by the characters for cherry (桜, ou), plum (梅, bai), peach (桃, tou), and apricot (李, ri). The phrase emphasizes that each of these trees blooms in its own time and exhibit unique beauty, illustrating the idea that everyone has their own unique path and pace in life. This term conveys the message that one should not compare oneself to others, but rather embrace and appreciate individual differences and timelines. Each person, like each tree, has their own way of blooming and contributing beauty to the world.

"Oubaitori" (桜梅桃李) has its roots in medieval Japan.

Origins and Background
- Kokin Chomonshu: The term appears in the 1254 anthology "Kokin Chomonshu," which describes the diversity of spring flowers with the phrase "In spring, there are the flowers of cherry, plum, peach, and apricot."
- Nichiren: In the Kamakura period, the Buddhist monk Nichiren used the term in his teachings. He stated, "The cherry, plum, peach, and apricot each have their own place and do not alter their own character," emphasizing that enlightenment can be attained by each person in their unique way.
