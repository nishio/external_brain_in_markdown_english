The Koran 6:108 ([[Ansam]] chapter) states the following (Ibid.):
> "Do not curse their (pagan) gods. Otherwise, they will curse Allah unjustly because of their ignorance. We thus make each person beautify their deeds. And the final return will be to Allah, and He will tell them about what they used to do."

explanation
- This verse calls for respect for the beliefs and values of others. It says that disrespect for the deities of others should be refrained from, as it may ultimately provoke acts of contempt for Islam and Allah. The verse emphasizes the importance of interreligious harmony and respect.

verbatim translation of the whole
- And do not curse those who call upon anything other than Allah. Otherwise, they will curse Allah with hostility because of their ignorance. In this way we made each community beautify their deeds. Then there will be their return to their Lord and He will tell them about what they used to do."

That they too will eventually return to Allah and report what they have done (= believed in a god other than Allah), so there is no need for us to call them out on their deeds, and that they can remain [[each community beautifying their own deeds]].
