Outcome A
- There are small ones and big ones.
kanji "person radical" (radical 9)
- Think small accomplishments have value and big accomplishments have great value
person Q
- They don't value small accomplishments.
    - Does the accumulation of small values add up to big value?"
People R
- Introduce axis X,Y
    - There is a value X that is not based on size.
    - There is a value Y that occurs only in major achievements.
    - Person Q is talking about Y.
    - Person P is talking about the value of X and Y combined.







CI
- Even if you add up the number of non-citations of papers that are cited only by your family members, you will never reach the value of a single paper that is cited by many people.
Wrong KPI
    - [[No numerical criteria should be used to evaluate researchers.]]
- Global Impact
    - Value Y
    - random event
    - Number of papers and patents is a type of KPI that increases as work continues
        - value X-like

human relations
- Number of followers
- Close friends

Don't be so busy working to create value X that you lose time to create value Y.

train of thought
- I thought there are P's and Q's, I guess (original context is non-citation count, but abstracted).
- I thought I was more of a Q guy.
- On the other hand, isn't ignoring the value of small accomplishments a resolution downgrade? I also wondered.
- Whether it is suddenly worth a small [[False dichotomy]] or not.
    - [[two axes, not conflicts]].
