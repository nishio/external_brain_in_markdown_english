[Sometimes the "effort to understand the conclusion" is misinterpreted as "the effort to draw that conclusion" when a simple explanation is given.](https://note.com/4bata/n/n0a44276a0ef1)

If you have actually experienced [[trial and error]] and [[intellectual production]] by yourself, it is [[empirically self-evident]] that there is a lot of trial and error behind what you see, but people who only consume don't understand that. I guess.
