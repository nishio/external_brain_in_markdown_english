- Figures that have been repeatedly discussed, added to, and become more informative.
- How should the process of cutting down and simplifying be?
- Zoom in on important stickies and zoom out to view style
    - The people who have made it have the information in their brains, so they can supplement it,
    - Can zoom in and out on the tool.
    - When sharing as an image, stickies with fine text are just noise.
- It seems like a good idea to create a new diagram with minimal copy and paste ([[cherry pick]]) from a diagram with a lot of information.
    - Currently, you have to select a range to copy.
        - I want to do a single sticky note, "Take this and paste it over here.
    - Not implementing a way to make enlarged stickies smaller.
        - I want the copy and paste to be the first size.
- When cherry-picking from an existing diagram to a new diagram
    - Instead of using the pointing device to "select, copy, and paste into a new diagram".
    - I was more comfortable with "write out the necessary keywords on my phone and space them out" while looking at the existing diagram.
- Maybe it's because they haven't implemented the former feature.
    - If you do the former, you'll need to share a clipboard.
        - Split screen on one machine or
        - Need to use multiple displays, etc.
    - It's a hassle to switch screens every time you copy one thing.
- The fact that there were no groups to reuse and no hand-drawn diagrams, only strings to reuse, may have suited the latter.

- I thought it would never come to an end.
- Under the pressure of "let's [[simplify]] it so it can be read without magnification," we cut off the branches and leaves and left only the important parts.
- I've had three useful insights in the process.
- People tend to get stuck with more data than they can handle smoothly...
