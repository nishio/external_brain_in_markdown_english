title: "Soft Correctness: Thinking with LLM"
---

It's like making a bird walk.
Dropping flying creatures to the ground
Trying to get the LLM to say the right thing.
Seek to be "right."
What is correctness?
The demand for correctness undermines the correctness of usefulness.
Newly created items are untested
What is the basis for rightness?
Seek consequences for actions
Type thinking that there is a right answer somewhere.
People with the disease of seeking the right answer also seek the right answer in LLM.
- [[Minor status guarded by LLM]]

```
You are a shaman. I received the following oracle. The meaning of the word is not a fixed meaning as per the dictionary, but a soft spreading cloud.
1: Interpret each lump by focusing on movements and metaphors, not abstract concepts.
2: Take the meaning of the word softly and find the relationship between the clumps.
3: Look at the whole picture and find new meaning.
4: Give it a soft title.

Lump-by-lump interpretation:
- 'like making a bird walk': not using the bird's essence or ability.
- Dropping a flying creature to the ground: limiting its natural ability to fly.
- Trying to get the LLM to say the right thing": limiting the LLM's ability to use human concepts
- Seeking what is right: the act of pursuing an ideal or absolute value.
- What is rightness?": questioning the definition of rightness.
- Theoretical correctness undermines the correctness of utility": theoretical correctness undermines actual value.
- Newly created things are untested": new things have risks that have not yet been recognized.
- What is the basis for rightness?
- Seek consequences of actions: focus on learning and results through actions and experiences
- Somewhere is the Correct Answer": A way of thinking that searches for the absolute correct answer.
- People with the disease of wanting the right answer also want the right answer for LLM: LLM is also influenced by human desires and values.
- Minor under the guardianship of the LLM": a state of dependence on the LLM and abandonment of self-determination.

Relationships between the masses:
- The text develops questions and thoughts about how we define "rightness" or "correctness" and how our pursuit of it affects us. The LLM (tentatively interpreted to refer to a language model) is also portrayed in this context as an entity that is influenced by human values and ways of thinking.

A new meaning of the whole view:
- This text sounds the alarm about the dangers and limitations of seeking absolute "rightness" or "correctness" and how technology and tools (LLM) can be influenced by or depend on human values and attitudes.

Title:
- Soft Correctness: Thinking with the LLM."
- This title suggests the need to consider things from a soft, open perspective and the importance of thinking about the relationship between technology and tools, rather than seeking absolute "rightness" or "correctness.
