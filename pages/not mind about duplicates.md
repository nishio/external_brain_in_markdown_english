title: "not mind about duplicates"
---

When it comes to information, it's better not to worry about duplication than to pay the cost and lose the opportunity.
    - [[May be duplicated]]
    - [[Don't be afraid to duplicate]]
    - [[Don't worry about duplicates, just write them.]]
    - [[duplicate check]]
but what about the physical?

When you can't determine if there is a duplicate [What you can't find is the same as what you can't find.
What if a duplicate is found after the fact?
