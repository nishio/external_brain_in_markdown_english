title: "Ideally, a world where there is no disadvantage in using one's real name would be ideal, but the real world is not yet in an ideal state."

from  [[Nodal Point of Thought 2022-03-25]]
- Ideally, we would like to live in a world where we are not disadvantaged by displaying [[real name]], but the real world is not yet in an ideal state.
- > The ideal world would be one in which people would not be disadvantaged by displaying their real names in their family registers, but the real world is not yet in that ideal state, so it is up to each individual to defend themselves.
