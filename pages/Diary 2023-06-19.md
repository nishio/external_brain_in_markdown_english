- The feeling that different families have different relationships with their marriage partners.
    - I told a prospective bride to be that she lost her wedding ring and had to buy a new one, so watch out.
    - My intention was to say, "Be careful not to lose it, because it is easy to lose it when wearing something unfamiliar, and the financial cost of rewriting it is high.
    - I was surprised when others who heard this generated the interpretation, "Did you buy a new one so your wife wouldn't find out?
        - I imagined this myself, I wonder if it is associated with this because it is a common story (whether it is common or not, I often hear it as a "story").<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I thought it was unexpected.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/biwachi/icon' alt='/villagepump/biwachi.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I never had the idea to try to hide such a thing.
        - At the point where I couldn't find it, I reported that I couldn't find it.
        - [[I don't know why you would try to hide the fact that you lost your ring.]]
        - They think they'll get caught if they shut up and buy it back.
        - In order not to be found out.
            - Call the ring shop without being noticed.
            - Check availability of rings of the same type as before and pay
            - They'd know it was in the mail, so I pretended to be on another errand to pick it up so they wouldn't find out.
            - The paper bags and containers will give you away, so go dump them at the station.
            - Even if you make it that far, you'll probably get caught with "new and completely unscratched".
        - You don't know where you lost it in the first place, so it could be in the house, and it could be exposed in a "I'm wearing a ring and I found a ring under the fridge" kind of way.
        - Based on various factors, I don't know why you think you can fool me.
    - Based on the fact that "I guess what and how far to report varies from household to household," he said.
    - If I lose it, will I have to buy it back in many cases?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/yosider/icon' alt='/villagepump/yosider.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - If it's expensive, he's going to be hesitant.
