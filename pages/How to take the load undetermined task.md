title: "How to take the load undetermined task"
---

After observing the behavior patterns of various people for a long time, I think there are two types of behavior when there are multiple tasks for which [[burden]] cannot be accurately estimated in advance.
- One pattern is to estimate the workload on the high side and try not to overflow. If you already have two uncertain tasks and think there is a possibility of overflow, you do not touch the third one. Filtering in advance.
- The other pattern is to estimate the workload at the low end and get to everything. And if it overflows, filter it down to [[posterior]] by doing the higher priority stuff.

Each may have an advantage or disadvantage depending on the situation.
- When doing a task where success = low probability of high load occurrence, it seems more advantageous to sow seeds without fear of overflow. #Sowing seeds
- If there's a disadvantage, it's when there's a deadline that can't be moved, or when there are other people's tasks that depend on it.
    - I wrote that when others are involved... but that's a problem because communication with others is falling behind as a task priority, and it would be better if we communicate with them early on to delay or cancel.
