There is a key in the treasure chest.

When the person is "hurt", he/she often does not know that the cause is his/her past behavior, and even if he/she does know, it is hard to admit it, so it is unlikely that he/she will go on to "learn".

If you graduate from college without getting caught, will you be able to realize afterwards that you have not acquired proper writing skills? I don't think so, since they can't distinguish between proper writing and cheating.
