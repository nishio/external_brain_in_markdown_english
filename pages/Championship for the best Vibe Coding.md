Championship for the best Vibe Coding
> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1909088848526909859) I want to do [[V-1 Grand Prix]] for the person who is the best at [[Vibe Coding]]. Why don't you do it?
> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1909089433758138372) What tactics could be used?
>  I talked to @nishio and I still think it's a good idea to repeat [[voice instructions]] while summoning multiple [[Devin]] while checking for anomalies with [[eye grep]].
> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1909090375676932289) I think it's time to gather all the [[AI Surprises]] (including myself) and [[LLM Unemployed]] in one place and decide who is the best Vive coder. I think it's time to decide who is the best Vive coder.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1909096343379013746) [[Tenkaichi VibeCoding Budokai]] strategy, we both came to the same conclusion and laughed.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1909100027412369769) The details of my plan are: "First, summon [[horizontal widescreen]] on [[Xreal One]], then summon N Devins on it and control all their behavior without switching screens. Then, if necessary, we can intervene with voice or text. If we try to go beyond this, I think it will be necessary to entrust the entire control itself to AI, not to humans.
