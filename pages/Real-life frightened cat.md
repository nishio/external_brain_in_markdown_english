You want to hide behind the bar because you are afraid of humans, but in that position you cannot reach above the human's line of sight, so you become [[you think you are higher]] by turning upside down and becoming "higher from your point of view".

Often in humans, a phenomenon is observed in which a person who is inferior in [[axes of values]] X that others have, brings up the inverted [[reverse values]] axis X' and claims that "[[he/she]] is not inferior".
