[[Value range]] refers to the range of hands in which you can place a value bet, meaning that you have a strong hand and are in a position to make a strong bet.

It may be used outside of its original meaning.
- If you must not lose the game, you need a play that maximizes [[the win rate]], but (a),
- If you can afford to lose, it is beneficial (B) to play to maximize [[expected value]] rather than win rate
