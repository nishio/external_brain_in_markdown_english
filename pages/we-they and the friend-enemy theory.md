Friend-Enemy Theory" is a concept proposed by political philosopher Carl Schmitt, which states that the essence of politics lies in the distinction between "friends" and "enemies. Here, "friend" refers to those who share common values and goals, while "enemy" refers to those who have different values and goals that oppose them. By relating this theory to the linguistic representation of "[[we/they]]", we can understand how it affects social conflict and identity formation.

We/They" and the friend-enemy theory
The words "[[we]]" and "[[they]]" are pronouns often used to express intergroup conflict and identity in everyday speech and in political and social discussions. The word "we" refers to the group that includes the speaker himself/herself, while "they" refers to the group outside of it. The use of these terms is closely related to friend-enemy theory.

- Use of "we":.
    - By using "we," the speaker emphasizes a particular group, including himself or herself. This is useful in emphasizing the values, goals, or beliefs shared by that group.
    - For example, when saying "We need to stand up for our rights.", "we" indicates "friends" who share common goals and values.
- Use of "They":.
    - By using "they," speakers distinguish different groups from their own and indicate antagonism. This is often used to express hostility or distrust.
    - For example, when we say, "They are trying to take away our freedoms.", "they" represents "the enemy" and is portrayed as a threat to their group.

Friend/Enemy Theory and "We/They" Conflict
In "friend-enemy theory," the "we/they" distinction serves as a linguistic means of creating a clear distinction between friend and foe. This distinction is used to shape and reinforce political and social identities. It is especially evident in the following situations:
- Reinforcing [[group identity]]: The word "we" helps to reinforce unity and solidarity within the group. This makes it easier for group members to unite toward a common goal.
- [[Hostility]] of the external group: The word "they" is used to position the external group as the enemy. While this conflict strengthens internal group cohesion, it can also foster hostility and distrust of the external group.

Conclusion.
The use of "we/they" is closely related to the distinction between "friend" and "enemy" in friend-enemy theory and plays an important role in the construction of conflict and cooperation in social and political contexts. Distinguishing between friend and foe through language reinforces group [[identity]] and promotes internal cohesion, but it can also be a source of conflict. Thus, we can see that the use of language has a significant impact on social dynamics.

While [[subject omission]] in Japanese can refer to all people, doesn't the expression [[we]] in English implicitly assume the existence of [[they]] who do not follow that [[norm]]?

Indeed, the omission and use of the subject is different between Japanese and English, and the resulting connotations are also different.

Subject Omission and Universality in Japanese
- In Japanese, it is common to omit the subject, thus allowing statements to be made without a specific subject in mind. For example, in the expression "I must study," although the subject is not explicitly stated, it is understood as a general norm that "all people should study in that situation. By omitting the subject, a universal message can be conveyed without limiting the specific subject.

Implications of "We" and "They" in English
- In English, on the other hand, it is fundamental to specify the subject, and the use of the subject "we" makes the group (including the speaker) aware of the subject. In the case of "We should study," it indicates that a particular group, including the speaker, is insisting that he or she should study.
- Here, the use of "we" may implicitly assume the existence of "they". In other words, "we" may refer to the group to which the speaker belongs, and "they" may imply the existence of others who do not belong to that group. For example, saying, "We follow these rules" implies that "they (they) may not follow these rules.

Norms and Group Boundaries
- In Japanese, the omission of the subject can indicate a general [[norm]] that applies to the entire utterance and not a specific group or individual. The use of "we" in English can indicate a common norm or behavior within a group, while at the same time implying the existence of "they" who do not follow that norm.
- Thus, while expressions using "we" in English emphasize the actions and beliefs of a particular group, they may also assume the existence of those (THEY) who do not follow them. This difference is due to the difference in the use of the subject in Japanese and English and their cultural and linguistic backgrounds.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>One effective way to bring the universal expression of Japanese subject omission into English without distorting the nuance is to use "it" or "one" as the subject. This is because these pronouns are suitable for expressing general facts and norms in English.

When "It" is the subject
By using "it" as the subject, you can describe a general fact or situation without identifying a specific person or group. For example, when translating the Japanese phrase "If it rains, it gets wet." into English, "If it rains, it gets wet." can be used to describe it as a general phenomenon rather than a specific someone.

Example: The
- Japanese: "You should turn on the light when it gets dark."
- English: "It is best to turn on the lights when it gets dark."
Thus, the use of "it" can be expressed as a general norm or custom, not limited to a specific entity.

When "One" is the subject
Using "One" as the subject is also useful in indicating a general norm or custom. One" is used to refer to a person in general, not to a specific individual. This is appropriate when stating universal advice or general rules in English.

Example: The
- Japanese: "It is important to study."
- English: "One should study."
In this sentence, "one" is used to mean "anyone" rather than a specific person. Thus, the use of "one" allows for an expression that is not limited to a specific individual, but can be applied to a wide range of general situations.

Advantages of using "It" and "One"
The use of "it" and "one" allows English to retain some of the universal nuances of Japanese subject omission. It is possible to state general facts and norms without referring to specific individuals or groups, thus avoiding misunderstandings in communication.

This method allows abstract and universal expressions in Japanese to be conveyed naturally in English, and is very effective when you do not want to refer to a specific person or when you want to indicate a general norm.
