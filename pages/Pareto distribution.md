probability density function
$\frac{a/b}{(x/b)^{a+1}}$
- When b=1
- $\frac{a}{x^{a+1}}$
    - Taking the logarithm $\log(p(x)) = \log(a) - (a+1)\log x$
            - [[double-logarithmic graph]] to make a straight line
- expected value
    - $\frac{ab}{a - 1}$ (a > 1)
    - No convergence of expected values when a=1

    - [[power law]]
    - [[Zipf rule]]
    - The kth most frequent element in terms of frequency of occurrence is proportional to 1/k
    - This is because the domain of definition is discrete
    - Proportional to 1/k" corresponds to a=0, but in this case, the sum does not converge.
