title: "Many ideas come from forced simplification."
---

Argument that, compared to a Scrapbox-like tool that allows you to store things in a mesh-like structure, an outliner that enforces a tree structure can have a creative effect due to the effect of its constraints.
> >And importantly, there comes a moment when you have to courageously simplify the complex in order to output the outline as a final finished product (e.g., a sentence). This in itself has the effect of forcing and triggering thought.
>
>  In fact, I believe that much of what we call ideas come from this forced simplification. We say, "I understand a subject better when I put it in writing or explain it to others," because I have to force complex, intertwined information into a simple tree or linear narrative. In the process, information is digested and one's point of view is established. Outlines edited in an outliner facilitate that process by being a "fluid tree.
>
>  On the one hand, a mesh structure allows complex things to exist as they are complex. That may seem like a good thing at first glance, but in any case, the material may remain a material.
>
>  For example, if the primary purpose is to store information and retrieve it as needed, a mesh structure that can handle complex information in a complex manner may be superior. However, the effectiveness of an outliner as a tool for "writing and thinking," in other words, as a thinking tool, cannot be determined as simply as the Outliner naysayers would have it.
