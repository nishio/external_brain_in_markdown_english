> "There is no original [[abstinence]] teaching in [[Buddhism]], do you know why?"
> "Is it because Buddha denied asceticism in the Ascetic Forest?"
> "That's part of it, but it's also because in the old days, if you did things like abstinence and temperance because of the food situation and sanitary conditions, you would die. Abstinence was a pastime for the rich."
> I told him.

It is usually only after the world has become affluent. People start asceticism because they want to think that they are special religious dignitaries who dare to lead an inconvenient and painful ascetic life in an age of affluence. Celibacy is the quickest and easiest way to practice asceticism.

So many people who are celibate for the sake of superiority over others are cruel and terrible people. You see it in non-religious communities as well. People who say that because they're having a hard time, they're superior to others."

I'm not saying all of them are, but those who can choose an inconvenient and restrictive way of life are the rich or the powerful. That's why the Buddha hated asceticism and asceticism."
