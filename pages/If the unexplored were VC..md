Sometimes they miss, but I think they're pretty discerning, investing from a young stage in Japanese talent that wouldn't have been born if it weren't for Unexplored.
> [haruhikaru5](https://twitter.com/haruhikaru5/status/1634083775100624896) Mr. Ochiai, did you EXIT?
> [tanukiponkich](https://twitter.com/tanukiponkich/status/1634084846443319296) Unexplored is contractually outsourced, so it's not an investment. It is a government fostering project that is not even repaid like a scholarship. The operator doesn't get a penny even if it succeeds, and if it fails, it loses millions.
> [haruhikaru5](https://twitter.com/haruhikaru5/status/1634119578124156930) I only asked because of the expression "if it were a vc". I was just asking because there didn't seem to be any case of Mr. Ochiai creating a sustainable business as far as I have heard,
> [haruhikaru5](https://twitter.com/haruhikaru5/status/1634121165232017408) I have met several managers from Unexplored in the past, and while I have no doubt about the value of Unexplored and the contribution of the people it has produced to society, in the context of VC, I felt that Mr. Ochiai and the other two companies were a bit different. However, in the context of VC, I felt that comparing Mr. Ochiai with other two companies is a bit different.
