- For some person A, the relationship with X is of great value.
- B is more valuable to X than A.
- For B, the relationship with X is a bit negative

Trying to choose A or B in this situation [[choosing the wrong two options]].
- If you choose both and then there is a transfer of value from A to B that can be replicated.
    - For example, verbalizing and communicating knowledge.
- Tagging A with B can create opportunities for value creation
    - Creating this structure is meta value creation.
