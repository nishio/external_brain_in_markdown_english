Projects with and without deadlines
- Projects with deadlines force a dense experience in a short period of time.
    - It can broaden your perspective.
- On the other hand, once the deadlines are gone, [[the "important stuff" emerges from the network of things in the chain of things]].
    - I wrote a broad listening case study in kintone and [[UTAS-UMAP]].
- Both are important
- Perhaps this is my subjective and natural expression [["important things" emerge from the network of interconnections of things]], which sounds like a natural phenomenon, but I guess this worldview varies from person to person to begin with.
        - [[Ideas are natural resources]]
- There is a [[shared belief]] situation where I believe that if I keep me free, important things will emerge, and the president believes that he will get better results if he keeps me free.
    - When I see young people trying to figure out how to build a career, it's really a mystery to me how my situation was constructed.
    - Luck rather than intentionally constructed
    - But it wasn't all built by a single stroke of luck.
    - Like I kept making choices in a certain direction on the occasion of a lot of random events?
            - [[Value of Choice]]
            - [[planned contingency theory]]
- [[The illustrated guide to a Ph.D.]]
    - When the goal is to push the edges apart, the natural way to proceed is to do it yourself and observe the results.
        - I unknowingly take that way of life for granted.
        - I take it for granted that there are no written explanations.
        - but many people in the world want someone else to do it first and write an explanation
            - I rather take it for granted that the explanation is written somewhere in the book.
            - I haven't found myself an explanation."
            - The person who should be writing the commentary isn't."
            - There's an explanation in there somewhere, but they won't give it to us."
            - Oh no, I don't think any of them are the same.
        - I think it would be beneficial if there was an explanation of how Polis and TTTC work in a book like "The Technology Behind Broad Listening".
            - Considering who should write it, well, I think I'm one of the better options.
            - On the other hand, my time is limited and there are countless good things to do. When I think about it, it's not very high.
