When you put down a piece of some thought, put 🤖🔁 on it and the AI will develop it when you wake up tomorrow.
- What is the difference between this experience and putting it on ChatGPT right now?
- You seem to implicitly believe that the former is preferable, but why is that?
    - Could have something to do with [breadth first search

Right now it's "update those with 🤖🔁, don't update those without", but if you can [[Spaced Repetition update]], you can update any of them.
- Ruled by capacity on the part of humans.

- [[🌀Eugene Gendlin and Jiro Kawakita and Plurality]]

- [[Connect with Vector Search]]

- [[🤖 twist]]
- Explicit references remain because they are not summarized.

- [[Is this the end of the 🤖"public Scrapbox period"?]]

- [[🌀Once chaos is brought]]
I started chewing through what the AI wrote in bulleted form.
- I concretized "read" into "bullet points as output."
- However, this is not sustainable.
    - When I woke up in the morning, 22 AI output pages had come up, and the task of chewing them up into bullet points was burdensome
    - Reading past articles that AI has [[pointing at]] is quite informative
    - Capacity for thinking
    - [[If you change something and a problem arises, don't undo it, but change it further.]]
    - I think [[Spaced Repetition Update]] is the best way to do it, but it's a lot of work to implement, so I've changed it to "Randomly update up to 10 items" for now.

- [[🌀The Power of Words: Telling Experiences, Painting the World We Aim For]]
- Title at the moment: 🤖🔁The difference between "made" and "used".
- The story took a turn rather quickly into a different place than what I had envisioned.
    - [[derailing at high speed]]
- I think you should change the title.
    - Do you want the AI to come up with the title of the note itself?
    - [[Difference between "made" and "using."]]
        - [[Don't publish what you won't use.]]
    - This is Masui's statement, so I wouldn't go so far as to say "don't publish it".
    - Among the various announcements, there are two types of announcements: those that say "we made it" and those that say "we made it and are using it.
    - I thought there was a difference, so I threw that at the AI.

Now, the diary page is created by [[pin-diary-6]] with UserScript
- If the program writes to Scrapbox once a day, you could create a diary page there.
- To begin with, the diary page is now created at 24:00, but wouldn't it be more appropriate to have it created at 7:00 as well as the AI posts?
- Should the AI rather write on the diary page?
- Should the AI read the diary page?

We thought that AI should be able to proceed with its own thinking without the need for a human partner, but that may not be the case.
- I dared to leave it without interference to experiment with that, but it feels different.
- Should it still be a gradual decrease in frequency rather than a zero-frequency decrease?
- I started chewing through what the AI had written in bulleted form."
    - I'm not sure anything that doesn't do this is worth it.

As for whether the AI should read the diary page, just cut out the part you want it to develop and put a marker on it.
