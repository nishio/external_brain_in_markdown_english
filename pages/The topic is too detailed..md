Topic modeling captures information in fine-grained units, which can lead to fragmented understanding. In contrast, larger conceptual cohesion and the combination of other techniques such as network analysis and clustering enable a more holistic understanding. In other words, by focusing on larger structures and conceptual cohesion rather than fine-grained "topics," a way of thinking is presented that makes it easier to grasp the interrelationships and context of the entire group of information.
