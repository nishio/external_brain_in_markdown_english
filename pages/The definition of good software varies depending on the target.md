title: "The definition of good software varies depending on the target"

One-line summary: Depending on the development context and target, '[[良いソフトウェア]]'の定義や開発の方法論は変わる。<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>

> [kohsukekawa](https://twitter.com/kohsukekawa/status/1699821203941413032) I used to feel the same way when I was working on Java and related platforms at Sun, but after [[Jenkins]]. But after creating [[Jenkins]], this way of thinking changed, and deducing from it, I now think that what is reasonable for non-technical software (banking, insurance, etc.) would be completely different.
>  >yukihiro_matz: As far as I understand it, "[[small teams]]" and "[[good developers]]" are the most important factors to develop "good software", and it is an illusion that [[IDEs]] and [[static programming languages]] can fill those gaps. [[Dynamic programming languages]] do not provide that illusion from the start.
