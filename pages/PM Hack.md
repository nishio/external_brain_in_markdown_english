title: "PM Hack"
---

> The Unexplored Junior program received 105 applications in 2018, and it looks like there will be even more this year, so it would be interesting to see one PM hacker who researches the interests and preferences of PMs and other things in advance and catches one!

Interesting summary of each PM's reaction to this statement

Teramoto PM
> I'm not absolutely recommending it because it's an interesting story, but I'm willing to do it if you want to. I'm not sure if "hobbies and interests" necessarily match the criteria for adoption, but if past adopters cooperate, I'm sure the first round will pass.

> I think that if the project is selected as a project that is not "what I [[want to do]]", it will only make the weekly meetings and debriefing sessions more difficult.
- > Unexplored Junior is not a game where you get 500,000 yen if your project is accepted, so I recommend that you check the annual schedule and other details properly. If you choose a theme with the goal of being accepted, you will have a hard time executing the project afterwards. You will be happier in the long run if you think carefully about what you want to do.
- > "Long-term" means that adoption is not the goal, of course, and even the debriefing is not the goal. Often in the debriefing sessions, people talk about "[[Debriefing is not the goal.]], it's a start.

PM Ishii
> If you are too familiar with a field, you will naturally see things that you can't comment on, and it will be difficult to link this to the adoption of the project.
- > I think it's more appealing to play with [[My Strengths]], because it fits the PM's taste, but if you propose something that you don't know much about and don't really want to do, you'll see that somewhere.

Seki PM
> I think there is more weight on how the proposal should be explained rather than the trend of the ideas, and there may be a preference for that.
- > Writing may seem like a technique, but in order to write properly, it is necessary to think about what the idea is to solve and how far you can think about the issue as if it were your own through a solid survey and deep thinking. I think it is important to think about how far you can think about the issue as if it were your own.
- > This year, with the increase in the number of applications, the amount of time to avoid per-paper review will decrease more and more, so it is very important to be able to write a proposal. I think the second round will be tougher to see if you cheat in writing your proposal. If you can cheat that well, I think you are well qualified.
- > Even if the proposal is not well written, if it has [[passion]] and the passion is conveyed in the proposal, I think it will be understood. I honestly didn't know what @SoraSue77's proposal was about last year because it was all passion, but several people were interviewing him because they felt there was something in it.
- >  A series of tweets around here are about #UndergroundJuniors. I'm waiting for your application. After I finish my thesis, I plan to write a blog about how I have & will look at the review documents.
