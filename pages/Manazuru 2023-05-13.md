Manazuru inspection trip by [[Audrey Tang]]. I participated at the invitation of [[halsk]].

[[Manazuru]] is a town where "[[Beauty Ordinance]]" was created 30 years ago, based on [[Alexander's]] [[pattern language]].
[Manazuru Town - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/真鶴町)
- > The "Manazuru Town Development Ordinance" was enacted by the national government in 1993 and came into effect the following year. Article 10 of the ordinance, "Principles of Beauty (8 principles)" and "Standards of Beauty," as well as rules for development and construction, the role of the council, and the participation of residents are stipulated as part of the town development plan. This was a pioneering example of a national ordinance regulating urban development, and it was also an unprecedented case in which "beauty" was stipulated in a statute. The design guidelines (design code) of the "Principles of Beauty" refer to the ideas in "A Vision of Britain's Future: Reflections on Architecture" by Charles III, then Crown Prince of Wales, who was concerned that the once beautiful historical buildings of England were being demolished one after another. The "Ten Principles of Architecture" referred to in this book are considered as a hint for thinking, because they have a common universality for people living in cities, transcending country and time.
- Manazuru is 7km2
- Formed by volcanoes, the terrain is rich in variations
- Stone is an industry.
    - Advantage of proximity to quarry and port
- The old town is a narrow street, so [[building codes]] don't allow new construction.
    - New construction zone on the other side of the tracks.
- (beautiful) forest
    - > In 1661, the Odawara clan planted 150,000 pine seedlings over a period of three years, and since then, in 1905, the forest was recognized as a forest that protects and nurtures fish and designated as a fish-guarding forest. The site had long been managed by the national government from the Goryozan (forest under the control of the feudal lord of the shogunate) to Goryozan (forest owned by the imperial family) until it was transferred to the town of Manazuru in 1952.
    - >  The Manazuru Peninsula Nature Park was designated in 1954. Today, in order to preserve the forest in its present state for future generations, the following rules have been established: "Do not pick," "Do not burn," "Do not throw away," and "Do not step into the forest.

- Sandwiched between Atami City and Odawara City
    - [Resisting the Wave of Tourism
- The small size made it easy to share opinions.

Manazuru is short of water
- Self-supplied water sources are insufficient.
- They bought water from Yugawara.
- This is one of the concerns about turning the area into a tourist destination.
    - Fear of water cutoff, etc.
- Local fishermen opposed the forces that wanted to build a hotel and turn the area into a tourist attraction because they were concerned about the pollution of the sea.
    - So the cleanliness of the water or the sea was a [[public good (i.e. goods or services such as parks or highways)]].
    - Tried to prevent [[Tragedy of Common Land]] from being caused by tourist hotels

Q: Have there been any upgrades over the past 30 years?

- It was initially designed to be updated.
- However, "it was too well made [[and]] there was a reluctance to modify it.
    - It was taken as a kind of bible or constitution.
    - The key question is, "[[How do we]] update it?"

Manazuru's population is declining.
Will this be a problem for the [[aging]] population, with its many steep hills, etc.?
- Manazuru has a high [[aging rate]] but a low [[nursing care required rate]].
    - Related: [[Wako Model]].

I was happy to express that 'broad listening' is an augmentation of human ability, and it plays an important role for encouraging Plurality in Japan, whose culture values consensus.

> [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1657558187002961920?s=20): I got a new insight from her when I asked about the legitimacy. The insight that the switching cost decreases when social systems are built on the Ethereum platform was an eye-opener for me. I plan to write about this later on my Scrapbox.
- I asked about [[social inovation legitimates governance]]

I tried it myself and found that was not tasty at all. I wanted to convey that it's sweet non-alcoholic drink rich in amino acids,…
Japanese Explanation
- I had the opportunity to speak with Audrey Tan, Minister of Digital Affairs of Taiwan, and was able to convey my interest in [[broad listening]] as it can be interpreted as [[human enhancement]], and my belief that it will play an important role, especially in Japan, where [[consensus]] is important. I was able to convey the idea that [[broad listening]] could be interpreted as [[human enhancement]] and that it could play an important role especially in Japan where [[consensus]] is important.
    - (Added) I wrote more about it here: [[Broad Listening is Important in Japan, Where Air Rules]].
- I also asked her to elaborate on her statement about the legitimacy of governance, "[[Social innovation legitimizes governance]]," and she pointed out that if multiple social systems are built on the [[Ethereum]] infrastructure, [[switching costs]] will go down and people can choose "which social system they want to choose". I felt the scales fall from my eyes when he pointed out that if multiple social systems are built on the [[Ethereum]] platform, [[switching costs]] will decrease and people will be able to choose "which social system to choose" according to their will.
    - (Added) A little more detail below.
- Tip: "Broad listening" as written here is a general term for technology that helps humans understand the feelings of hundreds of other humans.

Difference between [[Decidim]] and [Polis
