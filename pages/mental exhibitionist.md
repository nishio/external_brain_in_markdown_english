I see what you mean.

    - [[Why publish your personal project?]]

Wearing a bathing suit at the beach is allowed, but wearing the same level of clothing on the street is considered overexposure.
The appropriate level of exposure is just a socially created standard somehow.

When I told my wife that I might be a mental exhibitionist, she said, "Are you that exposed?" She said.
He said, "I haven't exposed too much of my private life."
Wouldn't you?

What it says and what it doesn't say.
- The story of how he got shingles is written instantly.
- I've been taking pictures of my shingles twice a day and finding it interesting to see the changes, but I'm on the "not public" side of the line on the edge of whether or not to make this public.
- Why?

Is there a bias that would rather not expose the physical story?
