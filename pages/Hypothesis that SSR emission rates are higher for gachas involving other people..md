Something that is [[uncertain]], something whose outcome cannot be predicted in advance.
- He likens the act of "doing it" in life to "[[drawing a lot of money]]."
    - [[planned contingency]] says, "You'd better get messed up.
- So what kind of mess is best? then what kind of gacha is best?

Even shadow game gachas are "uncertain" and "unpredictable.
- Hypothesis that emerged
    - SSR emission rates are higher for gachas involving other people.
- another approach
    - Even in the best case scenario, the upper limit for a shadow gacha is not much.
        - Even if you drew all SSRs in a 10-round gacha, so what?
    - Very small considering the impact it has on our lives.
        - [[upside risk]].
