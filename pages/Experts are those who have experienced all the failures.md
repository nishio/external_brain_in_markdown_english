title: "Experts are those who have experienced all the failures"
---

>  A [[specialist]] is someone who has experienced all [[failures]]. All possible failures in a certain narrow area.
- [Niels Bohr - Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr)
    - An expert is a man who has made all the mistakes which can be made in a very narrow field.
    - As quoted by Edward Teller (10 October 1972), and A Dictionary of Scientific Quotations (1991) by Alan L. Mackay, p. 35

In the original, the modification of mistake is from the back, but in Japanese, it tends to be from the front.
- Translation: An expert is a person who has made all kinds of mistakes in a very narrow field.
- The important part is the "all failures" part.
    - But when juxtaposed with the larger phrase "in a very narrow field," "all" becomes less conspicuous.
- I understand the intent to make it stand out by making it bigger than "all kinds of things."
    - But this is going to have a stronger or weaker impact on some people.
    - If it were verbal, I could emphasize it with intonation.
- That's why I decided to split it into two parts in my translation this time
    - > An expert is someone who has experienced all the failures.
    - > all the possible failures that can occur in a certain narrow area.
