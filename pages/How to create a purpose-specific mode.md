What we made
    - [[Create ✅empathy writing mode]]
    - [[✅Create a mode of retrospective support]]
    - [[✅Make proposal support mode]]

way of making
- First we need to formulate the question.
        - [[The first question should be made with the expectation that it will be in the title of the log.]]
- What to do on the client side
    - Determine the key for mode identification
    - wrinkle out the first question by mode
- What to do on the server side
    - Import and register modules at the beginning of the media iterator in specialized mode and let it do the details for you.
    - Various definitions in individual modules
    - The state and question IDs are global values, but there is no need to save the range of IDs, and it would be troublesome if there were collisions, so we can reserve 100 or so and treat them locally by relative position from the first offset.
