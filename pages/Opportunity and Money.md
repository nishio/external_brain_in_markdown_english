from [/villagepump/opportunity/money](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/opportunity/money).
- Relationship between [[opportunity]] and [money (written before an amount)

margin for pasting together (e.g. two pieces of paper)
- Regarding [[the relationship between money and competence]], there was a discussion about using the terms "necessary and sufficient conditions" to classify competence.
- We see a problem with using this term "necessary and sufficient conditions" as a label for classification.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

- If you don't have A money, you won't be given the opportunity in the first place.
    - A money is a necessary condition for being given the opportunity
- B money is enough to give you the opportunity.
    - B money is a sufficient condition for being given the opportunity
- Opportunity is a necessary condition for competence
    - Some people don't have the opportunity to be competent.
    - You have to have the opportunity to be competent.
- Opportunities come and go for reasons other than money.
    - Personally, I think reasons other than money have more impact.
- It is not appropriate to treat "money" as if it were a binary entity like True/False when it is a quantifiable concept.
- There is not much utility in classifying opportunities by money when money is not the primary determinant of the opportunity
