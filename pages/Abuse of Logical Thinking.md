title: "Abuse of Logical Thinking"
---

- [[logical thinking]] has been abused in some cases

The naive belief that logic can [[foundation]] is false and
- Unclear if the axiom is correct.
    - [[infinite regress]]
(lessening the significance or value of the previous word) the likes of
- [[Munchausen's trilemma]]

This can be used maliciously to [[work-to-rule]] a project you want to delay

I can then use my discretion, which is not based on logic, to produce results and bring it to the logic of "[[Proof of competence through results]]". [[pragmatism]].

I thought these simple and harmful strategies would be easy to stop, but I'm surprised that people don't understand these [[relativization of correctness]] stories or are emotionally repulsed by them for some reason!

We are merely talking about such a system, dynamics....
