> "[[At the time,]] Mr. Emaya had started a [[mysterious social movement]] called "[[NAM]]" (New Associationist Movement). There was a mysterious community of people in social thought and philosophy, people in literature and music, and political activists, and I started hanging out there. They were going to produce a book called "[[NAM Generation]]" as a pamphlet for the movement, and [[Akira Asada]], [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]], and [[Ken Suzuki]], who would later found Smart News, were among the authors. As a junior high school student, I worked on the annotations for the book as a part-time job. I received 30,000 yen or 50,000 yen from the publisher, Ota Publishing, and that was the first job I ever got paid for when I was about 15 years old.
