A is good, B is better." repeated four times.
    - [[satisfaction]] It's good to know that you do, and even better to keep trying on top of it.

I've heard that there are people who interpret it to mean "I'm serious...".
- For example, there is an implicit conflict axis of "who wins and who doesn't win over others."
- On that oppositional line, you say, "It's better to be the one who wins over others," and then you say, "But it's even better to win over yourself."
        - [[dialectics]] So you're doing a transcendence of conflict in the sense of
        - Related: [[dialectic development]] [[False dichotomy]].

- In this context it reads to me "I don't care if the physical body outlives or not, it's even better to leave [[An idea that will not die out after death]]."
