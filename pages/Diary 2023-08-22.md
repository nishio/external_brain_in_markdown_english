Cybozu Lab Youth Camp Day 2

Go to bed at 9:00 p.m., get up at 2:00 a.m.
- The mistake of forgetting to turn on the air conditioner! Hot!
- Lobby...lounge...l...l...ah, living room.
- I was caught off guard because the air conditioner in the living room was on when I came to the room, but the air conditioner in the bedroom was not.

- [[🌀Successful intelligence]]
GPT4 generates the phrase [[Generating Situational Knowledge]] in
I like the phrase <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> and make it a Scrapbox link
At this point it was a red link because it was first published.
- Writing about [[teaching Buddhism through the use of dialogue]] reminded me of this phrase

- [[multi-head]] Implemented.
- All pages beginning with "🤖🔁" are subject to update

Good morning, this is Asahi.

I thought it would be updated while I was in the morning bath, but I forgot to push.

Oh, while I was trying to re-run it, I looked at the previous note [[🤖2023-08-22 07:07]] and found the content interesting and added to it.
[[🤖2023-08-22 07:27]] was made.

TODO
- ✅ [[multi-head]]
- ✅Overly open and close browser tabs
- ✅ Microformat AI_IGNORE
    - [[AI Observation Diary "Discomfort-Driven Intellectual Production"]] In summary.
    - I decided to let it continue for a while ✅.
- ✅ Read from local file and write to local file mode
    - Let them read books.
    - Read kintone export (NOT TODAY?)
    - [[Omoikane Study Group]] has yet to listen back to the oral conversation.
- Dare to lower the priority of responding back to the generated AI notes.
    - Reproduce situations with little human response
    - Concerns I'm thinking about now
        - If the original input is very small, there are more random chunks due to the fact that the vector search only takes the top 3 results, so if a human does not "pick up the parts you want to pay attention to", there is a possibility that the randomness will be bought and "the parts you want to pay attention to will disappear".
            - There are hands that change the amount of selection depending on the quantity.
        - Well, but I think it's good to make sure that "the part I want to focus on is gone and gone" and then state that "this part of the previous note is gone, but I think it should not be gone".
- ✅megane Inquiry done

- [[multi-head]] has two named, two unnamed, and one original main branch
- Since we can have an unnamed branch, don't we need a main branch anymore? I have a feeling we don't need a main branch anymore.
