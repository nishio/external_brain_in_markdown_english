title: "Few people understand and the response is not good, so they give up talking about it."

> [@daijapan](https://twitter.com/daijapan/status/1668220793287999490?s=20): There are surprisingly few interviews where top athletes tell the truth. They answer tons of questions about how they feel about competing, what was painful, how they overcame it, when was the moment they were happy, how they felt, etc. But what they were really holding deep inside, what they were conscious of, what technology they were using, etc. are all questions that are rarely asked in interviews. However, what they were really holding deep in their hearts, what they were conscious of, and how they were mastering their skills are rarely talked about. This is because there are few people who understand and the response is not good, so they give up talking about it.

>  It is difficult to come up with the truth unless we ask many times along the way, "If you were to use an analogy, would it be like this? Because what we do with our bodies is so complex and delicate, it is not often clearly verbalized. Therefore, it is necessary to go through a process of asking questions and using examples to gradually clarify the outline of what is happening.
>  Actually, it's more like [[a linguistic accompaniment]] than an interview.
