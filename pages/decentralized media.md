> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1651558801164894208) Can't we replace [[the media]] that doesn't report what it should do and only reports what it shouldn't and what it doesn't care about with a combination of [[Polis]] and [[Mastodon]] or something like that? I wonder if we could replace them with a combination of [[Polis]] and [[Mastodon]] or something...

I can see the logic behind it. I think what many Japanese will feel more is "Decentralized Massmedia," since they thought Twitter would replace it, but it didn't.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1651566764399165451) I wondered why this idea suddenly came to me, but in English conversation school today, we were talking about how Italy prohibits ChatGPT, but in a few days [[VPN]] is bypassed. It turned out that some people from China, which also prohibits access to some services, use VPNs to access services outside the country.

> I feel that it will be difficult to find a way to spread from a small number of people and that it will be a game of financial power with intervention by machines in the future. Is it possible to educate people about the competence that makes them want to acquire and disseminate information and is it difficult to do so unless it is publicly accessible?
