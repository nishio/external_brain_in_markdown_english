### digest
.
Lower costs cause changes in existing systems and structures. This is because the new cost structure makes possible what was previously unfeasible. However, lower costs do not necessarily mean lower quality. Also, from a cost perspective, it is important to balance the cost of getting things in and out with the cost of keeping things out. Furthermore, it is reasonable to decide whether to change things or not by comparing the advantages and disadvantages of each option.

### Relevance
.
The note "as costs go down, structure changes" has relevance to fragments such as "the cost of getting in and out and the cost of staying in and out" and "quality goes down as costs go down." These show how changes in costs affect system and behavioral choices.

### deep thinking
While lower costs create new possibilities, they are not always the best choice in terms of quality and efficiency. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation that takes into account not only cost but also quality and efficiency is necessary.
