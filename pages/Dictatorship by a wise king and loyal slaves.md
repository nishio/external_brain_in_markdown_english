title: "Dictatorship by a wise king and loyal slaves"
---

I [[decayed]] because humans ruled.
Because [[the communication channel]] to make it a big organization had to be human.
But if [[LLM]] gets to do it, the king's ideas can be spread to every corner (software-wise).

A [[dictatorship]] government of [[wise kings]] and [[loyal slaves]] ([[AI]]), possibly the most powerful [[form of governance]] to have appeared in history.

[[wise king]]'s [[governing]], usually [[successor]] no.
So [[make the successor an AI]].
Thus [[AI Dictatorship]] is born.
