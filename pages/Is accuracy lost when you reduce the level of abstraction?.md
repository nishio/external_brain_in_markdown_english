title: "Is accuracy lost when you reduce the level of abstraction?"
---

Some people claim that "when you reduce the level of abstraction, you lose accuracy," but that's a low-resolution perception.
    - [[All models are wrong.]]
    - Abstract descriptions of real events have less information from actual real events.
        - So [[accuracy]] is decreasing.
    - Increasing abstraction decreases accuracy.
- On the other hand, mathematical concepts are abstract in nature.
    - To illustrate with a concrete example, the "[[generality]]" that the original model had is lost.
        - The characteristic that a model can explain the behavior of a wide range of objects.
    - That's because more information leads to more restrictions.
- Some people confuse these two phenomena, even though they are two different things.
