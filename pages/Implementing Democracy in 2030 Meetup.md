- [[Implementing Democracy in 2030]].
    - Exclusionism and social fragmentation are becoming real themes in Japan in 2025.
    - At the same time, we are beginning to see the emergence of digital democracy and advances in AI-based dialogue and decision support.
    - The possibilities of how we can design society are certainly expanding.
    - This time, people who are active in politics and government, and people involved in technology and product development,
    - And people who are interested in solving social issues and designing new institutions gather together,
    - This is an event to envision the future with the theme of implementing "collaboration across divides."
- Contents
    - First half: Introduces the latest technologies and methods for creating collaboration, as well as practices that are underway in Taiwan, Israel/Palestine, Afghanistan, and other countries. While actually experiencing some demonstrations, we will organize the methodology of "how it is achieved" and examples of the prerequisites for collaboration.
    - Second half: Based on this premise, "If you were to think about it in your own surroundings or in Japan, what challenges would you face and what kind of vision would you aim for?" and shared them with other participants.
    - Bringing in each other's perspectives, we will draw more generalized patterns of collaboration.
    - Perspectives from diverse positions and experiences, as well as politics and technology, are essential here.
    - Bring your experiences and ideas and let's create a dialogue together to shape the future.
- Date: Sunday, August 17, 19:00-22:00
- Location: [[LabCafe]].
- Host: [[Hiiro Aoyama]] (Columbia University / Digital Democracy 2030)

    - [[What's missing from Broad Listening is a sense of acceptance.]]

- The conversation after we finished, "What was the result of TMG's Long-Term Strategy Broad Listening?" I asked, "It was newly established when I noticed that there was no 'tourism' category in the long-term strategy."[[Existing framework]] の問題に気づいて更新することができたのが実益の一つ」「面白い成果なのに公務員は前任者を否定できないからアナウンスできないんだな」に関する公開資料はこちらにあります<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - [[Shin Tokyo 2050 Broad Listening]]
    - A "welfare" category was added later in Team Mirai as well (I'll write an article about it soon).
    - I think one of the benefits of broad listening is being able to notice these kinds of "[[category]] oversights.
