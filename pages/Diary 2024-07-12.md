Fall asleep after dinner and wake up at 2:30

One person criticized the actions of others on social media, comparing them to Nazis.
I tried to get GPT to summarize it because, language aside, it might have something useful to say, but they refused because it violated their terms of service.
This is interesting.
- Is that what you want?
    - Actually, it might be good.
- When that kind of filter becomes widespread, people who post foul-mouthed posts on social media will be blocked before they reach others.
    - I'll be like a person spouting off on TV.
    - At least the online social space will be peaceful.
    - At this time, it is still considered ethically objectionable to speak out in a convenience store or on a station platform.
- In a boxing ring, you're allowed to hit each other.
    - Doing it in a convenience store or on a station platform is not allowed.
    - This is to be compatible
    - Similarly, there are social networking sites without content filters and those that do, and people can choose whichever they prefer.
            - [[Subjectivism doesn't force anyone to move.]]
    - If people want to get into a fistfight, they can get in the ring.
        - If you want to see a fistfight, go to the bleachers.
            - I can enjoy violence without risking being beaten myself.
        - If you don't want to see that kind of thing, you don't have to go.
    - If you have a fistfight on the street, the police will come.


[[Broad listening in practice]]


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1811774451933151515) I heard that the sale of election posters as advertising space has gone into the red, that the boycott campaign is having the opposite effect and is being bought and supported by the opposite side, and that in a world where radicalism tends to stand out, it is actually I felt that the world tends to be marked by extremism, but in fact it is more sane than it seems.

> [shinshoga](https://x.com/shinshoga/status/1811681603896377644) ★In response to the slander and vile boycott campaign against Iwashita Shin-Ginger, including its business partners, which was triggered by a single comment about the Tokyo gubernatorial election, many people said, "We would rather buy and support them! We would rather support them by purchasing our products! and the Iwashita Fresh Ginger Online Shop has received an unprecedented number of orders. On a normal day, we receive an average of about 30 orders per day, but on some days we received as many as 213 orders....

> [eutonie](https://x.com/eutonie/status/1811220390657831295) I have a book published by Mishimasha titled "Sankyu no Susume" (Recommendations from the Third Class). In short, it is a book about doing more than two things. When I was a high school teacher and Noh player, I asked my teacher Kaburaki if I could quit teaching and devote myself to Noh, and he was very opposed. He said, "I need more than two incomes so that I can quit when something absolutely unacceptable happens.
> [eutonie](https://x.com/eutonie/status/1811220393392513506) -> Keep it." Kaburaki was also a Shinto priest, and the day after the war ended, he witnessed his father, who was also a Shinto priest, commit seppuku. He thought, "This is not right! But, even if you think so, are you not forced into a situation where you have no choice but to do what is necessary for your livelihood, for your family, and for the sake of future generations? Politicians, the media, academics, and even entertainers.

>  It could be paraphrased as "human networking," but since the people ordering the work don't have any human networking in the field, they become sitting ducks for middleman exploitation.

>  I think that the presence of Ms. Audrey Tang in the center of politics, in addition to her own technical skills, has the advantage of preventing money from flowing to strange middlemen exploiting the middlemen.
> [Byucky](https://x.com/Byucky/status/1394538319812329474) According to a book about the man, he is completely intentional in his approach, and all the people Audrey Tan meets with are made public, so they can't lobby for their own personal gain. Radical Transparency. The very opposite of cutting out the middleman.

He said it's a three-day weekend.
I'll have to take a break from cleaning up the campaign over the three-day weekend and remind myself of the Plurality book.


> [si_te_interesa](https://x.com/si_te_interesa/status/1811727107132961264) At any rate, a quick calculation based on published and visible figures shows that about 1 in 10,000 Japanese women commit suicide per year, I've roughly calculated that one in every 10,000 Japanese women commits suicide per year, while one in every 20,000 commits suicide during pregnancy and within a year after childbirth.
>  In other words, it seems that women are less likely to die when pregnant.
>  >nhk_news: 118 women committed suicide during pregnancy and within a year of giving birth in two years

> [si_te_interesa](https://x.com/si_te_interesa/status/1811727480153407575) doesn't sound like what you mean.
> [si_te_interesa](https://x.com/si_te_interesa/status/1811930648560759261) I'm not making light of the anxiety of pregnancy or the stress of raising a child. I'm just a little annoyed that NHK is writing an article that may cause a rift with your partner at a critical time by making you anxious even though the numbers don't match your feelings.
> [naoto88](https://x.com/naoto88/status/1811952598787981795) NHK is just trying to stir up anxiety.
> [mr1aan](https://x.com/mr1aan/status/1811956199472136295) They're older people, so what's the point of comparing them if you don't compare them at about the same age? redo.
