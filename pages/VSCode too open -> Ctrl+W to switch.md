VSCode too open -> Ctrl+W to switch
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT-4/icon' alt='GPT-4.icon' height="19.5"/>When working with multiple VSCode windows open, it can be difficult to distinguish between each window in the Mac's [[Mission Control]]. If each window looks similar, it can be difficult to tell which window corresponds to which project.

- The command palette is a powerful tool in VSCode, . . On the Mac, it can be opened with Cmd + Shift + P. From there, the "Switch Window..." command can be used to move between open VSCode windows.
