This clipping video made me question Kohei Saito's statement.
> If you just cut out the second half of the sentence, "It's a dangerous idea to try to make things better with technology," it's a very messy discussion. It is important to discuss what makes things better and what direction is "good".

background
- Subjects:.
    - [Mr. Kohei Saito (economic thinker, critic of capitalism based on Marxism)
    - [[Yusuke Narita]], assistant professor at Yale University, economist, and frequent high-profile media commentator
- Program: "[[Sunday Japon]]" (TBS affiliate, information variety program broadcast every Sunday from 9:54 to 11:30)
    - The broadcast on Sunday, February 16, 2025 is most likely applicable, but we assume that the discussion spread on social networking sites on February 17-18, 2025.
- Topic:.
    - Although the specific agenda is unknown, it is possible that Saito's [[Marxist]] viewpoint and Narita's [[libertarian]] position were at odds.
    - Discussions on the future of technology and capitalism are expected.

Evaluation of Kohei Saito
- Positives: Positives.
    - Voices of support for statements and stances (e.g., "Well said," "Your words have weight").
    - He is highly regarded for his educational background (Free University of Berlin, etc.) and his rarity as a young Marxist debater.
- Negatives: I am not a fan of the hotel.
    - He criticized their ideology and background, calling them "peace-loving" and "Marxists from wealthy backgrounds."
    - He called them "ignorant of the hardships of ordinary people" and "dishonest."
Evaluation of Yusuke Narita
- Relatively Positive: I am very satisfied with the quality of the product.
    - He was described as "smart" and "worldly."
- Negatives: I am not a fan of the hotel.
    - He pointed out the difference in competence, saying, "His words have no weight," and "I can't compete with Mr. Saito."
Comparison of both
- Many believe that Saito overpowered Narita (e.g., "Narita is the frog staring at the snake").
- The predominant view is that Saito is superior in terms of scholarly achievement and depth of discussion.

Reaction to the idea/program
- [[Marxism]]:.
    - He was positive, saying, "Young [[Marxists]] are valuable."
    - Negative: "[[Socialism]] is outdated."
- San Japo:.
    - While appreciating Saito's efforts, some commented that it was "too difficult" and "uncomfortable.
- Other Comments
    - Critics say that "both sides are dangerous" and "leave the public behind."

Overall Impression
- Split opinion: Reactions polarized according to whether they support Saito's Marxism or not, and according to Narita's media exposure and sympathy for his ideology.
- Reception of the discussion: It was questionable to what extent the highly technical discussion was conveyed to San Japo viewers, with some segment of the audience finding it "esoteric" and "unhelpful.
- Attention: The confrontation between the two sides became a constant topic of conversation on social networking sites, with a lively exchange of opinions on both sides of the issue.

> "It is grotesque that the richest man in the world would make such arbitrary decisions against the poorest people in the world."
> "Narita-san is partially responsible. He is spreading [[techno-libertarian]] in Japan," he said, pointing out that it is a dangerous ideology.
> I'm glad you said that in front of him.
> As expected of Mr. Kouhei ♡.

Speaker A: "They are quite angry with the President and Mr. Eron."

Saito: "No, exactly, I am a socialist, so if I were in the U.S., I would be on the oppressed side, but I really think it is grotesque that the richest man in the world makes such arbitrary decisions for the poor people of the world. I believe that Mr. Narita is partially responsible for this, and that the current inefficient and wasteful government could be better if it were reformed by, for example, utilizing AI, which is very popular in the U.S. right now, but in Japan, Mr. Narita is spreading the idea and is called a "[techno- In Japan, Mr. Narita is spreading this idea, which is called "[[techno- libertarian]]," and it is the idea that human rights and redistribution are unnecessary because it is inefficient and favors those who are capable.

Narita: "There might have been a little."

Saito: "There was that trend, and I think we need to change that."

C: "Even before Trump showed up, you had already seen a bit of a trend of large corporations leaving global metro areas since Biden."

Saito: "Yes. I think it's about bringing it back together, but I think what's coming out this time is a very dangerous idea that really capable people are trying to abolish those ideas and promote reform through technology, because the current ideas of diversity and so forth are getting in the way."
