> [kentaro](https://x.com/kentaro/status/1647770907581239299) I can sympathize with you about being in your 40s and not having any great strengths, like insecurity, but on the other hand, no matter how old you are, as long as you live your life in comparison to others, your insecurity will never go away. No matter what age you are, you can do [[what you believe is right]]. If you don't have that, then the essence of the problem is not your age, but your failure to cultivate [[values]].

However, it is common for people to internalize what others are comparing themselves to as their own comparisons, and because of this, it is necessary to be aware of this.

> [kentaro](https://x.com/kentaro/status/1647868644632981504)[I have told you many times that you will be plagued by insecurities that cannot be resolved because you have not been raised with enough sense of values. I don't mean to imply that you should just stick to yourself. I have talked about this in a little more detail using the following slides.
- [Live Your Own Life - Live for Fun and Develop Your Values / Live Your Own Life - Live for Fun and Develop Your Values - Speaker Deck [https://speakerdeck.com/kentaro/live-your-](https://speakerdeck.com/kentaro/live-your-) own-life-live-for-fun-and-develop-your-values]

> [tmtysk](https://x.com/tmtysk/status/1647902986428121088) "The problem is not age, but the failure to nurture values. I saw the slides for the first time. I also wondered if it is possible to foster confidence in order to nurture values, and if those around them can be involved in that way.

[[Comparison with others]] is the source of [anxiety
