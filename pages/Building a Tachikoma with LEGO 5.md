This is great. It's stable.

- The [[Tile 2 x 2 - Center Stud]] was only available in green, and the bar and dish were only available in white, so the color is wrong, but that will arrive tomorrow!

- [[G Curve Top]] fits just behind the head.

- A [[clip bar]] grows out of a hole in the side of the [[side stud block]], and the clip bar serves as both a [[T-pipe]] holder and a stick to be held by the [[tile clip]].
    - [[Side Stud - Clip Bar - Clip]]
    - [[Side studs - Clip bar - T-pipe]]

The T-pipe uses [[center stud]] and [[open stud]] to form a [[Recessed studs - Open studs - T-pipe]] pattern.
