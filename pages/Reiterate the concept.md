title: "Reiterate the concept"
---

In my [[Personal Projects]], [[Readers are their own]], so it is difficult to create a page for explanations of what I already know.
- When I'm visiting someone else's personal project, I don't create many new pages in the first place.
- I don't "not make it at all" in my personal projects.
    - At what kind of time do you make it?

- Scrapbox was created for the first time in [[2021 Unexplored Junior]], including adopters.
- I've created quite a page of explanations here.
- Why?

what kind of thing
- Having made so many of them, I'm starting to see common patterns.
- What's in it for you.
    - Exact name title
    - Brief description
    - External links to sources to look at if you want to know more

> When do you make it?
- I still think he's conscious of what others see.
- In writing, he seems to think, "This part here refers to a specific concept rather than the literal meaning, but that may not be conveyed."
    - The "not getting the message" is a way of thinking that assumes information is communicated.

Why did I make it all up in the unexplored Junior Scrapbox?
- After all, "I can't get through to you.
- I think "immer" doesn't convey the same message as "I use immer" or "I like immer too".
    - If it's a push-off style, it's "of course you should Google the words you don't know," but the atmosphere is a bit friendly.
- In some cases, the words aren't used correctly.
    - Call it "Firebase Hosting" and "Firebase" or
    - Cloud Firestore" is called "Firebase," and so on.
    - Netlify" becomes "Netfly" and so on.

Why did this suddenly climb into my thoughts?
- Perhaps when I considered machine translating the entire Scrapbox project, I felt that a lot of things just didn't "come across" in the translation.
