> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1682965972188282880?s=20): Ishiyama once criticized that we tend to use generative AI for questions and searches instead of using it for generation, and this is a good book for those people! Hey, the story about having ICESTORM created against FIRE is really interesting ðŸ¤£.
