title: "Is the next development a network connection or a solution to the in-drag full-size display problem?"
---

summary
- Q: Should Movidea's next development be a network connection or a solution to the problem of displaying full size while dragging?
- A:
    - One line answer, "the ability to put data in the cloud."
    - The issue of the full-size display while dragging is personally weird, but a commitment to artistic perfection.
        - It may be over-quality and should be shown to users and their reactions observed.
    - Network connectivity feature creates a "stickies are in the cloud" situation.
        - The essential function of stationery is that "what you write does not disappear."
        - So I'll make it quickly.
    - The one we'll do tomorrow is the network connection function.
        - Create a state where you can say, "The sticky note data is in the cloud."
        - In past versions, the state of not connected was expressed as "Not connected". This is an expression that does not capture the essence
        - The appropriate phrases are "data is in the cloud" and "data is only locally available."
        - Stop calling it "network connectivity."
- consideration
    - An example of being faced with two development tasks and wondering which one to prioritize.
    - I decided to consult with Keicho, who is much better than a coin, and decided to make a decision rather than wasting time on hesitation.
    - I found that one task was the creator's commitment to the naturalness of the appearance.
    - I called the other task by its technical aspect, but I found it to be more essential.
    - This organization changed the name of the latter task, and the balance of priorities was broken down so that we could confidently choose what to do next.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>This time, a literal drag realized using the browser's DragDropAPI
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "DragDropAPI" is that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Browser's standardized functions to realize dragging, the browser does the work of displaying the object being dragged, etc.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "realization" is that "realization"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Hmmm...the look in drag, I guess.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>To achieve the appearance of moving stickies as naturally as possible. Now, I feel that it is not natural that the display of the object being dragged is in its original size.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between that "drag" and "realize"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Dragging is a moving operation, and what is realized is the appearance of that moving operation.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is that "drag" the same as "realize"? Is it different?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>not match the correct (answer, etc.)

- >  Drag is the operation of moving, and what is realized is the appearance of that moving operation.
- Is there anything else you can tell us about this "make it happen"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Some of the requirements have been clarified, so it can be achieved without using DragDropAPI, maybe it can be achieved better.

- How do you know this "make it happen"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I feel "realized" when I no longer have a point of concern.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is that "make it happen"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's in me. I guess my ideals are too high.

- Where is this "realize"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I think "when I no longer have a point of concern" is artful. Maybe it should be "if the user finds it inconvenient."

- How do you know about these "stickies"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I'd like to dig into the cloud storage story, not that one.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "cloud" is this "cloud"?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The user does not have to do anything, and saving is started in the background when the placement of stickies, etc. is changed.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen with regard to those "stickies"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Operations on stickies should be rewindable.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to the "stickies" for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>(This is a mixed bag of Undo stories.)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Must be able to detect changes in React state updates that are subject to Save or Undo
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>As for "sticky notes," can you do that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Since destructive updates are prohibited from a React perspective, it should be possible to detect it just by looking at the object identity regarding the sticky's state, which can be done with a hook. I think I did something complicated in an earlier version, but I don't know what it was for...
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where do these "stickies" come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>(I just checked and there is a function running every 3 seconds that checks to see if it has been updated and calls save when it has. That's an update rate limit.)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>(I remember, you're supposed to only send local changes because the save process shouldn't run when the collaborative editing is updated with information from the server.)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>In other words, stickies can be created by local updates, or updates from collaborative editing can come from the cloud. If you just want to save them, the former is fine, but if you want to make collaborative editing an option, the latter is necessary.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where are those "stickies" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Can we do away with co-editing for now? I thought about it, but in that case, it would be sad if the server has the latest version and I edit the old one and overwrite it, and if I say, "The new one is on the server, I'll reload it," then updates via the server will still occur. So, we need to take care of server updates regardless of whether we actively promote co-editing or not. I want to eliminate the situation where stickies are only at hand as soon as possible and make them "in the cloud". To prevent them from disappearing.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between that "sticky" and "realize"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>(In summary, the issue of displaying full-size stickies while dragging is personally unpleasant, but we should show it to users and observe their reactions because it is our commitment to artistic perfection, and the network connection function is an essential function of stationery that "stickies are in the cloud" and "what you write will not disappear", so we should quickly create it. It is the network connection that we will do tomorrow.)
