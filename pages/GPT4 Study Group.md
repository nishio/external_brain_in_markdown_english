After the fun "playing with GPT4" party on Discord broke up, I looked on Facebook and saw a post that said "GPT4 is hyped up to be great, but it's not good at all," and I felt like "ahhh" because it was a bad prompt to see.
If you don't learn how to use any tool, you can't use it well and it won't add value. ([Tweet](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1636043893354668033?s=20))

There are people who try a lot of things and only post what works on Twitter, and then there are people who see it and spread the word "I can do this, oh my God, it's amazing" without trying it themselves, and there is a composition that tends to [[expectations are excessive]]. That does not mean that zero expectations are correct. We need to learn the right expectations and how to use them to create them.

There was a "ChatGPT chat session where 2-4 people who pay for ChatGPT share multiple screens at the same time on Discord, and more than a dozen people watch and chat with each other. It was a very good [[knowledge exchange]] place.

> After a fun GPT4 event in Discord, there was a Facebook post that said "GPT4 is no good". It was poorly used. You can't use a tool well if you don't learn how to use it correctly, and many people feel "wow" when they see examples of successful use on Twitter, but expectations should be held appropriately. At the Discord event, we all shared our successes and failures and had a good knowledge exchange.

    - Some people try a lot and only post what works on Twitter.
    - This is not sharing failures, only successes.
    - People who don't try it for themselves misperceive the probability of success as high.
    - Many people spread information in a misguided way and have excessive expectations.
    - It's not correct to have excessive expectations without using it, and it's not correct to use it in a messy way and have bad results and underestimate expectations (Tweet 1).
    - We need to learn the proper expectations and how to use them to create them.
    - A concrete example of how to learn this is (Tweet 3)
