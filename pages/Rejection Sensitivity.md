Rejection sensitivity (RS) is a cognitive-emotional trait that makes people anticipate "I might be rejected," hypersensitive to social cues, and prone to overreacting to real or imagined rejection.

contents
- Process (typical)
    - Anxious anticipation: "I will be rejected.
    2. hypervigilance: overdetection of ambiguous cues as signs of rejection (attribution of hostility)
    - Reaction: avoidance, pandering, self-deprecation, or anger → reactive aggression
- Subtype
    - Anxious RS: Atrophy, excessive consideration, testing behavior
    - Anger-type RS: Damaging Interpretation → Blame, sudden counterattack
- Measurement (representative)
    - RSQ (Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire) system:
        - Synthesized and averaged "how anxious" x "how much rejection is anticipated" for each situation (adult version, child version, romantic situation version, etc.).
- Different from what?
    - Attachment anxiety/avoidance: style of overall relationship expectations; RS is oversensitive to situation evaluation; RS is not sensitive to the situation; RS is not sensitive to the situation; RS is not sensitive to the situation.
    - Justice sensitivity: hypersensitivity to injustice (violation of norms of others); RS is hypersensitive to being rejected by oneself.
    - Neurotic tendency: general instability of emotions, RS is trigger specific of rejection.
- Related Outcomes (Trends)
    - Internalization: social anxiety, depression, isolation
    - Externalization: anger, reactive aggression, relational friction
    - Vicious circle: self-fulfilling loop where behavior caused by fear of rejection leads to actual rejection
    - It is discussed as an aggravating factor that can amplify interpersonal stress in ADHD and ASD.
- Direction of intervention (e.g.)
    - Training in reevaluating interpretations: don't assume that ambiguous cues = rejection
    - Attention Bias Modification/Metacognition/Mindfulness
    - Interpersonal exposure (safe and gradual) and emotional regulation skills (e.g., DBT)
    - Reduce "uncertainty" by clarifying feedback and developing notice rules (school/workplace)

Terminology note: Difference from RSD
- RSD (Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria) is a label for strong distressing experiences used in clinical and party circles, and RS is better developed for academic operationalization and measurement. It is easier to distinguish and organize them according to use.
