I discussed how "[[Monetary Capital]] disappears when used, [[Knowledge Capital]] does not disappear even when used, and [[Social Capital]] requires skillful use but can increase if used well." Let's delve deeper into how to use this social capital. #MoneyDisappearsWhenUsed

- When there is demand D and supply S, an intermediary M who knows both can create value by connecting them.
- In the case of product transactions, M corresponds to the market.
- In such cases, products are separated from producers and circulate independently.
- However, knowledge, especially in the sense of problem-solving ability rather than information, cannot circulate independently of people.
- Similarly, for various reasons, the demand from the demand side often cannot circulate independently of the demander.
- Therefore, there are types of transactions in the world where neither a market where "suppliers display products for buyers to purchase" nor a market where "demanders post job offers for suppliers to apply" can be used.
- Just as markets create value by facilitating product transactions, providing facilitation for such transactions also creates value.
- In this context, intermediary M acts as a supplier by providing [[Matching]] value.

    - If the system is designed so that intangible capital accumulates with M as compensation for providing that value, a positive feedback loop will likely occur.
    - The current concern is what those conditions are and how to design them.
    - It is a necessary condition that the happiness of both parties increases after the transaction between D and S occurs.
        - If the transaction does not lead to a good result, trust in intermediary M decreases.
        - Therefore, introducing any S to D lowers D's trust.
        - Conversely, introducing a not-so-good D to S lowers S's trust.
        - Hence, M must strive for [[Careful Selection]] and [[Filter]] out unsuitable participants.
