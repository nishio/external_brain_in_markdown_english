title: "Update Interval of AI Notes"
---

2023-08-31
- In the early days of [[AI writes research notes daily]], each note was updated once a day.

Then, a number of notes could be run in parallel, 22 updates per day.

This was an overload for humans, so we decided to limit the number to 10 per day
- This resulted in indefinite intervals

On the other hand, it is often run directly from the command line with a URL specification
- This is one run now.

There is a feeling that we are not catching the real needs.

Does something that has been executed once really not need a second execution?
- often want to do

Is it really correct to specify the number of sheets and indefinite spacing?
- There's no guarantee that your new loop will be processed tomorrow morning.
- Some want it to be once a day, and some want it to be a little less intense so they can extend the interval more?
    - If you think it's too much, use it.
    - Explicitly switch?
- The use case of "think as much as you can before you go to bed, leave the rest to AI, go to bed, and wake up to find that new developments have occurred" is no longer feasible.
    - In this case, it does not have to be multiple days in a loop
    - One time.
    - Due to the fact that the title cannot be rewritten on import, the style of state management with specific characters in the title will not work.

Maybe even a day is too short.
Longer term.
Grows in a way that engages newly related fragments as they emerge.
If so, wouldn't the timing of growth be when the closest fragments appear?

If it is a long term mode, why not just let it sleep until a closer fragment is discovered?
To do so, the proximity of the fragments used must be written in [page memory
