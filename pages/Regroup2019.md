Learning at [[Regroup]] in 2019
- Forcing the entry of a front sticky when grouping is not a good idea.
- Difficult to design UI to match that height when the keyboard is out on the phone.

Code name for the development of tools to improve intellectual productivity

Q: What ideals do you hope to achieve by creating ReGroup?
- Strengthening one's intelligence
- 2018 note: [[ReGroup2018]] called it a KJ method support tool, which is not appropriate.
    - Because I am not interested in following the original KJ method procedure.

Q: What exactly do you mean by "strengthening one's intelligence"?
- The KJ method has been very instrumental in strengthening my intelligence.
    - The effect of "disappearing" by writing out
    - Increase in working memory capacity by expanding
    - Compression and chunking effects of bundling with faceplates
- On the other hand, overworking them to the limit has revealed some problems.
    - We can go further by creating tools to overcome this.

Problem 1: High cost of preparing sticky notes
- status quo
    - Handwritten on paper sticky note
    - Slides printed and cut at 25up.
- ideal
    - Digital data should be reusable.
    - Writing out against a paper sticky note would not be so convenient if it were digitized, but the fact that it is paper makes it difficult to reuse it.
- I want to reuse something I've made before.
    - What ever you make = not limited to sticky notes.
        - Rather, there is a greater need for slides.
- solution
    - import
        - My output
            - Slide PDF
            - Scrapbox
            - Past Writings
        - I want to swallow other people's output too.
            - Other people's Scrapbox
            - Book PDFs are also imported in a messy way just by putting them in.
            - Making leverage memos is even better.
                - Merge with [Incremental Reading
    - Discovery support from imported
        - search (e.g. for someone using a search engine)
        - sweet potato search
        - Similar Suggestions
            - Depends on the proximity of the KJ method.
                - KJ method is 2D vector annotation
            - I can get information on whether you used the suggestions on the map or not.
                - Active learning cycle goes around

Problem 2: Poor list ability.
- Limitations of desk space
    - Physical stickies cannot be scaled
    - Cannot occupy a desk indefinitely.
    - Cannot carry a desk
    - Preparation and cleanup costs
        - [[Metaphors for shifting viewpoints]]
- Cost of sorting
    - Just physically lining them up eats up a lot of time.
    - Not easy to try "different orderings."
    - Bound to a certain order.
    - Digitize it and you can switch in an instant.
    - Can be presented incrementally.
            - [[Suggested additions to make a nameplate when the sticky notes are enormous.]]

Problem 3: Poor access to physical "bundles"
- High cost of physical manipulation of "bundling" and "opening bundles."
    - It's beneficial, but the cost is too high to do it.
- Bundling" is essential to transcending cognitive limits.
    - Benefits of "compression
- Digital folding required

confluence (of rivers)
- Can you join the leverage memo review system?
    - Leverage memo is a sticky note
    - Keep a link to the citation
- Can you join the motivation checklist?
    - A bunch of questions to convert tasks into "motivational units"
- Can you join with clean chatbot?
    - A System of Inquiry."
- Can you join up with the speed leader?
    - Each page of the book is a sticky note

- [[Sticky notes are immutable.]]
