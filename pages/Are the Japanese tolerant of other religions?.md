title: "Are the Japanese tolerant of other religions?"

Munemasa Horie, "Are the Japanese Tolerant of Other Religions?" graph is dominated by the opinion that "Japanese people are intolerant," but the majority of Japanese respondents answered "I don't know," and it is inappropriate to create a graph ignoring this opinion.

I was surprised at how bad it is as a statistical inference. First of all, just by looking at this graph, I can tell that it is arbitrary, since the y-axis is not aligned and all the answers to the questions are not written,

For example, if 90% of the respondents answered "I don't know" and 10% answered "I trust them", it would be strange to come to the same conclusion. In fact, except for "I trust them a little," the percentages do not change that much.

It's a mystery how you would answer that question if you are not a believer. The graph reflects this.

Creating a graph that exaggerates the results by cherry-picking convenient responses while withholding all responses is nothing short of research misconduct. It is at the level where even undergraduates would call it out and make an issue of it, rather than making it inadmissible.
