title: "Upside Maximization Game"
---

> [kubotamas](https://twitter.com/kubotamas/status/1788932682799632845) VCs should take to heart Dr. Vinod Khosla's words, "I only have [[upside]] in investing because I am prepared to [[take a total loss]] when I invest. I only have [[upside]] in investing because I am [[prepared to lose all my money]] when I invest. If [[a venture investment]] fails, you only lose one times your principal, but if it succeeds, you get a return of dozens or hundreds of times your principal. The heart of venture investment is this [[asymmetry]], which is essentially a game of [[upside maximization]] rather than [[risk management]].

> [kubotamas](https://twitter.com/kubotamas/status/1788932893802430787) "The same day I founded Sun Micro, I founded another company and that one failed badly. But while the world knows about my success at Sun, no one knows or cares about my failures; as the first investor in OpenAI, I have made billions of dollars in profits, but behind the scenes I have made many failed investments of millions of dollars. Failure is not a factor in venture investing, I don't care about risk. Maximizing success is the most important mater."

Introduction:.
- [[Vinod Khosla]] talks about the 20-year transition of his venture capital firm, Khosla Ventures.
- The team has changed little, with David Weiden and Samir Call working together since 2006.
- The company's mission is to provide "venture assistance" and is not simply an investor.

Transitions and team dynamics over the past 20 years:.
- Khosla Ventures' particular approach is "venture assistance," helping entrepreneurs develop strategies and recruit talent.
- Vinod often does not attend regular board meetings because of inappropriate advice.
- Team members are flocking to Khosla because they share the mission and are making bold investments such as [[OpenAI]].

Long-term investment and impact:.
- Khosla invests in long-term, high-impact areas such as environmental technology and believes that returns will follow as a result.
- They will focus on tackling the big problems that have technical solutions, and they are willing to be [[unpredictable in timing]].

- [[contrarian bet]] :
- It is important to bet on ideas that no one else believes in and to stick with them for the long term.
- Investments in OpenAI and Fusion were heretical at the time, but Khosla continues to pursue them.

Cryptocurrency Strategies and Real World Applications:.
- Khosla focuses not on the speculative aspects of cryptocurrencies, but on real-world applications, such as building 5G networks with helium.
- The company has a policy of complying with regulations and avoiding unauthorized use.

Venture Assistance and Team Building Insights:.
- Keith Rabois returns to Khosla because of his passion for working with entrepreneurs.
- Khosla has developed empathy from his own entrepreneurial experience and offers sometimes harsh advice.
- General board advice is often off the mark.

Advice Criteria:.
- Advice should be sought from those who have experience in launching multiple billion dollar companies.
- We should hire people who can think from [[first principles]], not from existing industries.

Investment Strategies and Learning from Failures:.
- Venture capital is asymmetric risk taking [[trade-off between small losses and large profits]].
- Khosla has experienced more failures than anyone else, but the great successes have more than made up for it.

Global Fund Strategy and Technology Impact:.
- Rather than aiming to be the world's largest fund, Khosla focuses on the economic disruption and social impact of technology.
- The company is actively investing in areas where future breakthroughs are expected, such as AI, robotics, and climate change.

How people work and the role of AI:.
- Over the next 10 years, AI is projected to increase GDP growth from 2% to 4%, freeing people from monotonous work.
- Education is changing not to obtain a job, but to exercise creativity and pursue one's passion.
- [[AI increases the maldistribution of wealth]], but the political system should be able to correct that.

Personal philosophy and longevity in venture capital:.
- Khosla pursues his passion based on [[intrinsic motivation]], not [[others' expectations]].
- Even though he is over 60 years old, he is passionate about [[transforming social infrastructure]], which he says he enjoys more than golf.

Throughout, Khosla emphasizes the importance of a long-term perspective, a contrarian approach, and intrinsic motivation, while looking ahead to the massive social transformation that AI will bring.
