## summary of notes
.
A discussion of programming for "systems built by humans and computers."

## Relation to Fragment
.
It is associated with the fragments "implementation by natural language," "human + computer = augmented human," and "artificial language called programming language." These share the idea of humans and computers working together to build systems.

## deep thinking
Programming systems in which humans and computers work together enhances human intelligence and opens up new possibilities. To do so, however, it is necessary to bridge the gap between natural and programming languages.

## summary of thoughts and title
.
The construction of systems through human-computer collaboration will lead to enhanced intelligence and new possibilities. To this end, it is important to bridge the gap between natural and programming languages.
