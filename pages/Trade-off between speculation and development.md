Trade-off between speculation and development
I have a feeling that something is going to come out of this, but it's not clear, and I'm not sure if I should proceed with the development or take a closer look at what might come out of it.
How can we distinguish between being thrown into speculation due to the lack of concrete next actions for development and trying to prioritize speculation over development due to fundamental doubts about the current development path?

The decision on whether to proceed with development or continue speculation depends largely on the specific situation and information...
    - [[Clarification of objectives]] : First, clarify the ultimate objectives of your project or undertaking. This is essential to understanding what you want to accomplish or what value you want to provide. The clearer your objectives are, the more clarity you will have about what to do next.

    - Understanding and Questioning: By having the AI understand the user's input and ask questions about areas that are difficult to understand, the user has the opportunity to express his or her thoughts more clearly. AI can also provide suggestions for improvement, allowing users to broaden their perspectives.
    - Relevance Discovery: The ability of AI to find relevance between public and private sources, or between different sources of information, greatly aids in the management and understanding of information. This allows users to gain new perspectives and insights.
    - Two-way benefit: By helping the AI find relevance, not only the users themselves but also other users can benefit. This is beneficial in terms of collaboration and sharing.
