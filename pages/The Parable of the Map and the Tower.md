title: "The Parable of the Map and the Tower"
---

    - Without [[Map]], I'm lost.
- The perspective of walking down the street is a very low perspective
- Map is a very high viewpoint
- It's a high perspective, so you can't see what you can see from the perspective of walking down the street.
    - You can't even notice a flower blooming on the side of the road, or that the road is impassable due to an accident, etc.
- On the other hand, the perspective of walking down the street is too much information? It's confusing, it's wrong.
- Maps are useful
- But maps are only for places well known to mankind, and when you are about to explore a new place, you will not be given a map of that new place.
- You need to climb as high as possible, such as a tower, to broaden your vision and make your own map.

- If you have a map, it would be beneficial to use it.
- If you don't have a map, you need to make one.
- If there is a tower to map, it is beneficial to go up to it
- If you don't have a tower, you need to build one.
