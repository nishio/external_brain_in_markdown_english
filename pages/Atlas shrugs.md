"[[There is]] no such thing as a crappy job, only a [[worthless (meaningless) person]] who doesn't want to do it." p. 39
Gentlemen who profess to want to destroy generators while keeping the lights on.
- That's a line that still works today, even though the novel was written half a century ago! (People haven't progressed much...)

Volume 1: Emotionally charged and moved by the project's accomplishment
Volume 2: Hate Against Society Rises
Volume 3: Mystery Solving
As for the romance factor, there are pros and cons.
- Well, I think this element makes it a polyphonic harmony.
- I'm not so sure I can relate to it, personally.
- I wish there was a short version without the romance element, because it's hard to recommend it easily because the volume is very large.
- > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1642452440623771650?s=20): I've been feeling more and more that I should read the rest of "Atlas Shrugging His Shoulders," which I neglected after reading the part where Atlas shrugged his shoulders. I've been thinking that I should read the third part of the book, which is exactly [[Classics to read now]], but it's hard to recommend it because of the sheer volume of the book.

What? Density is bad. It's the type of book I won't be able to read when I get presbyopia.

It's a good book, but long.
