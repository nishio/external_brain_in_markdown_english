I bet on the tsunami coming.
- [[flood of tsunamis]]
- It is uncertain whether a tsunami will hit or not.
- Assuming you're coming, run to higher ground.
- Don't stay to convince those who are staying to assume they won't come.
- Related: [[Pascal's Wager]].

This is betting = uncertainty management
- Often [[Barbell Strategy]] is better [antifragile
- Unlike the physical body, [[offshoots (plants; often the of grass family)]] can [bet on multiple options
