First Exploration Polis 2.0: To Seed Review Network
August 22, 2023

Initial exploration of Polis 2.0: transitioning to a seed review network. This article describes how Polis operates, and the Polis 2.0 pilot project after linking with Talk to the City, a crowd interaction tool developed by AOI. In addition, we brainstormed about future feedback networks and role-playing.
An Initial Exploration of Polis 2.0: Moving Towards Seed Review Networks. Talk to the city. The future of the network and colorful performances will be possible again, and the brain will be in a state of intense excitement.

Talk to the City and Polis 2.0
Polis 1.0: The City-State of Converging Opinions
Polis is an open source crowd opinion aggregation system whose name is taken from the meaning of "city-state" and symbolizes that everyone's opinion is treated fairly on the network. polis has been widely applied to public deliberation processes around the world and is particularly useful in situations where online and offline integration is required. Polis is closely associated with participatory budgeting, law reform, and deliberative democracy, and uses statistics and machine learning to collect and analyze the real opinions of large numbers of people and express them in their own words.

Talk to the City
Polis 1.0 Opinion
Polis is a collection of opinions from a wide range of people. Polis is used extensively in civic deliberation processes around the world, and is a consistent link between upstream and downstream Polis and related to consultation, law revision, and deliberative democratic information. Polis is used to collect, analyze, and understand the true thoughts of a large number of people, while allowing others to communicate in their own language and learn statistics and equipment.


Polis specific flow
Anyone can start a Polis survey and, with a ready-made key statement (Seed Statement), publish it and solicit responses. In the process of answering the questions, respondents are gradually sorted into camps with close positions, which are then visualized in a graph. This allows participants to more clearly understand their positions during the actual deliberation process and allows for more effective discussions based on the key statements.

In the process of answering the questions, you will be asked to prepare a Seed Statement, and then you will be able to answer the questions in front of the other participants. In the process of psychometric testing, the respondent will be divided into groups that are close to his/her position, and these groups will become more visible after a while. After the actual deliberation process, the participants will be able to clarify their positions and make more effective arguments based on the key statements.

Polis has been used in Taiwan for vTaiwan (數位經濟法規線上詢), READr (數位身分證, 四大公投立場, etc.), Taiwan-Ministry of Commerce (台美議題互動), etc., and is an open source tool that can be used by anyone.

Polis 2.0 and Urban Dialogue
CIP and Polis 2.0
In April 2023, the UK non-profit organization CIP, together with OpenAI and Anthropic, initiated a "dialogue meeting" to discuss the conflicting issues associated with the development of large language models (LLMs). The Digital Agency (moda) piloted this in July of this year with an ideaathon, a project known as Polis 2.0.

In Polis 2.0, the dialogue was expanded to include virtual persons (LLMs), allowing everyone to participate in the dialogue. This allows different views to be disclosed and allows more people to continue the dialogue.


Polis 2.0 and City Talk
In April this year, the Alignment Assemblies (AA) of CIP, a British non-profit organization, and OpenAI, a ChatGPT organization, and Anthropic, a Claude company, will discuss the Alignment Problem that is inevitably faced when large language models (LLMs) are developed. Alignment Problem.) In July of this year, the Ideathon, a large number of which were created by moda, will be the first to be released, and will be known as polis 2.0.

The power of polis is that it allows users to write a series of chronicles at the same time, and to talk about the same thing to the same person at the same time. The polis 2.0 features a large language model (LLM) (ChatGPT, GPT3.5turbo) that can be used to control the interaction between two people.

Role of Talk to the City
Talk to the City" is an AOI tool that trains clusters of different sources, such as Twitter tweets and Polis results, to create visualization maps. For this ideathon, Polis statement opinions and voting results were imported into "Talk to the City" to generate new agenda clusters.

In this article, we will look at some of the key statements on polis, and also introduce the AA process of "Talk to the City" (我城對談), a tool developed by the AI Objectives Institute (AOI). The AA process also introduces "Talk to the City" (我城), a tool developed by the AI Objectives Institute (AOI), which is based on a collection of sources from different sources, such as Twitter's thrust, the position of the deliberation workshop, and Polis' results, to train the visualization of the agenda. The most original development is that users can keep up with these collections.

LLM will share with you its position on this collection and what it sees and hears.

The first time the Taiwan Trial will be held, we will discuss the opinions expressed by the members and the results of the vote, and then we will discuss a new agenda.

I have a question in a collection on "Artificial Intelligence Ethics": "Lawmakers are not using AI tools during the evaluation process. My response was "I disagree".

LLM with 🏛️ expression code will answer "I understand you may have a different way of looking at this problem. I am aware that the law officer relied on the Artificial Intelligence Tool during the evaluation process. Artificial intelligence tools can introduce prejudice or error, which can affect the fairness and accuracy of the judgment. The ability to judge human judgment, including the ability to take into account background, subtle distinctions, and subjective factors, is essential when the assessment is complex and subjective. The possibility of relying on artificial intelligence tools can damage the integrity of the evaluation process."

The above process is called Polis 2.0.

Meta-polis and feedback loops
Meta-polis conception
This trial is like an RPG game in the digital public domain, providing a forum to debate important issues and reconcile conflicts with virtual figures. This creates a feedback network and promotes the personification of collective opinion.



Summary: The Road to the Seki Key Critique Network
Polis solves the opinion texting problem and overcomes the bottleneck of collecting large numbers of text opinions. Talk to the City, on the other hand, satisfies the need for feedback and automatically generates seed opinions. The combination of these two tools opens up the possibility of diverse opinion leaders and creates a "Seki Key Critique Network.
