title: "Courage to open the door to choices"
---

> When I think of my child's future, I think of a state of many possibilities and options. ...
>
>  So, I don't think it's a question of fewer options when you grow up. ...
>
>  I think it is not the options that are diminishing, but the courage to open those doors.
>
>  I recently made a new friend who is older than me, and she is always boldly opening doors and moving forward. If she opened the wrong door, she would come back and say, "I made a mistake! She would come back and say, "I made a mistake!
>
>  ...Anyway, I open doors all the time. Seeing that, I thought that what I lack is not choice, but courage.
