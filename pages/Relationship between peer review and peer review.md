<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Peer review" and "peer review," when used in a Japanese context, mean almost the same thing. Both refer to the process of review and evaluation by experts in the same field (peers) to confirm the quality and reliability of a research or academic paper before it is published.

Below are the relevant points and characteristics of both:
- Purpose: The main purpose of peer review and peer review is to ensure the quality of research and to prevent the publication of papers that contain errors or inaccurate information.
- Process: When an author submits an article to a journal, it is sent to several experts in the field to evaluate it for accuracy and value of content and appropriateness of methodology. The reviewers communicate their recommendations (acceptance, acceptance after revision, acceptance after re-review, or rejection) to the journal's editors, who make the final decision.
- Anonymity: Peer review and peer review usually remain anonymous in both directions. This can be done in two ways: "single blind," where the reviewer does not know the author's name, or "double blind," where the author does not know the reviewer's name either.
- Impartiality: Anonymity is expected to eliminate reviewer bias and ensure impartial evaluations.
- Imperfection: However, no matter how many peer reviews are conducted, not all errors will be found. Nevertheless, peer review and peer review are important processes for quality assurance in the academic community.

In the world of research and academia, peer review is considered an essential element in ensuring the quality and credibility of research.
