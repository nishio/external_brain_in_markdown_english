- Gap with [Ideal self

from [/tkgshn/feelings-of-self-conflict](https://scrapbox.io/tkgshn/feelings-of-self-conflict).
- Suffering from [[gap]] between [[my ideal]] and the current situation
    - Maybe this feeling is sublime, but it's not something I actively put out around me.
    - Operate properly while recognizing it in yourself.

from  [[Harms of the gap between ideals and reality]]
    - [[Struck by the gap between the ideal and the reality]]
    - There is a gap between [[the ideal image of what I should be]] and [The Reality of Myself
        - This is not crazy.
    - At this time, the presence of a gap can generate damage to the psyche
