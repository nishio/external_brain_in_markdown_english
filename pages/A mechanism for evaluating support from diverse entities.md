[[Connection-Oriented Cluster Matching]]
- QF voting behavior is a high-dimensional vector
- Cluster it and use the variation as a coefficient of voting power.

[[Polis]]
- Voting behavior is a high-dimensional vector
- PCA it, cluster it, and multiply the support in each cluster by the consensus index.

[[Community Notes]]
- The evaluation on the note is a high-dimensional vector
- Decompose it into attribute information and bias terms in the note/voter 1 dimension
    - This one dimension roughly corresponds to the political left and right
- High bias terms in the notes mean that they are "supported by both the political left and right"
