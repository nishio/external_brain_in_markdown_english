title: "greatest legacy to posterity"
---


> This is a record of a lecture given by [[Kanzo Uchimura]], a thinker and religious leader of the Meiji era, at a Christian summer school in 1894 (27th year of Meiji) on the shores of Lake Reed, Hakone. First published in "Kohan Ronshu: 6th Summer School Edition" [[1894 (Meiji 27)]]. What can one bequeath to posterity? Is it clean money or business? Or to become an educator and pass on learning? But there is the greatest legacy that anyone can leave behind. That is to live a life that is unique to that person. This is a modern masterpiece, full of humor and profound content.
