from [[The Art of Worldly Wisdom]]
Take a firm stand.
lxxii

Failure to execute a design is less harmful than indecision in doing so. It is less harmful for a stream to flow than for it to be dammed. And this is not because of bewilderment, for they have clearly made a decision, but because of a total inability to act. It takes some skill to find difficulties, but it is much harder to find a way out of them. Some people never find themselves in a quandary. Their clear judgment and decisive nature make them suitable for the highest professions. Their intelligence tells them where to insert the thin end of the wedge, and their decisiveness tells them how to drive it home. They are quick to accomplish any task. As soon as they finish one area of action, they move on to the next. They are fortunate and can be sure of success.
