- Contextual explanation of how to use [[information card]].
- summary
    - Some people care about "how it's classified."
    - This is a mistake based on the misconception that cards are for classifying and storing knowledge.
    - Cards as tools of intellectual production are not like that.
        - The goal is not to classify and store knowledge,
        - Manipulating cards to perform intellectual production tasks is the use of cards.
        - The ability to operate the card is a feature of the card, if you only want to store it, you can use a notebook.
    - What is manipulation?
        - rearrangement and rearrangement
        - This often uncovers connections between seemingly unrelated cards.
            - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> By discovering [[Unexpected Related]], you are [[Structured after the fact]] into a structure you did not anticipate.
        - Cards are tools of creation
    - To decide on a taxonomy is to set a box for thinking.
        - Put the card in a tight classification system and it will suffocate and die.
        - Classify according to subjective interest, not according to objective content of knowledge
relevance
- Knowledge written in notebooks is often dead.
        - [[Not a warehouse to put dead text in.]]
        - [[Metaphor of a fish tank]]

- Jiro Kawakita [[Do not classify.]].
