title: "No one is left behind."

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/sge/icon' alt='sge.icon' height="19.5"/>No one will be left behind" is the philosophy of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] ([[SDGs]]). In English, it is "[[No one will be left behind]].

There is a wide range in whether to slow down the rate of progress in order to reduce to zero "those [[who are temporarily left behind]]," or whether to consider that it is inevitable that "those [[who are temporarily left behind]]" will appear, and to eliminate them after they appear, so as not to make "those [[who continue to be left behind]]" a problem.

He has been appointed as a member of the government's Council for Promoting Regulatory Reform, where he will propose ride-sharing and other regulatory reforms. We interview Mr. Kawabe, who leads a giant Internet company, about his prescription for digital transformation (DX).

> [fpocket](https://x.com/fpocket/status/1742140759103463613) Like inclusive education, I think the meaning of the phrase "no one is left behind" is misunderstood. In the context of digitalization, I think it should be widely known in Japan that Audrey Tang uses the term "digital resilience" and states that "digital is a tool to connect people" to enlighten people about plurality.
- > What do you see as the reason for the government's delay compared to the private sector?
- >  Kawabe: First, I think we have been too kind to existing users. The Digital Agency's concept is "digitization that leaves no one behind," but I believe this will not work. Priority for digitization should be given to those who are able to do so, while those who are not able to do so should be assisted at the government office, for example, with smartphone operations. This two-step approach is necessary. One reason is that progress is slow because we try to accommodate a kind of "[[misconceived equality]]" or those who are least able to use it.

> The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the successor to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were formulated in 2001 and adopted unanimously by the member states at the UN Summit in September 2015. The SDGs consist of 17 goals and 169 targets, and pledge to "leave no one behind" on the planet. The SDGs are universal, not only for developing countries, but also for developed countries themselves, and Japan is actively working on them.
