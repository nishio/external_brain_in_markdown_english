The following is a brief summary of what can be read from the weekly report for mid-February to early March 2024, as well as suggestions and ideas that may be gleaned from it. Please use it as a reference for looking back and setting goals for the coming year.

1. review by period
- 2024-02-12～02-19
    - Record weekly notes in short spans to correct rhythmic lapses
    - Take advantage of consecutive holidays (2/10 - 2/12) to refresh
        - Stretching and moving the body
        - Allow yourself to say, "If I don't feel like doing it, I don't have to do it," and prioritize recovery from fatigue.
    - Talk about "Talk to the City" on 2/8
- 2024-02-19～25
    - Tried Gov4Git trial, but paused with unknown error
    - The [[pMAGI]] project is ongoing.
    - Creation of roti related pages (bazaar and club)
    - Friday: AI panel meeting at Unexplored Conference
    - Saturday and Sunday: Unexplored Results Debriefing (more presentations and discussions in the community)
- 2024-02-25～03-03
    - Monday is a substitute holiday, event on Wednesday (Nuruan)
    - Many Murder Mystery Meetings on weekends.
        - Refresh and discover new things through games
    - Achieved 150cm leg spread with stretching (steady and continuous results)
- 2024-03-03～03-07
    - Focused on tasks related to [[BitNet]], Unexplored Conference 2024 poster, [[PluralityBook]], etc. all at once.
    - Gov4Git's Voice Credit was awarded.
    - 3/4: Negotiations with PluralityBook publisher and worldwide announcement
        - Accelerated toward publication, including "winning by a touch" in competition with other companies.
    - 3/5-6: Finalizing contract terms
    - 3/7: Weekly journal switch ahead of schedule due to busy weekend
        - Conscious of switching on and off, such as reading at a cafe

2. learning/awareness gained
- Technical Verification and Trials
    - Trial use of new technologies such as Gov4Git often does not go smoothly, but practice makes the issues concrete.
    - Reaffirming the importance of testing in a real environment as early as possible
- On/off management during task-intensive periods
    - Even when working on multiple projects at the same time, I take a break to do leg stretches, Murder Mystery, etc.
    - Take short breaks, such as reading in a café, to maintain creativity and focus.
- Increased activity in publication negotiations and external collaborations
    - Increased full-scale external collaboration, including negotiating publication of PluralityBook and finalizing contract terms.
    - Realization of possibilities to expand from the community, such as competition and contract negotiations among multiple companies

3. ideas that could be applied in the future
- Frequent sharing of defect and failure logs
    - When a tool like Gov4Git doesn't work, sharing the cause or error message right away makes it easier to find a solution
    - Centralize the history of failure logs in Slack, Scrapbox, etc., so that they can be diverted when similar problems recur.
- Continued balance of refreshment & learning
    - Good flow of stretching, board games, Murder Mystery, etc. to switch body/mind.
    - Continued to emphasize a balance between "taking a good rest" and "trying something new" by utilizing weekends and consecutive holidays
- Visualization of the collaboration and negotiation process
    - Briefly note down the process so that you can look back later on the points of communication with the publisher and contract negotiations.
    - Clear examples of successes and failures can be used as know-how for the next negotiation or project
- Action list for the next period
    - Creation of a public relations and marketing roadmap involving the publication of PluralityBook.
    - Gov4Git Retry: Investigate Specific Failure Points and Call for Community Help
    - [[pMAGI]] Enhancements: Improved UI flow and easier to understand flow for adding topics.

summary
- While the period from mid-February to early March is busy with technical trials, project progress, and external negotiations overlapping at the same time, I was impressed by the conscious effort to ensure rest and leisure time as well.
- Looking ahead to next year and beyond, the more new technologies and external negotiation opportunities, the smoother the process will be if information sharing and negotiation know-how can be systematized.

Please take a look at it for future reference.
