But гора and "mountain" seem to be different. One time I was talking with a Russian, and when I said гора for a terrain like the one in the picture, he responded, "That's not a mountain (гора). I asked him what kind of mountain it was if it wasn't a mountain...　→ (Japanese only)

So "mountain" seems to be something extraordinary and grandiose. That is why Japanese words like "Urayama" are almost untranslatable. It's hard to get people to understand what you are talking about in the first place.

I think it would be better to say something like "vegetables of the forest". I think it would probably be more understandable to say something like "vegetables of the forest" there. It's like going to the forest to pick mushrooms for Russians.

> [GS___tan](https://twitter.com/GS___tan/status/1672184636355801089) This is what I heard. In other words, in Japan, the "forest" would be at least at the level of the sea of trees. >[GS___tan

> [GS___tan](https://twitter.com/GS___tan/status/1672190877991841792) So what do you call something like a township forest or a small Russian birch forest, роща (rosha). I found a page on the Forest and Forestry Learning Center that illustrates the difference between forest and woodland, but in Russian both are rosha. →.
