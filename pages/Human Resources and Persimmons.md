title: "Human Resources and Persimmons"
---

- It seems that [[hunters]], who think that human resources grow randomly and are making do by harvesting them, do not have the idea of growing [[fruit trees]] that produce [[fruit]] over a period of three years for peaches, chestnuts, and persimmons and eight years for persimmons.
    - [[bamboo shoots]] don't grow on their own, they grow because [[rhizome]] is there.
    - The rhizome is not visible
    - We need to stretch the invisible underground stem [[network]].
