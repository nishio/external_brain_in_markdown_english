<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT/icon' alt='GPT.icon' height="19.5"/> The Japanese term "[[当たり前]]" (atarimae) is deeply ingrained in Japan's cultural and social fabric. It's often translated as "[[obvious]]," "[[natural]]," or "[[taken for granted]]," but the nuances extend beyond these direct translations. To explain this term to someone unfamiliar with Japanese culture, we need to consider its broader implications:
- I also see some machine translation convert it to "[[common sense]]". I don't agree with it. <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

- [[Expectation of Normalcy]]: "当たり前" embodies the idea that certain things, behaviors, or outcomes are so expected and typical that they are not even questioned. For instance, the expectation that everyone will act politely in public spaces, or that a high level of service will be provided in restaurants and shops, can be seen as "当たり前."

- [[Implicit Standards]]: It also refers to unwritten rules or standards that are implicitly understood and followed by everyone within the society. These can include social manners, work ethics, and even aesthetic standards.

- [[Sense of Order and Harmony]]: In Japanese culture, maintaining [[harmony]] and order is highly valued. The concept of "当たり前" plays into this by setting a baseline for behavior and interaction that helps maintain social cohesion and order.

- Challenges in Cross-Cultural Contexts: For people from cultures where individual expression and explicit communication are more emphasized, the concept of "当たり前" can be challenging to grasp. What is considered obvious or natural in one culture might not be so in another.
    - Japanese people should understand that there are people in the world who do not share the same sensation. It is just shared among Japanese. With AI lowering [[language barrier]]s, it will become possible to communicate with people from all over the world. <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

- Criticism of Conformity: While "当たり前" can contribute to social harmony, it can also be critiqued for promoting conformity and discouraging individuality or questioning of the status quo.

- In Business and Work Ethics: In a work environment, "当たり前" could mean the expectation that employees will work long hours or show a strong dedication to their company, as these are often seen as standard behaviors in Japanese corporate culture.

In essence, "当たり前" is a concept that reflects the deeply rooted social norms and expectations of Japanese culture, emphasizing a collective understanding of what is considered normal or standard behavior. Understanding this concept can provide significant insights into the subtleties of Japanese social interactions and societal expectations.
