title: "What if a new continent is discovered?"

2023-04-14
- Since [[physical body]] is one, there were two choices: "[[cross to the new continent]]" or "don't cross".
    - [[mobile voting]]
- [[New Continent]] became a community of those who chose to "cross over to the new continent."
    - [[Formation of early adopter groups]]

- [[A body that can be divided]] does not have to choose between them.
- Examples of bodies that can be divided: [[attention]], [[monetary capital]]
- There are things that should be divided and things that should not be divided.
- Different people have different ideas of what they think the appropriate balance should be.
    - This means [[one vote per person]] not a vote.
        - [[Quadratic Voting]].
        - Unfortunately, the reality is not QV.
- I have to think about what kind of vote I'm casting.
    - Some people vote 0.
        - Maybe I just don't think about it.
        - but that is the person's decision to make.
    - Vote now or vote later.
        - This is also a decision
    - How I feel now
            - I think it's a good idea to allocate [[monetary capital]] as much as you allocate [[attention]].
