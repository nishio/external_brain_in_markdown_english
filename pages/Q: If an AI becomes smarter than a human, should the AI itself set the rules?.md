Q: If an AI becomes smarter than a human, should the AI itself set the rules?
- Of course I think so.
- But if you do it overtly, there will be emotional backlash and it will be troublesome.
- So we need to be "[[democratic]]" and make sure that everyone has a "[[sense of]] conviction."
- Even at this point, GPT4 is smarter than a significant number of homo sapiens.
    - So, rather than deciding by "homo sapiens [[majority rule]] [[one vote per person]]", it is better to have "AI in and adjust the weights" to reach a better conclusion.
    - It is important how to make it convincing and [[legitimacy]].
