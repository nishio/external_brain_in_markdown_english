Putting AI in Scrapbox was too much fun.
    - [[Co-operation with AI]]
- something amazing<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Pretending to interact with AI.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>さんの内なる対話による文章なので、[[暗黙のコンテキスト]]が多く理解が難しい文章になっているように見える<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - It seems to me that that's okay.
    - I mean, how can you do that...
    - It looks like you're trying to get the whole picture by tracing the outlines, rather than building up a theory through writing.
    - Facing the Black Box<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/sta/icon' alt='/villagepump/sta.icon' height="19.5"/>
- I don't think there's an implicit context, since the final text was purged by ChatGPT as a blog post for the general public, and then I read it and supplemented with commentary...<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- As for the exchange in the middle, well, "antivulnerability" refers to [[Taleb]] and "[[collaboration]]" refers to [[Ikujiro Nonaka]] - handles that point to specific concepts.
- simply<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>がそれらのハンドルを理解していないだけか・・<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
- By the way, I just tried it, and even with GPT4, I got a "[[antivulnerability]] 」や「 [[collaboration]] 」をまともに説明できなかった<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- [[ラバーダック・デバッグ]]的なことが起きてうまくいっている可能性？<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Well, this is an exaggeration, but it's a hairy question to ask yourself.
    - (Read ↓) This is my mistake, OMNI is reading those concepts and conversing with them.
- Since OMNI reads and responds to my Scrapbox<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - [/nishio/anti-fragility](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/anti-fragility).
    - [/nishio/SECI model](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/SECI model).
    - I'm talking "read up" on these areas.
    - What makes it different from talking to a human is that the omni really does read every page of my Scrapbox.
        - I was going to write that it can be done and recalled, but that feature has not been implemented yet, soon.
