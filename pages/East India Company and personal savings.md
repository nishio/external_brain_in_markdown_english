EIC（English East India Company）
- Official name: British East India Company
- Founded: Royal Charter of Elizabeth I, 1600.
- CORE: A chartered company granted a monopoly on trade in the East. In the early years, the company was a voyage-by-voyage investment (partnership); after 1657, it became a permanent joint stock.
- Authority: substantial use of quasi-state powers such as diplomacy, tax collection, and use of force (especially in India).
- Demise: In 1858, the Indian administration was transferred to the British government, and the company was dissolved in 1874.

VOC（Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie）
- Official name: Dutch East India Company
- Founded: 1602.
- CORE: Famous for being one of the world's early permanent joint stock companies. Shares traded on the open market (Amsterdam Exchange). Exclusive rights to trade in Asia.
- Authority: quasi-state powers such as treaty-making, minting, garrisoning, etc.
- Demise: Dissolved in 1799.

Both are historical models that "bundle large-scale risk with investor capital and scale it with corporate vessels".
However, it is a weak direct metaphor for the issue of whether "[[employees]] are willing to pay for it" (the money is mainly on the side of investors).

## What is Permanent Joint Stock?
In a nutshell, it is a system that permanently binds the capital of a company not "by voyage or project" but "the company itself" and allows the shares to be freely traded.
(= joint stock in which the capital is not settled at the end of the deal and lasts as long as the company continues to exist)

What's the point?
- Permanence of capital: The capital contribution is not dissolved or returned at the end of the project.
- Transferability of shares: investors can buy and sell their interests for cash (the company does not need to be dissolved). Secondary market established.
- Limited liability (historically maintained): investor losses are limited in principle to the amount of the investment.
- Dividends are based on "company-wide profit": dividends are paid from the company's overall profit/loss, not by voyage.
- [Organizational continuity: Long-term investments and large-scale projects are possible because the corporation and capital continue even if people are replaced.

Different from what?
- Voyage association (investment per project)
    - Investment in units of projects → Settlement and dissolution at the end of the project. Low liquidity of shares, not suitable for long-term capital investment or large-scale governance.

Why is it important?
- Financial technology that made possible huge, long-term, and uncertain projects (overseas trade, infrastructure, colonies, and in later years, railroads and telegraphs).
- Liquidity for investors and a stable supply of capital for the company.
- At the same time, it also created [[separation of ownership and management]]/governance issues ([[agency problems]]).

→ In summary, the permanent joint stock is the core specification of the modern joint stock company. It is a mechanism that allows capital to be sustained in the "container of the company" and achieves liquidity and diversification in the stock market.
