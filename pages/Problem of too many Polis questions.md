Problem of too many Polis questions
> [@makotokirihata](https://twitter.com/makotokirihata/status/1647933405278121984?s=20): [https://t.co/RlUI47s3BO](https://t.co/RlUI47s3BO) Interesting
> Just a little too many choices to make and a little too tough for my lazy self.
> I feel like I want to collect answers by prioritizing the far away from where I have already answered, like Bayesian optimization.
> I know we're in the process of getting close to far in the first place.

> [@hrjn](https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1648225476702502913?s=20): Polis I wonder if the GPT could shrink the questions so that there are more questions.

> [kuboon](https://twitter.com/kuboon/status/1648160127890104320) It's hard to answer 79 questions and I can't finish the race.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1648161911408840704) I think it would be better to re-partition periodically, as the number of people to vote for increases and the cost of answering each question goes up. I'd like to have the system assist in deciding when to re-partition and in creating a new set of seed opinions.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1648165232223875073) But, well, "in order for 100 people to reach an equal consensus, each person must hear 100 times as much as he/she speaks", so I think it's a reasonable pitfall to read 80 cases and not allow people who don't pay the cost of pushing the for/agree button. I think it's a reasonable drop to not allow people to submit their own opinions if they don't want to pay the cost of reading 80 comments and pressing the "agree" or "disapprove" button.

> [@mike_neck](https://twitter.com/mike_neck/status/1648471489698742272?s=20): - There are 80 questions and it takes about an hour to answer them all...
> ・Duplicate questions with the same content, perhaps because amateurs are momentarily creating questions.
> ・・The terrorism here refers to a lone attacker targeting former Prime Minister Abe and Prime Minister Kishida, but isn't that a murder case?
> Some questions appear to be unclear in meaning due to omission of subject matter

> [@hal_sk](https://twitter.com/hal_sk/status/1649932696645402624?s=20): ... Did a lot of people give up pretty much halfway through? There were so many questions, and on the UI it said "more than 100 questions left" and I didn't know how many questions there were in total, so it was hard to answer them.

- My impression at this point is that
    - More than 100 questions would be too many.
    - The only way to prevent the increase is to not accept opinion submissions.
        - But being able to post opinions creates a "sense of participation," so I'd like to accept them if possible.
        - They are not sure if the person who submitted the opinion was able to submit it or not, this is a lack of feedback from the system
            - The system is not supposed to accept the same content, but there were two instances of almost identical submissions coming in.
    - I'm not moderating right now.
        - Can be set to not appear until moderator approval.
    - After 100 ballots have been collected, how much the ratio will change after accepting more.
        - I don't think it would change much, so you might want to discontinue it or reduce the probability of its appearance.


> [ringo](https://twitter.com/ringo/status/1655817703654047744) I've tried several times to get involved,
>  There are dozens and dozens of questions, and I surrender after a few.
>  I'm just wondering if anyone who can answer a few dozen questions and participate is pretty special.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1655827028254527489) The observed fact is that there are hundreds of people who can answer and participate!
- > [ringo](https://twitter.com/ringo/status/1655828844790841344) How much did they drop out on which question? How do you know which questions are the most important?
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1655830518964047873) I didn't take that much detail because it's too much trouble, but for example, this would show 541 people who voted at least one vote, and 475 people who voted enough for clustering. is 475 people.
- > [ringo](https://twitter.com/ringo/status/1655832813504172032) 26.41 votes per voter on average, answered 26.41 questions on average. I think you mean?
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1655836231505448961) Yes, that's right. You can see the number of individual responses per question at the bottom of the report, but the order in which they are displayed is customized depending on the situation, so it's hard to discuss "where they left off"!
- > [ringo](https://twitter.com/ringo/status/1655904811588653057) I see!
- >  I was surprised at the amount of responses you all gave.

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1655994085877096448?s=20): there was a comment that Polis has too many questions, so I took a chance and created a Polis with only 4 questions, it's a good visualization.
> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1656000915768479745?s=20): Polis, I've been trying to gather opinions from Twitter and let GPT-4 sort it out... and all that. I'm starting to think that "finding two people in conflict" and "creating about two opinions on each side" should be enough without trying so hard.
