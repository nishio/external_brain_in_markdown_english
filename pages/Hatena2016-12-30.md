*1483025710*(resolved)no sessions when trying to attach to tmux
Q: disconnected to EC2, logged in again, tried to attach to tmux but it says no sessions. kill -10 doesn't work. The process is alive. What is wrong?

A: When I created an instance from AMI, I didn't want to work with "ubuntu" which was created as default user, so I created "nishio" separately and worked with it. However, when I logged in again, I couldn't connect to nishio's tmux because I logged in as "ubuntu". It was a careless mistake.
