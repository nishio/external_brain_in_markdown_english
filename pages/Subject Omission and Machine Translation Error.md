title: "Subject Omission and Machine Translation Error"
---

I noticed a translation error when trying to mention something in [/nishio-en/Manazuru 2023-05-13#655683ccaff09e0000f415f7](https://scrapbox.io/nishio-en/Manazuru 2023-05-13#655683ccaff09e0000f415f7). The translated sentence "He's wearing a [[Nishikigoi NFT]] T-shirt!" uses the pronoun "He," which is incorrect because Audrey's pronoun is "She."

Upon checking the original Japanese text, it was written as "[[Nishikigoi NFT]]のTシャツを着てる！" If we translate it literally, it would be "Wearing a [[Nishikigoi NFT]] T-shirt!" Therefore, the original Japanese text does not contain any information about the subject's [[gender]].

[[Subject Omission]]
- In Japanese, the subject is often omitted. Therefore, there is no need to distinguish whether the subject is "he" or "she" in this situation. This is not a mistranslation, but rather an incorrect assumption made by the translation AI that it needed to supplement non-existent gender information and mistakenly assumed the subject was male.

[[Gender-specific pronouns]]
- In Japanese, there are "彼" (he) and "彼女" (she), but there are also gender-neutral words like "あの人" (that person) or "あの方" (more polite way).
- In English-speaking countries, I have heard that some people avoid using the distinction between "Mr." and "Mrs." and instead use the Japanese-derived honorific "[[-san]]."
