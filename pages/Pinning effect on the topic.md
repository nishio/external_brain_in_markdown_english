Skip fragments put in the past = [[page memory]].
    - [[page memory]] is difficult to see the value in the short term, but clearly beneficial in the long term
    - In the short term, in response to [Do you need 🤖MMR?" I thought

        - For a human query 0, it is pulled to an existing sentence fragment and outputs 1.
        - If a human sees this and develops it into 2.
        - Without page memory, the same gravitational pull will occur again next time.
    - I thought the MMR was necessary to avoid one, but if there are multiple fragments of similarity, it's natural to gravitate there once it's well told.
        - It is not good for [[trade-offs between use and exploration]] if forces occur that keep you there.
        - So page memory is essential to care for this one.
    - Like this.
