[[follow the fashion for nothing]] [[follow the morality for serious matters]] [[follow yourself in matters of art]].

> Yasujiro Ozu Introduction Exhibition Corner in the Furuishiba Cultural Center... Displayed at the entrance were Ozu's words, "Follow the fad for nothing, follow morality for serious matters, and follow yourself for art.
[[Tomoki Yuma]] Nothing follows fashion, nothing follows morality... Let's talk about it together! My Japanese Movies" | GQ JAPAN []](https://www.gqjapan.jp/culture/article/20210301-tomoki-sukezane-movie)
- [[Yasujiro Ozu]]


orthographical variants
    - [[Follow what is fashionable in matters of no importance, follow what is moral in matters of importance, and follow yourself in matters of art.]]
    - > What doesn't matter follows [[prevalence (e.g., of a disease)]], what matters follows [[morals]], and what matters in [[the arts]] follows [[myself]].
        - [[Yasujiro Ozu]]
- The one in the exhibit section looks more correct.
