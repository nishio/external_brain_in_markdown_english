title: "When you hold a hammer, everything looks like a nail."
---

[[parable]] of a [[human bug]] that falsely assumes that once it has a solution, all problems should be solved by that solution.

Of course, whether solution A should be used depends on the subject. You should have more than one solution and choose the appropriate one depending on the subject.
- Screws should not be hammered in with a hammer, they should be tightened with a screwdriver.

This is to give you more options, so you can get into another [[human bug]] that stops you wondering which one to use because you have too many options. [[Jam Experiments]]

Development of a parable
- You don't have a hammer, but you see someone hammering a nail with a hammer and you think you must hammer a nail too, so you hammer a nail with your fist.
- Making oden with a saw. You could make it, but it's not suited for you.
- I think it would be very useful if the saw could drive nails! I'm sure it would be if it came at no cost, but do we really need it?"
