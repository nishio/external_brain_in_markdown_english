title: "POC and PMF are different."

OLD TITLE: 0 to 1 and 1 to 100
- [[0 to 1]] and [[1 to 100]].
    - Even if 1 to 100 has value, others won't believe it without first having 0 to 1.
    - First you make one, then you say, "We need to create a system for 100 of these to be born."

0→1 functions as a literal [[Proof of Concept]].
- Another way to describe it: [[POC]] and [[PMF]] are different.
    - I think this one is more appropriate.
        - [The 1 in 0 to 1 varies from person to person.
