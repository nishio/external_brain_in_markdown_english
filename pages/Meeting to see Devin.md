title: "Meeting to see Devin"
---

A group of about 30 engineers observing [[Devin.ai]] that was held between 2024-12-28 and 2025-01-25.
- How it started
    - I saw young engineers around 20 years old talking about how they wanted to experience Devin, and I said, "I'll pay for it, so let's get more people together to increase the opportunity for knowledge exchange.
- Devin Observation Diary of Mr. Teramoto, which led to the introduction of Devin.

        - First day's article: [Would you hire Devin, an AI programmer who can be hired for 80,000 yen/month? - Devin Observation Diary｜Daiki Teramoto](https://note.com/teramotodaiki/n/n00dde86ff676?magazine_key=ma1f76a419145)
- It was an opportunity to meet with [[Scott Wu]], the CEO.
    - [[Meeting with Scott Wu]]
- It took a month to finish.
    - I too was tempted to use Devin for my own PRIVATE purposes.
    - And it's hard to keep paying from my wallet.

        - It was supposed to be 70,000 yen, but we got excited and bought more and more credits, so it ended up costing 270,000 yen.
