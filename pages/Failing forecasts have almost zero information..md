- [[failure]] to [[forecast]] is [[information volume]] almost zero

> [kaityo256](https://twitter.com/kaityo256/status/1780622982324609089) To find a new road, a lot of people have to run in different directions. Most of them are dead ends, but someone lucky will find a new road, and then we all go from there to find another road.

> [kaityo256](https://twitter.com/kaityo256/status/1780623699961643435) So, the discourse that "it's a dead end that way anyway" when you see someone running is quite possibly true, but it only kills the motivation of the person running and produces nothing. It does nothing but kill the motivation of those who are running. If you don't want to run, it is better to support them or at least be quiet.
