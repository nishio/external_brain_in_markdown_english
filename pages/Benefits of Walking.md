title: "Benefits of Walking"
---

    - Study the effect of [[walk]] on [creativity
    - Measure [[divergent thinking]] with the [[Guilford's alternate uses]] (GAU) test.
    - It's a matter of "think of another way to use it."
    - Measure [[convergent thinking]] with the [[compound remote associates]] (CRA) test.
    - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Associates_Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Associates_Test)
    - Given three words age/mile/sand, the question is to answer "stone" which is a compound word with all of them.
- Experiment 1, test sitting, then walking on a treadmill. Walking increased GAU by 81% but only 23% CRA
- Experiment 2, comparing three patterns: sitting and then walking, walking and then sitting, and sitting and then walking. Walking still increased GAU, but in the case of walking and then sitting, there was also an increase in score while sitting
- Experiment 4, [[analogy]] generation test, compared four patterns: sitting indoors, walking on a treadmill indoors, walking outdoors, and moving in a wheelchair outdoors. Improvements in analogy quality were not due to outdoor stimulation, but to walking.
