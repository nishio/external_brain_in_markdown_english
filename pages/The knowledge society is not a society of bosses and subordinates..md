title: "The knowledge society is not a society of bosses and subordinates."

Drucker: "[[A]] knowledge society is not a society of [[bosses]] and [[subordinate persons]]."

I tweeted on Twitter.
- > I wonder if you realize that the Druckerbot's "knowledge society is not a society of bosses and subordinates," which is full of RTs, is a state in which there is no one left in the organization to surpass you as a result of constant learning and acquisition of advanced expertise (and those who cannot do so have already been restructured).

So, quoting from [[postcapitalist society]], with some of the finer phrasing redacted: "The world is a big place, and the world is a big place.
- > Modern organizations are organizations by [[specialists]] of knowledge. Hence organization by equals. No knowledge is above other knowledge -- p.76
- > You must acquire new knowledge in any field every four to five years, or you will become obsolete -- p. 78 Otherwise, you will become obsolete -- p.78
- >  [[knowledge workers]] cannot be supervised. Rather, they are in every sense useless if there is anyone who knows more about their specialty than they do -- p. 87.

What is meant by "[[Organization by equals]]" and "no one knows more about one's specialty than oneself" is as shown in the figure [Learn from those with little knowledge.

    - [[Knowledge workers cannot be supervised.]]
    - [[There is more than one mountain.]]
