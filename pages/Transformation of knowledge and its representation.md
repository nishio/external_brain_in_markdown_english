## [[Transformation of knowledge]] and its representation
Knowledge takes on a different form in our minds before and after we learn it.... Of particular interest is the "[[summary]]" of knowledge. Summarizing is not simply the act of shortening information. It is a process of selecting the parts we find valuable and discarding the parts we do not find valuable. This "[[values]]" is different for each individual and is subjective.

The act of conveying knowledge is not merely the conveyance of information. A form for conveying it, or "[[an]] easy to understand form," is required. This may not always be accurate. It is important, however, that the form be such that the people who receive the information can accept the new knowledge with surprise and interest. This can be likened to "[[soft gears]]. If a gear is soft, it will move more smoothly, reducing friction with other gears. The transmission of knowledge should also be in a form that is soft and comfortable to the mind of the receiver.

In the process of communicating knowledge and information, it is important to identify the "[[valleys]]" between different knowledge and information and to build "[[bridges]]" that bridge these valleys. What is the connection, or "bridge," between the two? It may not be literal information or knowledge, but the ideas and philosophy behind it, or the emotions and values one feels. I feel that thinking about this "bridge between" is very useful in the process of knowledge transformation and transmission.

### Impressions
.
- Not what I meant to say, but the feeling of "that's how you interpret it - interesting".
        - [[Parable of the Gears]] evolved
- relevance
        - [[Leverage memo]]

Knowledge Forms
[[after LLM]]
- [[Summary is an ambiguous concept]]
- Retain the parts you value and discard the parts you don't value.
- This "value" is subjective.

Easy to understand form
Probably not the right answer.
before people are greeted with surprise
Soft gears

Identify valleys and build bridges.
- [[It is useful to think about what connects the in-between]]
