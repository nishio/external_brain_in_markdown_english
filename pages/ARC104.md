- The question phrase is "if rearranged," but it is not necessary to literally rearrange, but frequency counts are sufficient.
    - Unordered columns are multisets" pattern because reordering is "ignoring order".
        - [[Sorting → Frequency Counting]]
- Rustic writing style to make sure you're going in the right direction.
python

```
def solve_simple(N, S):
    from collections import Counter
    ret = 0
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(i + 1, N + 1):
            subseq = S[i:j]
            debug("subseq", subseq)
            count = Counter(subseq)
            if count["A"] == count["T"] and count["C"] == count["G"]:
                ret += 1
    return ret
```

- And then re-implement this in a fast enough way
        - [[Frequency counts are range sums]] So maybe a [[cumulative sum]] method? I think so.
    - But since N=5000, wouldn't O(N^2) just barely pass? So I decided to try a simple counting method first.
    - As a result, the decision is correct and AC without using the cumulative sum
python

```
def solve(N, S):
    from collections import defaultdict
    ret = 0
    for i in range(N):
        count = defaultdict(int)
        for j in range(i, N):
            count[S[j]] += 1
            if count["A"] == count["T"] and count["C"] == count["G"]:
                ret += 1
    return ret
```

    - I made one mistake and RE'd the range of movement of j once.

- I had no idea what to expect, so I implemented a simple depth-first search for now.
- The sample case was correct, but the code was quite complex, and the WA was not resolved.
    - It is not a good idea to implement a halfway fast implementation. The cause of WA could not be identified.
    - A simpler, slower, and more correct code would have found discrepancies in random tests.
- The explanation says O(N^3) in DP, attributed to the domain partitioning.
        - [[A larger structure can be created from a bilateral relationship.]]
        - [[Same length if they overlap → even length block]]

- I didn't think of this at all, this kind of "[[Power of Attribution]]" is missing, and I'm wondering how I can learn it.
