- I'd like to ask those of you who [[read aloud]] Japanese in your head and have programming experience, do you also read the source code aloud?
    - I didn't do it, and I think it's the same in Japanese. I think.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Recognizing that reading aloud is "something you dare to do to flow slowly when you want to verify the smoothness of the connections in your writing.

    - [Typoglycemia](https://dic.nicovideo.jp/a/typoglycemia)
        - I thought this phenomenon happened because I was reading with images instead of following the text properly.
        - If a surprising number of people are reading aloud, what does that mean?
            - I rearrange them into the correct sentences and then read them aloud.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/kutsumofu/icon' alt='/villagepump/kutsumofu.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - I'm reading aloud without following the words properly, so the middle is missing.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - Don't wait for me to finish reading aloud before moving on to the next sentence.
                        - [[reading aloud in one's brain]] can't keep up.
                    - [[The parts I don't read aloud are like insect bites and the meaning doesn't come down to me.]]
- > I'd like to ask those of you who [[read aloud]] Japanese in your head and have programming experience, do you read the source code aloud as well?
    - If you are hand typing a long function, read it aloud to the end.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Like `getElementsByClassName`.
        - The speed of reading aloud is keeping up with the speed of typing.
    - If you can write fast with LSP support or something, or if you just want to do code reading, the playback stops when it finishes recognizing the code and goes on to the next part.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/yosider/icon' alt='/villagepump/yosider.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Maybe this is what Japanese sentences are for.
        - I've skimmed a lot of the pauses and have a rough understanding.
            - Skipped parts are not played back, of course.
        - On the other hand, I think that's why there are so many misreadings.
    - I feel like I'm reading aloud everything but the symbols.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/kutsumofu/icon' alt='/villagepump/kutsumofu.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/shoya140/icon' alt='/villagepump/shoya140.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - You didn't read the `()` and other symbols completely.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Silent reading, seems to be the best way to describe it.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - I'm aware of it, but that's the only sound missing.
        - > I think the symbols are silent and placed in the image.
            - This is what it looks like except for the symbols.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - +1<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/sta/icon' alt='/villagepump/sta.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - `return ctypes.windll.user32.MessageBoxW(0, str(message), str(title), mbtype)`
            - This is "Return Sea Tapes, Windy LL, User Thirty Message Boxes Doubl e Zero Store Messages Store Title M B Type."
                - (str reads store to me (more stol-ists?))
                - By the way, the "mbtype" part is "M, type, hmm? ...... Oh, there's a bee, mbtype" I thought to the point of "mbtype".
            - You can skip reading it once you get used to seeing it over and over again.
                - I can interrupt my reading aloud around "Return Sea Tapes" to say "Oh, there it is."
                - Well, I often feel like I understand and end up reading it back aloud. ......
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Close to "n" > silent, feels like it's being placed in an image
            - `return ctypes.windll.user32.MessageBoxW(0, str(message), str(title), mbtype)`
            - "Mmm. Nm. Nn. Like "Nn, nn, nn, nn, nn".
                - Symbols are also silent
                - Silent but distinguished, so `ctypesWinDllUser32MessageBoxW` makes me feel "hmmm, that's a long one".
            - Even if you don't program, you have `"` and other letters that you don't pronounce.
