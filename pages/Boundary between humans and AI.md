title: "Boundary between humans and AI"
---

I think those who draw the line between humans and AI today will be written in [[future world history]] textbooks like "those who drew the line between [[whites]] and [[people of color]]. AI is more [[minority]] now, but if the human population grows slower and AI capabilities grow faster, there will come a time when the human side will be in the minority in terms of total [[intellectual production capacity]].
