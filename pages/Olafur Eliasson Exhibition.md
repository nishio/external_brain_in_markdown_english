    - I forgot to take a picture of the bottom of the machine.
        - It's got a big weight on it and it's swinging around.

- [[plurality now]].

    - They say this is made by arranging [[space-filling polyhedra]].
- > The smallest unit that makes up the "cycle of interconnected moments in harmony" and "air for breathing" is a dual-objective polyhedron with 11 faces. The material used for this product is also unique. It is a recycled zinc alloy (90% zinc) made by a special method that extracts zinc (a trace amount of zinc that is considered safe to release into the atmosphere) from the smoke generated when industrial waste is burned (technical cooperation: KIBAKU).

    - > The 11-sided polyhedron can be rhombic, kite-shaped, or triangular, and any of the faces can be glued to each other without gaps. 11 is an odd number of faces, which results in unexpected meandering and a variety of shapes.
    - Oh, this one.
