> [fmfm_nknk](https://x.com/fmfm_nknk/status/1874797697225638055) The story about "[[uncool]]" becoming a word to describe personal [[integrity]] rather than taste in music reminded me of the Friday attack I was reminded of the praise for Beat Takeshi's press conference video after the Friday attack. Even if it is "bad" in terms of right and wrong, if it is based on consistent values and aesthetics, it is not lame and is cool.

Because it is a society with strong Intimacy, sexual assaults have been covered up by organizations, but if the concept of Integrity is brought in with the word "tacky," more people may be willing to accuse others, even within organizations.

But when they are told "You look tacky", not many people say "I was forced to be fashionable! I don't think there are many people who say "I was forced to be fashionable" when they are told "You're tacky!

I wonder if they are afraid of being put in a lower position in the world because of their inner sense of beauty and values.

> [fmfm_nknk](https://x.com/fmfm_nknk/status/1891074312058077298) The apology video by Romain Reijiwa is highly rated, and I felt that what is required now is not "[[Compliance]]" but "integrity" (self-integrity). I felt that "integrity" (self-integrity), not "[[Compliance]]," is what is required nowadays. [The behavior that seems to be based not on external compliance but on one's own [[consistent sense of beauty]].
> [fmfm_nknk](https://x.com/fmfm_nknk/status/1891075994464780438) I often hear from young comedy lovers that they want older comedians to stop using social networking sites because they are too lame. I often hear from younger comedians that they want older comedians to stop using social networking sites because it is too lame....

I think it can be said that the reason why they imply (intimate) is because the way they relate to the world is intimacy oriented.
> [fmfm_nknk](https://x.com/fmfm_nknk/status/1891081229694317036) That's exactly what sexual assault is about, it's about doing things to other people that would not be a problem if the relationship was intimate, and when you are popular from a very young age and the only people around you are your fans and relatives, you tend to feel like the whole world is intimate. When you are popular from a very young age and the only people around you are your fans and relatives, you tend to feel that the whole world is intimate, and it may become a problem only when you get older and are seen as other people by young people.

I imagine it might be difficult for them to admit that they disliked you because it shatters their worldview that "everything in the world is intimate".
