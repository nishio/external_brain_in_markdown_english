title: "The Five Ps"
---

- From [[DIPS Intellectual Productivity System]].
Not so good naming, but a way of thinking about [[prioritizing]] tasks. What determines the order of priority? From the top to the bottom.
- Copy that.
    - I don't care how you change it, as long as the other party agrees.
    - If you can't get it, you can't change it, and if you break this, you lose credibility.
- saving
    - If doing something by a certain deadline saves time overall, the priority of that task is temporarily increased
    - This is also the way to reduce overhead by bundling tasks
- time
    - Deadlines already given, meeting schedules, etc.
- embedded (e.g. software)
    - After schedule times are finalized, there can be gaps in between.
    - Put tasks that can be done in a pre-stocked half-hour at the half-hour.
    - In other words, we can say that "the priority of half tasks has temporarily increased".
- value
    - Selecting Tasks by Certainty of Value
    - If you're not sure which to execute first, choose the one with the clearest value.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I don't think so. This has the feel of someone "doing a given job."

It is impossible to say that they are listed alphabetically as Ryokai, Setsuyaku, Time, Umekomi, and Value.
