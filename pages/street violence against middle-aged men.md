title: "street violence against middle-aged men"
---

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3/icon' alt='o3.icon' height="19.5"/>The term "Oyaji-hunting" became a popular term in Japan in the mid-1990s for street robberies committed by groups of juveniles, mainly targeting middle-aged men (oyaji) who were returning home drunk, assaulting them, and robbing them of their money and goods. The media reported this crime as a symbol of "generational conflict" due to the combination of the stagnation of the younger generation caused by the economic stagnation and the fact that the middle-aged generation still holds the resources. Although it is in fact a form of juvenile crime, it is positioned as a social phenomenon unique to Japan because of the economic disparity between generations and the gap in values.

Definition and Etymology
- formation of a term
    - The term "father hunting" became popular after the mass media picked up on the term used by the perpetrators of a June 1996 robbery and manslaughter incident involving seven high school students and others in Funabashi City, Chiba Prefecture.

- meaning
    - It refers to the act of surrounding middle-aged or older men, such as office workers on their way home drunk, beating or blackmailing them, and robbing them of cash or wallets.

Historical Background and Expansion
- Economic stagnation in the 1990s and dissatisfaction among young people: It was analyzed that the "[[jobless]] ice age" after the bursting of the bubble economy made young people anxious about their future, and their frustration turned into acts of violence.
- According to the Police White Paper, robberies by high school students have surged by about 2.2 times since 1994, and the "old man hunt" is cited as a typical example of street robbery.

    - > And a popular new pastime of youth gangs is oyaji-gari, or "uncle hunting," which means finding a weary office worker on his way home from work, beating him up and robbing him.

Administrative and Judicial Responses
- Since 1997, there has been an active debate on the revision of the [[Juvenile Law]], and whether arrests should be made for those under the age of 14.

- The police set up an organized theft task force to strengthen street vigilance and reinforcement activities for juveniles.

Current Situation and Lessons Learned
- Since the 2000s, "father-hunting" as a term has been almost unheard of, and statistics show that street robberies are on the decline. However, it has been pointed out that hate feelings based on the generation gap remain in a different form on social networking sites.
- The aging of Japan's population and the poverty of its younger generation have created a "new intergenerational risk," and the possibility of a resurgence of violence is undeniable.
