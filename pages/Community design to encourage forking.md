> [realNuun](https://x.com/realNuun/status/1830508300129202547) We've been working hard to grow our [[Community]] service and it's going well, but I wonder if [[Number of Dunbars]] constraints make it impossible to scale around a single community when you want to scale indefinitely. However, I suddenly realized that it might be unreasonable to focus on a single community when we want to scale it infinitely because of the [[Number of Dunbars]] constraint. It seems to me that we need a structure that allows users to create multiple communities on their own.

> [askyvxi](https://x.com/askyvxi/status/1830530679307719045) I think Verrillon had what seemed to be the answer there.
>  We had a structure where communities were clustered in units of 50-150 people, focusing on some feature.
>  Ask akim and he will give you the details.

> [realNuun](https://x.com/realNuun/status/1830534076367016149) I see!
>  I can see it being loosely clustered in units of secondary collections in Beliron!

> [askyvxi](https://x.com/askyvxi/status/1830535601998967172) yes yes yes
>  You can fork the community by adding a few elements, and that is more than welcome.
>  We are also taking apart more and more the way we do forks. I was working on guidelines and making rails on how to fork.
>  I heard a story that referenced 2chan clustering or something like that.

> [realNuun](https://x.com/realNuun/status/1830537383907110989) I see...
>  It's so nice to share the community building process itself!

> [askyvxi](https://x.com/askyvxi/status/1830576074427601089) It is surprisingly difficult to get Japanese people to understand the concept of "permissionless secondary creation/expanding the community", which is generally accepted by the [[white list]] system. It is surprisingly difficult to get Japanese people to understand the concept of "you can create derivative works/expand the community without [[permissionless]]"! (which is not really a restriction at all), it seems to have spread more widely.

>  We also get a lot of inquiries like "Is it OK to use images generated by your service for ________? I think it is important to have a guideline!

> [askyvxi](https://x.com/askyvxi/status/1830582483374797152) It seems that even in Verrillon, no matter how much I said, Akim was getting inquiries!

> [realNuun](https://x.com/realNuun/status/1830582721305100576) Ethics, too often knocked over to the safe side~!
> [realNuun](https://x.com/realNuun/status/1830583089283932647) Verrillon's guidelines, not vague ones like "don't allow", but more realistic ones like "call people not to buy" or "can't support". I like it a lot!

> [askyvxi](https://x.com/askyvxi/status/1830584402897760491) I remember that we tried not to use strong words like "banned" because of practical considerations such as not wanting to choke off the buds of underground genres that we could not officially support but that were interesting and interesting, and also because we did not want to compromise our philosophy of being permission-less. I remember that we tried to avoid using strong words such as "prohibited" because we did not want to clog up the buds of genres that we could not officially support but that were interesting and underground.
