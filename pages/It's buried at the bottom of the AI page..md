I've been trying to trace the miracle of thought for a while now, and got confused because I couldn't quite trace it back, but here's what I've been thinking.

- 1: Write in a diary or work log
- 2: I'm stuck, so I "cut it out on a separate page, mark it 🤖 and make it eligible for AI processing."
- 3: Look at the AI output and move on
- 4: In retrospect, the human thought is buried at the end of the page marked 🤖.

I'm like, "Of course you do.
- We also need to consider what we need to do for the future after we use AI.


- [[Wiki mode]]
- > Hybrid mode, with the upper half in document mode and the lower half in thread mode
- Given this, maybe the AI should write on the bottom and a human picks and writes on the top.
