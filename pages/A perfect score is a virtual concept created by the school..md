title: "A perfect score is a virtual concept created by the school."

> [daijapan](https://twitter.com/daijapan/status/1743043777475031346) The act of making is a continual acceptance of imperfection. A perfect score is a virtual concept created by schools. No matter where you go in society, problems never go away. The act of making is to move forward little by little while accepting that imperfection, which always has problems.
>  Life begins and ends with "problems". However, we can be convinced. But we can be convinced, and we can only be convinced by what we think and do.
>
>  So what can we do to reduce "[[never-ending point reductionism]]"? You have to be a [[creator]]. Because then you can realize the importance of making somehow in the midst of all the problems and [[insufficient resources]].
>  There is no problem-free state in society, only "degrees" of how much of a problem exists.

>  When I think about [[point reductionism]], I think that [[standardism]] is behind it. If you think about it, in order to think in terms of point reduction, there must first be a "perfect score".
>  However, there is no such thing as a perfect score in the 100m, for example; even if we define 10"00 as a perfect score, there are times when a runner runs in the 9-second range, and if we evaluate the 9-second range, it becomes a point system.
>  Therefore, the point reduction system is based on the premise that a perfect score is the standard, from which points are subtracted for evaluation.
>
>  I think that reductionism is also a standardization principle and contributes in many ways to maintaining uniform quality.


> [daijapan](https://twitter.com/daijapan/status/1743041366232531397) If reductionism loses sight of the standard, it can become a mindset that focuses solely on problems. We will continue to focus on our own problems, on the problems of others, and on the problems of society.
>  The definition of a perfect score was created virtually by schools. There is no perfect score in society, in others, or in yourself, no matter how far you go. There has never been a place in the history of mankind, anywhere on earth, where there has not been a problem.
>
>  This is sometimes called perfectionism, but I call it "never-ending point reductionism" because we often do not even have a standard for what constitutes perfection. Out of subtractive point reductionism, the standard has gone away, leaving only the habit of just continuing to subtract points.
>  The never-ending reductionist continues to lament. Because there is no end.

If you are not a "maker" and you are frustrated, it is healthy to think that your frustration is amplified because you are not actually making anything.
