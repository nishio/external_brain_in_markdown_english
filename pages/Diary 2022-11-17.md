There have been a lot of empty diaries lately.
- Wrote one line 6 days ago [[Diary 2022-11-11]].
    - You're talking about putting together a study group document.
- 10 days ago [[Diary 2022-11-07]].
    - This is a story about starting to put together materials for a study group and a Pikmin Bloom event.
    - To summarize, the past 10 days have been filled with input and output for study group materials and a lot of walking, and I haven't been able to get around to my diary.
- 14 days ago [[Diary 2022-11-03]].
    - Debriefing session on the results of the Unexplored Junior
    - Oh, I see.
    - I kept a diary rather well until about 10/30.
