The [[Sword of Damocles]] is a sword suspended by horsehair above the throne, which could fall at any moment.

If I become senile, I must commit seppuku quickly."
In the context of "intercede for me if I'm getting senile."
No, there's no guarantee I'll be in my right mind at that point."
He said, "So we need to automate it through AI."

In this topic, the metaphor of the "sword of Damocles" indicates a state of constant presence of potential danger or threat. The original legend begins with Damocles' admiration for the wealth and power of Dionysios, the pretender of Syracuse, and envy of his position. To demonstrate to Damocles the danger and precariousness of his position, Dionysios sets up a sword suspended by a thin horsehair above his throne, under which Damocles is to dine. This sword symbolizes the constant danger and threat that accompanies power. Damocles ultimately cannot bear this instability and fear and abandons his desire for riches and power.

The term "senility" refers to the state of being stuck in stereotypes with age, unable to accept new changes and advances. This metaphor suggests the idea that an individual should end his or her role at a point at which he or she is potentially harmful to society and surroundings.

The original Sword of Damocles story has a deeper meaning: the recognition of power, responsibility, and the constant danger that comes with it. Applying this story to contemporary AI technology and the concept of "aging" allows us to consider various aspects of technological progress, including its uncertainties and ethical responsibilities, as well as the individual's ability to adapt to such progress.
