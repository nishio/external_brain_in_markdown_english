> [@ichiro_satoh](https://twitter.com/ichiro_satoh/status/1550053540957405184): When I am asked about NFT and Web 3.0 in interviews, I answer "NFT and Web 3.0 are modern [[alchemy]]. I answer, "NFT and Web 3.0 are the [[alchemy]] of our time. Many people assume that they can do what is technically impossible. On the other hand, I do not deny that the process of exploring NFT and Web 3.0 will produce something derivative, just as the knowledge of alchemy in the Middle Ages led to chemistry in later times.

Good [[even if]].
- Whether a goal is [[feasible]] or not is not the same as whether the activities aimed at that goal are [[beneficial]] or not.
