51It is easy to inadvertently imagine or understand a ladder model in which those with more knowledge teach and those with less are taught, but this is not correct. What is incorrect?
(Audience: When one person teaches more than one person, that person's preconceived notions are eventually just distributed to all.) That is astute. Excellent point. But I'm going to take a few more steps to get there, so I'll change the subject a bit. More knowledge, less knowledge.

52The person with more knowledge teaches the person with less knowledge teaches the person with less knowledge. You are 16 years old and the teacher is 33 years old, so you are twice as old as each other. There is a division of roles between those who teach and those who are taught. It seems as if there is a clear difference in knowledge. But as I progressed through college and into the workforce, this gap narrowed. I have a junior colleague in graduate school who is about that age. He has more life experience than I do, but I teach math. The division of roles between those who teach and those who are taught will disappear. More knowledge, less knowledge.


Next comes the much-used "[[Learn from those with little knowledge.]]" diagram: [[Exchange knowledge and learn from each other]].
