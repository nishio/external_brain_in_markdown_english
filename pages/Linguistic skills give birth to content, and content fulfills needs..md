[[linguistic competence]] gives birth to [[contents]] and contents fulfill [[needs]].

This post itself is an amazing linguistic ability.
An example in itself.

> Q: What is so great about Kenshu? Even if he has never created a money-making business, does it make him great if he sells his company?
>  A: If you try to analyze this with the understanding that "Kensuu-san must be a person who is evaluated by results," you will lose the translation.

>  - the result of that action is not what is being evaluated.
>  - "Explain in language why you did that action, etc." is content, and the content itself fulfills a need.

Linguistic skills give birth to content, and content fulfills needs.

>  It's not that the person is getting a lot of recognition or attention, it's more like "the content is being read, and the reason why the content is being read is because it explains the reason for the action in a slightly different way than others".

>  There are not many other places where you can take the commentary that critics and others have been doing for a long time, act on it yourself, and then give your own commentary, so it fills a niche need. In the case of critics, the commentary is only consequential and has no effect on subsequent actions, but if you act on your own, give your own commentary, and then act again, the commentary has an effect on the next action, and that's where the interest comes in, I think the structure is such that the commentary has an effect on the next action.

>  Yes.

>  So, people are browsing content, not people.

>  I thought it would be easier to understand if I took this premise into account, since misinterpretation here makes it difficult to interpret!
