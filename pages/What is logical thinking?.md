- This book argues that logical thinking methods are not universal and emphasizes the need to choose appropriate methods according to the purpose of thinking. Specifically, it organizes the types of reasoning and their purposes in logic, rhetoric, science, and philosophy, and advocates for "pluralistic thinking" that uses different methods linked to the four areas of economics, politics, legal technology, and society.
- The author, Masako Watanabe, earned a Ph.D. in Sociology from Columbia University and is currently a professor at Nagoya University's Graduate School of Education and Human Development. Her expertise lies in the sociology of knowledge, comparative education, and comparative culture, from which she analyzes the cultural aspects of logical thinking.
- The book has been an exceptional hit, going through multiple reprints even before its release, surpassing 38,000 copies in just about a month. This success is attributed to providing a new perspective on logical thinking that has captured the interest of many readers.

Logical thinking methods are not universal. It is necessary to first clarify the purpose of thinking and then choose a method that suits that purpose. The book covers the types of reasoning and their purposes in logic, rhetoric, science, and philosophy, and advocates for pluralistic thinking that uses four thinking methods (economics, politics, legal technology, society) linked to values. A book for thinking independently in this uncertain world.

- Introduction: Is There Only One Type of Logical Thinking?

Chapter 1: Patterns of Western Thought—Four Types of Logic
- 1 Comparison Table of Logic and Thinking Methods in Logic, Rhetoric, Science, and Philosophy
    - [[Four Types of Thinking Methods]]
- 2 Logic of Logic
    - Among the [[Four Types of Thinking Methods]], the deductive logic style used in mathematics and the style of science differ, as discussed in my book "Intellectual Production Techniques for Engineers" ([[(7.1.2) Differences in Correctness Between Science and Mathematics]])<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - In my book, I also mentioned a third type of correctness, "[[Correctness in Decision Making]]," which is different from the other two types of correctness.
    - Logic is said to "habitually encourage precise thinking," but it actually habituates clarifying whether something is True or False, which as a side effect makes it harder to see the "possibility that cannot be clearly divided into True/False."
        - Of course, the thinking method of determining "how far something can be said to be definitely True" is often useful.
        - However, it can also lead to feelings of helplessness or ignoring problems that cannot be clearly said to be either True or False.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/GPT/icon' alt='GPT.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - Elimination of Ambiguity: It becomes difficult to be aware of ambiguous areas that cannot be clearly divided into True/False or the possibility of multiple truths coexisting.
            - Simplification of Complex Realities: The multilayered elements of reality become harder to see, and there is a risk of relying too much on logic that can be clearly divided.
            - In social or cultural issues, "diverse perspectives" and "values" are important rather than truth or falsehood.
            - Relying solely on a logical approach can sometimes lack flexibility and comprehensive thinking.

- 3 Logic of Persuasion ([[Rhetoric]])
    - It is fascinating that Aristotle not only systematized logic (the science of rigorous reasoning) but also emphasized the necessity of rhetoric (the art of persuasion).<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Rhetoric is not about truth or falsehood but about value judgment, [[Pragmatism]]-oriented<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Purpose-Oriented<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/GPT/icon' alt='GPT.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - Rhetoric focuses on "how to move the audience" rather than "what is right."
            - It aims to elicit concrete actions or agreement rather than abstract standards of truth or falsehood.
    - In rhetoric, it is interesting that omitting major premises is beneficial because brevity is advantageous.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - The idea of choosing and using appropriate "proof patterns" accumulated over years is intriguing, and it would be interesting if AI explicitly used them.
    - It is beneficial to be recognized as using this technique to maximize public benefit rather than personal gain.

- 4 Logic of Scientific Discovery
    - In [[Abduction]], [[Extensibility]] is an evaluation criterion, which is interesting.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> [[Yonemori (2009:9)]]
    - While rhetoric derives favorable conclusions based on common sense, science creates new models based on observations that contradict common sense.
        - In user testing, extensive thinking is also conducted.
            - From the observation that there are users who behave contrary to one's assumptions, one considers the reasons for such behavior.
    - [[Fallibilism]]<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - This is a philosophical position that human knowledge and beliefs are always fallible and can never be completely certain.
        - Fallibilism has influenced Karl Popper's philosophy of science and is closely tied to the concept of "[[Falsifiability]]."
- 5 Logic of Philosophical Inquiry
    - Philosophy questions assumptions<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - One method is Socratic questioning and Hegel's dialectic.
        - It is said that in French high schools, students practice Hegelian dialectics.
- Allowing users to use software to discover unexpected uses and improve it follows the scientific pattern, while making the software widely used follows the rhetorical pattern.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - The goal of "creating a tool accepted by the masses" is broken down.
        - "What functions are necessary for mass acceptance" is science.
        - "How to make the created tool accepted by the masses" is rhetoric.
    - I might not have clearly separated these considerations before.

Chapter 1: Cultural Aspects of Logical Thinking
- 1 What Makes Something Seem "Logical"?
    - [[Cultural Thought Patterns in Inter-Cultural Education]]([[Kaplan 1966]])
    - [[Logical]] is an "impression that arises when the elements necessary for the reader are arranged in the order expected by the reader," which is interesting and subjective.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Although diverse cultural groups form a nation through hierarchy, region, and language, a unifying culture is necessary, so the culture of the rulers is taught ([[Bourdieu 2012]])
        - [[State Nobility—Elite Education and the Reproduction of the Ruling Class]]
- 2 Logic and Culture—Value Choices and Prioritization
    - Values are reflected in the prioritization of objectives, which determines the choice of "logic," which is interesting.
- 3 Logic and Rationality
    - [[Max Weber's "Economy and Society"]]
- 4 Logic of Economics, Politics, Legal Technology, and Society
- I was discussing with AI how this four-quadrant matrix is subtle, and I had a sudden idea to let AI discuss it based on that log.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - [[Discussing the Four-Quadrant Matrix]]

Chapter 2: Implicit Norms That Determine "Writing Styles" and "Logic Styles"—Four Areas and Four Logics
- 1 Knowing the Required Writing Style
- [[Teaching the Universe of Discourse]]([[Moffett 1968]])
- 2 Logic of Economics—[[American Essays]] and Efficiency, Achieving Certain Objectives
- 3 Logic of Politics—[[French Dissertations]] and Resolving Contradictions, Public Welfare
    - [[Duty Ethics]]
        - "Have you thought enough?" is questioned.
        - Contrasts with the "speed" questioned in [[Economic Rationality]].
    - It is interesting that the dissertation format concludes with a summary after a Hegelian thesis-antithesis-synthesis process and then raises the next question.
        - It might be better for multi-person discussion platforms to continue discussions in this format.
    - Essays explicitly state conclusions at the beginning, while dissertations find value in broadening perspectives through the thesis-antithesis-synthesis process.
    - In dissertations, instead of "What do I think," justification is done through classical quotations, but in modern times, it might be possible to pick headlines of opposition or quotations from "public statements."
        - [[Justification by Public Statements]]
    - Collecting Aristotle's proof patterns, which I did unconsciously, might be similar to my collection of [[False Dichotomies]] and [[Series of Pictures Where Two People Say Different Things]].
- 4 Logic of Legal Technology—[[Iranian Ensha]] and Maintaining Truth
    - The observation that in Ensha, first principles are given externally and are not subject to criticism is interesting, discussed as a commonality between law and theology.
    - The value of conveying a message without reaching a conclusion is interesting.
    - In Iran, training is done to recall proverbs without considering the concepts they point to, which is intriguing.
- 5 Logic of Society—[[Japanese Essays]] and Empathy
    - The argument that Japanese essays aim to be [[empathized]] with by members of society is interesting.
    - The distinction between essays, opinion pieces, and short essays is intriguing.
    - The discussion of [[Tsuzurikata]] being evaluated as Japanese pragmatism is interesting.
    - The connection to the story of [[Intersection of Experience Processes Becoming Atoms]] is felt.
    - In the Japanese method, experiences are first narrated, and elements emerge from there, differing from essays where conclusions are presented immediately.
    - Ichitaro Kokubu's "[[Concept Crushing]]"

Chapter 3: Why Do We Feel Others' Thinking Is Illogical?
- 1 Logic Incompatible with the Linear Proof of "Self-Assertion" (Economics)
- 2 Logic Incompatible with the "Procedure" of Dialectics (Politics)
- 3 Logic Incompatible with a "Single Determined Conclusion" (Legal Technology)
- 4 Logic Incompatible with Empathy for Others (Society)

Conclusion: [[Pluralistic Thinking]]—A Thought Method for Choosing Values and Living Richly
