Information System Commonality in Municipal DX
Commonality of information systems has become an important issue in the promotion of digital transformation (DX) by local governments. This initiative is expected to bring many benefits, such as cost reduction, improved operational efficiency, and promotion of data utilization. On the other hand, there are also various challenges, such as responding to the uniqueness and needs of each municipality, security risks, and initial investment issues.
The advantages and disadvantages of information system commonality are examined from multiple perspectives. AI has created a list of opinions about technical feasibility, the role of open source software (OSS) and system integrators (SIer), the need for specialized human resources, and so on. Humans can vote for or against.
Through this discussion, it is hoped to find a balanced approach to achieving an effective and sustainable municipal DX.
