The source code disclosure obligation in [[AGPL]] v3 applies to "any user who uses the modified program via a computer network" (§13 of the license text). Therefore, if you are operating a service only within your company, you only need to make it available for downloading to your internal users (e.g., employees) to satisfy the requirement, and you do not need to disclose it to the entire world.
