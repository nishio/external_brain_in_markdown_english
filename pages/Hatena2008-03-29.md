Oh, I'm feeling very sleepy right now.

I'm going home and going to bed.

*1206813189* Misbuttoning the brain
My body and brain are tired because I was up until 31:00 yesterday and went to bed from there. I want to sleep. But my spirit is elated and does not want to rest. I am in trouble.

In the meantime, I am drinking plum wine, etc. I am afraid it will have the opposite effect.

I guess the most reasonable solution would be to get a prescription for Myslee. However, it's a pain in the ass to buy a drug without a prescription. On the other hand, once you've experienced it, over-the-counter drugs seem like crackpots.
