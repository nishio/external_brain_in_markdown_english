- I looked at [Illustrated Navigation Premiere Pro](http://okiniweb.web.fc2.com/zukainavi/premiere/24.html) but couldn't find the add keyframe button.
- [add, move, and set keyframes](https://helpx.adobe.com/jp/premiere-pro/using/adding-navigating-setting-keyframes.html)
    - Which button is described as "the 'animation on/off' button in the effects control panel?"
    - The icon to the left of "Scale" is it.

    - This is how it changes when pressed.
