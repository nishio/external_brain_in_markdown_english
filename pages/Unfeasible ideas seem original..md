title: "Unfeasible ideas seem original."
---

- [[Amateur ideas may appear original in oral presentations, but they are not feasible.]]
- In an experiment in which a professional and a layperson gave presentations on their ideas and many college students (laypersons) evaluated them, there was no difference in the evaluation of originality between the professional and the layperson, but most of the laypersons failed to realize their ideas.
        - [[The fact that an idea looks novel should not be used as a reason for adoption.]]
        - [[The more people who have never completed a project, the more "great ideas" they generate.]]
        - [[Ideas that are not feasible are worthless.]]

[[unfeasible]] idea appears to be [original
