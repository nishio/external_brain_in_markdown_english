title: "Parable of the Go"
---

- If we compare it to [[go]], placing a stone without looking at the opponent's move is not [[efficient]], and moving in direct response to the opponent's move is not [[first move]].

Similarly, in [[life strategy]], it is not efficient to move without seeing what is going on in the [[outside world]], and it is not efficient to move in direct response to what is going on in the outside world, and it is not efficient to move in direct response to what is going on in the outside world and not get ahead of the curve.
    - [[Proactive and Reactive]]
- [[toying]].

But there are some differences from Go, however.
- Go is all [[observable]] and [[values]] are clearly defined and common.
- The world is largely [[unobservable]] and values differ from player to player.
- So, even in a situation where in Go, "in this situation, it is [[the most suitable]] to play here," whether one can know the situation in the first place differs from person to person, and what is the most suitable for the same thing differs from person to person
        - [[People who are missing opportunities don't see opportunities.]]
