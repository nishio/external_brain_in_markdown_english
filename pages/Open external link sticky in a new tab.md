    - [[Scrapbox Sticky Notes]] [[External link sticky note]] to read more about it.
    - [Display and organize each Scrapbox page as an item
    - Read in detail -> scroll through Scrapbox to find the desired link -> tedious
- Should be able to jump directly from external link stickies
    - Slot a sticky note with additional information
    - I made `local_info.url`.
    - I thought about setting it to `extra` because it is additional information, but then I thought, "Values not stored on the server should be distinguished".
