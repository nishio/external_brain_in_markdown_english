title: "Premature optimization is the root of all evil."
---

> In DonaldKnuth's paper "StructuredProgrammingWithGoToStatements", he wrote: "Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%."
- [[Donald Knuth]] writes in his paper "[[Structured Programming With Go To Statements]]": "Programmers waste an inordinate amount of time thinking and worrying about the speed of unimportant parts of their programs. Such attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are taken into account. 97% of small efficiency gains should be forgotten. Premature optimization is the root of all evil. However, we must not miss the crucial 3% of opportunities." (translated by Nishio)
