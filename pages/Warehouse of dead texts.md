title: "Warehouse of dead texts"
---

It's a mixed metaphor.

- A [[warehouse]] is usually a place to store "things to be taken out and used in the future.
You don't put dead people in a warehouse. We don't put dead people in a warehouse; we put dead people in a graveyard. [[Graveyard of dead documents]]
What is the state of the text being "dead"?
- There's "not to be updated in the future" and "not to be referenced in the future."
- Even texts that are not updated can generate new sprouts from them.
        - [[A case study of a new sprout growing from a text that was dead due to social triggers.]]
