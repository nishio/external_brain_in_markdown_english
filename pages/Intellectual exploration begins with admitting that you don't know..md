title: "Intellectual exploration begins with admitting that you don't know."

> [@sugimoto_kei](https://twitter.com/sugimoto_kei/status/1601836249412562944?s=20&t=k3FeEzQHmB_PX8ApR-ji8A): Perhaps in our time, [[knowledge]] is [[ social hierarchy]]. So, to frankly say "[[I don't understand...]]" about something important is taken as an expression of [[weakness]]/[[inefficiency]]. By the individual more than by anyone else.
> This is not an intellectual attitude. Intellectual inquiry starts with [[Admit you don't know what you don't know]].

It's lame that people who think the amount of knowledge is a social pecking order don't realize [[Computers are overwhelming]].

    - [[Afraid to say, "I don't know."]]
