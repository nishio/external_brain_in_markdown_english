When AI removes the constraints of human implementation, it moves to a fast but fragile regime of speculatour dominance.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The constraints of implementing a social system by humans meant that both [[speculator]] and [[ranche]] were needed and a cycle was occurring, but when those constraints are removed and ranche can be more effectively replaced by AI, the equilibrium point should move, right?

I understand your subject. In line with the framework of Pareto's General Sociological Outline (residues/derivatives, elite cycles, "fox = scheming type" and "lion = coercive type"), I would like to introduce the "speculatur (speculator/innovator)" and the "lanthier (written as lanche)". (written as "lanche"; "speculatour" and "lantier"). Landlords = conservatives)" dynamics are recaptured in a situation where the AI relaxes implementation constraints.

Main point (conclusion first)
- Conservative and repetitive tasks such as "rule compliance, supervision, accounting, tax collection, and standardization," which were operated and enforced manually, are likely to be replaced by AI. This is Pareto-like automation of Lantier functions, and the equilibrium is likely to shift in the direction of a higher ratio on the speculatour side.
- At the same time, however, AI can also enhance "foxes" (scheming and combinations = Class I residues) such as propaganda generation, search for loopholes in the system, arbitrage, and binding operations. As a result, a highly agile but fragile equilibrium of "too much intrigue x coercion guaranteed by AI "** is likely to emerge.
- Furthermore, if AI turns enforcement, monitoring, and credit allocation with high precision, the "lion" function will also turn without human intervention, and a polarization can occur: either a slowdown of the elite cycle (rigidity) or, conversely, a high-speed cycle (preference shift in a short period of time)**.

Correspondence with Pareto Vocabulary
- Speculatur: novel combination, arbitrage, opportunity creation (Class I residues = combinatorial, change-oriented / fox-like)
- Lanthier: vested, dividend, order, persistence (Class II residues = clump retention/lionic)
- Cyclical: The ratio of the two swings historically, and the side with excesses leads to self-destruction and reaction.

Equilibrium movement when constraints are removed (mechanism)
1. lower mounting cost C → automation of the lantier function
    - Processes that belong to "maintenance" such as audit, credit, inventory, bureaucratic operations, regulatory compliance, and collection are easier to rule out, and AI auto-piloting will lower marginal costs.
    - As a result, the amount of human lantier required will decrease -> more institutional changes and new schemes proposed by the speculatour will be tried out (faster implementation).
2. consequences of volatility
    - When Lantier's "friction" is weakened, the frequency of innovation adoption rises. However, if the AI is also responsible for enforcement and detection, the frequency of crashes will increase while the amplitude of crashes will be suppressed (a series of detailed trial-and-error).
    - In Pareto fashion, the dominance of Class I residues is likely to be prolonged, but the supply of justification (derivation) is also sufficient for AI generation, so justification is shallow and fragile.
3. two new (unstable) equilibria
    - A: Schematic Dominance x Forced Automation
        - Speculatour driven. Rules operation, collection and elimination are coldly executed by AI.
        - Prediction: speed of policy/product trials up/withdrawals also fast, "thinness" of institutions (weak internalization by people).
    - B: Techno-bureaucratic fixation
        - Conversely, AI maximizes Class II residues (persistence), suppressing risk preference and stopping the cycle.
        - Prediction: High efficiency, but fragile (will collapse during disturbances). Innovation will be isolated outside the "sandbox".

Additional Pareto implications
- Change in style of circulation: Algorithm renewal, not human replacement, becomes the unit of circulation. Even if the apparent elite turnover is reduced, model renewal is the real turnover.
- Automatic supply of derivatives (ideology): AI mass-produces "explanations," diluting the depth of consensus. Short-term synchronization is easy to achieve, but resistance can also be amplified nonlinearly, driven by AI.
- Selection and Signaling: When the gatekeeping function originally performed by the Lantier layer (setting the threshold for credit creation) becomes algorithmic, the selection criteria become continuously optimal → risk of local optimum lock-in.

Observable indicators (field test of equilibrium movement)
- (1) Compliance/back office AI automation rate (% of headcount and % of operating costs).
- (ii) Half-life of institutional change (frequency of revision of rules and policies and radius of impact).
- (iii) The origin of generation of justification documents (human/AI) and the degree of internalization of citizens and employees (duration of following).
- (iv) Recovery curves during crises (Type A is frequent and small in amplitude, Type B is rare but catastrophic).
- (5) **Redefining the role of the "human lantier "** (moving from asset dividends to institutional design audits and values governance).

Design implications (if desired balance)
- Double braking: a) make reversibility/audit logs mandatory for enforcement to be implemented by AI, b) gradual introduction to speculatour proposal (phase gate).
- Residue portfolio management: institutional allocation of Class I (combination) and Class II (retention) within the organization (e.g., scale-limited experimental quota + change factor limit for production systems).
- Justification "depth" requirement: connect participatory rebuttal procedures to AI-generated derivations (lower cost of deliberation windows/objections).
- Visualization of cycles: Time series of model updates and threshold changes are disclosed as "quasi-elite changes" rather than by people.

summary
As you point out, the more the constraint of human implementation fades, the more easily Lantier-like functions are substituted by AI, and the more the equilibrium tends to shift to speculatour overload. On the other hand, AI also makes the lion's share of functions (enforcement and monitoring) more efficient, so the equilibrium tends to polarize into either a high-speed cycle of "speculatour overabundance x forced automation" or a cyclical halt of "techno-bureaucratic fixation. Since either swing will increase fragility, the key point is to incorporate reversibility, auditability, staged introduction, and participatory rebuttal into the institutional design.
