<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Hopefully some thoughts will develop on the relationship between motivational systems and Keichobot.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "Keichobot" is this "Keichobot"?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "system" is this "system"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>A motivational system is a system that motivates by asking questions and giving advice. I think it's a little related to asking questions and being specific.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that "system"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Motivation systems have been used to a point, but I'm beginning to question my basic premise. I think the assumption that there is such a thing as "motivation," that the problem is the lack of it, and that all you have to do is produce it, is false.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It is good if people spend time with a pleasant feeling and produce output that is socially valuable. Motivation has nothing to do with it. Motivation for a task that produces garbage will only produce garbage efficiently.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "motivation" is that?

- Where is this "system" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>When I made this, I didn't have the concept of serverless yet and realized the app with static delivery and GoogleAnalytics. If we rebuilt it now, we could take richer information for each user and give more appropriate advice.

- How do you know this "system"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I was going to collect data and do machine learning. It turned out to be just an if statement.

- Is there anything else you can tell us about this "motivation"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>When the tasks to be done are not clear, or there are multiple tasks to be done but the priorities are not clear, etc., you will not be able to move forward. When this is solved, the user will be able to move forward. Users sometimes express this as "I'm not motivated" or "I want to be motivated," but that is a statement that does not grasp their own needs, similar to "I want a fast horse.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What does that "motivation" seem to be?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>There are a number of factors that "impede progress." The presence of these is vaguely described as "lack of motivation. Motivation" is the opposite of that, a shadow of

- How do you know you are "motivated" to do this?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I've used Keichobot myself for various purposes, and feel that it has been "very beneficial to the progress of the project" by breaking down tasks that are too large or breaking the balance of priorities, which I think is what we need.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "task" is this "task"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>What to do. Often there are times when it is not clear what to do. Sometimes there is more than one, and then one can only do one at a time, so one must choose

- Where is this "motivation"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It's like a porthole, it doesn't exist.

- Where is this "system" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I have yet to find a system anywhere that combines a motivational system with a system that asks questions and provides clarification.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between its "motivation" and its "system"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>The system solves the impeded state.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen with respect to that "system"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It's not yet clear how to combine them, so it would be nice to know.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to the "system" for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Need to clarify what needs to be clarified by the question.

- What does this "system" look like?
