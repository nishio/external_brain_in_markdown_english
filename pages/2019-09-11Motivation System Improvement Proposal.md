    - [[motivating system]]
- There was a vague sense that focusing on "[[willingness (e.g., to do something)]]" might be a mistake.
- A little more verbalization today.
- People who are in a situation where they have fixed "things to do" and are not "motivated" to do them.
    - "How do I get motivated?" implicitly affirms the fixation on "doing."
    - But I'm not sure that fixation on "doing" is correct.
    - Unless it's something that would kill you if you didn't do it, the thought that you "should" do it is wrong in itself.
    - 'I have to do it because it's my job' - implicitly ignores the option of quitting the job.
    - Is it really a "must do"?
    - Wouldn't it be appropriate to ignore the observed fact that "I don't feel like doing it?"
    - Keep doing what you truly find [interesting
    - If it's not fun, if it's not motivating, then don't do it.
        - [[KJ method for "interesting"]] related to
    - Need a system to collect what motivates you and what does not motivate you in order to encourage verbalization of what you find interesting
