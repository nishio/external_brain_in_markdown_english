Yukito Emorya sees "[[nation]]," "[[capital]]," and "[[nation]]" as distinct, and in recent years has emphasized the concept of "[[association]]. In his book "[[Toward a World Republic]]," he aims to go beyond the concept of "capital=nation=nation. In his book, "Toward a World Republic," he aims to go beyond the concept of "capital=nation=state," in which the nation is related to "fraternal feelings" and "(the power of) imagination," and the "civil society" = "market economy," which is the expression of "enlightenment" and "sensitivity," can be integrated only through the imagination. It is said that only the imagination can synthesize the two.

    - > The terms "[[market exchange]], [[reciprocity]], [[redistribution]]" by economic anthropologist [[Karl Polanyi]] are paraphrased as "capital, nation, state" and [[association]] is presented as an aufheben to it.

Nation, on the other hand, is generally understood as a people, nation (nation-state), or ethnicity. In Emiya's view, the fundamental difference between the use of Nation and Nation is that Nation is a more imaginative concept, while Nation refers to a concrete political entity based on enlightenment. His concept of association (which paraphrases economic anthropologist Karl Polanyi's market exchange, reciprocity, and redistribution in terms of capital, nation, and state) is positioned as a means to aufheben (transcend) these The "Aufheben" is a term that is used in the following way.

The use of "Nation" and "Nation" in Emaya's argument is closely related to his extensive philosophical and literary research and can be seen as part of his efforts to understand the various forms and modes of exchange in society and to seek new forms of integration that transcend them.
- That's why you're using the word "Nation" to describe a reciprocal group as part of this effort.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
