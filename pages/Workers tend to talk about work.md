title: "Workers tend to talk about work"
---

[[Workers]] tend to talk a lot about what they did and how much they did it (and how hard it was).
But others are not interested in "what and how much the worker did.
They are only interested in "why we did the work" and "what we learned as a result."

- Difference in interpretation of whether [[work]] done is [[results]] or [[result of work]] is the outcome.
