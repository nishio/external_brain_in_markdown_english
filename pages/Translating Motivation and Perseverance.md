<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Someone has machine translated "motivation", "perseverance", and "competitive spirit" into English and is having trouble getting them all to be Motivation. Alternative.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>We suggest appropriate English expressions for each word.
- Yarugi - Motivation Alternatives:.
    - Enthusiasm
    - Drive (Driving force)
    - Eagerness
- Konki - Motivation Alternatives:.
    - Perseverance
    - Patience
    - Tenacity
- Makenai ki - Motivation Alternatives:.
    - Fighting spirit
    - Determination
    - Competitive spirit
    - Never-give-up attitude
I believe these alternatives are English expressions that more appropriately capture the nuances of each Japanese word. By using them in different situations, you will be able to convey your intentions more accurately.

# GPT4
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Someone has machine translated "motivation", "perseverance", and "competitive spirit" into English and is having trouble getting them all to be Motivation. Alternative.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The following are alternatives to each of these expressions:
- Motivation: Motivation / Enthusiasm / Willingness
- Perseverance / Persistence / Endurance
- Determination / Resilience / Grit
These alternatives are the English expressions that most closely match the meaning and nuance of the respective Japanese words.

I've come to the conclusion that Claude 3 Opus is better than Human and GPT4, although it's a close call.
