title: "There are two types of social capital"
---

from [[Isn't membership-based employment necessary to accumulate knowledge and social relationships? #65cdc3aaaff09e00003a362a]]
- I've noticed that there are two "[[SOC]]" as well, and there's a swing in interpretation between them and the reader.
    - A: [[Internal relationships]].
    - B: [[External Relationships]].
    - I was picturing the B's.
            - [[Parallel work is an opportunity for knowledge inflow]]
            - [[There are two channels for information to flow into the organization]]
            - [[path dependency]]
    - In short, I was writing in an overly abstract way about [[knowledge inflow channels]] that are [[tightly coupled to individuals]].


- [[Two types.]]
