title: "Digital Signatures in Taiwan's Anti-Fraud Law"

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>I will quote the part of Audrey's talk at [[Meetup with Audrey & Glen]] about the case for "using DID/VC to prevent fraudulent ads on platforms like Facebook" and then briefly summarize the points.

> (Audrey TANG)
>  “Well, I think it is not about incentivizing the individual citizens. It is about incentivizing the people who consume those DIDs or Verifiable Credentials. You need to create a strong incentive for them to verify the digital signature. If they don’t verify, or they verify in a bad way, there needs to be very strong liability if you don’t verify.
>  For example, a couple weeks ago the Taiwan parliament passed a law called the Anti-Fraud Act, and in the Act it says: because there are too many deepfakes on Facebook and many places, celebrities — many of their photos are used in those advertisements to sell cryptocurrency or something like that. And they don’t like it, right?
>  So we now say: to post any advertisement on social media that has the potential to reach 10% of our people on Facebook and so on, first, like TikTok, they have to register in Taiwan, a local presence — otherwise, we will block them. Now when they post such advertisement with people’s face on it, they need to get a digital signature from that person. So if you see Audrey Tang selling you cryptocurrency, Audrey Tang needs to sign that advertisement. If Audrey Tang doesn’t sign, and somebody gets scammed for 1 million, then Facebook will be liable to pay that 1 million.”

Point Explanation
- Mandatory "[[digital signature]] of the person" using [[DID/VC]].
    - Taiwan's Anti-Fraud Act stipulates that "if a celebrity's photo is used in a social networking ad, the celebrity's digital signature (DID/VC) must be verified.
    - By making the platform liable for damages if any damage is caused by false advertisements, "identity verification before advertisement placement" will be enforced.
- Ensure enforceability by "holding platforms accountable."
    - If damage is caused by an advertisement not signed by a celebrity, the social networking operator (e.g., Facebook) is compensated for the damage.
    - Since mere subsidies and incentives will not move the platform, the strong pressure of "legal liability (compensation)" will promote the implementation of identity verification by DID/VCs.
- Combining Fraud Prevention and DID Penetration
    - This was cited as a concrete example of promoting the use of digital signatures as a trust infrastructure (DID/VC) while addressing the pressing issue of eliminating fraudulent advertising.
    - The effect will be to speed up the implementation and penetration of DID/VC by introducing it in areas of high social need (fraud prevention).
