- Problem: When there is an error in the input layout data, the screen does not update and the service appears to be not working.
    - At a minimum, error messages should be displayed in the event of an error
    - It's hard to show where you're wrong, but I can give you "how far you're right".
- The fix was easy, but the build doesn't work.
    - `$ npm run build`
:

```
Could not find a required file.
	Name: index.js
```


2020-01-17 Made `"egaka"` and `["e", "ga", "ka"]` acceptable.
:

```
"ðŸ¤”".length
2
```

- to display characters that are considered two characters, such as
        - [[ðŸ¤”Key]]


:

```
[["?  shi", "nade", "jugeke", "mozese", "", "bamiha", "dooto", "ginoiki", "pyoi", "", ":"], ["Ã¼ ne", "ubihi", "rozusu", "yabufu", "Ibehe", "", "punume", "zoyuso", "pemu", "piwa." , " ", "o-"]]
```
