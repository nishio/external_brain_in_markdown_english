Key Features
- List of "Do's and Don'ts
    - Ability to list activities that users should avoid in order to focus on the current task
    - Regular reminders to check "what not to do".

- Simple prioritization
    - No complex priority system, but only three categories: "do it now," "do it later," and "don't do it.
    - UI for easy drag-and-drop reclassification

- Focus mode
    - Displays only the current task and hides all other information
    - Timer function to encourage regular breaks

- microtask decomposition
    - Assistive functions to break down large tasks into smaller executable steps
    - Provides visual rewards upon completion of each step

- Flexible reminders
    - Have users check their "to-do" list and important tasks at set intervals
    - Minimize distraction by showing only in-app rather than push notifications

- Visualization of progress
    - Visual display of progress, including number of completed tasks and focus time
    - Long-term trend analysis to drive improvement

- voice input
    - Ability to voice-activate tasks as soon as they occur to you
    - Automatically categorized into "to be done later" category

- Integrated Filters
    - Filters notifications such as phone calls, emails, social networking sites, etc., and displays only the important ones while in focus mode

Design Principles
- Simple and intuitive UI
- Minimize visual stimulation
- Incorporate positive reinforcement and encouraging messages
- Flexibility to adapt to individual user needs

The proposed design is intended to help users with ADHD tendencies maintain focus, clarify priorities, and manage tasks effectively.
