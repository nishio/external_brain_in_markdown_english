I had a one-digit miscalculation and thought, "I need 80 million..." but it was 8 million.
- I thought the hurdle was surprisingly low, but the important thing is not to deposit money, but to "keep the node running 24 hours a day."
- More nodes would contribute to the decentralized nature of Ethereum.
    - > Solo staking increases the decentralization of the Ethereum network

- > Using SMS-based 2FA is susceptible to [[SIMjacking]] (open in new tab) and is unsafe.
- interesting
    - ETH2 token scam: Spewing "convert ETH to ETH2 or you will lose it" and offering to "return ETH to ETH2 if you transfer ETH" to coincide with a major correction at the main office.
    - Mining Pool Scam: Convince people who don't understand that there is no such thing as mining in Ethereum that they can make money if they join a mining pool, and get them to invest.
    - Airdrop scams: make it look like you offered something of value and get a transaction approved to get it, or get people to sign in with their Ethereum wallets at a site prepared by the scammers and steal their private keys


> Your rewards are proportional to the time your validator is online and properly attesting. Downtime incurs penalties proportional to how many other validators are offline at the same time, but does not result in slashing. Bandwidth also matters, as rewards are decreased for attestations that are not received in time. Requirements will vary, but a minimum of 10 Mb/s up and down is recommended.

- > As of May 2022, you'll need ~1TB for the Mainnet execution chain data alone (growing at >1GB/day).
- >  Ethereum had its genesis on July 30, 2015. It is growing in size over time, and the introduction of sharding will also increase storage, memory, and bandwidth requirements.
- >  You'll need SSD storage to consistently handle necessary read/write speeds.

- As a way to contribute to the Ethereum community, I thought that solo staking, which requires 8 million staking and the technical skills to run a node, might be suitable for me, but it is harder than I thought, and although I can do it if I try hard enough, spending time trying to do it might be inefficient as a way for me to add value to the community. I'm starting to feel that it's inefficient to spend my time working on it as a way to add value to society. I'm starting to feel that it's inefficient for me to spend my time trying.
