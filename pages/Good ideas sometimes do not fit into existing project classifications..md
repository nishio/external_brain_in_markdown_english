In terms of project management, it seems to me that there is a certain rationality in organizing the various tasks by project. On the other hand, when it comes to ideas, an idea that solves different projects at once is a good idea to apply. In other words, they don't fit into the existing project categories.

Certainly, ideas are not tied to a project and may cross over to different projects, right?
