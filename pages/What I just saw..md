title: "What I just saw."
---

It may be important to be able to do a search of the type "the one I just looked at" (whether it is a search or a list of the most recent reads depends on the design).
When users are reading information, they sometimes think, 'This is related to that thing I just saw. If they can't find that thing they saw earlier, they lose their awareness." This is the story.
Specifically, the system displays new notifications, which tends to occur when there is no read list.
