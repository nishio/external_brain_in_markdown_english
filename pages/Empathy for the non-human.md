> [BBKusokoraBOT](https://twitter.com/BBKusokoraBOT/status/1722401138430128580) "People who complain about [[bear extermination]] have no place in society, so they [[empathize]] with exterminated bears rather than people. I cried when I heard the psychological analysis like this.
>  Don't you have a human heart or something?

- > [[out-of-place sympathy]].
- > A man with [[ASD]], who does not know how people feel, feels "[[poor]]" when he sees a stuffed animal in a store that he does not pay attention to. This naïve feeling that "a strong being with reason should do as he pleases" is difficult to convey to a standardized person without the ability to express it like he does.
> [tociss](https://twitter.com/tociss/status/1722600590885490947) I'm also more [[sympathetic]] to bears than humans in general (I agree with the decision to have to kill bears to keep humans safe. I agree with the decision to kill bears to ensure human safety, though).
