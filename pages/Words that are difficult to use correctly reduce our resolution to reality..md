title: "Words that are difficult to use correctly reduce our resolution to reality."
---

Difficult to use correctly [[strong language]] tends to lower the [[resolution to reality]] in front of you.
- Words [[that are difficult to use correctly]] tend to lower [[resolution (e.g., display, dpi)]] for [[the reality in front of you]].

> [nekoya](https://x.com/nekoya/status/1952890726662213648) "[[psychological safety]]" is also a dangerous word because it is rarely used in its original sense
