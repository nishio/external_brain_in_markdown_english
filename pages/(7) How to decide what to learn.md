title: "(7) How to decide what to learn"
---

When I give a lecture I often asked "I do not know what to learn". In Chapters 1 to 6, I have explained the methodology of learning how to learn. In this chapter, let's think about the decision what to learn which  is one step before "how to learn".

- [[(7.1) What is the right thing to learn?]]
- [[(7.2) Management strategy of oneself]]
- [[(7.3) Creating knowledge]]
