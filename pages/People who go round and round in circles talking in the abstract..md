title: "People who go round and round in circles talking in the abstract."

Even people who talk in the abstract can dig in and talk about specific activities if they
- We have an accumulated stock of concrete experiences.
- Even those who can speak concretely usually speak abstractly, because abstract is more [[thought efficient]] ([[thought economy theory]]).
- Without a stock of concrete experiences, it is impossible to delve into abstract stories.

Why stay in that state?
- I personally have a strong desire to create what I have in mind, so I can't really sympathize with people who think a lot but don't take action to make it happen.
    - [[Desire to be special]], I thought.
    - The experience of specific actions is not "special" because people act on a daily basis without particularly high ideals, etc.
    - Those who look down on those people are boosting their self-esteem by being highly ideological.
    - After writing all this, I remembered "[People who have never wanted to make it and have never made it.

You're trying to talk abstractly and ask for specifics, and you don't get specifics, you just talk abstractly, and when you circle back around and go back to the original story, "Oh, the stock ends here," "[[the bottom's]] so shallow."
