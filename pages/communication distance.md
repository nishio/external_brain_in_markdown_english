    - [[Knowledge Overlap]] is the ease of [communication
        - [[overlap]] 100% = 100% of what is said is interpreted as intended.
    - 0% overlap = 0% of words uttered are interpreted as intended
    - For example, if 50% is interpreted as intended, it takes 2 utterances to convey the content of 1
    - It is natural to assume that the distance is the inverse of the overlap
- But [[trigonometric inequality]] does not hold for this distance
    - It is possible that the distance between Mr. A and Mr. C is longer than "the distance between Mr. A and Mr. B + the distance between Mr. B and Mr. C
    - Not "[[distance]]" in the mathematical sense.
    - In such a space, it can happen that the distance mediated by B is closer than the direct distance between A and C.
    - This reduction in distance can be economically valuable.

- If distance is better, should we all have overlapping knowledge?
    - If you only consider the efficiency of communication, you're right.
    - Add to that the effect of economic value created by the "[[search]] of the unknown," and you get [trade-off
