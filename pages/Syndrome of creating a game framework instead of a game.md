The pursuit of technical beauty and reusability takes a backseat to the actual content (gameplay, story, etc.) that players can enjoy.

[Main features
    - Pursuit of [[perfectionism (psychology)]] and [reusability
    - Trying to create a [[generic]] [[foundation]] that can be used in other projects in the future delays the development of specific game content, resulting in a game with a low level of completion.

- [[abstraction trap]].
    - If functions and elements are abstracted too much, the actual player experience ("fun" and "immersion") will not accompany them, and the sensory appeal will be lost.

- Extension of development period
    - Because of the obsession with completing the framework itself, it takes a significant amount of time before [[release-ready content]] is created, making it difficult to bring it to market in a timely manner.

- Neglect of user experience
    - The actual enjoyment for the user takes a back seat because of the bias toward [[the beauty of the internal structure]] rather than the ultimate goal, which is the "fun" part of the game.

Countermeasures
- Create a prototype in the early stages and confirm actual player response through user testing.
- The approach is to first realize concrete gameplay with the minimum framework required, and then extend and abstract it later.
- Always give top priority to "what kind of experience players want" and strike a balance between technical sophistication and user experience.

In many cases, this symptom is caused by excessive engineer pride and expectations of reusability. Since it is the finished game experience that is evaluated in the actual marketplace, it is very important to incorporate the user's perspective from the early stages of the evaluation process.
