### Summary of notes
.
Humans serve as sensing devices for AI.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The note offers the perspective that humans are sensing devices for AI. This is related to Nishio's research notes "The Device Industry of AI Development by AI," "Humans are fragile components that will only operate for a mere 100 years," and "Humans are computers made of protein." These fragments share the perspective that humans play an important role in the development and operation of AI.

### deep thinking
The perspective that humans serve as sensing devices for AI has the potential to redefine the relationship between humans and AI. The perspective that human knowledge, experience, and senses contribute to the learning and development of AI can trigger a reevaluation of the role of humans in the development and operation of AI.

### summary of thoughts
Humans act as sensing devices for AI, contributing to its learning and development.
