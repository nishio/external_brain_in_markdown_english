- What have you been doing for 12 days?
    - I met Mr. Seki on the 17th and got a [[VESS Card]].
        - I wrote a little about that meeting on the 24th [[MTG2023-04-24]].
    - Rapid increase in the need to speak English
        - After thinking about it for a day, I concluded that I should invest flexibly in this "training incentive" opportunity, so I contacted GABA on the following Tuesday and booked a trial lesson for Wednesday as it was the fastest available slot.
        - On Wednesday, I was trying to decide whether to sign up for 30 or 40 panels, but I decided on 40 at random.
        - Unless you have a prior commitment, cram in two sessions a day.
        - I can talk a lot now.
    - Bring the implementation of Scrapbox's automatic English translation system into stable operation.

    - Thinking about creating a document that could be worth reading for non-Japanese speakers
            - [[Polis Experience Report: Should we investigate the causes of terrorism?]]
            - [[Polis Experience Report: Should Same-Sex Marriage Be Legalized?]]

It's been about two weeks and I haven't switched back.
- I don't have time mentally until Saturday.
- Let's switch to Sunday.
- Simply put, they were doing English.
    - I did two English classes every day, and I didn't even take Golden Week off to do that, and I was exhausted, so I stopped.

I don't have the brain space to think about next week's activities.
- We'll take our time Sunday to figure it out.
- English conversation
    - I signed a contract for the amount of time I could put in two frames on all the days, but ended up suspending it because it was overkill, I think I have about 17 left.
    - Think about what kind of plan you want to use before it expires.
    - It seems like a good idea to make an appointment to see when someone you like is available.
