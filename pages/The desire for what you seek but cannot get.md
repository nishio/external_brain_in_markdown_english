title: "The desire for what you seek but cannot get"
---

The pain of not getting what one seeks is the pain of not getting what one seeks.

Is there no name attached to the side of greed?

There is a different kind of stupidity in asking for something that you might get and being disappointed when you don't get it, compared to asking for something that "wouldn't have gotten it in the first place" and suffering when you don't get it.
