title: "Dexterity is a useful tool"

- [[skillful]] is a useful "vessel"

- [[Zen and Yangming]] Concepts of "way," "vessel," and "person"
> The closer one is to [[the way (of proper conduct, etc.)]], the more one has mastered the way, the more one is a true human being. A true human being is a [[device]] because it must play a role in human society, but it is not just a vessel, it is a [[vessel of the Way]]. He is not only a vessel, but also a "doujin. It must not be a "vessel."
