The phrase "painting is dead" ("la peinture est morte") is attributed to the French painter Paul Delaroche, who said the phrase in 1839 when the [[daguerreotype]] (early photographic technique) was invented. The term is known to symbolize the change in the role of painting with the advent of photography.

context
Invention of the Daguerreotype
- In 1839, French inventor Louis Jacques Mande Daguerre (Louis Daguerre) introduced the daguerreotype, a photographic technique using silver plates.
- This technique made a huge impact on the art world of the time because it enabled extremely detailed depictions and accurate images in a short time.

Background of Delaroche's statement
- Delaroche was an academic history painter and an artist who specialized in realistic expression.
- It is said that he felt that realism was being supplanted by photographic techniques and declared "the end of painting.

broad sense
- This statement does not mean that paintings are no longer needed, but rather suggests that the role of paintings is changing.
- With the advent of photography, painting, which strove for realistic expression, lost its exclusive status, and new directions such as impressionism and abstraction were sought.

Discussion of actual intent
- There are various theories as to how seriously Delaroche himself took this statement. Some say that the words were taken largely in the context of later life rather than as a symbol of his sentiments.

The phrase "painting is dead" has been passed down through the generations as a symbolic statement that the advent of photographic technology was a major turning point in the history of art.
