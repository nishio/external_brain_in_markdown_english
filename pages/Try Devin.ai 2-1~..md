The previous [[Try Devin.ai 2025-01]] became very long after only a month, so I made a new page.

[Security awareness of Devin at home and Devin at work are too different - Devin Observation Diary｜Daiki Teramoto](https://note.com/teramotodaiki/n/n4a45982c63ff)
- I'm curious what the difference is derived from.
- If it's a system prompt inserted by the service at runtime, then it would seem that the new instructions to Devin at Teramoto-san's house would be the tougher one to follow.
- Maybe make it tougher only when there are more members?
- It's a black box, which is weird.
- Let Devin raise [[Devika]] ()

> [teramotodaiki](https://x.com/teramotodaiki/status/1887120497508560905) I've decided to have Devin order my lunch for a while from now on!
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1887129199351304579) ugh!
>  Hundreds of pizzas arrive by mistake
> [teramotodaiki](https://x.com/teramotodaiki/status/1887135315334427094) If that happens, I'll retire again...

> [teramotodaiki](https://x.com/teramotodaiki/status/1887391066741240039) Two beef bowls arrived earlier today.
>  I didn't say one, I lost.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1887438353643315227) I'm glad it wasn't 100!

> [sizumita](https://x.com/sizumita/status/1887391066741240039) I wonder if Devin wanted a beef bowl too.
> [teramotodaiki](https://x.com/teramotodaiki/status/1887408899818725882) I like this theory too much!

> [teramotodaiki](https://x.com/teramotodaiki/status/1887525282871189661)
>  Devin wrote a diary of the day's events
>  I had no idea why I asked for two!

> [shokai](https://x.com/shokai/status/1895976461632487882) I had Devin review dependabot and it got interesting.
>  - do all the open pulls!
>  - Give me an overview of the library
>  - Dependencies Summary
>  - just pull out the parts of the changes that are used on the app side.
>  - If the API has changed, pull it.
>  - let me know if there are any interesting updates.
>  - make a list of file paths that use the library.


> [voluntas](https://x.com/voluntas/status/1896387509783003308) It occurred to me that I'm starting to think that "Build a product using Cline" would be a good way to educate newcomers. You can learn both design and instruction.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1896420972405887315) I think this is a highway of learning to be able to use Devin, and by using Cline, I can effectively learn "what can be entrusted to AI and what needs to be watched closely". I think this is a fast way to learn how to use Devin.
> [voluntas](https://x.com/voluntas/status/1896421155504058695) I'm not interested in Devin at all because I prefer controllable, what should I do?
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1896422637741781393) Is there any difference between Cline and Devin in terms of being "controllable"?
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1896423202869653696) Well, but you don't have to be interested in something that doesn't interest you. 99% of the people in the world are not interested in Erlang.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1896423439390662720) After asking the question, I thought, "If people aren't interested, they don't know the details, so it's a waste of time to discuss it."

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1896430351993680318) People who think there is a clear boundary in controllability between Devin and Cline probably don't know much about Devin, and people who use Devin are the most They are confused because they tweet "I could do this with my hands off the handlebars!" I think their perception is off because they tweet "I was able to do this with my hands off the handle! It's like [[publication bias]].
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1896430868975214669) If you put up Devin's WebUI and watch Devin work on it from the side, there is no difference between it and Cline, so if you want to watch, you can. If you want to interact, you can always do it. Devin has the advantage that you can rewind and check it later, even if you don't watch it in real time.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1896434059200631276) After thinking and looking at what [[controllability]] is for a while, I realized that the same object, if people don't know "how to [[control]] it", will appear to be " I realized that the same object can be seen as "low controllability" by people who don't know "how to [[control]]" it.


> [pandeiro245](https://x.com/pandeiro245/status/1896058558531453225) I don't even bother to share here about Mr. C and Mr. D these days, but I've lost a lot of mindshare to them, and I'm not sure I'm the only one. I write this for my own sake. First of all, comparing these two, I think that Mr. C has been talked about more than Mr. D. In fact, I heard about Mr. C first. Two weeks ago, I had the opportunity to spend some quality time with Mr. D before Mr. C. I thought it was the best thing I could do. I thought it was great. It's nice to be able to communicate via Slack. I might be able to give up my computer and live my dream life on a smartphone.
>
>  But as we continued to communicate, Mr. D was not perfect either. It was my fault for not sharing the information in advance, but Mr. D also tries to produce output with little information without much feedback, even though it takes a long way. But they also charge a lot, saying "We'll pay you for the work you've done. Until the payment is received, they also share something like "I haven't received the money, so I'm going to sleep. I can't sleep because they always say, "If you don't reply within 30 minutes after we contact you, I'll go to bed. It's hard.
>
>  On the other hand, Mr. C, whom I have been talking with since yesterday, has been a topic of conversation, and he is amazing. On the other hand, Mr. C, whom I have been communicating with since yesterday, has been a topic of discussion, and he has been great. In conclusion, I think it would be better to have Mr. C mainly work on the general framework and ask Mr. D to do some minor revisions such as wording corrections. However, it has only been two weeks, so I would like to catch up more and make a good team. If you are interested in this area, please feel free to exchange information with me!
>
>  Note 1: Mr. C = Cline, Mr. D = Devin
> [pandeiro245](https://x.com/pandeiro245/status/1896352869357621413) Cline works locally and is suitable for offices with uninterrupted internet access and telecommuting; Devin works in the cloud and is suitable for nomads.

> [teramotodaiki](https://x.com/teramotodaiki/status/1896145479601406366) Devin v1.3, Claude 3.7 Tier as a programmer has gone up a notch since Sonnet.
>  v1.1 was about "student interns with good coding skills", v1.3 is about as reliable as "third year fresh graduate engineers who are candidates for the next tech lead".

> [teramotodaiki](https://x.com/teramotodaiki/status/1896145919747440949) Well Devin, it's a watershed moment for your career.
>  ![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GlB2qdBa8AAIlGV?format=jpg&name=large#.png)
> [teramotodaiki](https://x.com/teramotodaiki/status/1896155322466873680) It didn't work.
> [teramotodaiki](https://x.com/teramotodaiki/status/1896158130972799395) I was able to do it, but I didn't check Send to Slack, so I took a pay cut!

> [GOROman](https://x.com/GOROman/status/1896396237261479995) It's funny because Devin automatically pulls the fixes to Github and Copilot reviews the pulls on Github. I guess they don't need me anymore.
