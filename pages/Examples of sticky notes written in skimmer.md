Cleanup (2017-05-01)
    - We tend to think that [[output]] is [[Large Tasks]], but by dividing it into [[Phase to output fragments]] and [[Summarizing phase]], the output of fragments can be done in [[intermission during a break in time]]. The output of the fragments can be done in [[intermission during a break in time]]. You can even write one while riding the escalator.

Cleanup letter (2018-10-11)
    - We tend to think of [[output]] as a single [[Large Tasks]].
- However, it can be divided into [[Phase to output fragments]] and [[Summarizing phase]].
- When divided in this way, the output of fragments can be performed with [[intermission during a break in time]].
- You can write one while riding the escalator.
