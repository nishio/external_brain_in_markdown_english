In the context of Japanese folk religion and spiritual practices, "kuchiyose" typically refers to a form of spirit possession or mediumship, wherein a spiritual medium, such as an [[Itako]], is believed to summon and communicate with spirits of the deceased.

During a kuchiyose ritual, the medium enters a trance-like state, believed to allow them to channel spirits and relay messages between the living and the spirit world. This could involve relaying messages from deceased loved ones, providing insights into the spiritual realm, or even seeking guidance or wisdom from ancestral spirits.

Kuchiyose can be seen as a form of spiritual intercession, a way for the living to connect with the spiritual world. It's an important part of some traditional Japanese religious and cultural practices, particularly in regions where these traditions have been preserved.

However, views on kuchiyose and similar practices vary widely both within and outside of Japan, and they're becoming increasingly rare due to modernization and changing beliefs. As with any spiritual or religious practice, interpretations and experiences of kuchiyose can be deeply personal and should be understood within their cultural context.
