title: "Behind the classification is a question."
---

- Behind [[Classification.]] is [[question]].

Regarding the "a frame is provided and you are expected to fill it" type of framework,
That "frame" is always accompanied by a "question" behind it,
They are asked to think carefully about the "question" and answer it.

It's interesting to see the answers given after careful thought.
The quick answer is not interesting.
