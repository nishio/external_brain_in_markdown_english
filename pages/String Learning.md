title: "String Learning"
---

- Neural net that just outputs strings of length N in that order
- naively, we can have an N-dimensional one-hot state vector
- Then, if we compress this network, how small a network can we keep functioning?
- What kind of mistakes will we make if we destroy the learned network?
