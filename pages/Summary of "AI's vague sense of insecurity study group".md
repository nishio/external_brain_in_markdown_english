- [[AI's vague sense of insecurity study group]]
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>Thank you for your lengthy summary of the vague concerns and progress regarding AI. I think the main points can be summarized as follows

- There is concern that the [[performance gap between English and Japanese]] will widen as AI advances. This may reduce the competitiveness of countries that use [[minority languages]].
- Advancement of AI may form an [[early adopter group]], and the world may be [[dividing into parts]] with [[People on the move]] and [[those who are left behind]]. I will take action to [[ride the AI wave]] as if I were [[running away from a tsunami]].
- [[RAG]] (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and other technologies that allow LLMs to supplement non-public information within the company are needed, but even there there there is concern that giant IT companies such as Microsoft will seize this information.
    - In the [[groupware]] industry, the advent of LLM may make it difficult to provide value at the current level of abstraction. It may be necessary to be more [[close to customer operations]].
    - As [[white-collar]] jobs are replaced by AI, the [[office work support]] business model is at risk. Users may shift to [[system development]] and [[interpersonal interface]] jobs.
- There is a risk that Cybozu will be left behind in the latest trends in AI or that it will not be agile enough. There is also a concern that innovation will be stifled by [[restrictions on double-duty]] and other factors.
- I am working on the "[[summary]]" task as my target, but there are several aspects to the summary that are difficult to direct well to the LLM. I need to create and fine tune the data.

Overall, the report expressed an awareness of the major challenges for individuals and organizations on how to adapt and provide value in the midst of changes associated with rapid advances in AI. In the midst of so much uncertainty, we saw a willingness to move nimbly and find our own way to make the most of the situation. Thank you for your valuable input.
