The connection between these two
    - [[First, build trust through muddy problem-solving.]]
    - [[What to keep in mind when suddenly assuming the position of CTO from the outside]]
[[Those who come later need to earn the trust of those who were there before them]].

Why is this so?
- [[U-curve model]]
- Embedding [[existing systems]] is necessary for not only prototyping but also performing.
        - [[bouncing of ideas, opinions, etc. off each other to obtain a fine-tuned integrated whole]]
- "[[Respect the existing system]]" from [[What to keep in mind when suddenly assuming the position of CTO from the outside]].
    - I'm not sure what "[[respect]]" is in this expression, it could be seen as mentalistic.
    - That "ideas that demonstrate value by connecting to existing systems" need to understand "existing systems" in order to demonstrate value, of course.

- [Visualize the difference in evaluation functions.
    - I think that's a personal measure,
    - The organizational scale of "value = results while minimizing [[coordination costs]] and [[legal risk]]" often conflicts.
    - Mismatches can be detected at an early stage if both sides' evaluation axes are first verbalized and presented in a form that allows comparison.
    - o3 was divided, but the following is almost the same<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Recognize [[the asymmetry of career tracks]].
        - [Entrepreneurial orientation" with individuals who value "[[speed]] and [[originality]]" the most,
        - In organizations that are [[stability-oriented]] and emphasize "[[reproducibility]] and [[consensus building]],
        - The same results have different evaluation points.
        - If the gap is left unaddressed, "[[frictional cost>outcome]]" will result, and it is easy to determine that the optimal solution is to eliminate collaboration.
- "[[Juvenile bonus]]" is expendable.
    - The "[[number of failures]]" and "[[sharp words and deeds]]" that are acceptable for young people are rapidly reversed in evaluation with age.
    - Need to be aware of the amount of bonuses remaining and design to convert "attention" to "[[trust assets]]" before the [[failure tolerance]] is reduced.
    - [[risk-taking]]" is multiplied by "[[solidarity cost]]".
    - Legal and ethical risks ripple out not only to the individual but also to all parties involved.
    - Even if "I am fine with it," I am shunned by those around me who do not like "collateral loss.
- Create a flow of conversion to "assets
    - Don't let ideas and attention be short-lived,
    - Small-scale verification → Templating of successful patterns → Redistribution as know-how and tools
    - The flow of the asset will be capitalized in the following manner.
        - I'm not sure if this trend is appropriate.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - This will help them get away from the "just a topic of conversation" reputation and will also help the organization persuade them.
- [Cooperation cost is measured as a KPI.
    - If you quantify how many additional man-hours and [[firefighting]] were forced on those around you, and set your own targets for improvement, [[trust recovery]] will be accelerated.
    - The key is to be aware of "[[total value for total cost]]" rather than "my output alone.


- [[Communication problems are mutual.]]
- If A and B have communication problems, well, neither
    - If A has a problem with B, C, or D, A looks bad
- An organization forms a network of trust when the people within it continue to "communicate well with each other" over a long period of time.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/3454525d404118d66ed50c87bceebe13/thumb/1000)
    - Assuming Individual A and Individual B have no communication problems.
    - Suppose B introduces A to his organization and has a problem with member C.
    - At this time, D and E come to continue "no communication problem with each other" with C, so naturally they judge "A is bad".
    - For B, it is a boardroom composition of conflict between A and C, D, E
        - This is a pain in the ass.
        - C, D, and E will cause a loss of trust by bringing A
            - Not explicitly institutionalized [[referral responsibility system]].
            - This looks like A took money from B's wallet and spent it.
            - Like a co-signer, B pays the costs due to the trouble A has caused.
    - If multiple cases of this are observed, the perception that "A tends to cause that kind of trouble" spreads, so referrals are stopped.
        - A similar composition in a completely different context was the case of game players who make others uncomfortable, and who are not invited to a place where they are having fun playing games.
                - [[People who are toxic to the community are not invited into the community.]]
            - There it is, here it is: [[self-inflicted alienation]].
    - [[The world of those who kill is not expanding.]]
        - [[Expansion and reproduction of social capital]] you're doing the opposite.
        - [[How to use social capital]]
        - > A requirement that after the D and S transactions occur, the Happiness of both parties must increase.
        - > Because trust in intermediary M will decrease if the transaction does not lead to a positive outcome.
    - A waste of resources acquired in the short term with the "recklessness common to young people" and then burned without increasing them.
- Understanding the Existing System."
    - It's not that hard.
    - It's a mechanism that the average homo sapiens of average intelligence is able to perform on average.
    - If you have a good understanding of the system, you should be able to understand it better.
    - Is this [[Downloading]] in [[U-curve model]] in [[U-theory]]?
        - It's hard to understand when you're stuck in your own frame of reference.
        - When you react like "this is the way it should be," "it's not supposed to be," or "the existing system sucks," you don't get the information and you don't understand it.
        - So, even if you verbalize your idea or create a prototype in that state, you still have difficulties in the [[Performing]] stage because the connection with the [[Social Field]] in [[Presensing]] is not happening.
