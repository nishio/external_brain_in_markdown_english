- [[Summer Programming Symposium 2024]]

Adjust the scales.
- Not identified as the same person because he/she has gained too much weight since the last measurement.
- I wonder where I can change the settings~!
- The app has been updated.
- I'll go home and see if I can find out the model number of the scale or something.
I'm not sure.
- They say you can't change more than 5kg since the last time, so I put my current weight.

Sleep rhythms are all over the place.
- Went to bed at 10pm and woke up at 3:40am.
