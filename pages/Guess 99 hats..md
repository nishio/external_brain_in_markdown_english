- 100 Prisoners
- Randomly aligned
- They make you wear a black or white hat.
- You can know the color of the hat of the person in line before you.
- I can say one word, black or white.
- If it matches the color of your hat, OK.
- There is a way to get 99 people to be OK by having a consultation with all of them before lining up, what is that?

- No more side channels.
    - Tell them with an accent or a tap on the shoulder.
- And not lined up in a roundabout way.
