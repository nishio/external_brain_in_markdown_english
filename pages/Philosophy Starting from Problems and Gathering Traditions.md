title: "Philosophy Starting from Problems and Gathering Traditions"

> [hitoshinagai1](https://x.com/hitoshinagai1/status/1813754652464493042) When you are doing philosophy, there are a number of philosophical issues that you can't really get a handle on, and there is a tradition of how to do things around them that you can get a little bit of a handle on. I have the strong impression that there are a number of philosophical problems that are really out of our hands and feet. I believe that there are philosophies that start from the problems that are out of reach and philosophies that start from the traditions of gathering.

> [hitoshinagai1](https://x.com/hitoshinagai1/status/1813860116816625803) Books on the history of philosophy are obvious, but introductory philosophy books are usually also introductory books on the "how to get a few hands and feet" tradition that has been developed! I think it's a good idea to read them. I think some people can get a direct grasp of the problem itself, which they can't get a handle on, just by reading them.

Philosophy starting from the problem and [[philosophy]] starting from the [[gathering tradition]].
