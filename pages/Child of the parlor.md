The term can be broken down into "zashiki The term can be broken down into "zashiki," which means a traditional Japanese room or parlor, and "warashi," an old Japanese word for child. So, "Zashiki-warashi" can be roughly translated as " child of the parlor."

Zashiki-warashi are typically depicted as ghost-like children who inhabit specific houses. They are usually invisible, but they can choose to appear, often in the form of a child around five or six years old. These spirits are not harmful and are, in fact, believed to bring good fortune and prosperity to the house they inhabit. However, if they are neglected or offended, they might leave the house, which is often followed by a downfall in the family's fortune.

The Zashiki-warashi stories are especially prevalent in the [[Iwate]] Prefecture of Japan. These stories, like many other yōkai legends, serve to explain mysterious phenomena and express cultural values. The belief in Zashiki-warashi encourages respect for the home and its spirits and fosters a sense of the unseen forces that might influence people's lives.
