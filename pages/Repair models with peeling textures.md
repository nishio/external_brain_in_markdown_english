title: "Repair models with peeling textures"
---

- I downloaded the TARDIS model but the texture is peeling off, I don't know how to put it on.

    - Ability to change the material mapping of imported objects in Unity
    - Now we can make the texture a new material and re-map it.
- I'm sure there are easier ways to do this.
    - [[Brender]] power needed
