title: "Condition when it arises"
---

Translation of Latin origin [In statu nascendi

To understand a concept, it is good to look closely at the "state of affairs when it arose"
- Because it is the closest in terms of "mental state before the concept is acquired".
- Over time, abstraction and expansion of meaning become more difficult to understand

relevance
    - [[The relationship found after an expanded interpretation is not necessarily the same as the relationship to the original concept.]]
    - [[Books are already a product of abstraction]], so we've moved a bit away from the state of affairs when the concept arose.
    - Supplement with specific episodes of the author's life.
        - But I can't always do it because I can't write the story or it doesn't fit the volume.
    - I'll approximate it with a parable.
        - [[Coined based on unshared experience]]
