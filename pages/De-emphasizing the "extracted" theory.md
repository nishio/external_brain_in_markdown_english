title: 'De-emphasizing the "extracted" theory'
---

- [[extract]]" the interesting parts of the book.
- not good
- The cost of trying to quote in good faith is inflated.
- It's just a cutout of the book, an [[inferior copy]].
- Most of the words that are impressive at first sight are often lost [[in context]] and unintelligible after six months.
- Instead of "taking a piece of the book out," find the [[coupling]] of your knowledge with the knowledge in the book and record it.
