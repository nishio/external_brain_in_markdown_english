What I mean by transparency here is that the people should be able to see through the work of the state. If, on the other hand, the state can see through the people, then we have a [[surveillance state]]." ("Audrey Tan: Letters to Freedom," Kodansha, p. 59)

Freedom is not something you receive, but something you give generously." (Audrey Tan, Letters to Freedom, Kodansha, p. 11)
