title: "Evaluated without merit."
---

When person A sees person B being [[evaluated]] by many people and feels that "he is being evaluated even though he does not have [[(real) ability]]", "person B does not have ability" is not a fact but A's interpretation.

Either "B is not competent and the multitude [[overestimates]] those who are not competent" or "A is not competent to recognize B's competence."
