> [@tsukamoto](https://twitter.com/tsukamoto/status/1527277688003899392?s=21&t=Tk3sTEdP7qC-5KO-SXtY9w): business communication is [[(Internet) chat]]. When you shift the communication, it's quite efficient to go through a simple one-word phrase and then shift to a one- or two-word response such as "OK" or "Acceptable". With [[Slack]], it's simplified to the point where you can create a stamp with a few words and everyone can immediately use it, but with Teams, you can't create a [[stamp]] and that last step doesn't get any easier.
