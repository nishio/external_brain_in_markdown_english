Critical Opinion on Nikkei Newspaper's Column "Declining a Job Offer Should be Communicated in Person
> As a recruiter, it is nothing but a waste of time to spend time on someone who has turned down a job offer, so don't tell the hiring manager not to call them just for [[etiquette]], even if you want to get them to change their mind. Who's the one giving shitty advice that lowers Japan's [[productivity]]?

I thought this was a discrepancy between "courtesy 1.0," which considers it polite to use one's own time, and "courtesy 2.0," which considers it polite not to deprive [[the other party's]] time.

    - [[Make the package easy to make decisions.]]
    - This is setting them up to not use their time.
        - I use my time to do that work.
        - It's an act of goodness, whether it's courtesy 1.0 or 2.0.
        - [[False dichotomy]]
