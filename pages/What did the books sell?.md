title: "What did the books sell?"
---

- Self-observation of the creation process can be found here: [[20180502Self-observation log]].
- I took it one step further by looking at the question, "What were books selling before the new Mach book?"

- A situation where Mr. A and Mr. B are in close proximity and Mr. B can observe Mr. A's behavior as he teaches.
    - First, Mr. A's work is communicated non-verbally by Mr. B watching from the side.
    - Commonality of experience #Collaboration
    - By verbalizing how Mr. A interprets a common experience, a common interpretation is made.
        - If left alone as it is, Mr. B will interpret it in his own way.

- When the person teaching and the person being taught are far apart and cannot be observed directly
    - Common situations in books, etc.
- First, Mr. A verbalizes
    - But at this time, experiences that are difficult to verbalize are left out.
    - Raw experience may not be carried in book form
    - It becomes an interpretation and verbalization of experience.
- It is an inferior learning format to the state of being able to co-observe.
    - will scale.
    - Effective in a situation where the number of people being educated is increasing faster than the number of people doing the educating.

- Mr. B, who has read a book that has been abstracted and verbalized, needs to connect that verbalized interpretation with his own experience
    - Metaphors such as "fall into the belly," "become flesh and blood," etc.

- This "coupling with one's own experience" is not easy
- So, the authors provide explanations in a simple way, include specific examples, use a novel format, or use a "comic book" format.
- This is a structure that is compromised to the reader by cost on the part of the author.

- That was fine in the days of mass production.
    - Because the cost of authorship is borne by a large readership.
    - When authors write "easy-to-understand books" at a cost, they sell more books for longer periods of time.
    - Cost justified.
- Subdivision of fields
- Increased variety of products on the market
- The amount of readers per book has decreased
- Decrease the effect of [[signalling]] on books
        - [[when there is a legal tender currency, bad money drives out good money (Gresham's Law)]]
- Emergence of the Internet
    - The attractiveness of the book distribution channel has decreased compared to the quality, quantity, and speed of information distribution on the Internet.
- The incentive to do that on the part of the author is diminishing.
- Readers are also drowning in a flood of information.

- Agile and Waterfall
    - Books are written without the customer (reader) in sight.
    - this is a big deal
    - Problem when a customer realizes after spending money to create it that it doesn't exist.
        - Related: [[Lean Startup]].
    - On the author's part, I want to know the customer's reaction as soon as possible.
        - Introduction of reviewers, etc.
    - The software industry was quick to arrive at a similar idea.
        - Create and release releasable items as quickly as possible.
        - Identify what needs to be created through dialogue with customers

liquidation
- What did the books sell?
    - Abstracted concepts and helping readers combine abstracted concepts with their own experiences
