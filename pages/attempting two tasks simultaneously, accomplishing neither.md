title: "attempting two tasks simultaneously, accomplishing neither"
---

I don't remember the specifics, but here's my story<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
"I have an idea, if we implement X first, it can be used for both objective A and objective B. [[killing two birds with one stone]]!"
→Some time after we started implementing X
'Hey, this part of the implementation, for objective A it has to be Y, but for objective B it has to be Z. What do I do?'

If the problem is simple enough to foresee in advance what to design and how to design it, "what looks like [[common area]]" is really a common area, so it is possible to implement it first.
On the other hand, when challenging a problem that is difficult for me and that I cannot [[foresee]], "compatibility of objectives A and B" is more complex than "objective A alone" or "objective B alone," so the frequency of errors in preliminary design increases.
When this effect is included, it is difficult to say whether or not commonization is efficient. The gain or loss depends on the project situation and the competence of the person designing the project.

I found something I wrote a long time ago.
    - [[Objectives become multidimensional.]]
    - [[One means to multiple ends.]]
    - [[Trade-off between DRY and loosely coupled]]
    - [[Common Interface Trap]]
On the other hand.
    - [[Good ideas solve multiple problems at once.]]
    - I'm troubled by some of the stories that

relevance
    - [[Harvesting the Framework]]
