These amulets are often small, beautifully decorated cloth bags containing a prayer or inscription. They are believed to provide various forms of luck or protection.

Different types of omamori are meant for specific purposes, such as:
- Health: For general well-being or recovery from illness.
- Safety: For protection while driving or traveling.
- Academic Success: Popular among students studying for exams.
- Business Prosperity: For success in business ventures.
- Love and Relationships: To attract or maintain love.

People buy omamori for themselves or as gifts for others. It's customary to return the omamori to the shrine or temple after a year, or once the wish has been fulfilled, for it to be burned. This is done to thank the deities and to dispose of the omamori respectfully. New omamori are then purchased for the next year or for new wishes. This practice reflects a deep respect for spiritual beliefs and the cycle of renewal in Japanese culture.
