title: "I want to revisit the Kumano Kodo."

from  [[Diary 2023-09-26]]

I wish I could revisit the Kumano Kodo.
- I was running out of energy, so I had to go through all the "there's some good fresh water down here" and "there's some kind of prince over there" stuff.
- Think about what to do as a Next Action
    - The power of mountain hiking is acquired by hiking in the mountains.
    - I think it would be a hassle to coordinate schedules with other people, so something I could do alone with little risk of getting lost would be something like "climbing Mt. Takao a couple of times a month.
        - And you can tell the difference by repeating the same pathway.
- If you can get revenge, there's [[Dual Pilgrim]] further down the road.
