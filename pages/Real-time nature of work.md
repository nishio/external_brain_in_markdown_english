title: "Real-time nature of work"

> [philomyu](https://x.com/philomyu/status/1806164792966537547) I think there are two kinds of [[work]] that humans do, roughly divided into "[[action games]] with [[real-time]]" and "[[simulation games]] without [[real-time]]". I think there are things like "[[practice]]" for the former and "[[study]]" for the latter, but I think there are many people who do neither and try to become strong only with vague "[[experience]]".

[[Fighting game]].
