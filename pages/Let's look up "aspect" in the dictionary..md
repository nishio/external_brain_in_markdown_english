from  [[Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning" Study Session 4]]
Let's look up "aspect" in the dictionary.
PS: "aspect" is "aspect" in the original, so I'll look this up in the dictionary
- > Any specific feature, part, or element of something.
- > The way something appears when viewed from a certain direction or perspective.
- > The way something appears when considered from a certain point of view.
- Convincing. When you look at A from a certain point of view B, you see a specific part, that is aspect.
