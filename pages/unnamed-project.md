            - When you get to page 99, you'll see a page that says, "[So, what's the appropriate name for this project?" a page called "What is the appropriate name for this project?
        - I cannot predict what will happen with this project.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
