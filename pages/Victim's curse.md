title: "Victim's curse"

> [madanaizo](https://x.com/madanaizo/status/1834905902480343394) Mr. Tatsuru Uchida, not so popular on social networking sites, wrote more than a decade ago, "Once a person identifies himself/herself as a [[victim]], no amount of redress can restore my [[correctness]]... because he/she continues to prove his/her [[correctness]]. I think it was super prescient of you to write that once a person has claimed to be a "victim", he/she will "remain in a state where what I have lost cannot be recovered..." by any remedy, in order to continue to prove that "[[correctness]]".
> [madanaizo](https://x.com/madanaizo/status/1834906828834324858) "Right now the 'victims' are the strongest, so everyone tries to get to that position first." Something like that was written about 20 years ago. Sensei, you don't seem to be very popular these days, but when I look at social networking sites, I see people saying, "What the heck. I guess he was right after all.
> [madanaizo](https://x.com/madanaizo/status/1834908048927998179) No, it's super right for the victim to complain about the damage. But at the same time, you can't "stay" there either. It should have been the role of the Japanese "uncle" to say, "If you remain a "victim" forever, you will lose your life. What is it? These days, all we have is Itoi-like "Oh, now this is sexual harassment, too?

He said, "He used the incident as an excuse for skipping the rest of his life planning. I guess people in the past were all poor and unhappy, so they could give a good sermon to those who were also unhappy. It was like, "You're not the only one having a hard time, don't take it easy on yourself." I'm glad I'm a modern man.

> Once a person has explained his or her current situation in the sentence pattern that "something powerful" has caused me to lose my freedom, prevented my potential from blossoming, and has not allowed me to "be myself," he or she is "stuck" with that explanation.
>  If "I" used this explanation as a stepping stone to take some action, regain freedom, realize my potential, and realize my "selfhood," then that "something mighty" was not so mighty after all.
>  This flies in the face of the previous case.
>  Hence, once a person adopts this explanation, he will unconsciously hope that the "mighty something" is so mighty, omnipresent, and omnipotent that all his efforts at "self-healing" will come to naught.
>  In his zeal to prove the correctness of the hypothesis explaining his misery, the person comes to wish that he is so unhappy that he cannot be saved by any means.
