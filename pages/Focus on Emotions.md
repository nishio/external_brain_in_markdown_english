- What is "[[emotion]] in [[focus]]"?
    - When an emotion arises in yourself, take a step back and observe, "Oh, now I'm angry," without becoming one with the emotion.
    - We need to move away to focus.
    - This is called [[associate]] or [[Vipassana meditation]].

- In the case of other people's emotions
    - For example, when others are angry, the perspective of seeing "This person is angry" or "This person is turning red in the face.
    - Avoid being consumed by anger.

Emotions need to be [[objectivized]] in order to focus ([[Emotional objectification]]).
