title: "Equality varies by perspective."
---

    - It was interesting to see an argument that makes it clear that there is no such thing as [[equality]].
    - A "We give everyone the same amount of income tax deduction uniformly!"
    - B "Higher income earners have higher tax rates, so higher income earners get higher tax breaks! It's unequal!"
    - C: "In monetary terms, yes, but as a percentage of your annual income, the lower your annual income, the higher your tax cut."
        - [https://x.com/sedori8over/status/1851837339729088871?s=46&t=gkSZtjGEtUZPO0JCzBxCBw](https://x.com/sedori8over/status/1851837339729088871?s=46&t=gkSZtjGEtUZPO0JCzBxCBw)
- To begin with, Mr. B's argument would be "let's give everyone a fixed amount of benefits".
    - And then the debate begins as to whether "rich or poor receive the same amount of money" is okay.

[[If you bring up a number, look at a percentage; if you bring up a ratio, look at a number]].
