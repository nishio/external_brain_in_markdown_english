title: "Why is software unstable?"
---

I have not been able to answer the question that occurred to me while I was walking during the day: "Why does software become [[instability]] year after year? Unlike matter, software is made of information, so it itself should not deteriorate, but what causes deterioration?
    - Because [[Kohei Okubo]] is not [[Autonomous adaptation]] to [[Environmental Changes]] outside.
    - [[Jun Harada]] I think it's because [people don't die, so the findings don't accumulate.

It may seem straightforward that "we must pay the cost of adapting to changes in the outside world," but there is a lot that we don't understand, such as "[Why does the outside world change? Why do we need to adapt to changes in the outside world?
    - [[Kohei Okubo]]
    - I suppose "Why does the outside world change?" and "Why do we need to adapt?" are the same as the relationship between the natural world and living things.
    - The reason why costs are hard to be paid is that many people still do not understand the reality that "the Internet is exposed to daily changes just like the natural world.
