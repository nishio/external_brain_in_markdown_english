Rather than making requests to or criticizing the government, they first think about what they can do, and by discussing "what they want to be and do" rather than "what should be done," this leads to concrete changes in behavior.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The "Self-Government Conferences" are held by a general incorporated association [[Concept Japan]] in local governments across Japan, where residents are selected at random and provided with a place to think about local issues and review projects conducted by the government as "their own business". The program has been held more than 145 times across the country so far.

In response to the new coronavirus situation, an online "self-personalization conference" has also been initiated to provide a forum for residents to share their views on the impact of the coronavirus on society and the challenges ahead. This initiative also aims to bring the public's voice to the government and media.

Yonago City has also introduced the nation's first resident-organized "Self-organization Conference," in which randomly selected residents evaluate city projects and report the results to the mayor.
