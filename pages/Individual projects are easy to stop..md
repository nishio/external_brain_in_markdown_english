- [[Personal Projects]] are easy to stop

I think I started this story somewhere, but I don't know where.
- No explanation costs required for "quitting" compared to in-house projects or software development
- If you are working on Project A and decide that Project B is more time-effective, you can immediately direct resources to Project B.
- This isn't a company or an individual.
    - It's whether there are a lot of customers and other stakeholders.

Discussion about "[[path dependency]]": what is it?
- Acquisition of new knowledge and skills becomes more difficult in organizations
- This is because companies need a lot of explanation and persuasion when changing direction once they have made a decision.
- For individuals, the decision to try or stop using a new technology has lower [[accountability costs]] because the decision is completed by the individual alone.

- [[Is it right not to pursue those who leave?]]
- [[Impact of the Development of AI on the Software Industry]]
- [[Anything that no longer functions must be destroyed.]]
- [[Large and fast companies]]
