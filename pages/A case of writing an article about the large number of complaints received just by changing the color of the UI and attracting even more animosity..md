[story about how we received a lot of complaints just for changing the color of the UI｜nonato](https://note.com/nonato/n/nad3ca6ef484f)([archive [https://megalodon.jp/2024-0307-0121-10/https://](https://megalodon.jp/2024-0307-0121-10/https://) note.com:443/nonato/n/nad3ca6ef484f])
> [ymrl](https://twitter.com/ymrl/status/1765392201763414214) I've been bothered by this article for a long time. I wonder if you can imagine how users would feel if they read this article.
> [ymrl](https://twitter.com/ymrl/status/1765396459942555766) You introduce sincere feedback that describes specific situations of use, but you don't say whether you took any action in response to the points raised, and you say something like, "There were some harsh opinions and the members were exhausted, but we did our best to push through. It's not a very good impression from users, is it? ......

> [pnizo](https://twitter.com/pnizo/status/1765558090114748852) I wouldn't order from him, that's my honest opinion!

> [sumyapp](https://twitter.com/sumyapp/status/1765556067583640011) Indeed, it is a frustrating article to read.
>  The focus is on the company's "[[courage]]" to "have the courage to change", leaving the user behind, and I don't see any process of deciding in advance with the user whether the UI change is really good for the user....

> [takanoripe](https://twitter.com/takanoripe/status/1765401176470921634) I don't like the article. I don't like the way they make fun of the fact that they got feedback on the product and then "received a complaint", and I don't like the way they make it sound like a good thing that they pushed through a change that they didn't know who they were doing it for. I won't post the link because I don't like it.

> [shrkwh](https://twitter.com/shrkwh/status/1765351613093548451) Yoshi if you have the balls! I didn't find any learning in the conclusion like that, and it read as too much disregard for the user's convenience. I also found it disturbing that the team's atmosphere was "if the development team says, 'We don't want to develop it,'" to begin with.
> [shrkwh](https://twitter.com/shrkwh/status/1765352484070166584) "If the development team says, 'We don't want to develop it,'" a decent programmer would never say such a thing, so I'm wondering if they've lost a lot of their trust savings or if there's a problem with the team organization. I'm wondering if there's a problem with the organization of the team or if they've lost their trust savings.

> [TenmaniChan](https://twitter.com/TenmaniChan/status/1765451603740672147) When I looked at the after page before reading the second half of the article, I thought, "White text is not good...".

> [budouchan_kyoto](https://twitter.com/budouchan_kyoto/status/1765550192387137724) > After a month, I rarely hear "I want it back" anymore, so again, familiarity solved the problem.
>  I think it's only natural that it would attenuate because the same user never sends the same claim over and over again.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1765370729527480390) This is intuitive.
>  - People using tablets outdoors
>  - People who use it in the dark in the truck late at night.
>  I wonder if it's not good in that environment, because use cases like that come to mind.

> [hiroki_daichi](https://twitter.com/hiroki_daichi/status/1765581734735958376) Changing the UI may seem like a trivial difference, but it can lead to cognitive dissonance because mental models are destroyed. Still, it is still possible to make modifications that ultimately have real benefits.
>
>  It's understandable that you might feel like you're being a pain in the ass in the process.
>
>  Even so, it has to be [[sincerity]], how it should be and how it should be done in order to provide value to customers. From the point where it is not user-first, the experience is disrupted.
>
>  I guess I feel bothered because the article seemed to convey that not-so-sincere attitude through its language. That's why the words of the point are a little tighter.
>
>  What we thought was good for us did not come across well, but we have to face great uncertainty in order to learn from it and overcome it.
>
>  The team may have lacked the necessary [[self-assurance]] to do so.
>
>  I thought it would be better to have more contact with people in the field who are happy with the situation and to ensure their emotional stability.
>
>  Also, if you're going to write about it as a company in an article, it's hard for customers to accept it unless you have a lot more than that to have [[catharsis]] at the end, a story of joy and better results in something. Maybe you could build more of a story structure and plot.

- > Investigate the cause of the glare.
- >  Feedback on the dazzling feedback gave us information on the manufacturer and model number of the display. Buy that display (1) on Amazon.
- > The display (2) that had been in the Tokyo office and was not in use by the same manufacturer was sent to the Kyoto office.

- Ah, it's possible that the Mac monitor is too superior to the customer's environment.
- That was a really good story>Slide
