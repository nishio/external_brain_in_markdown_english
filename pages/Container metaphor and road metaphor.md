- [[Container Metaphor]] and [Metaphor of the Road

People who drag mental models such as Evernote before Scrapbox tend to use tags as "containers".
- For example, put the tag "book" on all your reading notes and go around.
- This recognizes the tag as "the container in which the pages about the book are placed.

But when I listen to shokai and others, I often hear the expressions "link," "connect," and "trace.
    - [[People remember places not by latitude and longitude, but by paths.]]
    - This is [[Metaphor of the Road]].
        - [[Link is the way]]
- So is the metaphor "[[any door]]."
    - The road is not connected and cannot be traced.
    - → Put the door out and put in a string that looks close to where you want to go.
    - →Suggests some of the places you can actually go.
    - →Choose the right one and the road will lead you to it.

I hear a lot of "we want to make the search better."
- That's like saying "I want a faster horse" at a time when automobiles were being created.
- I don't have a problem with sticking with a horse just because it's what you're used to.

Lines like "Scrapbox is expensive to learn."
- There's not a huge amount of notation that needs to be explicitly learned or anything like that.
- I think the real hurdle is the "change in mental models" that isn't explicit.
- And the more the mental model changes, the more useful Scrapbox is.
    - However, in the management of nota, "usable without change" is chosen over "usable without mental model change".
    - As a result, it is difficult to see the need for change because the mental model can remain unchanged and still be used accordingly.
