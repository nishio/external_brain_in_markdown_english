title: "Computational Thinking is a monarchical theory"

    - Part of a brainstorming session by [[Kinta Nakayama]] in preparation for a lecture.
    - [[Interesting angle]] I thought it was, so I wrote it down.

Here are my thoughts: 1.
For a long range of human history, most humans have not had "[[Others who work for you]].
Only some people had it exceptionally well. Example.
    - Ancient Rome, where owning a [[slave]] was common
- A monarch who has acquired the right to rule his people by force of arms or by divine kingship based on religion.
- Capitalists who have acquired a large number of employees through productivity enhancement by capital and expanded reproduction.

Computers can be "others who work for you,
You need a set of knowledge to make it work for you, and I think that is what is called Computational Thinking here.
On the other hand, monarchism is a set of knowledge that allows the monarch to work well with the people in a monarchy, and the same composition.
So "[[Computational Thinking]] is [[monarchism]].

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1081151598233939974) [[problems caused by the elderly (esp. gerontocracy, and elderly people' s control over the young)]] are making people slave or capital slave, you can make computers slave.
>
>  AI is a technology that extends the range of what a computer can SLAVE.
>  Therefore, for you guys with nothing in hand, the most leverage is to SLAVE the computer.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1081154259008184321) computational thinking is monarchism. So it needs to be learned.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1081154957410066433) The shadow industry is an industry that makes humans and their spouses SLAVES via a SLAVE, the computer.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1081157695825035264) If there are any university professors who would like me to give these bad lectures, please let me know. I will give you a bad lecture.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1081161692917030913) The title of the lecture looks good for "[[Monarchism in the 21st century]]".

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1081239398220320768) I want to change something because my spouse is going to be misunderstood imho.
>  It's the ability to manipulate human emotions, like love or disposable time hackers.
>  What a great word to use!
- [[romantic or other feelings of fondness]].

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1081351744808923136) slave is also a radical word, so let's change it to control.
>
>  How to Get Rich
>  ・Control the organization
>  ・Control your emotions
>  ・Control capital
>  ・Control calculator
>
>  Well, no, computers are modern slavery,
>  No sense that [[dumping]] through slavery is eating existing industry.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1081352956136452096) I don't think it's good because control also looks like self-control. It is other control.
>  I'm not sure if it's control or something else. I'd change the verb in each one.
>
>  How to become rich
>  ・Build and exploit organizations
>  ・Control and exploit people's emotions
>  ・Exploit capital based on capital
>  ・Dumping and exploiting computing machines by making them work as slave labor
>
>  I wonder if it's something like this?
