[Public goods (i.e. goods or services such as parks or highways)" is an economic concept that refers to goods and services that have the following characteristics
- [[non-excludability]]: consumption by one individual does not interfere with the consumption of another individual.
- [Noncompetitiveness: Consumption by one individual does not reduce the amount available to other individuals.

In the context of an organization, for example, the following are "internal public good values"
- Clarify the organization's mission or [[vision]].
    - [[knowledge sharing]] or [[know-how sharing]].
- [Fostering a "cooperative organizational culture
- Improving the quality of open source software

They go beyond the contribution of a particular individual to the benefit of the organization as a whole. However, due to the nature of public goods, they tend not to be adequately supplied through market mechanisms.

The [[PMP]] seeks to provide a dynamic incentive design and collective decision-making mechanism for contributions to facilitate the creation of such "internal public good value." In this way, it seeks to elicit cooperation and overall optimization within the organization.
