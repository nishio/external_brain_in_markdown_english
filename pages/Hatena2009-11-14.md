*1258167925* How to dispose of "unburnable trash".
Unburnable trash is not being disposed of well. Why is that? Because we procrastinate thinking, "The non-burnable trash day is the first third Wednesday of the month, let's throw it out then."

Burnable trash is not put in trash bags on burnable trash days. Burnable trash is usually put in trash bags "when you decide to throw it out" and the accumulated bags are taken out on burnable trash day. So non-burnable trash should also be put in trash bags when you decide to throw it out.
