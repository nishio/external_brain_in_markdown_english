["Please add Hirakata City to Momotetsu" Gutsy presentation in front of Momotetsu game director Sixth graders at Ogura Elementary School in Hirakata, Osaka (Ovo) - Yahoo! Yahoo! News](https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/cad876d5219d9589149872375f7679d6036b28d0)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Sixth graders from Ogura Elementary School in Hirakata, Osaka, made a presentation to add Hirakata City to the popular game "Momotaro Dentetsu". Through this experience, they learned the importance of failure and subsequent challenge. The creators of the game advised them on the importance of having [[originality]] and the need to have [[Different Perspectives]] from others in order to be selected among many proposals. They also stressed the importance of having a dream, and setting goals and continuing to work hard to achieve them.

- > The critique from the creator of Momotetsu was harsh. The first one was [[Shoji Masuda]], director/game designer of "Momotaro Dentetsu World," who made it clear that he would not treat the game like a child....
- > The reality is that there are rivals. You will be compared. The person who pushes them away may or may not get their proposal adopted...
- > Noting that many of the properties proposed by each group were duplicates, he said, "Eighty percent of the people said the same thing. This will not be adopted. Because they have the same point of view as everyone else," he said.
[[Noriaki Okamura]]
- > If you are trying to get ahead of others, you can't just do the same thing as everyone else. I want you to look at what others are doing and think about bringing out your own color.
