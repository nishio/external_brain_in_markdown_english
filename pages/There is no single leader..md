title: "There is no single leader."

Mr. Anno said he doesn't want [[Digital Democracy 2030]] activities to be tied to him alone.
[I want to stop having the top image of the LP as the Anno image - Issue #1 - digitaldemocracy2030/website](https://github.com/digitaldemocracy2030/website/issues/1)
>  Yasuno is not the only one doing this activity.
>  I would like to grow the community in a direction that prevents the creation of a genus as much as possible.
>  dd2030 wants to be politically neutral, and I don't think it's a good idea to have a personal face in the foreground.
>  I think it would be good to have names and pictures of board members where they introduce who they are.

Mr. Yasuno does not want his face to appear at the top of the page, but on the other hand, if people see the project on the page in the future and wonder who is working on it, it will look suspicious if there is no information. If the project page is not informative, people will be suspicious of the project. If there is data on Slack and Discource that can be used to get a good sense of the activity, it may be possible to create an entry for each of them.

Hal Seki:
As for the leader story, I think g0v's "nobody" policy is great, and Code for Japan is also a great reference.
> g0v is a community, not an organization. There is no fixed territory, no members, no way to join, no spokesperson, no single leader. g0v began at an unexpected time, in late 2012, with the slogan "Everyone can join, no one is 'all things to all people'". Like the free imagination of the early days of the Internet, it brought together many people who were dissatisfied with centralized power. The "Zero Hour Government" (g0v in Chinese characters) was born. Perhaps the beginnings of "government at zero," bi-monthly hackathons, and biennial summits are the result of a cycle that has resulted from everyone's openness, belief in freedom, and steadfast community management.

It should be noted that we are not saying that there is no need for a leader, but that there is no "single" leader, and in fact there are people who pull in leadership roles for each of the various projects.
