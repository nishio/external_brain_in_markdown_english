## Digest 1
On how to improve cognitive resolution.

## Digest 2
.
In order to increase "cognitive resolution," it is important to improve the skills of using tools, as indicated by fragments such as "New Doors Open (2023-02-12)" and "Increased Skills in Using Tools Lead to More Detailed Perceptions of the World." In addition, fragments such as "Resolution of perception of things," "Examples of cognitive resolution," and "Tools to improve cognitive skills" suggest that the use of tools to improve cognitive skills and the accuracy of identifying things are means to improve cognitive resolution.

## deep thinking
To improve cognitive resolution, it is important not only to improve one's own recognition and identification accuracy, but also to improve one's tool use skills. The use of tools that enhance cognitive skills can also be helpful.

## one-line summary
To improve cognitive resolution, tools are utilized to increase identification accuracy, improve tool use skills, and enhance cognitive abilities.

## Title
.
"Three components of cognitive resolution: identification accuracy, tool use skills, and cognitive enhancement tools."
