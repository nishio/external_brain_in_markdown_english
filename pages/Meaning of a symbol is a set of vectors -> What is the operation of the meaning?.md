title: "Meaning of a symbol is a set of vectors -> What is the operation of the meaning?"
---

- If [[meaning]] of [[symbol]] is [[set]] of [[vector]], what can be the [[semantic operation]]?

    - [[k-method]] etc. is an operation that turns [[vector set]] into a set of vectors.
    - The operation of simply averaging a set of vectors is equivalent to the k-means method with k=1
    - A kind of = [[abstraction]] that ignores differences between individual vectors and combines them into one.
    - [[projection]]
    - There was talk of [[being crushed in the middle of something]] being an abstraction, of the vector of meaning.
    - The same can be done for a set of vectors
- Find the distance
    - Given multiple sets of vectors, find the distance between them
    - This means applying [[hierarchical clustering]] to meanings
