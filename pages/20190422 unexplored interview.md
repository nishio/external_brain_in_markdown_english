The video of the interviewee received during the event of Unexplored Juniors is now available.
I'm talking about network reconnection with unexplored foundations as hubs, but I didn't feel like I could get the message without the prerequisite knowledge.
- In 2011, when Dr. Takeuchi asked me to write a one-page essay on "Unexplored," I wrote what I thought was the best way to convey the message, "[[Unexplored as a network formation system]].
    - I was adopted in 2002, so at this point it had been 9 years.
- Mr. Ukai was adopted in 2011, Mr. Arakawa in 2004, Mr. Yasukawa in 2012, and so on.
    - Alumni/alumnae participated in the annual results reporting meeting, and a loose network was created through face-to-face meetings.
    - A "place for alumni/alumnae to give advice" was created for current students each year.
        - A common purpose began to arise, "to support the projects of current students."
        - Instead of just meeting face to face, "discussions" occur when we have a common goal.
        - Get to know each other better.
            - Related: [[Gathering is the first step, staying together is progress, working together is success.]]
- In 2014, the General Incorporated Association Unexplored was created to do things that are difficult to do at an independent government agency.
    - Unexplored Junior is a project started by Unexplored alumni who got together at an Unexplored Foundation event and hit it off in a bar.
    - The [[unexplored association]] covered the costs of the first year of the unexplored junior.
        - Later, sponsors increased and the company became independently profitable.
- Unexplored Junior can be said to be "a [[network formation system]] created with reference to the unexplored.
    - And the creation of unexplored juniors is itself an effect of "[[the]] formed network."
    - A situation in which a cycle of positive feedback is being built
