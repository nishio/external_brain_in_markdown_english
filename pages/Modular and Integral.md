title: "Modular and Integral"

- There are two ways to do this in [[Product Architecture]].
- Combination type (modular)
- Integral

- [[modular]]
- Combine relatively large [parts
- Locally efficient in that parts can be reused
    - [[Interaction between modules]] must follow a standardized protocol
- Extra [[overhead]] and inefficiencies occur in [[seam]] of parts
    - Worse than integral type in terms of [[Global Features]] such as overall footprint, weight, power consumption, etc.
- Module components can be independent products and can be easily procured from other companies
    - [[Modularity Trap]] # Trap

- [[integral]]
- Small component granularity
- Interactions are not standardized.
- Sometimes you can create a [[competitive edge]] by tuning to the crunch.
