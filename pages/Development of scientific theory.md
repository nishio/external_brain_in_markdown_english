title: "Development of scientific theory"

> I think the most accessible textbook on philosophy of science is "[[Adventures in Philosophy of Science]]" and the most well organized one is "Development of Scientific Theory". The former is easier to read, but I think it is the latter that I find more interesting after reading it.
