title: "Mathematical model in which relationships determine meaning"
---

When the meaning is a vector of higher dimensions, the relationship is determined by the operations between the vectors.
- This is the mathematical model found in [[word2vec]] and others
- If the vectors are orthogonal, there is no relationship.

- As [[Eugene Gendlin.]] pointed out, association determines meaning
- What kind of mathematical model is this?
- These two symbols are related, and are passed
    - [[CIRCUMLOCUTION]].
- But this is what word2vec does internally.
    - The word "this word is related" is presented with the co-occurrence of the word in the window.
