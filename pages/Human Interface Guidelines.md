> [@Psychs](https://twitter.com/Psychs/status/1613197395327868928?s=20&t=K0SCtEHu9eSmm0gsEI24-A): Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, recently. The latest version of Apple's Human Interface Guidelines is so specific about the design system that the design philosophy behind it has been lost, and the meaning of reading them has been lost. If you search "ios human interface guidelines 2011", you can find PDFs as of 2011, so I suggest you read those.

I downloaded it and put it in my Dropbox because I don't know how long the old one will be available (note to future self).
