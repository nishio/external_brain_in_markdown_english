title: "No bad questions."
---

    - [[question]] is also beneficial to the respondent
- [Masahiro Maeno,](https://twitter.com/irobutsu/status/923685998575304709)
    - If the respondent is inclined to "do [[good question]]," the question itself will not be asked.

    - If the question is, "Didn't I just explain that to you?" then that shows that that part was not communicated.
    - If a basic question is asked that you left out because you thought it was self-evident, you will find that there is a gap in your assumptions.

supplement
- This is just a mindset thing on the part of the person receiving the questions, not literally "no bad questions".
    - For example, [[double-barrel]].
    - There are inefficient questions (= inefficient questions).
    - Some questions are misleading.
