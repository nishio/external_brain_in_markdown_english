title: "Individuals and Categories"

A "I don't feel it is correct to say 'X is Y' when there is a proper noun X that refers to a specific thing and a category Y that refers to it."
B "I see, that means 'Mr. A is not a human being'."

C "That's right, since X is included in category Y."
B "I see. In other words, 'Mr. A is a human being' and 'Mr. C is an animal'."

- [I'm not sure if this is a boomerang joke or not, but the composition is similar and it might be useful for something in the future.

The original topic was "Is Wikipedia a Wiki?" but I discarded it because of the shaky interpretation of the word "Wiki" in that regard.
