People who claimed to be strong are treated coldly when they are weak.

Even for the elderly who are not able to stand on their feet, there are those who are treated gently and those who are treated coldly.
- I guess it depends on whether that person used to do the "I'm strong, follow me" move.
- People who insist, "I'm strong," are treated coldly when they become weak.
- In some cases, they may be indiscriminately kind because they want you to treat them that way in the future.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
