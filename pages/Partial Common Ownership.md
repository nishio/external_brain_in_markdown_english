## summary of notes
.
Partial Common Ownership is a new, fair and efficient alternative to capitalist and communist methods of asset management. In this system, assets belong to no one, but to everyone. The current owner of an asset must self-assess and declare its value and pay a fee based on that self-assessed value. This fee can be used to fund public goods or distributed as a social dividend.

## Relation to Fragment
.
The "[notes from reading [/tkgshn/ "A SPECULATIVE SKETCH OF A DAO, WITH OPEN COLLECTIVE"](https://scrapbox.io/tkgshn/ "A SPECULATIVE SKETCH OF A DAO, WITH OPEN COLLECTIVE")" explains partial common ownership in detail and has direct relevance to the notes . In addition, "[memo that a "city-building proposal" was submitted to cityDAO for [/tkgshn/DAO to build a city on their own](https://scrapbox.io/tkgshn/DAO to build a city on their own)" proposes partial common ownership as part of the [[CityDAO]] project.

## deep thinking
Partial co-ownership is a new form of asset management. Its implementation and operation, however, brings with it new challenges, such as owner self-assessment and payment of fees. It is also important to understand how this system achieves fairness and efficiency through specific operational examples.
