It is compatible to say that "the person with the louder voice will be recognized faster and have an advantage" (P) when the person with the louder voice, A, and the person with the smaller voice, B, have exactly the same ability (Q) and that they will be recognized correctly and be the same in the long run (P).

- I saw on social media that Mr. B, who is not good at [[self-promotion]], claims that "in the long run they will be the same" (Q) with respect to Mr. A. That claim does not deny in any way that there is currently a difference in the P part or that A is clearly larger when integrated.
- Since I didn't observe the two of them myself, but only saw Mr. B's assertion, I feel that Q's "same in the long run" is just Mr. B's wishful thinking in the first place, and that it is more likely that Mr. A will reach a higher "long-term level" by taking advantage of the recognition he has quickly risen to.
- I don't think Mr. B's behavior is basically very beneficial, since it's so much so that the completely uninvolved outside world thinks so.
