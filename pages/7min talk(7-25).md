(concept) Connecting to the Japanese context will help Japanese people better understand Plurality, and it will also provide an opportunity for people around the world to gain new insights from Plurality. Many still find Plurality difficult to understand. I believe that increasing layers of understanding through descriptions from diverse perspectives, connections with various examples, and parallel rephrasing is beneficial.

The majority of Japanese people do not want to express their opinions using their real names.
All Japanese speakers at international conferences are outliers of Japanese culture.

Leaders must listen broadly to the anonymous voices of those in conflict (listen broadly).

KJ Method to make collective wisdom

1: Jiro Kawakita's idea of "not fitting into known groups,"
Jiro Kawakita's KJ method was developed in Japan as a way to gather public knowledge.
The KJ Method (also known as Affinity Diagram or Affinity Mapping) developed by KAWAKITA Jiro is a way to gather collective wisdom that was developed in Japan.

The KJ Method is a technique for generating collective intelligence from large amounts of descriptive data.

Good: Democratic / Bad: Autocratic
Even a distant monkey fits naturally
- Even a distant monkey that could not join a group naturally merges into the group.
Theme

> It is totally unwise to go from a large division to a small division. [You must always go from small to large. This is one of the decisive problems of this method (see Figure 7)....
> In his mind, he has an arbitrary principle of grouping, such as, "In my opinion, it is correct to divide the contents of this many paper materials into three major categories: market research, quality control, and labor management. The company simply applies this dogmatic classification scheme and fits paper scraps of data into the ready-made framework. In this way, the conceptual significance of the KJ method is completely lost.
- [[way of thinking]]  p.77
- It is completely wrong to move from broad categories to finer ones. We must always proceed from finer categories to broader ones. This is one of the critical issues with this method. ...
- This is because in your mind, you already have a preconceived notion about how to categorize the pieces of information, such as "According to my understanding, it is correct to broadly categorize these pieces of paper into market research, quality control, and labor management." You are merely applying this arbitrary classification framework and sorting the pieces of information into these preconceived categories. This completely nullifies the creative significance of the KJ Method.

The KJ method's conceptual significance is completely lost if you just apply the grouping principles you have in your mind and simply sift and fit paper scraps into the ready-made wak. (Nishio summary)
- Merely applying the existing principles of grouping in your mind and sorting the pieces of information into these ready-made frameworks completely nullifies the creative significance of the KJ Method.

We must let go of existing frameworks.
"ready-made grouping frameworks"

Group boundaries created by preconceived notions must be broken.
We must break down the boundaries of groups created by preconceptions.

Ken Suzuki's idea of "NAMERAKA(smooth)" boundary blurring,

Let's make the world not flat, not step, but NAMERAKA(smooth)!
FLAT
homogeneous
homogeneous / singular

STEP
Differences.
dividing into parts
differences / divided into parts

smooth boundary without division

Not to make it uniform, but to eliminate fragmentation and smooth the boundaries.
We should not to make world homogeneous to resolve division. We should make the boundaries NAMERAKA(smooth).
