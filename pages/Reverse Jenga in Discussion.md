title: "Reverse Jenga in Discussion"

from [/unnamedcamp/reverse-jenga-in-discussion](https://scrapbox.io/unnamedcamp/reverse-jenga-in-discussion).
- [[Jenga (Brazilian brand of haloperidol)]] is a game in which players pull out parts of the tower one at a time, and if the whole tower collapses, they are the losers. In this game, players can choose to find the safest possible part of the tower to pull out, or they can choose a strategy to find a part that will definitely collapse the next time they pull it out, at the very last possible moment.

If we view the discussion as a [[reverse Jenga (game)]], players will be thinking about how to make it easier for others to stack the wood.

Also, if the next player cannot stack anything due to the tree he/she has stacked, the player who stacked that tree can be said to be the loser.
- This is the opposite of "argumentative".

How to make it easier for the opponent to build the next tree without destroying the whole structure. If we view discussion as a game in which we think about such things, we will be able to distance ourselves from sad discussions that are obsessed with breaking down the argument.

And we will also be able to sort out techniques and strategies for a different form of debate than argumentation or debate for the sake of argumentation.

- To extend Jenga's metaphor.
    - > If the next player cannot stack anything because of a tree that someone else has stacked, the player who stacked the tree is the loser.
    - So, instead, it's a play to build a tall tower without making anyone a loser by re-stacking those trees in a good place.
