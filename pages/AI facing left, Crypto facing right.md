title: "AI facing left, Crypto facing right"

> [realNuun](https://twitter.com/realNuun/status/1729412137947484240/photo/1) The Chinese language article "AI Xiang Left, Crypto Xiang Right", which was mentioned in the vitalik article, was translated at DeepL!
>  It's too early to be talking about AI vs Crypto already as of 2019.
>
>  "Standing at this moment in history, 2019, the two most interesting things that will happen to human society in the next two decades are almost clear.
>  One is AI, the other is crypto and blockchain.
>  Most interestingly, these two technologies will grow into two opposing forces on an ideological level. This could be the pinnacle of human society in the next decade."
>
>  "At the economic level, AI will dramatically worsen the distribution of wealth. At the military level, AI will dramatically lower the threshold for waging war. At the political level, AI will turn SF 1984 into documentary literature."
>
>  "[[Assange]], in his book "[[Cryptopunk]]," reduces the power of state institutions to three basic powers. They are the power to possess and exercise military power, the power to regulate communications, and the power to regulate the economy. Each of these powers corresponds to one of the basic human freedoms. Each of these powers corresponds to one of the basic human freedoms: freedom of life and movement, freedom of communication and expression, and freedom of economic activity.
>  The state is the culmination of a highly developed human civilization that brings order and consensus > and is the basis for large-scale human collaboration. I do not intend to oppose this model. But state power unchecked by countervailing forces will have very serious consequences.
>  As far as I know, the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is probably the only attempt to put a "last-resort halt" on the primary power of the state. The "check of last resort" is a last resort when the usual checks and balances, such as congressional authorization, have failed. But, as noted earlier, the Second Amendment has long since lost its historical significance. It now exists only as a symbol of the U.S. Constitution's respect for the tradition of civil liberties. Other countries do not even have the symbol of the Second Amendment.
>  In short, today, when state organizations have become so powerful, there is no power that the people have over the primary power, the state.
>  What about the second and third powers of the state? Is there a power that can counter it? There is! The answer is crypto & blockchain."

>  It describes the risk of human existence due to AI and blockchain as a defense technology against it.
