title: "Landing point of the KJ method"
---

- I thought that one of the reasons why the [[KJ method]] is difficult to understand is that the landing point is not clear, when I read the [[Textbook of Design Research]].

- [[empathic writing]] But it clearly states where you landed.

I also feel that I've gotten the hang of it after using the KJ method several times, not for its own sake, but for the purpose of creating a flow for my presentation materials.

On the flip side, [[the KJ method for "interesting"]] was an objective of the KJ method itself, and it was unclear what would be gained as a result of doing it.
- It is easy to focus on subjectivity as a subject of writing
- The effect is to help people understand their own values.
- Hard to know what you will end up with.
