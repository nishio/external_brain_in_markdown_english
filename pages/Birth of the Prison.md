- The Birth of Prison - [[surveillance]] and [[punishment]]" 1975
    - [[Michel Foucault]] #Foucault
    - [[panopticon]] by [Jeremy Bentham.
    - Prisoners are [[surveillance]] one-sidedly by guards.
    - Prisoners cannot know if they are being monitored.
    - Prisoners feel "constantly monitored"
    - Prisoners become [[submissive]] to authority

A mechanism to strip away [[psychological safety]], so to speak."
