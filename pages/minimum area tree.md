→ [[Kruskal method]]

The Kruskal method is O(E log E)
When E is too big to make it in time
    - The [[PRIM method]], in combination with the [[Fibonacci heap]], gives an O(E+V log V)
    - Even with a naive [[binary heap]] we get O((E+V)log V)
- O(E) if E can be sorted in linear time.
    - → [[linear time sort]]
