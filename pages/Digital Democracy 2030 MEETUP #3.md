> [hal_sk](https://x.com/hal_sk/status/1946163804464726047) In 2009, the first Web Society symposium was held at the Yasuda Auditorium. At that time, the political use of the Internet was still being discussed in a positive light.

> [hal_sk](https://x.com/hal_sk/status/1946165901054603405) The US has reached a phase where it will achieve its goals through political violence rather than through dialogue. Also the risk of civil war.

> [hal_sk](https://x.com/hal_sk/status/1946166419625857222) Information and economics have gone global, but politics have not been updated. Global inequality has narrowed, but domestic inequality has widened.
>  Politics becomes an outlet for anger.

> [hal_sk](https://x.com/hal_sk/status/1946166885013422275) A new Cold War has begun; AI will play a key role. How we use AI will be important.

> [hal_sk](https://x.com/hal_sk/status/1946167645239136425) With democracy down to the Cold War era, can Japan, a relatively undivided country, be the last bastion of democracy?
>  The world is paying attention to us.
>  On the other hand, Japan is also becoming permeated with a divisive virus. A scene I saw a long time ago in the US. The countdown to division has begun.

> [hal_sk](https://x.com/hal_sk/status/1946168451355328527) So there it is #dd2030: In the age environment of AI and the new Cold War, we must set out how we will use AI in the right direction. Update on democracy.

> [hal_sk](https://x.com/hal_sk/status/1946172290967699494) More than 7,000 suggestions for improvements to the manifesto have been registered through the Idobata system, with 6,991 Issues open. How should political parties narrow down the voices of the people and turn them into policies in a transparent and accountable manner? I am interested in the following.
>  ![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GwIxYWhXgAAvh9k?format=jpg&name=medium#.png)

> [hal_sk](https://x.com/hal_sk/status/1946173393264349357) Previously, voting was based on people's empathy.
>  Modeling opinions using AI (broad listening), understanding tradeoffs (idobata), is probabilistic.
>  Voting is what gives legitimacy to decisions. Oriented towards a better way of voting.

    - I see your point [[QV is deterministic]].

> [hal_sk](https://x.com/hal_sk/status/1946174781247905851) A yes/no vote is not a strong indication of intent; the Quadratic Voting method allows each intent to be reflected more proportionally by paying a cost. The Quadratic Voting method can reflect the will of each party more proportionally by paying a cost.
>  When showing representativeness, the strength of the selection can be expressed as a spectrum.
>  ![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GwIzpUAWUAAUsGq?format=jpg&name=medium#.png)

> [hal_sk](https://x.com/hal_sk/status/1946175804708167858) I actually made a tool that allows you to vote for/against each party with a QV, which requires more thought than yes/no because you have to assign points to each party. You need to think about it better than yes/no.
>  ![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GwI0k5NXQAAH6Tj?format=jpg&name=medium#.png)

> [hal_sk](https://x.com/hal_sk/status/1946177899113197933) Using square roots rather than adding up each individual vote allows for more inclusive decision making than simple majority voting

- He said that the story here is detailed in [[Beyond Collusion Resistance: Leveraging Social Information for Plural Funding and Voting]].
    - Co-authored by Leon and [Glen Weyl

> [hal_sk](https://x.com/hal_sk/status/1946178454610714821) QV is already in use in various countries.
>  Discussion of European political parties, Ethereum platform, GitCoin, Plurality Book editorial policy, etc. Code for Japan also uses Quadratic Funding.

> [hal_sk](https://x.com/hal_sk/status/1946179344046620691) QV can be applied to a funding mechanism (Quadratic Funding). I hope you will give it a try.
