- > [realNuun](https://twitter.com/realNuun/status/1646154173065359362) [[vess]] is giving out vess cards!

- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1646159917856747526) Thanks for the info!
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1646168691694772224) I did some research and I was wondering if it is something you have to attend an event to get? I thought it was something you could buy by mail order.
- > [realNuun](https://twitter.com/realNuun/status/1646169370954006531) It's just been released and it looks like you can't get it from the internet yet...
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1646173880741138432) I will wait patiently!

Seki-san ([[hal_sk]]) gave me this.

- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1647952084875231232) I don't know what scoops are ok to publish and what are not ok because I'm not literate about crypto security... I'm like an old man who tries to get a refund at an ATM. I'm in a state like an old man who tries to get a refund... I feel a crisis of lack of basic literacy.

- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1648259600075087872) It was a waste not to issue a credential with the first person who let me touch my VESS card when this happened. I didn't understand it at all at that time.
- > [Toori_mo](https://twitter.com/Toori_mo/status/1648533851382382592) That's me on my way back from PluralityTokyo! Let's touch when we meet again!
    - > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1648721477670428673) I just now issued it because the tab from that time remained unclosed!
- > [hal_sk](https://twitter.com/hal_sk/status/1648521737095778309) Is it best practice to have your VESS card scanned and have a wallet connection (if you have one) on the spot? Hey, I'm not sure if it's a good idea.
    - > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1648722022028181504) That's a bit like saying, "What, are you sure you want to connect your wallet to this unfamiliar thing?" It takes time, and it's not a good atmosphere to rush a decision. I could connect it later, so maybe I don't have to do it on the spot.
