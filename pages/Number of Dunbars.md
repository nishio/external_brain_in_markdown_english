title: "Number of Dunbars"
---

> The Dunbar number is the cognitive upper limit on the number of people with whom a person is considered to be able to maintain stable social relationships. In this context, a relationship is one in which an individual knows about each person and also knows how each person is related to each other. The Dunbar number was first proposed in the 1990s by British anthropologist Robin Dunbar.

Explanation of Dunbar number with a mathematical model and verification with real data

> [@mtknnktm](https://twitter.com/mtknnktm/status/1023882418153959425?s=21): phenomenological math to explain Dunbar number (roughly 150 friends) and Dunbar circles (the number of relationships is inversely proportional to the number of friends). Model and analysis of real data. I would like to be able to do this kind of research. → Cognitive resource allocation determines the organization of personal networks |PNAS [https://t.co/BsRGj40ud0](https://t.co/BsRGj40ud0)
