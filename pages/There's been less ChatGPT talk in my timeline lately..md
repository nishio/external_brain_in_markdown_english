title: "There's been less ChatGPT talk in my timeline lately."
---

from  [[Diary 2023-05-04]]

Witnessed the statement, "There has been less and less talk about ChatGPT in my timeline lately."
    - [Torn of the world.
        - [[Not reduced, but moved out of observation range.]]
        - It could be said that the [[Formation of early adopter groups]] is over.
    - This is [[chasm]].
- I think I anticipated this one and wrote about it, but I can't find it right away, so I'm writing about it again.
    - PS: I found this on Twitter
            - [[As know-how accumulates, it is not transmitted.]]
    - When [[New Technology]] emerges, [[new-obsessed]] engineers tinker with curiosity and actively [[transmit]] what they have experienced.
    - Because by transmitting, it is easier to discover others who have the same interest and are trying the same thing.
            - [[signalling]]
            - [[Information is gathered to the sender of information.]]
    - By connecting with such people, it is easier to get information about the subject you are interested in.
            - [[Formation of early adopter groups]]
- As you accumulate the know-how you use for your own work, you'll use it for work you can't transmit.
    - Then they won't transmit as much as they did in the early days.
- The other day I wrote "[[Stop trying the unpaid ChatGPT in Japanese and thinking you know what you're doing...]]" was probably the last rope I threw to the people on the other side of the tearing world.
        - [[spider silk]] reminiscent of
        - [How I stopped throwing masakari.

Suggested.
    - [[person who hangs a spider's thread]]
