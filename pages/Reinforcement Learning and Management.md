    - [[reinforcement learning]] framework
        - There is a function called [[policy]].
    - The strategy takes [[condition]] as input
    - The solution is to output [action
    - Whether the action was good or not will be known after some time ([[deferred compensation]]).
    - The expected value of future rewards for choosing a certain action is called [Action Value
    - a variety of measures
        - Randomly selected actions
            - Select [[Action Value]] to be the largest.
                - Call it [[Greedy measures]].
            - Known to be not so good
            - Because the pessimistic misconceptions are not corrected.
        - Ypsilon Greedy
            - Random action at a certain probability.
        - optimistic initial-value method
        - USB1
    - [[management]] framework
    - Management makes decisions on what to allocate limited resources to, depending on the situation.
    - If expressed in terms of reinforcement learning
        - Decision functions take a situation as input and output an allocation
        - Only time will tell if that allocation was good.

        - The definition of [[reward]] is non-trivial.
        - You might think it would be money.
        - Companies in the red cannot survive, so they must first seek to turn a profit.
            - This is "money" = "survival"
        - However, after turning a profit, it is a matter of fits and starts.
            - Companies are public institutions of society ([[Konosuke Matsushita]])
            - CSR: [Corporate Social Responsibility
                - [Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) ｜ Keizai Doyukai](https://www.doyukai.or.jp/policyproposals/plan/csr.html)
                - [[Employee Satisfaction]]
                - [[(degree of) customer satisfaction]]
            - Some are looking to expand in scale.
            - Survival of the company → long-established
            - We want more people to use the products we make.
            - If we don't go public, we can't return profits to the VCs who invested in us.
            - I don't want any trouble while I am president.
        - The company culture is a consensus within the organization on what is considered a reward.
