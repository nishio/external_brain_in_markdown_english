Double your resources
cxxxiv
Double the resources.

It makes life doubly so. One should not be dependent on one thing, nor should one rely on only one resource, no matter how good it may be. In particular, the causes of success, of favor, and of respect must all be doubled. The moon's mutability transcends all and limits all beings, especially those dependent on the human will, the most fragile of all. To prevent this instability is the attention of the wise, and for this reason the main rule of life is to have a double store of good and useful qualities. Thus, just as nature gives us a double store of the most important of our limbs and the most endangered, so art should deal with the qualities on which we depend for our success.
