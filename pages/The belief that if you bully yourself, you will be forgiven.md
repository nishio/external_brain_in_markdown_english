Don't you think you'll get the credit?" I've been traumatized by that, so I don't do [[masochism]] stories in front of others.

I had been thinking seriously that if I exposed myself to my tormentors, I would be forgiven for everything in the end. It destroyed that [[assumption]]. It was a good experience. I still have nightmares about it.

But one day, my mom told me, "Don't be self-deprecating. I was told by my mom one day, "Don't make self-deprecating jokes, the customers don't think it's funny, and you're not making them laugh, you're being laughed at.
