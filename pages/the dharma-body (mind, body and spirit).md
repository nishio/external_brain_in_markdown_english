[同理心 - 維基百科，自由的百科全書](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/同理心)

In Japanese it is `empathy`, in English `empathy`, both are `feelings`, `pathos` (passion)
On the other hand, I learned that in [[Mandarin]] it is "Tongli Shin". This uses the word "reason. It is "reason" for "understanding" or "reason."

[HiNative](https://ja.hinative.com/questions/19075645#google_vignette) has an expression "to put yourself in the other person's shoes", which is also "thinking".

relevance
    - [[empathy]]
    - [[The nuance of "convinced."]]
