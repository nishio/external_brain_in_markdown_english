- [[Human being]] is like [[instance]] of [[EC2]] with [[CPU Credits]] limit because it will die if it keeps running at maximum performance, but it cannot store unused credits without limit and they expire rather quickly, so you need to apply a moderate [[workload]] and keep running it. You need to keep applying a moderate [[workload]].

- [CPU Credits and Baseline Performance - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ja_jp/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/t2-credits-baseline-](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ja_jp/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/t2-credits-baseline-) concepts.html]
    - > 1 CPU credit is equivalent to running one vCPU for one minute at 100% utilization.
    - For instance type t2.nano
    - CPU credits received per hour: 3
    - Maximum accumulated credits: 72
    - If you take a day off, you can work hard for 72 minutes, but if you take more than a day off, you won't accumulate more than 72 minutes.
