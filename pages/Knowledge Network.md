title: "Knowledge Network"
---

He describes it as "a network of knowledge not being formed" with a nuance similar to "knowledge not being built up."
What is this "network of knowledge"?

    - [[associative connection]]
    - Disparate pieces of knowledge are connected by association.
    - This is the first step to start connecting [[Discovering Connections]] [[Discovering Relationships]] [[weak connection (e.g. in a relationship)]].
    - X and Y have been thought to be unconnected until now, but now realize that they are connected through A.
    - Example: I noticed that [[hierarchy of objectives]], which I wrote 5 years ago, is related to [[OKR]] in that it makes Objecive (goals) hierarchical.
    - [[knowledge consistency]]
    - The connections made in this way turn into "solid connections" as a number of them overlap each other.
            - [Gaining Stability" which can be placed in [[Interference Effects of Ideas]].
    - X and Y are connected through A, through B, and through C
        - →That's why there is a strong connection between X and Y.
        - Example: Both [[KJ method]], [[GTD]] and [[OKR]] commonly support the concept that "higher level concepts are created bottom-up".
    - This [[strong connection]] creates a network of knowledge.

The locations of X and Y are not fixed; they approach and move away from each other. If the link is connected when they get closer, they can follow the link and move faster when they move away.
