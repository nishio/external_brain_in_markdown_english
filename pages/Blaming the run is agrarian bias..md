title: "Blaming the run is agrarian bias."

> When I left my job to study abroad in [[Mongolia]] a long time ago, I was told, "Isn't that [[escape]]?" I was at a loss for an answer. I was at a loss for an answer. But in Mongolia, I learned that in the [[nomad]] culture, "escape" is not [[shame]]. They go forward when they can win, and run away when they are in trouble. To win tomorrow. Maybe it is [[agrarian bias]] to blame them for "running away." Because there is land to protect.

Certainly the idea that "when an enemy attacks and you are suffering, it is good to stay and fight to the death until the end, not to run away," is convenient for the sake of the government when land is more important than people.
