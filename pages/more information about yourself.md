more information about yourself
> I also think you need to give a bit more information about yourself and how you started on the journey of writing the book. That information you can just post here, and I will copy and paste it.

> I think this really adds value to the body of knowledge on learning, and the structure is good (which I suspected, seeing that you are a software engineer).
