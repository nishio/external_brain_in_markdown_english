Physical imperialism v.s. Metaphysical imperialism

> [hottaqu](https://twitter.com/hottaqu/status/1679983527075680258) The word "physical imperialism" is ranked. Let me say this in case there is any misunderstanding. I myself do not take an invasive physical imperialism. By "invasive" I mean taking everything from the other side and colonizing it. I am a person who wants dialogue. But the other party can be one-sided.

> [hottaqu](https://twitter.com/hottaqu/status/1679984354381156352) For example, some philosophers make various arguments about subjects in the scientific field that ignore the findings of science, such as "I am not a brain" or "Time in the universe has no beginning." Some philosophers, for example, make various claims about scientific themes without considering the findings of science. They cross disciplinary boundaries without regard to brain science and without regard to general relativity.

> [hottaqu](https://twitter.com/hottaqu/status/1679984940992311296) Even with such a philosopher, I would prefer a dialogue based on scientific knowledge. But what would you think if the opponent said, "This is a metaphysical philosophy, so we don't need such empirical science"? Even though the subject is essentially one of natural science.

> [hottaqu](https://twitter.com/hottaqu/status/1679986240823922688) "Existence", "time" and "space", these are also now empirical physics topics. For example, regarding "existence", the Nobel Prize in Physics for 2022 is the same. It was awarded for results on the experimental denial of local realism. The findings of general relativity are of course also important for understanding time and space.

> [hottaqu](https://twitter.com/hottaqu/status/1679987053466112000) He had never studied general relativity, whose high accuracy has been confirmed by many experiments and observations, and he crossed the border from the field of philosophy into the field of physics and said, "This is metaphysics So, this is good!" This is metaphysics! First, please learn the basics of modern physics. Then we will be able to have a dialogue.

> [hottaqu](https://twitter.com/hottaqu/status/1679987808445042688) If you want to philosophize about the big subject matter of "existence," "time," and "space," I hope that you will discuss it with a minimal foundation of modern physics. I hope that you will discuss this with a minimum of modern physics. If you call this "physical imperialism," I have no choice. But it is the philosophers who first crossed the border with "metaphysical imperialism.

> [hottaqu](https://twitter.com/hottaqu/status/1679988483136577536) Their "metaphysical" logic on scientific subjects is totally vacuous from the perspective of empirical science. It does not even include the perspective of how to explain the facts that we know from experiments and observations.

> [hottaqu](https://twitter.com/hottaqu/status/1679989562876243968) I would like to dialogue with philosophers who influence physics, as in pre-Mach philosophy. I hope so. In the last century when philosophers did not try to keep up with modern physics, the prevailing attitude in the physics industry was that of Einstein and Hawking, who despaired of such philosophy and kept their distance. Why not change that?

> [hottaqu](https://twitter.com/hottaqu/status/1679989921816387586) That is what I expect from today's philosophers. I expect it from all philosophers, especially those who wish to pioneer a modern philosophy of Being, Time, and Space. Physicists and other physicists like to talk. Dialogue is welcome.

As long as at least 1 is not there, to the philosophy (philosophy of science) community, it appears that Mr. Hotta is currently just clinching to the philosophers in his delusion.

>  "The Mystery of the Present - A Critique of the Spatialization of Time" (ed. Kunihisa Morita, Keiso Shobo). 2) For more information, please look up the respective philosophers.

> [rCEp5yIY32l5Mlt](https://twitter.com/rCEp5yIY32l5Mlt/status/1680083611758755841) Thank you. I skimmed through the Kindle version of Morita (2019), and it is true that there are those who are not so sure about this one. I would recommend reading the British Journal of Political Science or Social Studies of Science, as I think you will meet people with whom Hotta-san would like to have a dialogue.
