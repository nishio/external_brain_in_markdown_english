Just as some inventions, such as the [[telescope]], have resulted in the loss of value of Church doctrines that were considered correct at the time, so some inventions, such as the LLM, may result in the loss of value of what was unquestionably found to be of value until recently
- It could be "[[objectivity]]."
- What we thought was objective until now is merely "a [[selection]] and [[summary]] of information by [[subjective interpretation]]" by Homo sapiens, who cannot handle a large amount of data "as is", while taking great care not to distort it arbitrarily as much as possible. It is nothing more than a "selection and [[summary]] of information by [[subjective interpretation]].
    - This "meticulous care" is [[craftsmanship]], so the value was found in the deliverables
        - = A cursory summary is of little value.
    - What was thought to be "objective/not objective" is "better summarized, higher-value subjectivity" and "crudely summarized, lower-value subjectivity."
- And in the future AI will provide "subjectivity that is even more valuable than that created by homo sapiens" at a lower cost.
    - At this point, there is some debate as to whether the quality of "AI-generated summaries" exceeds the quality of "human-generated summaries," but from the standpoint of [[cost effectiveness]], there is no room for debate.
    - Reading 1,000 opinions and giving a quick commentary on what opinions are available is very time consuming for a human, but AI can do it in a very short time in the form of [[Talk to the City]], etc.
- When that happens, the "[[summary craftsman]]" who used to provide value to society by producing objective findings and thereby receiving payment from society loses value.
    - Just as [[sock artisans]] lost their value when [[automatic knitting machines]] were created.
- A structure similar to that of [[the downfall of the authority of the church]] may occur in the form of [[the downfall of the authority of science]].

    - [[Not subjective or objective, but from the subjectivity of one to the subjectivity of many.]]
