I typed in 090 xxxxxx-xxxx and got an error, then I typed in 090 xxxxxxxxxx and it didn't work, and I thought they wouldn't contact me anyway, so I typed in exactly what it says in the example and still no luck, so I'm disappointed.

I had not noticed that there was another input field on the left.
