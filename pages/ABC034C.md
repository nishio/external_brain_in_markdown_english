- Thoughts.
    - Isn't it simply DP?
    - No. A simple DP would be 10^10 for the largest case, so it's impossible.
    - Is it a problem that can be mathematically transformed to arrive at a solution of smaller order?
    - This is, in essence, asking for the number of ways to choose the H times to move vertically out of the W+H times, so we can find $C(W+H, H)$.
- Official Explanation
    - I've read about finding the inverse of the factorial to get this, but it's known to me.
    - Did I put this together on one of the pages?
    - Written [[Combination in mod P]].
