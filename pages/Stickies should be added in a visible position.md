title: "Stickies should be added in a visible position"
---

I think this was solved by [[Move the text input field to the top of the screen]] [[pRegroup-done-2019]].
- > When I scroll down the screen and add a new sticky, it is added in a place where it is not visible (at the top) at that position.

    - TODO: This is a bug and will be fixed
        - If implemented correctly, sticky additions are always placed in order starting from the upper right corner of the current field of view.
        - On iPad, it is placed in the upper right corner without any problem after scrolling.
            - Is the misalignment caused by the difference in screen size?
