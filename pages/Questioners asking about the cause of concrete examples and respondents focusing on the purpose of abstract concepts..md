title: "Questioners asking about the cause of concrete examples and respondents focusing on the purpose of abstract concepts."

> [ockeghem](https://twitter.com/ockeghem/status/1751925530340028791) On Quora, I was asked the question, 'I'm a programmer, but I don't have a solid understanding of the physics of why cache memory is fast, even after looking it up on the Internet. I'm trying to resist the urge to answer, 'Because if it's not fast, it doesn't serve the purpose of cache memory.

Interesting structure to this question.
What is the discrepancy between the questioner and the respondent?

The questioner is seeking a physical reason or technical explanation as to "why cache memory is fast". On the other hand, the respondent is attempting to answer from a result or purpose-based perspective, "cache memory must be fast." The questioner is seeking a cause, whereas the respondent is attempting to provide an answer focused on the "objective. This is a perception gap often seen when understanding technical concepts.

The ideal answer would encompass both why cache memory speed is important (the objective) and how it is achieved (the cause or physical explanation) in a way that the questioner can understand. Reasons why cache memory is fast include its physical design, data access optimization, proximity, and other technical factors. A detailed explanation of these factors will provide a more complete understanding of the inquirer's question.

- This is "[[Why four types of]]."
- Respondents focus on "purpose."
    - He believes that "caches are intended to provide fast data access by interspersing fast storage media."
    - I, too, think "that's what the concept of cache is all about."
        - All of the following are "cached"
            - Access to DRAM is cached in SRAM
            - HDD accesses are cached in DRAM
            - HDD caches access to the Internet
- The questioner focuses on why SRAM is faster than DRAM with respect to one specific implementation of "cache," e.g., "access to DRAM is cached in SRAM.
    - However, it is not clearly verbalized, and is expressed in a fluffy way as "why cache memory is faster.
        - Low conceptual resolution.
        - Focus is blurred.
    - > [ockeghem](https://twitter.com/ockeghem/status/1751928964220952754) On the surface of the question, I think you are asking why fast memory used for cache memory is faster as a device. I'm not sure if I can answer that.
        - The respondent may not be what the questioner is looking for when he/she explains "why SRAM is faster than DRAM" in terms of physical design, proximity, and a wide range of other factors. He feels that this is not what the questioner is looking for.
        - On the surface, literally, that's what the questioner is looking for, but I don't trust them because often "people don't verbalize well what they want".
        - He also believes that the cause of the high speed in its specific implementation is "not very important"
            - The important thing is that it be fast, so it will be replaced when something faster is available.
            - As for the abstract layer structure, I'm thinking that's a lower layer we're talking about.

[[Questioner-answer miscommunication]].
