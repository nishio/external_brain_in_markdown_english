This is the hub page for personal notes for the "[[collect one's thoughts]] [[Digital Stationery]] Kozaneba" implementation project #pProjectIndex

- [[zooming interface]]

Wouldn't it be convenient enough to simply have a notes field in Kozaneba?

I'm Gyazo because I might change the image of the menu of the line-drawing function, but after changing it once, I'll make it my own because I've been using it for a long time with satisfaction.
- I'm uncomfortable with the sometimes slight delay in loading.

About the link between Kozaneba and Scrapbox
- I can link from Kozaneba to Scrapbox, but Scrapbox doesn't understand it.
    - Kozaneba should be able to output a list of links to Scrapbox in Scrapbox format.
    - You can put that on any page in Scrapbox.

- This link from "concrete experience", useful in connecting distant things from different perspectives, but disturbing because the line doesn't get any thinner than a certain distance.
    - Lower the lower limit of thinness more?
        - become difficult to see
            - You could make it temporarily thicker only during drag.
    - Make it vary depending on the size of the sticky note at the endpoint.
        - This way, distant but important links can be represented by making the sticky larger.



> [[When expanding from one page, do not draw a line from the center, but draw a line to the siblings]].
- from  [[Kozaneba Development Diary 2023-02-15]]
- No, that's not good 2023/11/29
- Because it will not be able to be settled at about N=7.
    - How about "draw a line between the first and second closest of the siblings in terms of vector similarity."
    - Maybe just "first"?
        - At first I thought that a lot of pairs with only two pieces would occur.
        - But you can do the KJ method's starting point "[[find the closest pair]]".
