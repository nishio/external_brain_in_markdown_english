<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3-mini-high/icon' alt='o3-mini-high.icon' height="19.5"/>With the rapid development of digital technology in Japan, there is a growing concern about information control by the state and large corporations and infringement of individual freedom and sovereignty behind the backdrop of convenience, which is being discussed as "digital totalitarianism" or "[[digital fascism]]". Specifically, in the context of the government's promotion of DX and the establishment of digital agencies, criticisms have developed about the risks of dependence on foreign capital and data concentration, inadequate privacy protection, and lack of transparency, all of which endanger the assets and sovereignty of the people. These arguments have been widely taken up by the media, academia, and think tanks, which have called for the need to develop legal systems to protect democracy and individual autonomy as the digital society progresses.

- Expansion of surveillance and information operations.
- There is a widely shared concern, exemplified by Shoshana Zubov's "[[The Age of Surveillance Capitalism]]," that big data and algorithmic collection and analysis of personal information are eroding individual freedom and decision-making, the very foundation of democracy. Numerous papers and reports discuss the risks of states and corporations using digital technologies to monitor and manipulate citizens and strengthen authoritarian rule.

- Big Tech's influence.
- Think tanks such as [[Harrison Heritage]] and [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] have warned that major platforms such as Google, Facebook (Meta), and Twitter (now X) can foster political conflict and distort public debate through content censorship and algorithmic They warn of the potential for major platforms such as Google, Facebook (Meta), and Twitter (now X) to foster political conflict and distort public debate through censorship of content and algorithmic bias of information.

- Rise of competitive authoritarianism.
- Some critics have noted that even in democracies such as the United States and Europe, there is a trend ("[[competitive authoritarianism]]") in which elections and government institutions are manipulated by a few powerful individuals, systematically reducing civil liberties.

- Technological evolution and political automation.
- More recently, it has been discussed how AI and automation technologies are being integrated into the political process, replacing traditional dialogue and consensus building with algorithmic management and prediction, which is also linked to the concept of "[[The Artificial State]]".

Thus, in the English-speaking world, the threat of digital totalitarianism is discussed from multiple angles, both in terms of the benefits of digital technology for democracy, but also in terms of its negative impact on individual liberty and the public sphere.

The following characteristics can be observed

Digitization as a National Strategy
- The Chinese government has embraced concepts such as "Digital China" and "Cyber/Network Strong Nation" as its apex strategy for modernizing the country's governance system, achieving high-quality economic development, and improving its international competitiveness. The key statements of General Secretary 习近平总书记 are frequently cited as the basic principles of the digital economy, digital government, data security, and network governance, and their practical significance is emphasized in policy documents and press reports.

Promoting Digital Government and the Digital Economy
- Specific measures to improve administrative efficiency and transparency are discussed, including the establishment of a digital government, the online implementation of government services, and the development of data sharing and security. Successful examples of "Digital Zhejiang" and "Numeric Government" are presented in various regions, and these are positioned as models for digital reform on a national scale.

Systematic and holistic approach
- Digitalization is not just a technological innovation, but is considered to be deeply linked to the transformation of a nation's overall governance system and economic structure. The Chinese government aims to achieve "governance with wholeness" by utilizing digital technology through data integration, security measures, and the development of legal systems.
    - [[General Secretary Xi Jinping and the Digital Economy]]

In general, the prevailing tone in the Chinese-speaking world is a perspective that views digital technology as an important element of national strategy and actively promotes it as a means of promoting national control and economic development. Rather than critical connotations, the emphasis is on a position that positively evaluates the innovation, efficiency, and international competitiveness of state governance through digitalization.
