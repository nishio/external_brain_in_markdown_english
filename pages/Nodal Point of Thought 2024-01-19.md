I heard about one person who didn't participate when everyone else was playing a game.
- They said, "Let's do it." I said, "I don't do that kind of thing."
- I said, "Well, let's leave him alone," and the others said, "No, let's leave him alone."
- I left one of them alone and we all enjoyed the game together.
- Finally, that person who did not participate said, "It still doesn't sound interesting."

I said, "That sounds like 'those grapes must be sour.
    - [[sour grapes]]

poor
- I'm triggering myself and hurting my own self-esteem.
    - You don't realize it.
- I'm getting more and more stubborn [[and the world is closing in]].
    - For example, if the people who played the game at that time say, "That was fun, let's do it again," the people who said "no" are not invited.
- Everyone around you knows you're weak, trying to appear willful and strong.

It's about one person who doesn't participate when everyone else is working on something.
- We're all doing something together.
    - You can join us, too, and we invite you to join us!
- And yet there was an uncle who didn't participate and was criticizing them at a distance.
- If he'd been in the loop and spoken up, he might have helped others, but he was just mumbling from afar, so he was never used in a useful way.

Afraid to participate?
- Are you too afraid to approach a stranger to have an equal conversation with them and are you throwing stones from afar?
- And it never occurred to you that the people around you would think that you are a good person?
- Fellow of "[I am afraid of not knowing.
    - For example, if you're in a position where people are asking you questions, you have to say you don't know what you don't know.
        - Well, some people pretend to understand and call bullshit.
    - If you don't participate in the event, you won't be in a position to ask questions.
        - Just tell us what you know.
            - Avoids the "I don't know."
    - Uh, "position" is "position."
            - [[Critics who take no position]].

The story of an uncle who can't ask for advice.
- People who act like they want advice without asking for it.
- I said, "It's hard to ask people for things."
- Why is it so difficult?
    - To ask is to undermine self-esteem, and if your self-esteem is on the edge, you can't afford to undermine it a little bit, so you're just being stubborn.
    - If you have enough self-esteem, a decrease to the point of asking for a favor or apologizing can be quickly regained.
    - [[ears of rice drooping like beehives as they ripen]]
        - [[Empty barrels resonate well.]]

The first "who wasn't in the game."
- In fact, his self-esteem was on the edge and he couldn't even stand to play the game as an equal and lose?
- Did you want to gain self-esteem by being "begged" not to say that and to please join us for your refusal?
    - As a result, they ignored me, they played games with me, and I got the message, "We don't need you."

- [[break bricks]]
- [[A world of speed]]
- [[People who just collect and use them misidentify the belongings of those who make them as found objects.]]
