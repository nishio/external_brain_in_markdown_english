I finished reading Diaspora and thought it was interesting, but then I was seized by some mysterious sense of loss and said, "Everything seems so boring. Life is boring! Life is so boring! What am I going to do? Then I realized that today was the last day of the month and I had to go to the bank to pay the rent. In other words, the feelings I just described are what I feel when I get into a situation where I don't have a clear "next task" to do.

So I transferred the money anyway and came back.
- Rent transfer
- □ Boil 3 liters of beet tea and leave it to stand
- □ When the sugar beet tea has cooled down, pour it into a PET bottle.
- □ Labeling cables

At any rate, I labeled the four cables. Now I don't have to worry about "Oh, what's the other end of this cable? But I made the mistake of choosing white and green for the color of the vinyl tape. Labeling in white against a white cable is not very visible. I'll get some blue next time and try labeling white extension cables and such. Would yellow be better?

- ■ Labeling cables.
- Build shelves.

Hmmm. I'm running out of 11x11 mesh for the horizontal shelving, I'll need to restock a couple of pieces.
