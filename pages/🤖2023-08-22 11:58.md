### digest
.

Discomfort-driven intellectual production is problem-aware and aims to improve processes. Without problem awareness, we just trace methods and get the job done. However, in that way of working, you are just selling off your life time and turning it into money. It is important to devise ways to make that time an investment in self, even if you are doing the same work. The goal is to maintain enjoyment and keep intellectual productivity high.

Discomfort-driven intellectual production increases the value of ideas by verbalizing what is not verbalized. Ideas are replicable resources, and ideas that are identical to existing ideas or that do not generate enthusiasm themselves are of low value. Ideas need to be generated according to the situation. Ideas are valuable when they are nurtured and refined with effort. It is important to create and sustain a "state of goodness."

The process of discomfort-driven intellectual production and the process of increasing the value of ideas are closely related through the awareness of the problem and the investment of effort. Discomfort-driven intellectual production is the process of increasing the value of ideas through problem awareness. In order to increase the value of ideas, it is important to put in the effort to resolve discomfort when you feel it.

### Relation to Nishio's fragment
.

The fragment of the first BMOT special class "Intellectual Production" mentions the importance of discomfort-driven intellectual production and problem awareness, which is relevant to my research. Also, the fragment "When to change the front cover of the KJ method (creation process)" discusses the improvement of the value of ideas and the continuation of the "good state", which is consistent with my research.

### Deep thoughts and questions

I believe that discomfort-driven intellectual production is about being aware of a problem and putting effort into it, but what specific effort should be put into it? Also, to what extent does problem awareness increase the value of ideas? These points need to be considered in more depth.
