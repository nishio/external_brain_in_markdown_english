[Document Classification by CNN+LSTM using Kanji radicals as features | Artificial Intelligence R&D Engineers Group - Nextremer Inc.](https://www.nextremer.com/blog/5636/)
polarisation] by [[CNN]]+[[LSTM]] using [[radical (of a kanji character)]] as a feature

Use [[CHISE / Kanji Structure Information Database]] to obtain radical information

- It would be good to combine with [[Kanji Dividend Chart by Grade]].
