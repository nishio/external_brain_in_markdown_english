title: "Participate in projects you don't share"

    - [[empathy]] Should I not participate in a project that doesn't [[empathy]]?
- If you participate in a project that you don't share, and then communicate your opinion, it's possible that some people will share that opinion.
        - [[The first follower makes the leader.]]
        - [[Engulfing force]]
- This would create [[Diversity of Opinions]] in the project.
- This is preferable.
- If no followers are created, [[natural extinction]] can be done.

An idea that came up while chatting.
This idea never occurred to me, so I'll make a note of it anyway.
