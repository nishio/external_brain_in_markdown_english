title: "Fragments and Systems"
---

Some have asked, "What is [[systematic knowledge]]?"
I think the synonym is "[[Fragmentary knowledge]].

- [[fragmentary]]
- [[systematic]]
- [[fragment]]
- [[system]]

What connects the fragments
- connection
- Associative connections
- (strongly emphatic) not ...
- Maybe "seemingly contradictory" is important.
    - The unthinking person asks, "Which is right?" or, again, they assume the one they saw first is right and ignore the one that came later.
        - [[dialectics]]
