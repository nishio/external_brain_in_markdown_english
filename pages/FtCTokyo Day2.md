If we can stand out from other departments, other municipalities by using new mechanisms, then the decision makers will see the value in that and choose it, and legitimacy will be created."

> [naritaiki](https://x.com/naritaiki/status/1816322861596041692) It was interesting to learn about Taiwan's Quadratic Funding initiative from the first Digital Minister, Audrey Tang. It is a good example of mixing democracy and capitalism in an intermediary way to solve the issues of (1) one person one vote and (2) voting rights based on the amount of contribution when deciding how to use the funds among the contributors. Similar efforts are underway in Shibuya.

>  ・How to get background data on individuals (e.g., gender, age, etc. from audio. Different people have different ring worlds)
>  ・How to compress data (e.g., abstraction of individual feelings)
>  ・How far to create clusters (there is a limit to subdivide)

> [leopom10](https://x.com/leopom10/status/1816363474974638139) Quadratic Funding is pooled once and then redistributed? #FtCTokyo
- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1816373017972466137) I think the question is probably about the concept of matching pools, where donations to individual projects go directly to individual projects, and donations to the "whole group of projects" (also called matching funds, etc.) are pooled and distributed by the QF algorithm based on the behavior of individual donations. and budgets (also called matching funds, etc.) are pooled and distributed by the QF algorithm based on the behavior of individual donations.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1816367151932227937) @hal_sk I'm writing this because a thought has developed that if OSS is imitated by for-profit companies, they can only aim at society as a WHOLE for their profits. with OSS OSS can empower small communities like PTAs, festivals and neighborhood associations. This has a "several groups at crossroads" supportive meaning #FtCTokyo

You're a Speaker and here I am, "Are you a moderator?" "No, I'm not." or "Three, not four?" I thought there was some kind of miscommunication, and to my surprise, my presentation was skipped.
- Glen's presentation was immediately followed by a Q&A session
- I don't want to have to deal with unexpected happenings on the nervous podium of this group of men.
- After thinking about what to do, I decided that it was overall optimal to abandon my presentation opportunity and continue with the Q&A session rather than interrupt the Q&A session to present my presentation
    - I didn't seem to get a chance to announce that, so I resorted to raising my own hand during the Q&A session and asking people to nominate themselves.

> [yojunkaneko](https://x.com/yojunkaneko/status/1816361292137128376) Related to this comment, I asked Audrey Tan about the balance between Protest and Demonstration in the latter session I asked Audrey Tan about the balance between Protest and Demonstration in the latter part of the session. It was interesting to hear her comment that protests do not directly create the connections that follow, but that they are meant to be an outpouring of energy from the activity.
