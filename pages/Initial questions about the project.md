title: "Initial questions about the project"

First question.] for the project.
Do you want to make "What do you want to get out of it by doing this project?" ([[future tense]]) the first [[question]]?
What [[background]] led you to come up with this project?" ([[a past (i.e. a personal history)]]) to start with?

- Maybe [[fact]] in [[a past (i.e. a personal history)]] was easier for the interviewee to talk about and resulted in a better outcome. Various facts could be drawn out.
- Although [[clean language]] avoids focusing on the past because it was created to treat [[emotional trauma]], there is no need to avoid it in our use case.

This story later led to [My own notes on listening to other people's ideas

- [[Facts of the Past]] is [[easy to talk to]].
- [[Facts about the past are easy to talk about.]]
- [[interview]]
- [[listening closely]]
