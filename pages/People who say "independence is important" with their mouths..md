title: 'People who say "independence is important" with their mouths.'
---

There are teachers and parents who say, "Independence is important," but don't have it themselves.
These types of people don't have their own "experience with voluntary activities and being accepted," so they don't know what to do when a student or child actually does something voluntary.
This results in a rejecting attitude toward "students who act voluntarily.
