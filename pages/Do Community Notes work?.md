- There has been criticism that [[Meta's discontinuation of its professional fact-checker]] and its replacement with X's (formerly Twitter's) "[[Community Notes]]" is a camouflage for cost cutting and abdication of responsibility.
- However, studies have shown that Community Notes themselves have a high accuracy rate (e.g., 97%) and can serve as a warning against misinformation.
    - > “A study of covid related Notes in 2022-23 found 97% accuracy (according to medical professionals).”
        - ref. [[“Inoculation” to Resist Misinformation]]
- On the other hand, the response time is slow (often more than 7 hours, up to 70 hours) and the scope of the response is not sufficient to control the initial spread of the postings.
    - > “…relevant notes typically took more than seven hours to show up, with some taking as long as 70 hours.”

    - > Only 29% of fact-checkable tweets in our sample carry a note rated helpful. And of the helpful notes, only 67% are assigned to a fact-checkable tweet. This is not the kind of precision and recall figures that typically get a product shipped at a big tech platform.
    - >  Zooming out, the picture doesn’t look any brighter. In the three days leading up to the election, fewer than 6% of the roughly 15,000 notes reached helpful status.

- The new "bridging algorithm" is an ingenious way to discount the political bias of voters and other factors in order to achieve a fair evaluation.
- However, since the algorithm finds polarization structures and discounts votes, it is pointed out that even votes based on expertise may be disregarded.
- Overall, Community Notes is one of the promising methods, but challenges remain in speed, coverage, and countermeasures against bias.


> “This study found that notes on inaccurate tweets reduce retweets by half, and increase the probability that the original author deletes the tweet by 80%.”

- This is consistent with the results of the [[Birdwatch]] paper
