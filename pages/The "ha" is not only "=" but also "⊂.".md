- When you say "[[X is Y]]"
- One interpretation is "[[X=Y]]."
    - Since this is a symmetric relation, "Y=X" also holds.
    - Sometimes it doesn't work.
        - Hanako is the elephant, but the elephant is not Hanako."
- 「$X \subset Y$」[[X⊂Y]]
    - X is a subset of Y
    - From thinking of X and Y implicitly as dots to thinking of them as sets
- It is also expressed as "is-a relationship..."
    - Is it not a bias as if X is [individual (in philosophy)
    - In general, X is not limited to individual objects.
        - For example, "An integer is a rational number.
        - *Every* integer is a rational-number.
        - The is-a relation, which assumes that X is an individual, does not fit when a set comes to X, so it is converted to an individual with Every.
        - Other conversions such as X is a *kind of* Y. are also seen.
