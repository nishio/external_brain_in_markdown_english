> Folklorist Kunio Yanagida is said to have abandoned the "mountain people" for the "ordinary people," but this is not so. Through "mountain people," he pursued throughout his life a "society to come" that would overcome the state and capital. This groundbreaking essay approaches the heart of this possibility, centering on the concept of "[[mobility]].

from  [[Introduction to Exchange Styles]]
> In the stage when humans were hunter-gatherer nomads, there was no A as well as B and C. There, we can see that the products were distributed equally. Being nomadic, they cannot accumulate... The playful band did not grow larger or smaller than the size necessary for hunting. There were no restraints binding the members of the group. When they met other groups, they would have made simple exchanges, but there was no war. I name this state of affairs as [[protomobility U]].

### Summary of notes
.
The book "Yūdōron" by Gyōto Karatani offers a new perspective on the research of folklorist Kunio Yanagida. It is generally believed that Yanagida abandoned his study of "mountain people" and went on a quest for "folklore" focusing on "ordinary people. However, this book shows that Yanagida consistently explored the possibility of social transformation that overcomes the state and capital, while changing the subject matter, such as "mountain people," "Issei folklore," and "indigenous beliefs. The book also discusses the idea of playfulness, and the playfulness that arose after settlement is said to extend the domination of the state and capital.

### Relation to Fragment
.
Fragments such as "[[Nomadic Human History]]," "[[nomadic philosophy]]," and "[[People on the move connect people who settle down.]]" are related to the migrancy and sedentariness discussed in the notes. . In particular, "Human History of Nomadism" provides a study of nomadic nomadism, while "Nomadic Philosophy" provides a perspective on nomadic thought and philosophy. In addition, "Migrating People Connecting Settled People" provides a perspective on the interplay between nomadism and sedentariness.

### deep thinking
Playfulness and sedentariness have a profound impact on the structure of society and human behavior. Mobility allows for a free and fluid life and exploration of new possibilities. Sedentariness, on the other hand, provides a stable life and maintains social order. However, they interact with each other to promote social evolution and change. The balance between playfulness and sedentariness is critical to the health and development of a society.
