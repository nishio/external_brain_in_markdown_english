- [[Jay Barney]] is well known for his [[resource-based view]]. see [[Bernie controversy]].

To put it very crudely, [[coaxialization]] is based on [[causal inference]], where the objective comes first and what can be done to achieve it, while effectuation, which is its opposite concept, is based on [[means first]].

If the [[predictability]] of the future is low, the success rate of [[calculating backwards]] from the objective in cohesion will be low, so it is better to do more and more of what can be done now.
This philosophy is highly compatible with the "resource-based view," which focuses on "what [[resources]] I have at the moment.

- "[[We]] create the future through our actions, not by predicting it."

Must increase the observation range when the correct destination is unknown
We cannot know in advance where the things to be observed are ([[Menno's paradox]]).
In such a case, take the action that provides the fastest way to move (most increase in observations per unit of time) using the resources you currently have.
