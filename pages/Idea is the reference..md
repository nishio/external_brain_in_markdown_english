I'm not referring specifically to any literature written by others, but it's a good idea to do this, sort of thing.
- Platonically speaking, we're looking at [[IDEA (in Platonic thought)]], so it's like, "Well, this is how it was in the Idea world, so this is how it should be in the real world.
    - In this case, you will have trouble with [References
- On the other hand, there are people who have a style of thinking pattern where they do what they do because someone else's writing says it's a good idea to do so.

The idea is that the correctness of the "I did it because I thought it would be good to do it this way" decision is verified by the performance of the actual operation.
- This is [[Legitimacy through performance]].
- Those on the side who seek a basis for correctness in the literature are working with a different orthodoxy.
        - [[amber tissue]] tinged.
