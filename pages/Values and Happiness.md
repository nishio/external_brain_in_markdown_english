title: "Values and Happiness"
---

- Would you be [[happier]] if you knew more about your [[values]]?
    - Values:
        - What do I value?
        - What do I want #Desire
        - What do you find [[interesting]]?
            - This definition includes the implicit process of looking for "interesting."
                - I personally want "interesting," but that pretty much correlates with "[[learning new skills]]."
                - There are many people in the world who don't want that.
- You may be surprised at what you value.
- You can't tell someone else what your values are #subjective
