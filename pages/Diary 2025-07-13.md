Movement of the mind to make life a stable pattern.
- morning routine
Movement of the mind to bring about a change in the pattern of life.
- travel

convenience store
- (Compared to hunting) Stable outpouring of goods
- New products are developed one after another and disappear.
    - Needs for "new" and "change
    - Eating-type "entertainment content"


> Many people only look at the ReadMe table of contents, which does not reflect welfare or digital democracy, so they think Team Mirai is not close to the vulnerable.
Ewww.
It's a tough job to get your message across to the masses, isn't it?

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1944294221084865004) Good story! In fact, I also learned a lot during the Tokyo gubernatorial election, and this time I am watching the effects of AI An's adoption of Dify, and I am learning that this is how to create products in the age of AI.

> [okmachioka](https://x.com/okmachioka/status/1944009800926605716) I tweeted critical & skeptical tweets about Team Mirai, but the responses I got back from supporters were moderate & long-winded, with no rude tone or allusion at all. I seriously envy this atmosphere.
> [shirock_](https://x.com/shirock_/status/1944200632535331018) These are the kind of values I'm talking about.

> [okmachioka](https://x.com/okmachioka/status/1944204251804446861) This was the concept of resolution over confrontation too!
>  However, it is also difficult to see how you seem to have a "stay out of ideologies that might fuel division" attitude.
- [[I won't mention ideologies that might incite division]].
    - I have to accept the criticism that there is a need to make a plan for improvement.
    - Personally, I think it's the introduction of [[Polis]].

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1944287961870479871) I can't say for sure, because all the indicators are showing exponential growth across the board, and since this is my first time running for office, I don't know the coefficient of "how much of the vote will come from which indicator". I can't say anything definite. I feel that the probability of becoming a political party is still fair at this point, and it is likely to grow considerably in the next week.
>  >[doctor_anan](https://x.com/doctor_anan/status/1944281572255182885) #TeamMirai I will support you and vote for you, but

>  And honestly, I was thinking...

>  Clear growth over the past week compared to the 0-1 proportional seat projection for the Path of Renewal.
>  Mr. Yasuno, can we count on you?  x.com/team_mirai_jp/...

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1944288318218473850) That's one of the reasons why I feel like they are challenging themselves with the goal of "whether or not they can get multiple seats" rather than "whether or not they can become a political party". It's called a stretch goal.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1944290137451770165) What I personally think is a good indicator is the "number of people who donated", which has been accelerating and growing exponentially since the date of the public announcement, which is a nice touch! I think it is a good indicator for individuals.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1944290380876574918) "Stretch" itself is a stretch.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1944008701599527044) By the way, Shuhei Kobayashi of the Chiba constituency merged his suggestions for modifications to this system after he came back from his speech yesterday, too.
>  >[yyy01ni](https://x.com/yyy01ni/status/1944008701599527044) Team Mirai has a back-up special.
>  We can already visualize the movement of money to the penny, and we are cutting into the politics and money issue.
>  We're offering it to other parties and some are starting to use it.
>  I'd like to make this the standard and take it to the point where it's rather suspicious if you don't do it.

> [kazuneiwasa](https://x.com/kazuneiwasa/status/1944056599603294494) Mr. Yasuno is often seen in the context of a "Tokyo University student," but to be honest, from my perspective as a student one year younger than him, he was "an amazing Tokyo University student.

> [kazuneiwasa](https://x.com/kazuneiwasa/status/1944063976528302535) It's amazing that they not only came up with the idea, but also implemented it, used it, and announced it.
> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1944056599603294494) I miss ANNOTE! At that time, websocket technology started to be implemented in browsers, so I thought "I can make an online sticky note tool with real-time synchronization! I thought "I can make an online sticky note tool with real-time synchronization!
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1944205643277287437) I think it's engineer-like to talk about the means and technology of "websocket" in these situations. I wish they would talk about the purpose and value of this system, such as "This system will enable us to generate ideas and discuss them over the Internet using sticky notes".
