A: [[linear time line]].
- We tend to assume implicitly that
- The clock ticks, objective time is this
B: Non-linear time
- [[Subjective time]]
    - What each individual experiences
    - Experiencing the same past over and over again.
- Discourses like "subjective time is not linear" are too abstract to convey.
- Think more concretely.
- For example, a Scrapbox page I wrote in the past surfaces for some reason, and I open it and read it.
    - At this time, from the page side perspective, a continuation of the past "when I wrote it" "when I closed the page" time
        - Note on change of perspective
            - Here, the subject and the object, "I" and "the page I wrote," are switched, and I am seen as the object from the viewpoint of the page as the subject.
                - [[Inseparability of act and actor]] / [[subject-object exchange]]
            - The time line is continuing from the page perspective, and I as the object am changing my internal state with a few new experiences.
- This page itself is it.
    - I happened to look at "[[The Concept of Time in Gendlin's Introduction to Philosophy]]" again on 2024-08-30.
    - This was shared with [[blu3mo]] on 2023-10-12
        - I myself was interested in [[Eugene Gendlin.]] as a philosopher who practiced verbalization, and when I was reading it, the subject of time happened to come up.
        - I wasn't really interested in time myself, but I thought blu3mo was interested in non-linear time - so I cut out the relevant part.
    - This "I just happened to see it" is B1.
    - At this time, I am a different person from the one who finished writing the last time and the one who read this time.
        - So there is a difference there (B2)
    - From these differences, new ones emerge (B3).
            - [[dialectics]] like, but not in such a strong sense.
                - [[Notice the differences in similarities.]]
                - See two people with slightly different subject matter, the pages.
            - A new [[Aspects of Experience]] is formed when two related but different things meet.
        - Last time I only introduced the concept of time in the Introduction to Gendlinian Philosophy
        - I didn't have much thought about time myself, so I ended up halfway through.
        - This is a situation where "[[there is]] a hole to be filled.
        - Like [[holes]] in semiconductors
                - [[electrons and holes]]
    - Moving on from this created state (B4)
        - I've been describing this from the perspective of the subject that is now the page, so I feel like the two zingers are not connected to my immediate past.
        - The human side is connected from the perspective of the subject.

I'm the one writing it out, doing half the thinking outside of my brain, so the thought process is half observable.
- For those who haven't written it down, "I suddenly remembered something from the past," etc. [[the intersection of past and present]].

- [[Past self]] and [[joint warning]]
