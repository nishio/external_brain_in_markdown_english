Brain science research on curiosity and knowledge assembly will be extensively investigated in terms of neural mechanisms, effects on learning and memory, brain regions involved in knowledge integration, and their relevance to education and creativity.

Recent Trends in Brain Science Research on Curiosity and Knowledge Integration

1. neural mechanism of curiosity (expression process in the brain)
- Curiosity is thought to arise from the coordination of the brain's reward and cognitive control systems.
    - First, when faced with unknown information or questions, [[prediction errors]] or [[information gaps]] occur in the brain, which are detected by the [[amygdala]] and [[cingulate cortex]] (ACC).
    - Signals from the ACC activate the [[prefrontal cortex]] (especially the [[lateral prefrontal cortex]]), which asks the situation, "Can we figure this out?" and evaluate ([[apraxal]](?)) and evaluate ([[aprazal]](?)) the situation.
    - When this evaluation is positive and "can be clarified," the prefrontal cortex drives the [[dopamine nerves]] ([[ventral tegmental area]][[VTA]] and [[substantia nigra]][[SN]]) in the [[midbrain]] to release dopamine. This series of processes allows the brain to enter a motivational state (curiosity) of "I want to know! This process puts the brain into a motivational state of "I want to know!
- The dopamine reward system, activated by curiosity, is a circuit involved in pleasure and motivation.
    - According to fMRI studies, activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA)/substantia nigra (SN) and [[ventral striatum]] ([[nucleus accumbens]]) is markedly elevated during intense feelings of curiosity.
    - On the other hand, activity in these reward-related areas declines when boredom or low interest is present.
    - This suggests that curiosity excites the brain through endogenous reward circuits.
    - Furthermore, it has been reported that activity in the [[hippocampus]] increases in parallel with activity in the reward system, especially when curiosity is heightened, and that activity in the hippocampus is amplified even before an answer is given.
    - This heightened hippocampal activity is deeply involved in the memory of that information, as discussed below, but it is also thought to be involved in [[the detection of novelty]].
    - In fact, some theoretical models suggest that when the hippocampus detects a novel stimulus, it transmits this information to the VTA, which then releases dopamine back into the hippocampus ([[hippocampal-VTA loop]]).
    - This loop allows the brain to prepare its learning system for new information and prepare to take in knowledge more efficiently.
- As described above, behind the generation of curiosity is the interaction of the dopaminergic reward system (VTA/SN - nucleus accumbens), memory-related areas (hippocampus), and cognitive control areas (prefrontal cortex, ACC, etc.).
    - In summary, when we feel a strong curiosity about something, a series of neural processes proceed in the brain: detection of prediction errors → evaluation in the prefrontal cortex → activation of the dopaminergic reward system → preparation of the memory system. This process is what gives rise to our desire to "know!

2. the influence of curiosity on learning and memory
- Curiosity acts as a facilitator of learning and memory.
    - It is known empirically that we remember things better the more we are interested in learning them, and recent research provides a neural basis for this.
    - The experiment used a task in which subjects were presented with miscellaneous quiz questions and asked to rate their level of curiosity about each question before learning the answer.
        - [Neuroscience: The Power of Curiosity to Inspire Learning – NIH Director's Blog](https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2014/12/23/neuroscience-the-power-of-curiosity-to-inspire-learning/)
    - The results show that the answers to the curious questions significantly increased memory performance compared to those that did not, and that this effect persisted not only immediately after learning, but also on long-term memory tests on the following day and beyond.
    - Interestingly, it has been reported that in a state of heightened curiosity, even incidental information unrelated to the answer is more likely to be remembered.
    - For example, they were more likely to recall other stimuli (such as a picture of a face) that were presented while they were waiting for an answer with strong curiosity than when they were less curious.
    - This suggests that the arousal state of the brain caused by curiosity has the effect of strengthening not only the focal information but also the entire episodic memory of the surrounding information.
- Brain imaging studies have also revealed such neural mechanisms of memory promotion.
    - Although the aforementioned dopamine reward system (midbrain and striatum) and hippocampus were more active when curiosity was high, the functional coupling between the midbrain (SN/VTA) and hippocampus during curiosity arousal was stronger, especially in those with greater learning effects due to curiosity.
    - In other words, curiosity motivates dopamine to help the hippocampus form memories, which in turn improves memory performance.
    - In fact, there are multiple reports that memories are more likely to be retained when the "curiosity→dopamine→hippocampus" pathway is strongly activated.
    - This effect has been observed across age groups, suggesting that curiosity boosts memory not only in young adults, but also in the elderly and children.
        - [[年をとっても好奇心を持ち続けるといい]]のか<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- It has also been shown that the learning effects of curiosity have different characteristics from those of learning promotion by extrinsic rewards (money, awards, etc.).
    - One study compared the effects of monetary rewards and intrinsic curiosity on memory performance, respectively.
    - The results showed that both improved memory, but in different ways.
    - Curiosity enhanced memory by activating both the brain's reward circuitry and the [[frontoparietal]] [[attentional network]] and by improving [[attentional resources]], whereas monetary rewards enhanced memory primarily by suppressing task irrelevant processing such as the [[default mode network]].
    - In other words, the facilitation of learning by curiosity is due to "voluntary attention and excitement," which is thought to be a different neural mechanism at work than external rewards.
    - In general, curiosity is a powerful inner drive for memory retention and consolidation into long-term memory, and the importance of eliciting this in the teaching and learning environment is supported by neuroscience.

3. brain regions involved in knowledge integration and structuring
- People associate new knowledge with existing knowledge, systematize it, and store it in memory.
    - This process of knowledge integration and structuring involves an extensive network of the brain.
    - The network called [[default mode network]] ([[DMN]]) plays a central role.
        - In conjunction with the previous discussion, this is because when studying with external rewards, thoughts that are not related to the task (= default mode network) are suppressed,[[好奇心ドリブンで勉強している時の方が知識の統合が捗る]]のではないか<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - The DMN is a large network consisting of the [[medial prefrontal cortex]] ([[mPFC]]), [[posterior cingulate cortex]]/[[precuneus]], and [[parietal lobe]] ([[angular gyrus]], etc.) and is known to be easily activated during [[internal thinking]] and [[self-related recall]].
    - Once thought of as a quiescent system that is active when nothing is being done, in recent years it is understood to be rather a network that actively integrates information and makes sense of it.
    - For example, when we listen to a story or watch a movie, the DMN integrates information about ongoing events with our past memories and knowledge to deepen our understanding of the situation.
    - In other words, it is proposed that the role of the DMN is to build a meaningful framework (context) by linking new information obtained from outside (external information) with existing knowledge and context in the mind (internal information).
        - 「 [[knowledge consistency]] 」で本で読んだ情報が自分の経験や他の本と繋がることについて書いた<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - The device that causes this is the [[default mode network]].
    - This ability allows us to incorporate information into our memory as a "story" or "body of knowledge" that is more than just a list of facts.
- Key areas of the default mode network (DMN), including the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, and parietal lobe (angular gyrus), are activated during reflection and memory recall and function as a "[[signifying network]]" that integrates new information and existing knowledge.
- Within the DMN, the [[medial prefrontal cortex]] ([[mPFC]]) is particularly important for knowledge integration.
    - The mPFC is strongly connected to the [[schema]] (framework of existing knowledge) stored in long-term memory, and it closely exchanges information with the hippocampus when learning new information.
    - For example, a person who is familiar with a certain field can easily understand related new knowledge, and this is thought to be because the existing schema serves as a receptacle for new information and the mPFC can efficiently integrate new information from the hippocampus.
    - On the other hand, when learning information from a completely unfamiliar field (in the absence of a schema), the hippocampus-medial prefrontal cortex linkage becomes even more important.
    - Studies have observed enhanced hippocampal and ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) coupling in situations where existing schemas are inadequate, suggesting that additional hippocampal-prefrontal crosstalk is required to integrate novel information.
    - This means that the more difficult the information without a schema, the more the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex cooperate in a compensatory mechanism to incorporate the new information into the existing knowledge network.
- In addition, parietal regions (such as the inferior parietal lobule and angular gyrus) also serve as hubs for knowledge integration.
    - The [[angular gyrus]] is activated by recall of [[episodic memory]] and [[semantic memory]] and is thought to be a site of integration that combines information from multiple [[modalities]].
        - [[マルチモダリティ]] / [[マルチモーダル]] <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - For example, one experiment showed that the left angular gyrus and medial prefrontal cortex were activated during a memory recall task with a reward and responded additively to both accurate recall and reward.
        - [Frontiers | Reward, motivation and brain imaging in human healthy participants – A narrative review](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/behavioral-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2023.1123733/full)
    - Thus, key nodes in the DMN, such as the angular gyrus and mPFC, integrate and process multiple sources of information, including memory details and value assessments.
    - The [[higher association cortex]], including the frontal and temporal poles, is also known to monitor one's knowledge state ([[metacognition]]) and to abstract concepts, and is thought to contribute to the structuring of knowledge as part of the DMN.
- In short, the default mode network, centered in the medial prefrontal cortex, is essential for the integration and structuring of knowledge, and its interaction with the hippocampus forms the link between new and old information.
    - This network allows us to place one-off facts into a larger context and to systematically understand and remember them.

4. the relationship between curiosity and education/creativity
- Brain science findings on curiosity have implications for improving learning effectiveness and fostering creativity in educational settings.
    - In the educational context, teaching methods that stimulate students' curiosity have been found to improve their motivation to learn and their performance.
    - For example, one study reported that "intellectual curiosity" is an important factor in academic performance and predicts performance as much as intelligence.
    - When a teacher elicits students' interest by asking questions or conducting experiments, the reward system is activated in the brain, which increases intrinsic motivation to learn, and the brain becomes more receptive to learning.
    - In fact, research at the University of California, Davis, has shown that the brain is more receptive to new knowledge when curiosity is heightened and that pleasant emotions (pleasure in learning) accompany learning.
    - Such neurochemical changes (e.g., increased dopamine release) may lead to deeper understanding and long-term memory retention than conventional, forced learning.
    - For example, one middle school teacher reported that when he showed a video of a sunset and asked, "What is moving?" the students began to ask questions one after another, stimulating discussion.
    - These inquiry-inducing learning activities put the brain in an active learning mode rather than simply transferring knowledge, resulting in deeper learning.
    - Educational approaches such as "question-based learning," "discovery learning," and "project-based learning" ("PBL") are effective in stimulating students' curiosity and awareness of problems. This triggers the reward system in the student's brain, and learning itself can become a rewarding experience.
- In relation to creativity, curiosity is associated with [[creative thinking]] in terms of [[the quest for novelty]].
    - Psychologically, it has long been said that "highly creative people are curious," and brain science is beginning to support the connection between the two.
    - A recent review proposed that "[[curiosity and creativity]] arise from a common mechanism of novel exploration," and summarized that the two are similarly affected in many cognitive functions, including cognitive control, attention, and reward.
    - Of particular interest is the fact that brain regions commonly involved in both curiosity and creativity have been identified to some extent. For example, the default mode network (DMN) is important for creative thinking (e.g., [[free association]] and [[mental simulation]]), but it has also been suggested that the DMN is activated during introspective information seeking due to curiosity.
    - In research on creativity, it is known that the DMN operates during the conception phase and the [[executive control network]] during the evaluation phase, and it has been reported that people with high creativity have a higher ability to switch these networks flexibly.
        - If you're just thinking of ideas but not executing them, you don't have an execution control network working.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - [[Amateur ideas appear original in presentation but are not feasible.]]
    - This suggests that cognitive flexibility to switch back and forth between conscious focus and internal associative states is important for creative thinking, and that the more curious a person is, the smoother this switch may be.
    - Individual difference studies of creativity also report that individuals with personality traits of curiosity and imagination (such as "[[openness]]" in the [[Big Five (e.g., car makers, TV companies, etc.)]]) have stronger functional connectivity within the DMN.
    - This implies a well-developed [[network of internal thoughts]], and suggests that rich introspection and fantasy may contribute to the generation of novel ideas.
- Furthermore, curiosity can be a source of motivation for creative problem solving.
    - When faced with a difficult problem, the curiosity to "try to solve it" can motivate persistent trial and error, resulting in the discovery of a new solution.
        - There is that pathway, but there is also the "Is this a hard problem? Can't we solve it this way?" and then curiosity arises to see if the hypothesis is really true and if it is really possible to solve the problem in that way, and then the person tries it out.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - In the brain, dopamine is released from the reward system at this time to maintain motivation for ideas, and at the same time, the prefrontal cortex controls exploratory behavior to enable flexible thinking.
    - In fact, the "curiosity→creativity" link is supported by neuroscience, which suggests that the two are rooted in a common brain substrate (e.g., DMN and reward system). If future research unravels the detailed mechanisms, it is possible that training to increase curiosity could be used to develop creativity.
- Overall, brain science findings on curiosity support the importance of independent and deep learning in education and the value of curiosity as a psychological soil that promotes creative idea generation.
    - Curiosity enhances learning and memory through the brain's reward circuitry, and also serves as a bridge to organically integrate knowledge through the default mode network, leading to new ideas.
    - Based on this understanding, it will become increasingly important to create a questioning and learning environment that stimulates curiosity in educational settings, and to focus on curiosity as intrinsic motivation in creativity research.
