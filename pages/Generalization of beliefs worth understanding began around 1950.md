<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Isn't there a very limited period in human history when we came to think of "[[understanding]]" as a good thing?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>Although there was a trend to value "understanding" and "insight" in ancient Greece and in traditional thought such as Buddhism and Confucianism, it was not until the modern era that society as a whole began to greatly institutionalize and promote them as "good things. After the Scientific Revolution and the Age of Enlightenment, rationality and objective knowledge came to be highly valued in society, and the pursuit of "understanding" itself came to have great value.
On the other hand, there was a period in ancient and medieval times when religious and traditional authority was emphasized and individual free inquiry and "understanding" were not given that much social status. Therefore, if we look at human history as a whole, we may indeed say that the period during which "understanding" came to be given great value was relatively short.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Please explain, with reasons, when the belief that "understanding is valuable to all members of society" became a shared belief by a majority of society's members.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>As a rough guess, it seems reasonable to assume that most (the majority) of society on a global scale came to believe that understanding is valuable for everyone during the post-World War II period of the spread of the education system, which was around 1950.

### Reason Summary:
]
1.### Improve literacy and expand primary education
.
- From the end of the 19th century to the first half of the 20th century, compulsory education was institutionalized mainly in Western countries, and the number of people who could receive basic education increased rapidly. Especially after World War II, many countries improved their education systems, and as the [[literacy rate]] increased, the importance of "learning" and "understanding" became more easily recognized at the individual level.

2.### Establishment of International Organizations and Dissemination of Ideas
.
- In 1945, [[UNESCO]] (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) was established, spreading the idea that "access to education = a right for all" on a global scale. This global movement facilitated the spread of the idea that "knowledge and understanding are valuable to all.

3.### development of mass society and information media
.
- The postwar era saw the explosive spread of [[mass media]] such as radio and television, creating an environment in which people could access a wide variety of information through educational and enlightening programs and news. The distribution of such information contributed to people's strong awareness of the need to "understand and judge for themselves.

Taken together, it can be considered that after World War II, from around 1950 to the 1960s, the foundation for the majority of the world's population to share the "value of understanding" began to be put in place. Of course, there were large regional differences and the expansion was gradual, but this period can be considered a turning point.

'Isn't it only a few hundred years?' I thought it was, but according to the o1's view, it hadn't been a hundred years yet.
- The epoch in my brain was [[Diderot's "Encyclopedie universelle des arts et sciences"]].
    - France [[the philosophy of the European Enlightenment]].
    - "[[Enlighten those who are]] self-educated only for their own sake."
