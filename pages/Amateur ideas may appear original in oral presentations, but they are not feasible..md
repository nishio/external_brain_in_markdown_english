title: "Amateur ideas may appear original in oral presentations, but they are not feasible."

The paper compares [[amateur]], who has never used Mindstorms, and the winner and runner-up of the robot contest ([[professional]]) in the task "Create a robot that makes creative progress with [[Lego Mindstorms]].

- The presentation was evaluated for [[creativity]] by a large number of college students who presented pictures and descriptions of their ideas, and there was no difference in originality between the experts and amateurs.
- However, most amateurs could not realize the idea.　#unfeasible
- Amateurs who were able to realize their ideas rated lowest in originality. #Ideas realized

constraints
- During the ideation phase, Genji paid attention to the number of components and other constraints.
- In a previous study by Finke et al. "imposing constraints on the parts, categories, and functions of the output increases the rate at which creative works are produced.
- Gen. had put this to good use.

Change of plan
- There was no significant difference in the number of plan changes based on failure, but the number of plan changes not based on failure was significantly higher for Gen.
- When there was a failure in a part, mechanism, or algorithm factor, there was no significant difference in the number of times the same factor was corrected, but significantly more Gen Xers corrected the different factors.

Personal Opinion: I think that Genin has an execution model in his brain, which allows him to conduct "experiments in the brain" that cannot be observed from the outside.
I would like to know what exactly was the "non-failure based plan change."
What appears to the observer in this experiment as "working well, i.e., the plan was changed even though it was not a failure" is actually a phenomenon of "a difference between the execution results in the brain model and the reality," and the plan is modified based on the difference between the execution results in the brain.

- [[An idea that cannot be implemented is not a great idea.]]
    - [[Ideas that are not feasible are worthless.]]
    - [[The value of ideas from those who do not test their feasibility is low.]]
