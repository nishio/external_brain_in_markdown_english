title: "feasibility frontier"
---

- Metaphor for [[production possibility frontier]], doesn't seem to be a very major expression?
- The production possibility frontier is "a situation where [[trade-offs]] occur in what can be made due to limited materials.
- The feasibility frontier "has tradeoffs in what can be made due to [[technology limitations]]."

In English, it is called [[Technological Frontier]], but this is tainted with the meaning of "amazing technology" in English as well as Japanese.
- [[Technology Frontier]]

[[Frontier]]
- [[Front]]

- [[technical limitations]]
    - [[budget constraint]]
