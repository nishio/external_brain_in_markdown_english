People who stay in unproductive discussions.

Some people stay in unproductive discussions.
- What is not productive from my point of view is not productive when measured on my value axis.
- Different people have different values and therefore different ideas of what is productive.
- Example: The
    - A place where people who don't understand the premise join one after another.
        - Not talking about it, BAD.
        - You can act as if you are "someone who knows better", GOOD
    - A place where speech is detached from the speaker.
        - GOOD because attacks on individuals do not occur.
        - Attention to yourself, which should be paid to you, is lost and BAD
- What you want to get from the place is different.
