> 6 Varieties of Digital Democracy
>  1. direct voting type
>  2. artificial intelligence + public deliberation type (Higashi 2011)
>  3. mini-human type (Suzuki 2013)
>  4. artificial intelligence + cat type (Narita 2022)
>  5. artificial intelligence + private literature type (East 2023)
>  6. plurality type (yasuno2024)
