title: "Coined terms are also legitimized after the fact."

- The [[coined word]] is also [[canonized (in a textual sense)]] to [[posterior]].
Isn't that [[institutionalized language]]?

You can always coin a new word if you think an existing word doesn't match what you want to express.
That's the [[folk]] of the existing system.
It is legitimized after the fact by the number of people who like to use it.
Conversely, if no one likes it, it's the same as [[unpopular fork]] in [[subjectivism]].

Something a little more straightforward.
    - [[Coined words are not intellectual production.]]
Found something related.
    - [[I've accumulated more than anyone else.]]
    - > Not necessarily new to the cut, but recognized after the fact by having accumulated more than anyone else based on that cut.
