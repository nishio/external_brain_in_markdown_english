review
> Self-reliant conviviality ([[conviviality]]) is defined as "individual freedom realized in human interdependence and as such constitutes an inherent ethical value" (Ivan Ilyich (1973), Tools for Conviviality, Kyoji Watanabe and Risa Watanabe ( (2015) Chikuma Gakugei Bunko p.40, this book p.18)
