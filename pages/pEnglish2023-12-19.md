confluence of titles issue
![image](https://gyazo.com/5dfe094549bec60374347ee41873d358/thumb/1000)
- The problem is that pages is a list in Scrapbox export JSON.
    - Not aware of same title clashes.
    - So, once there, set it to `{title: page}`.
        - Current implementation
            - If there is a "ja" icon, skip it without translation.
            - If it has an "en" icon, it is overwritten.
        - That would translate "stuff that doesn't need to be translated" that works but disappears when it's overwritten.
        - Correct?
            - First, separate pages with and without icons.
            - For pages that do not have either icon
                - If the title is in Japanese, I'll just translate the title.
                    - If the result matches the existing page title, then we have a confluence problem.
                - If the title is in English, it is not converted in the translation and matches itself, but this is not a problem

I'll experimentally generate just the link structure.

- Oh, it's buggy, start over

    - Mostly done.
    - Why is there no pRegroup or anything like that?
        - The page itself is there.
        - Uh, okay.
            - I have mapping data translated into English for Japanese link titles.
            - I'm inserting as a link what appeared in this mapping.
            - therefore
            - Links to pages with alphabetical-only titles, such as pRegroup, are not being generated.
    - Since there is a possibility that the English link may be broken during translation, should the English link also be subject to completion?


Title confluence patterns
- `Sapir-Whorf hypothesis` and `Sapir-Whorf's hypothesis`.
    - Both become the `Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis`.
- This one too.
    - "Barren Debate": "Barren Debate",.
    - "Barren Debate": "Barren Debate",.
- A case of GPT3.5 equating the concepts I'm distinguishing.
    - "False dichotomy": "False dichotomy",.
    - "False dichotomy": "False dichotomy",.
    - "False dichotomy": "False dichotomy", "False dichotomy".
    - Only the one that really refers to False dichotomy is wrong for some reason.
        - "Incorrect Bisection Method": "Incorrect Bisection Method", "Incorrect Bisection Method".
    - Such âœ…
        - "False binary choice": "False binary choice", "False binary choice".
        - "False binary opposition": "False binary opposition", "False binary opposition".
        - "False True/False dichotomy": "False True/False dichotomy", "False True/False dichotomy".
        - "False dichotomy": "False dichotomy",.

It's looking much better.
- Maybe they don't match, because there is a confluence of concepts depending on the translation.
