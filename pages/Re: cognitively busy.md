> In cognitively busy situations, the ability to control oneself is weakened. And it makes it easier to engage in `habitual` behavior.
>  Perhaps we expect it is due to [[Cognitive busyness]] and not to the amount of knowledge.
>  First, it perceives the world in an extremely simplistic way. Second, it perceives the world based on the ideal of "I wish it were so" (≈without regard to substance). This would be a thorough suppression of [[MP]] consumption.
>  I think that [[zero-risk faith]] and the tendency to excessively seek [[being upright and cleanhanded]] have similar roots.

    - [[Saving Thought]]
    - Link to 2 other pages where this keyword appears
- Unlink "habit" and link "cognitive busyness," "cleanliness," "justice," and "simplicity."
