- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/57577/icon' alt='57577.icon' height="19.5"/> [[A layman trying to follow a formula would cut down on particles and chop them up.]]
    - It's too obvious and funny.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/57577/icon' alt='57577.icon' height="19.5"/>For now, let's just enjoy the frame as a puzzle without removing the particles from the future.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/57577/icon' alt='57577.icon' height="19.5"/>Word order swapping puzzles occur because the fixed form is fulfilled without removing particles.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/57577/icon' alt='57577.icon' height="19.5"/>You have to have the vocabulary to fit it in well without garbage like "for now."
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/57577/icon' alt='57577.icon' height="19.5"/>You wrote that I should make it a daily habit, but honestly, I'm [[Not good at continuity]].
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/57577/icon' alt='57577.icon' height="19.5"/>I wonder if the fine tuning of GPT-3 will help.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/57577/icon' alt='57577.icon' height="19.5"/>Make a fantasy of making GPT-3 a fine-tuning corpus.

        - WW is too free.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/57577/icon' alt='57577.icon' height="19.5"/>I tried to put "compose a tanka poem" into AI and was scolded to "write it yourself.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I feel like I'm just describing the facts.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/57577/icon' alt='57577.icon' height="19.5"/>From the beginning to the end, everyone sees the poetic form of tanka poetry at the same time.
    - I see what you mean.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/57577/icon' alt='57577.icon' height="19.5"/>Select and design the text type of the string because it will be seen at a moment's notice
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/57577/icon' alt='57577.icon' height="19.5"/>The sense of choosing "sticky sticky Hikaru" instead of the familiar "sparkling sparkling Hikaru"!
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/57577/icon' alt='57577.icon' height="19.5"/>Does your work improve with socializing? Watch the blank sheet of paper rather than the faces of others.
    - Would you like me to cut this "person" head off?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/57577/icon' alt='57577.icon' height="19.5"/>The work doesn't get better with a relationship. You'd rather look at a blank piece of paper than at someone's face.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/57577/icon' alt='57577.icon' height="19.5"/>First we build a strong individual, then we will go together into the unknown.
    - I wonder if it is better to say "Let's go together into the unknown 7" or "Let's go together into the unknown 7" in order to keep the pattern.
    - In layman's terms, the latter seems to sit better.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Ah, well, it's better to solve this with an expanded perspective instead of trying to work this out with a tweak of a particle.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/57577/icon' alt='57577.icon' height="19.5"/> [[First we will build a strong individual, and then we will climb a mountain together that has yet to be seen.]]
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/57577/icon' alt='57577.icon' height="19.5"/> [[Most of the people who give me shit are the ones who aren't doing a good job of making their own.]]
    - Programming is the same in this area.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/57577/icon' alt='57577.icon' height="19.5"/>Apparently, if you have a million yen, you can publish a book of poems, and the first book of poems was published at your own expense.
