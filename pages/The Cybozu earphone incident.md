What is the Cybozu "earphone incident"?
- Summary: During a training session for new employees, a new employee was working while listening to music on his earphones. When a senior employee warned the newcomer, the newcomer asked, "Why not?" which led to an open discussion throughout the company. In the end, they concluded that it was OK as long as the output was in line with the vision, an episode symbolic of the shift in the company culture. ([Cybozu-style](https://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m005960.html))
- What happened (flow)
    1. a senior employee cautions against the use of earphones during training for new employees.
    2. newcomers question why, and one-on-one discussions expand to company-wide discussions.
    3. the principle of judging by team results and vision compatibility is confirmed, and the operation is moved to a non-uniform ban. ([Cybozu-style](https://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m005960.html))
- In-house name/context: internally referred to as the "Earphone Incident" (also "Earphone Incident" notation). As an offshoot of the discussion, there is an introduction that was triggered by a post to an internal tool (KINTONE). ([log me](https://logmi.jp/brandtopics/320484?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Time frame: recalled as an internal discussion around 2017 on internal blogs, etc., and repeatedly referred to in external communications since then. ([NOTE (NOTE)](https://note.com/akyska/n/n37da41e51663?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- External introduction: Cybozu's official media and event materials featured the case study as an example of [[psychological safety]] and penetration of the Code of Conduct. There is also mention and mention of an article on the subject of the "earphone incident" in the Nikkei Shimbun. ([Cybozu-shiki](https://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m005960.html), [page.cybozu.co.jp [https://page.cybozu.co.jp/-/cyculture-reports/](https://page.cybozu.co.jp/-/cyculture-reports/) activities/11537?utm_source=chatgpt.com], [X](https://twitter.com/meg_h_2018/status/1080297848124563457?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

What can be learned (practical points)
- [[Principles rather than rules]]: Judging by "[[results in line with vision]]" rather than by external rules ([[fitness for purpose]]). ([Cybozu method](https://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m005960.html))
- Psychological safety: A culture renewal is facilitated by a climate in which questioning of reasons and company-wide discussions are tolerated beyond hierarchical relationships. ([Cybozu-style](https://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m005960.html))
- Transparency: [[open discussion]] on internal bulletin board converts individual discomfort into [[organizational learning]]. ([log me](https://logmi.jp/brandtopics/320484?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Bridging the generation/values gap: reused internally and externally as a symbolic case study to encourage [[updating stereotypes]]. ([Cybozu-style](https://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m005960.html))

Common Misconceptions
- It is not a "total ban/total ban on earphones": the conclusion is situation-dependent (output standard). If there are safety/business requirements, they will naturally be adjusted. ([Cybozu style](https://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m005960.html))
