title: "Relieve self-denial"

> [ktowhata](https://twitter.com/ktowhata/status/1710439358107734063) I've been reading various books on "[[self-assurance]]" and basically it introduces a device to [[affirm oneself]]. I have been reading a lot of books on "[[self-assurance]]". However, since self-assurance becomes a problem when [[attacks on oneself]] intensify, it seems to me that what is really important is not to strengthen self-assurance, but to [*[[soften]] [*[[self-denial]]].

> [ktowhata](https://twitter.com/ktowhata/status/1710439359508619285) The voice of self-denial is hard to refute because the logic is simple and robust. So it is the voices of others that are helpful. The fact that others are surprisingly [[indifferent]] and not harsh reduces the concentration of self-denial like water in a chaser. In this sense, the self-affirming book's self-help devices need to be supplemented with devices that are good for others to do for you.
