    - Storing thoughts slowly and then stirring them up, rather than reacting on reflex.
        - Reflexive statements and specifications will produce a bad product.
- This is why we need to communicate with an AI with a slow response time of one piece per day instead of a fast response time!

### Digest of research notes
.

Fragmentation and multifaceted association of information creates new meaning. This is accomplished by creating new connections to symbols that are not normally connected. It is also possible to export some data from groupware to which the AI does not have full access.

Nishio's notes reveal a discussion of information fragmentation and multifaceted associations. In particular, the idea that a "big blurry lump" can be broken down by adding new labels, and that more information can be isolated by adding more information, is closely related to my research.

A deeper understanding of the process of how information fragmentation and multifaceted associations create new meanings is needed. Nishio's notebooks have provided new perspectives on the process of information fragmentation and multidimensional association, but how these can be integrated and incorporated into concrete methods and tools remains to be seen. The question remains as to how to integrate them and incorporate them into concrete methods and tools.

### Insights from fragments
.

The "[[Atomic and Personal]]" fragments illustrate the idea that each individual intellectual production is one complete intellectual production with relationships to other intellectual productions. This is relevant to my research and requires a deeper look at how fragmentation and multifaceted associations of information affect individual intellectual production.

The fragment "[[ScrapboxSQUARE#2]]" also describes specific methods and know-how for intellectual production using Scrapbox. This is a useful reference when considering the specific shape and function of the "AI Dejima".

### Considerations and questions

A deeper understanding of the process of how information fragmentation and multifaceted associations create new meaning is needed. Nishio's notebooks have provided new perspectives on the process of information fragmentation and multilateral association, but how to integrate them into concrete methods and tools remains a challenge for the future. The question remains as to how to integrate them and incorporate them into concrete methods and tools.
