title: "Intellectual Production Techniques for Engineers Mechanical Keyword Extraction Experiments"
---

I created a program to extract keywords in a book from the data of a whole book, and I experimented with my own book.
If I feel that placing this on Scrapbox is detrimental to my network of knowledge, I will turn it off.
While it is fun to see the related page display at the bottom of this page, this page could become a strong hub and create a large number of 2hop links.

100 in order of highest score.
