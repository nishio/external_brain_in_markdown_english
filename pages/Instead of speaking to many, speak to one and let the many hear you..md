title: "Instead of speaking to many, speak to one and let the many hear you."
---

I looked up [[writing in an easy-to-understand style]] and found a classic that said something like "[[Don't try to speak for many.]] Speak to one person and make sure that many people hear you.

- (Nishio's translation) A good person [[speaks to one person]], even if there are many people. And other people naturally listen to them.

If a good person comes out from among many people and tells a story as if he sees it, all will laugh at him and laugh at him as well.

modern translation
> If you are a person of character, even if you are speaking to one person in a crowd, even the people around you will listen. Those who are not a person of character, with their guts on display, will interrupt and make up a story as if they had just seen it. It is noisy and annoying when everyone is laughing along with them.
