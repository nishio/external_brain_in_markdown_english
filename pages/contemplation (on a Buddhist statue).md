1. the concepts of [[self]] ([[atman]], [[the ego]]) and [selflessness
2. the relationship between the five skandhas and the Self
3. understanding [[the true nature of the various laws]] (the true nature of things)
4. the concept of "emptiness" and the "Middle Way" philosophy
5. the use of [[upāya]] in Buddhist teachings

Main Issues:
1. analyze the relationship between the Self and the five skandhas, [[denying the reality of the Self]].
- (2) By destroying [[attachment]] between myself and [[my place]] (the object I own), I attain [[the wisdom of no-self]].
3. explained that the reality of the various laws transcends language and thought and is like [[Nirvana]], without birth or death
4. the Buddha teaches self or no-self according to the sentient being's level of understanding, but ultimately there is neither self nor no-self
        - [[teaching Buddhism through the use of dialogue]] だね<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
5. by understanding the reality of various laws, we can walk the [[middle way]] without falling into [[discernment]] or [[common sense]].

In conclusion, by understanding the reality of the various Dharma realities, and by destroying vexations and nonsense, one can attain true liberation (nirvana).
