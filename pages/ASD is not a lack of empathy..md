title: "ASD is not a lack of empathy."
---

> The participants with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) were asked to read sentences describing a person with ASD behavior patterns and sentences describing a person with general behavior patterns without ASD, and to judge whether the sentences applied to them or were similar to them. Brain activity was measured using fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) when the participants were asked to read sentences describing people with ASD and sentences describing people with general patterns of behavior that are not ASD. As a result, we found that brain regions associated with [[empathy]] and [[self-consciousness]] were activated in people with ASD when they judged a person with ASD characteristics.
> It has long been thought that people with ASD are less empathetic, but this study shows that people with ASD can often empathize with others who engage in ASD behavior patterns.

Scientific evidence has emerged for what I had naturally assumed would be the case as a skin sensation.
