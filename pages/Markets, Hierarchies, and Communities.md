The market (as a concept), the level, and the community" = the three basic principles of "how to coordinate work" in society. Just to the point.

1) Price / Market
- How it works: Decentralized decision making with price signals. Transactions are made on a contract basis.
- Strengths: Fast resource allocation / Induces ingenuity / Easy exit and entry.
- Weaknesses: underprovision of externalities (environment and safety) and public goods / asymmetric information.
- Examples: B2B ordering, cloud pay-as-you-go, ad bidding.
- Suitable conditions: results can be clearly measured, standardized, and competitive.
- Indicators to look at: price elasticity, margin, bid/contract ratio.

2) Hierarchy / Firm & Bureaucracy
- Mechanism: Coordinated by orders and plans within the organization. Long-term investment and bundling of resources.
- Strengths: Large-scale coordination, quality control, and clear responsibilities.
- Weaknesses: bureaucratization, information lag, stagnation of innovation.
- Examples: supply chain management for a company, business operations for a government agency.
- Suitable conditions: high interdependence, confidentiality, long-term and large-scale projects.
- Indicators to watch: lead time, quality defect rate, organizational MTTR, fixed cost ratio.

3) Communities (Communities / Norms & Commons)
- Mechanism: Coordinated by shared norms, reputation, and voluntary contributions. Results go to the commons.
- Strengths: Fast accumulation and reuse of knowledge, low participation costs.
- Weaknesses: dependence on gratis, governance burden, and weak circulation of funds.
- Examples: OSS, Wikipedia, industry standards bodies, regional cooperation.
- Suitable conditions: results are non-competitive (knowledge) and have high reuse value.
- Indicators to watch: number of maintainers, Issue retention, number of forks, maintenance fund inflows.

Usage and hybrids
- Market x hierarchy: companies plan internally while externally procure at a price (typical supply network).
- Market x Community: commercial SaaS based on OSS (market for price, commons for infrastructure).
- Hierarchy x Community: Companies agree on specifications with standardization bodies → internal implementation.

Contemporary Supplement
- Platform and AI recommendations affect the market/community as a "quasi-plan" (exposure and search = substantial adjustments).
- The state is the fourth pole that supports the three parties through internalization of externalities, safety standards, and public procurement.

super-summary
- Market = "price" for dispersion adjustment
- Hierarchy = "order and plan" for centralized coordination
- Autonomous adjustment based on community = "norms and reputation
In practice, it is best to design a combination of all three.

I asked where this triangle came from (source).<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

There is. However, the "triangle" was not presented as it was by a single classic, but was reconstituted by superimposing the community/commons as a third coordinating principle on the classic that formulated the market ↔ hierarchy (corporations).

- Market vs. hierarchy classics
    - Coase, "The Nature of the Firm" (1937): Why transactions are conducted "within the firm (hierarchy)" rather than in the marketplace = explained in [[Transaction costs]]. ([Wiley Online Library](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    - Williamson, Markets and Hierarchies (1975): develops transaction cost theory and analyzes the boundaries and choices between markets and hierarchies. ([SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1496220&utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Presentation of the third principle (community/network)
    - Powell, "Neither Markets nor Hierarchies: Network Organizations" (1990): theorizes "networks" (= communal coordination) as a third form. ([Stanford University](https://web.stanford.edu/~woodyp/powell_neither.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    - Ostrom, Governing the Commons (1990): a demonstration of autonomous governance of the commons independent of the state or private ownership. A Strong Foundation for Community Principles. ([Cambridge University Press & Assessment [https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/governing-the-commons/reflections-on-the-commons/25EA7](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/governing-the-commons/reflections-on-the-commons/25EA7) EDBB48EEC9BA6A761E978EA9BA1?utm_source=chatgpt.com])
        - [[Elinor Ostrom]]
    - Adler & Heckscher (2006), The Firm as a Collaborative Community: systematizing collaborative communities in the knowledge economy as organizational forms. ([smlr.rutgers.edu [https://smlr.rutgers.edu/sites/smlr/files/Documents/Faculty-Staff-Docs/The%20Firm%20as%20a%20Collaborative%20](https://smlr.rutgers.edu/sites/smlr/files/Documents/Faculty-Staff-Docs/The%20Firm%20as%20a%20Collaborative%20) Community%20%28Heckscher-Adler%29-%20Contents%20and%20Introduction%20%281%29.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com])

In short, it is positioned as a widely referenced "market-hierarchy-community" triangle used in practice, based on Coase/Williamson's "market x hierarchy" axis plus the community/network of Powell, Ostrom, and Adler.


next:  [[Add "nation" and "model" to the triangle.]]
