When the weak retaliate, society realizes the cost of discrimination.

> [_cannedbread](https://twitter.com/_cannedbread/status/1731228399530885301) "It is better for the cost of life for a man to retaliate and influence society than for him to shut up and f*** himself" [[invincible fortress]] method, [[public order]] will decline at an accelerating rate. Only then will society realize the existence of "[[discrimination costs]]" for [[vulnerable men]].

But there is no turning back now, because the public has chosen to play Russian roulette, in which they might become victims of a heinous crime, rather than give dignity and compassion to vulnerable men.

I am glad that the bad practices have been eliminated in exchange for the deterioration of public safety. (I have an anti-dystopian spirit that would prefer a collapsed free world to a society that is built on endurance.
