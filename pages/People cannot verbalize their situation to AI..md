title: "People cannot verbalize their situation to AI."

[[どのような時に本を読むべきかは曖昧]]であり、人は自分の状況を言語化してAIに伝えることができない<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>Because it is not clear at what stage and with what content one should be reading, it is difficult for people to organize their understanding and needs, and as a result, it is difficult to communicate appropriate requirements to the AI.
Description: (in Japanese only)
- Learners often have difficulty identifying their learning stages and needs, such as "what knowledge should be reinforced now" and "how deeply should it be explored?
- With an inability to fully verbalize one's situation, it is difficult to find situations where the option of reading is valid and the ideal books for this purpose.
- Similarly, asking an AI a question will make it difficult for it to properly convey the information you want.
- To solve this problem, techniques and tools are required to enhance self-understanding (metacognition) and explicitly organize learning goals and current knowledge levels.
    - Nope,[[self-understanding]] （ [[metacognition]] ）を高めることを個々人に求めるのは流石に難易度高すぎるのでは<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Instead of making the person metacognitive, the AI could infer the current level of knowledge based on observations of behavior.
- Only when such assumptions are in place will it be easier to determine "should I hit the books now?" and "what kind of book is best for me?" and the dialogue with the AI will be more beneficial.
