    - I'm not moving ahead as fast as I am in [[IDEAL]].
    - Gray is [[Ideal self]].
    - The red arrow is [[Gap between ideal and reality]].
- At this time, impatience and frustration arise when you are late for your ideal self.
    - But it can only be resolved by moving on.

- Sometimes I feel the need to pull people behind me.
    - This is because "being able to pull" brings a sense of security because it is a demonstration that you are ahead of the curve.
- But if you pull someone who lags behind, the law of action-reaction pulls you back.
    - This exacerbates the problem.
        - [[flood of tsunamis]]
    - You have to pull people behind when you can afford to.
        - We must wait until the foothold is solid enough not to be dragged.
    - Trying to do more than one thing at a time and failing.
            - [[He who runs after two hares will catch neither]]
