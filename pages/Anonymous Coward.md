> If you post anonymously without logging in, your name becomes Anonymous Coward (meaning anonymous [[coward]], AC), and you are restricted by the aforementioned moderation system and the inability to post a large number of consecutive posts. On the other hand, there are many technical people who provide valuable information annotated with "I'm an insider, so I'm AC. ......," and such comments are sometimes rated as "helpful" or other by the site's moderation system.

If you looks something interesting but the auto-translated English is not good enough to understand it, feel free to let me know at [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en). I'm very happy to spread my thought to non-Japanese readers.
