"Building a society brimming with teamwork" is the vision of Cybozu: [Vision｜Cybozu, Inc.](https://cybozu.co.jp/en/company/vision/)
- [[チームワークあふれる社会]]

The four principles guiding Cybozu's teamwork are...
- [[Share a common vision]]
    - [[理想への共感]]
    - To get anywhere as a team, you first have to agree to move in the same direction. For Cybozu, that direction is toward a society brimming with teamwork. Our overarching vision is not only what guides our projects and corporate strategy, but also the defining factor we use in problem solving and conflict arbitration.

- [[Be yourself and take responsibility]]
    - [[自立と議論]]
    - Once you know where you’re going, the next step is to efficiently share roles and responsibilities. Dividing tasks requires a team of individuals who take responsibility for their actions. But true responsibility isn’t blindly following orders — it’s being true to ourselves, recognizing what we can contribute, and delivering on the promises we make. This confluence of self-evaluation and autonomy is what we decided to group together as “be yourself and take responsibility.”

- [[Be transparent]]
    - [[公明正大]]
    - After roles are divided, itʼs important that we all coordinate our efforts. This coordination requires from every member what is known in Japanese as koumeiseidai. It translates to public (公), clear (明), honest (正), and big (⼤). In other words, we must strive to make our thoughts and actions public, clear enough for anyone to understand, honest to the truth of the matter, and convey them with a loud enough voice so that all those concerned can hear.

- [[Embrace individuality]]
    - [[多様な個性を重視]]
        - [[多様な個性]]
    - A big part of teamwork in the modern knowledge economy is recognizing that team members know best how to do their own work. At Cybozu, we call this process “[[100 people, 100 workstyles]].” But policies are only truly flexible if people feel comfortable using them. To support team members and allow customized workstyles, it’s important we not judge one another based on personal preferences. As long as we are working toward a common vision, our stance is always to embrace individuality.
