- Not taking [[risk]] is [[False dichotomy]].
- The book quote describes it as "[[continue to]] take appropriate risks."
    - Risk-taking at the level of failure and death is clearly "[[Excessive risk]]" or "[[Excessive risk-taking]]" and not "[[Appropriate risk]]" and cannot continue to be taken.


- [[risk]]
