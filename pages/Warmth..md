title: "Warmth."
---

When there is a new product or service and the speaker is [[unfamiliar (with)]] with it, the speaker perceives a difference compared to his or her familiar product.
The difference is born from the difference in the speaker's proficiency level, so trying to explain the difference on the basis of product features is not a good explanation.
It is often observed that people describe such cases as having "[[warmth]]" in conventional products.

Examples of usage
- Tube radios are warmer than transistor radios.
- Paper books have more warmth than e-books.
- Television broadcasts are warmer than online video services.

Associative connection: [[profound]].
