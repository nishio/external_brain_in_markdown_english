>  [[Tempo]] is "Now, this moment! The move that works to win this moment!"
>  [[value]] is "Not affecting me now, but a move that will give me an ongoing advantage from here on out!"
>  It's a lot easier when there are a lot of people you work with who are aware of this tempo and value.

I'd like to increase the number of friends who know the importance of allocating more resources to value.

> [fladdict](https://x.com/fladdict/status/1864525695558545481) On days like exams or presentations, when "winning this day is the turning point of your life," it's good to take tempo cards, but on other days, it's usually the right thing to do, "I'll save up my value cards while continuing to lose. On other days, it's usually a good idea to play the "I'll save up the value card while continuing to lose" game. Winning overwhelmingly where there is no point in winning" is a waste of resources... and it is important to be aware of this.
