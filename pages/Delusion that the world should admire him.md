title: "Delusion that the world should admire him"
---

Giving [[orders]] to competent young people is beneficial to society because in many cases the orders make it easier for them to demonstrate their competence. So that is what is done.

However, some people become obsessed with the delusion that they are [[genius]] and that the world should [[admire]] them. This is not a rare occurrence; it has been observed many times.

The solution to this problem is not yet clear. It is not "stop giving them medals." Because not only human resource development programs and contests, but also "good universities," "good schools," "good laboratories," "good companies," etc. are sources of this kind of delusion. It is not possible to destroy all of them without creating a society of "misconceived equality.
