<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/> The term "[[nominalist]]" ([[nominalist]]) in [[Richard Rorty's]] definition of "ironist" is important in a philosophical context. Nominalism generally takes the position that universal concepts and categories are not real, but merely names or words. This philosophy is opposed to realism, the position that universal concepts exist as real things.

When Rorty describes an "ironist" as materialistic, he is referring to the fact that this person does not believe that his or her most important beliefs and desires refer to universal truths or absolute standards. The ironist recognizes that his values and beliefs are rooted in specific historical, cultural, and social circumstances and that they are accidental and not based on absolute truth or substance.

The "materialistic" in this context indicates the ironist's attitude toward his "[[end-pole vocabulary]]." The vocabulary of the terminopole is the words and concepts that individuals use to justify their own actions and beliefs, but the ironist recognizes that these vocabularies are not based on an absolute foundation and sees them as interchangeable. In other words, ironists believe that their values and terms do not represent universal truths and can be replaced by other cultural or personal vocabularies.

For Rorty, this materialistic attitude encourages ironists to relativize their beliefs and values and to be humble toward themselves and others. This attitude also means that the ironist has the flexibility to accept new vocabulary and different views. Aylonists are aware that their beliefs and values are not the only correct ones and are open to exploring diverse perspectives.

> This is also called nominalism, a position opposed to medieval realism. It is a position that opposes the medieval realism, which holds that only individual things exist, and that universals such as classes and species do not exist, but only arise in the human mind "post rem after the individual things.

In short, for example, "there is no universal reality to which the word 'iki' refers," but rather "people just give the name 'iki' to individual concrete things.
