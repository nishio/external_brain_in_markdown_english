It is not always the case that those who discover springs build walls.
- There may already be a wall, and there is no [[Incentive to Destroy]] it.
    - Destroying it incurs costs, and doing so would result in personal loss, so typically, one does not.
- It is problematic when the person on the right, who has the incentive to destroy, is [[Vague]].
