title: 'The process of thinking about what "thinking" means'
---

from  [[consider]]

What is "thinking" (asked by [[Tomoya Tachikawa]])?

Basic approach:.
- If you don't know the meaning of a word, you can observe how the word is used see: [[The meaning of a word is the use of the word]].
- →Look for examples of using "think" as a keyword on your Scrapbox.
- →Two used "think" itself, and four used keywords containing "think."

- There is already a page with "think" as a link.
        - [[handle]]
        - > When you get the word, you can use that word to do [[thinking]].
            - Words are tools for thinking.
        - > [[Engelbart]] held that language is a means by which individuals break down their perceptions of the world into "[[concepts]]" for modeling the world. Language maps [[symbols]] to these "concepts" and is used to consciously manipulate the "concepts. Consciously manipulating this concept, he believes, is "[[consider]]".
            - Thinking = conscious [[operation]] of [[concept]].
                - What is a concept?
                - What is concept manipulation?
                - What does it mean that the operation of a concept is conscious?
        - [[About Reading]]
            - [[Schopenhauer]]
            - >  A diligent person who spends a day [[wide (extensive) reading]] gradually loses the ability to think about things for himself.
        - myself
            - >  "[[consider]]" is a concept equivalent to "join" in "[Rushing to output results in a degraded copy.
                - In [[Rushing to output results in a degraded copy.]] I wrote: "An input merges with another input after a time = the word is ripe."
- There is a link that contains "think."
        - [[Thinking about people]]
        - Name of Konosuke Matsushita's books
        - Subtitled "Proposing a New View of Humanity, Seeking the True Way of Man."
        - In other words, "think X" means
            - "Advocating a New View of X."
            - In Search of the True X Way."
        - [[Think of an abstract]]
        - This is just one specific example of an abstract I'm considering.
        - Specifically, I'm trying to envision specific participants and what they would like to talk about.
        - In this case, "thinking" means the following actions
            - Create a set of fragmented facts and stories to talk about.
            - Create pathways to connect them.
        - Write it down to make it disappear, then slowly figure out how to connect it.
        - [[think in writing]]
        - This links to multiple pages
            - [Kazuhiro Shiozawa's [[literary work]].
            - >  Write first instead of trying to write after you understand
            - >  Writing allows you to view your thoughts from a moment ago objectively.
            - View thoughts objectively
                - [[objectivization]] of thought.
        - [[Consider the duality]]
        - This is linked to [blind spot card
        - Blind spot cards collect "[[blind spot]]"
        - What did you want to happen by it?
            - Thinking develops by noticing blind spots.
        - It means [It is human beings who interpret oracles.
            - [[tarot]] Drawing cards is an "oracle-giving device."
            - Whether or not it is actually an oracle is immaterial.
            - Breaking the stalemate of thought by trying to find a connection to the current situation by considering it to be an oracle
                    - [[breakdown of insulation]] by [[associative connection]]
                - Just as [[placebo]] can be effective without actually having a medicinal effect.
        - This "think dual" specifically means "map to the space of duals and think there".
            - It is a kind of mapping in [[analogy]] to [[metaphorical space]], developing it there, and then pulling it back, if you discard whether it is a dual or not.

impressions
- The flow of this page itself is a concrete example of "thinking
- summary
    - Engelbart, "Thinking = conscious manipulation of concepts."
    - An input merges with another input over time = the word is ripe
        - Schopenhauer called this "thinking," interpreted by Nishio
    - Nishio interprets Konosuke Matsushita's idea that "thinking X" means "creating a new way of looking at X."
    - Nishio calls it "thinking" to find the connections between the written fragments and create the appropriate story
    - Writing down thoughts objectifies them.
        - Concepts become consciously manipulable objects.
        - Writing it out and making it indelible allows for "time to set aside and merge it with another".
        - By writing it down and making it an object, you can get a different perspective on it.
    - Write down your thought process.
        - It does not directly solve another problem in the future, but it can be mapped by analogy
        - Mapping by analogy, developing, and pulling back provides a solution to a new problem
        - This realization that "the analogy holds" is "binding."
- This page actually combines a number of previous pages

To summarize in one line.
    - [[Thinking = combining one piece of information with another]]
    - If they happen to combine, they are called "[[noticed]]".
        - Intentional attempts to cause coupling are "[[consider]]"
        - This is Engelbart's "thinking = conscious manipulation of concepts."
    - There are a variety of specific ways to intentionally cause bonding.
        - Write down your thoughts so that you can objectify them and view them from a different perspective
        - Writing information out makes it indelible and allows it to be combined with another over time
            - Nowadays, by writing it down in a digital way, it can be found in a search.
        - There are ways to spread it out after the bonding has occurred.
            - Use analogical binding to map the problem to another space, develop it there, and then pull it back.
            - A type of coupling "[[suggestion]]" can be electronically recorded and explored electronically: [[2-hop links]].
