A framework that maximizes human-AI interaction is important for knowledge growth, and the combination of Scrapbox and Kozaneba facilitates centralized management of fragmented information and knowledge deepening. The decision to accept the AI perspective should be left to the individual.

Combining the fragmented information written down in Scrapbox with ChatGPT's capabilities may suggest a framework for new knowledge growth. This is an important step in information organization and knowledge growth.

Its specific implementation and effects are not yet clear.
In light of these points, the following questions arise

1. what are the specific ways to implement a framework that combines Scrapbox and ChatGPT to encourage new knowledge growth?
2. what kind of knowledge deepening can be expected by using this framework?
3. how do you combine pieces of information to create new knowledge, and how does this process proceed?
4. what is the background behind the idea that it should be left to the individual to decide whether or not to accept an AI's point of view?
5. why is the AI perspective not always satisfactory for truth seekers?

Proposes a new framework to maximize human-AI interaction; information organization through a combination of Scrapbox and Kozaneba and the ability of ChatGPT to provide "different perspectives" are important; writing down fragments of information in Scrapbox will lead to future growth; and the ability of ChatGPT to provide "different perspectives" is important; the ability to organize information in Scrapbox and Kozaneba is important.

### Relating to fragments
.

Different perspectives" on ChatGPT are useful, but many expect "the truth"; writing down bits and pieces of information in Scrapbox can lead to future growth. Concrete day-to-day information can be abstracted and connections discovered.

[* New Considerations (Japanese)

Proposing a new framework that maximizes human-AI interaction is an important step in information organization and knowledge growth; the combination of Scrapbox and Kozaneba to organize fragmented information in a centralized manner could be of high value in the future. In addition, ChatGPT's ability to provide "different perspectives" will provide new perspectives and ideas, contributing to the deepening of knowledge.

However, ChatGPT's expectation of "different perspectives" may not be satisfactory to those seeking "truth"; it must be recognized that the perspective provided by AI does not necessarily reflect "truth" but only one perspective.

In addition, writing down fragments of information in the Scrapbox is conducive to future growth. Concrete day-to-day information can be abstracted and new connections and perspectives can be discovered. This contributes to the deepening of knowledge and the discovery of new perspectives.

Combining these perspectives reveals a new framework for maximizing human-AI interaction. This framework will facilitate information organization and knowledge growth, enabling deeper understanding and the discovery of new perspectives.

### previous notes

We need to find a balance between humans and AI and find their form of communication.
- Hypothesis that essential thinking takes place by taking time to think, like a daily diary.
- AI can process faster, but diversity of human perspectives is also important

Need a "multihead" to have multiple thoughts going on at the same time
- It is beneficial for humans to throw unorganized thoughts to AI and for AI to advance them
- The development of this thinking should take the form of a Git branch

Use vector search to find relevant information
- This has been implemented

Proposal to make pages and links containing specific keywords initial candidates.
- For example, for a page that is used here and there but does not have a coherent explanation, GPT can write a draft by referring to the linked page.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

Agile writing style using Scrapbox
Combination of Scrapbox and Kozaneba to organize information
- Use Scrapbox as the infrastructure and allow Kozaneba to be used as an overlay to it.
    - It resonates with the human-AI balancing and multi-head approach.
- In addition, Scrapbox's vector and keyword search ideas could be further enhanced with Kozaneba.

- Need to facilitate data exchange between Scrapbox and Kozaneba
    - How should this be accomplished?
        - Reading and writing Scrapbox programmatically is not difficult as it has already been achieved<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

The difficulty of introducing and evangelizing Scrapbox should also be considered. If people are not motivated to use it, they will eventually stop using it. Therefore, it is important to create a state in which users can expect, "Here might be the information I want! It is therefore important to create a state in which users can expect to find the information they are looking for. How this should be accomplished and what the resulting impact will be need to be considered in more depth.

### initial version
 from  [[Nodal point of thought on Scrapbox and AI 2023/8/16]]

There's so much going on that it confuses my mind, so I have a blank page to write on.

Some joint projects slow down
balance
Balance between humans and AI needs to be adjusted.
Humans have not yet discovered a form of communication with AI.
timidly

One Diary a Day
It's meant to be slow.
More important essential thinking is done by taking time to think (hypothesis)
The AI side can do it faster.
What we actually did
It's also beneficial
But,
Perspectives on the human side do not change.
Diverse perspectives


Whether pages should be separated or not

multi-head
- There is more than one topic on which you want to develop your thoughts.
- Now the AI thinks what it wants to think, independent of humans.
- But I'd like to throw in the unorganized stuff that humans are thinking about right now.
    - I go to bed and wake up and the AI is one step ahead of me, which is good.
- I'm concerned that by having only one topic right now, throwing it at them will break the AI's current thinking.
- That concern should be eliminated.
- Like a branch in Git, thoughts develop in an observable path of development.
- We should have more than one branch.
- When you think about it like this, it is not obvious whether each commit should be a separate page or whether the branches should be combined into a single page
    - Scrapbox's top page dies to make each commit one page.
        - But that's not Scrapbox's fault for not being able to customize the home page.
        - When the old and the new clash, don't use the new as a reason to stop.
    - branch to one page.
        - You can have a long page.
        - but, well, is there any particular difference compared to the minutes or the study group presentation materials that you're putting in there?

Discovering Related Chunks
- I think we should include one vector search.
    - I doubt if it's good enough at the top.
    - Eventually trade-off between use and exploration
    - I took 3 top pages and ignored chunks from the same page.
- Connecting other people's projects hit by vector search

The idea is to give a keyword and take as initial candidates the pages that contain that keyword or have a link to that keyword.

Branch 1 page implementation
- Currently "Get the latest note" and "Create the next note after it with a new name".
    - Get Latest Notes" retrieves pages beginning with "🤖20" and sorts them by title.
- You can specify the target note.
    - But the current situation is that I've created a new note and it's going to be HEAD, so there will be one branch.
    - It would be nice if we could specify an export title that does not begin with "🤖20"
    - Let's add an overwrite option.
    - When overwrite ON, leaving the contents of the target page? Create a page?
    - No, Scrapbox itself has a history function, so can I overwrite it without worrying about it?
    - I'm not sure of the conditions for saving the history, should I leave it explicitly?
