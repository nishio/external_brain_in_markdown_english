- It is a metaphor, not a formal formula, but the meaning is generally correct.
- [[Vitalik Buterin]] actually uses the phrase "[[mechanism]] = [[algorithm]] + [[incentive]]" ("[[Credible Neutrality as a Guiding Principle Vitalik Buterin]] actually uses the phrase "[[mechanism]] = [[algorithm]] + [[incentive]]" (in "[[Credible Neutrality as a Guiding Principle]].
- In [[mechanism design]] in economics, a mechanism is defined as [[message space]] + [[allocation function]] + [[transfer]] and designed to satisfy [[incentive consistency]]. This short formula captures the substance well, since it can be regarded as equivalent to "allocation function = algorithm" and "transfer = incentive".

        - Some short "as-is" definitions from standard, authoritative sources are quoted (with Japanese translations where appropriate).

        - To summarize to the minimum necessary, the standard definition is "to give each player a mechanism with a message space and an outcome function (often decision + transfer)," and "mechanism design is the study of designing institutions (games) backwards that produce desired outcomes."

- Summary (Practical Readings)
    - Algorithm (rule/result function): a calculation procedure that determines the allocation from inputs (declarations).
    - Incentive (payment, punishment, right): a mechanism that motivates honest declaration or desired behavior to be optimal in the procedure.
    - Mechanism: Design that integrates the above two (+ communication protocol = message space).
