> [konotarogomame](https://x.com/konotarogomame/status/1829985299558285370) [[Taro Kono]] What I want to achieve as prime minister.
>  We would like to respond to the voices of those who wish to [[vote online]] because they have the intention to vote but lack the environment to do so, such as the fact that it is too far to go to the polling place and the number of eligible voters who can vote by mail is limited.
>  We would like to realize online voting by utilizing [[my number card]], which three out of four people have. We will start with online voting for Japanese residents abroad, and if there are no problems, we will expand it to the domestic market. We understand that you may be concerned about what will happen if you are intimidated and forced to vote for someone you do not intend. In [[Estonia]], a leading online voting country, you can vote online as many times as you want and the last vote is valid. If you vote online or at a polling place, your online vote will be invalidated and your polling place vote will be valid. (continued)

> [konotarogomame](https://x.com/konotarogomame/status/1829985303182131276) I understand your concern about intervention from other countries. Estonia is constantly under cyber attack from neighboring Russia, but our online voting system has never been affected.
>  [[digital agency]] has sent staff to Estonia to study the Estonian online voting system. We would like to start studying the introduction of online voting in Japan as well.

Interesting specification that "physical voting takes precedence over online voting."

> [fuzzysphere](https://x.com/fuzzysphere/status/1830438412220027388) To determine which is preferred, the voter and the vote should be at least temporarily recorded in the system.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1830447374470459772) "Isn't it obvious?" I thought so, but maybe this is equating "to be recorded" with "to be read by a third party". So you think you can claim that "secrets are at risk" and "recording them is a problem" by claiming "they will be recorded". That equation is generally not valid: [Secret Computation, which balances the protection of information and the use of data:](https://www.aist.go.jp/aist_j/magazine/20240410.html)
- [[Secret calculations]]
    - Protecting information and using data go hand in hand.
