[Guam Typhoon Report](https://twitter.com/urbangal_pink/status/1661991467408318464?s=46&t=gkSZtjGEtUZPO0JCzBxCBw)
- > The Guam airport seems to have been devastated, and the official word is that flights will not be flying until June.
- > New hotel check-in is impossible and the hotel is fully booked.
- > We were told that we were free to sleep in the lobby of the Hyatt and that we would be provided with free water and Wi-Fi. However, no matter where we searched in Guam, we were told that there would be no more accommodations for you anywhere in Guam.


- [[We need to understand the lack of understanding.]]


Schedule from [[Diary 2023-05-27]].
- First, write down the information in your brain about writing at this point on a blank page
- Open Kozaneba
- Put in what you haven't put in yet.
- The manuscript takes precedence over the weekly journal, because I can delay the weekly journal, but I'm sorry if I delay the manuscript.
He did a weekly journal, completely ignoring the manuscript.
- [[Humans don't work like computers]].
- Problem with "[[sensation]]"
- After all, we need to "[[rest]]" first, and then we need to "calm down" by discharging information that is scattered around in the brain.
    - The state of being only in the brain continues to drain computing resources.

Well, but I guess you could say I've completed the "writing down the information in my brain about writing at this point on a blank page"?
- Nothing in particular to be written out at this moment.
    - Maybe it really was there, but it went under.
            - [[Metaphor of a fish tank]]
    - but that's nothing to think about.
    - We can only take out what we can take out now.
        - [[I don't care what I can't control.]]

Is "writing something out" an incorrect task description to begin with?
- When B is on the surface of your consciousness, you cannot write down A without writing down B.
    - [[image of fish near the surface of the water]].
- You can empty the surface and wait for A to come up, but there is no guarantee that A will come up.
    - [[Things out of control]].
- Stop the input, focus on the output, and empty the surface.

### Stop the input, concentrate on the output, empty the surface

    - Observation of myself after [[social battery]] over-discharge
    - Go to bed at 20:00, get up at 25:00, output what you have learned until 30:00, go to bed again, get up at 11:00 (35:00).
    - Lazing around and looking at Twitter
    - Realize that you are looking at Twitter in a lazy way.
    - I'll come back to write in my well diary.
    - Notice the order of this action.
    - One wonders why they are doing this action in this order.
    - Should I drink coffee or not?
        - You could also go to a cafe that serves coffee.
            - Some say it's crowded because it's Sunday.
    - [[decision-making stall]]

- The state of being lazy and looking at Twitter hasn't stopped the input.
    - Poor quality, fragmented, emotionally counterintuitive, keeps throwing inputs into the water.
- Why a well-documented diary?
    - My Scrapbox is [[too]] flexible.
    - You can spit out all the topics in parallel, you can create pages, so when [[decision fatigue]] is happening, you can't decide what to write [[stall (of an engine or aircraft)]].
    - Diary pages are written one at a time as they come to mind.
