It's funny how people who have been doing IT education feel the end of IT and say things like "[[memory of a previous life]].
    - [[reincarnation]]


People who learned IT on their own at a time when there was no IT education.
- Learn xx on your own at a time when there is no xx education
- The era of xx education is not already in the [[early adopter]] phase with respect to xx

There's the question of whether it's okay to find and train "IT people."
- Thinking about it, I think IPA Mittoku might be "IT Talent Discovery and Training", but Mittoku Junior is a support for creators.
