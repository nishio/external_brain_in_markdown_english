Depending on whether you are above or below the level of fulfillment, the exact same arrow has a different meaning.
- However, fulfillment levels are subjective and vary from person to person, making it difficult for others to guess
    - Worse, some people see "unfulfilled" as "shame" and try to hide it, which makes it even more difficult.

For those on top, arrows are of the nature of "a plus if you have them, but you don't have to have them".
- For those below, the same arrows become "necessary for fulfillment".


- [[A series of pictures of two people saying different things]]
- In the current picture, people are not yet vocalizing.

- [[satisfaction]]
