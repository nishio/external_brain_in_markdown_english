> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1805170157012283724) People sometimes talk about "seniors not being able to use digital," but I don't think that's necessarily true. I know many people who make use of LINE and YouTube, and I have received comments from people in their 70s on my daily live-streaming.

> [shujisado](https://x.com/shujisado/status/1805512059960111452) Because an open source project looks like an open and democratic development system from the outside, people in various circles aim for open source-like methods and organizations. The first successful open source organizational structure was a lifetime dictatorship, followed by an oligarchy, then a consortium, and so on.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1805577681725276626) Many people take the word "democratic" in a fluffy way, without subdividing it too clearly. When we say that an open source project is democratic, "democratic" does not mean that one person votes for it, but rather that anyone can make a proposal, that the proposal is visible to others, and that it can be discussed in an open forum.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1805586054986219670) The reason why such a difference in nature arises is because there is a difference in the nature of the world between the physical world and the digital world. If I feel that the operating policy of an open source project is different from the policy I expect, I can fork it. People can easily leave. This is a big difference from the physical world.
[[Panarchy]].

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1805587191810417103) In my lifetime, AI will be the "gentle lifetime dictator" for many projects. I believe we need to develop technology to make that dictatorship more people-friendly.
[Gentle lifetime dictator - Wikipedia [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%84%AA%E3%81%97%E3%81%84%E7%B5%82%E8%BA%AB%E3%81%AE%E7%8B%AC%E8%A3%81%E8%80%](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%84%AA%E3%81%97%E3%81%84%E7%B5%82%E8%BA%AB%E3%81%AE%E7%8B%AC%E8%A3%81%E8%80%) 85]
- > "Benevolent dictator... ." popularized in Eric Raymond's essay, "[[Cultivation of the Nowhere Sphere]]. As one of the topics related to hacker culture, Raymond examines in detail how, because of the nature of open source, a "dictatorship" must be benevolent. Because if opinions completely differ, it can lead to a new leader forking the project.

To help this, an award system called "TMG DX Award" is established once a year to commend digitization efforts recommended by each bureau. This year, the awards will be held again.

>  Since digitization is done on the front lines, many of the projects are more down-to-earth than flashy and glamorous. On the other hand, there are some initiatives that may be helpful to other municipalities as well, so please feel free to watch them if you like.
>  The last fiscal year is summarized in NOTE. Digitalization of guidance and inspection services and infrastructure inspection efforts by the Bureau of Sewerage.

>  It will be a burden on the field in the short term to do the current work on site and then further digitalize it with BPR. Even so, digitization will continue to progress because there are people who are working hard now for the future. We would like to take this opportunity to shine a light on this, so please feel free to contact us if you would like to cover this event.

From yesterday's chat
- I read a lot of self-help books, many people make fun of them, but they had real benefits.
- A theory that ultimately comes down to "[[Seven Habits]].
    - It can be said that reading many thin and easy books is a way to grasp what is commonly talked about
- The Courage to be Disliked.
- Talk about "[[effectuation]]" being a good linguisticization.

> [YusukeTaira](https://x.com/YusukeTaira/status/1805239883377865111) National liability for defamation was accepted for the mayor's comments at a city council meeting. According to a court decision (Tokyo High Court, May 25, 2006), the head of a municipality does not have the same wide discretionary power concerning questions, etc., as a member of the Diet.

> [YusukeTaira](https://x.com/YusukeTaira/status/1805240906897141998)↑The Tokyo High Court decision of May 25, 2006, Labor Case No. 919, p. 22, is also available on the court website. This case is also important in practice, as it is a high court ruling that the court did not reach the same conclusion as the Supreme Court ruling on September 9, 1997 (Hanrei-Ji No. 1631, p. 57), which ruled on the discretionary power of Diet members regarding questioning, etc.

> [hkawai3](https://x.com/hkawai3/status/1805107897535521101) I said, "No, no, you can do it too. In fact, there are people who started programming because they wanted to make OSASK applications and became able to do it. If you try it and get stuck, please ask questions at that time. I am sure I can help you."
>  Reply "That will take time. It can be done quickly if you do it.
> [hkawai3](https://x.com/hkawai3/status/1805107899972333721) Why don't you help me? I am in trouble!"
>  I said, "I have studied so much to do what I want to do. It is not to help you. I am sorry."
>
>  In open source development, users can help, not just say what they want.
> [hkawai3](https://x.com/hkawai3/status/1805107902279258226) Each person may make what they think they need on their own. Everyone just did what they could do to the best of their ability and brought it to the table. ... But on the other hand, there are sometimes people who just come in and say, I don't have this, I don't have that, do this, do that. And those people are pretty bossy.
> [hkawai3](https://x.com/hkawai3/status/1805107904502235373) I just saw a statement that candidate A's poster in the gubernatorial election is not put up anywhere there, what are you doing? What are you doing? I wondered why he would say such a thing when everyone is busy working hard to put up the posters. If it were me, I would have asked them to share the posters because I wanted to go and put them up myself.
