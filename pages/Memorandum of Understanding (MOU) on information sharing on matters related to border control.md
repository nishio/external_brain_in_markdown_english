[Taiwan Contingency, Sharing Information on Evacuated Foreigners...Unusual Memorandum of Understanding Signed: "Wary of Possible Entry of Chinese Operatives" (Yomiuri Shimbun Online) - Yahoo! News [https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/ab85335b430c965d396](https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/ab85335b430c965d396) d58711b8782f3c59005b9]
> According to the official, the Japanese side will receive information on foreigners who wish to enter from Taiwan based on the MOU. As a result, in the event of an emergency, Japan will be able to effectively conduct screening (acceptance screening) to determine if there are any persons who may have a negative impact on public safety in the country. Even in normal times, advance checks are conducted at Taiwanese airports for passengers bound for Japan.
