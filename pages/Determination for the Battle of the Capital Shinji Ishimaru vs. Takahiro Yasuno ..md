I hear it's been well-received, that "they're both discussing it properly."
> [kc_p_2](https://x.com/kc_p_2/status/1802690174562013249) I watched the video of Takahiro Yasuno and Shinji Ishimaru's discussion, and it would be hot if the two were in a close race. I'm not sure if I'd like to see a "one-polar" or a "multi-polar" race, but I'd like to see a "two-polar" race.

I'll see you later.

- Mr. Ishimaru stated that he is running for Governor of Tokyo because of the sense of crisis in Japan as a whole. He explained that the reason he is running for governor rather than a Diet member is because the head of the government has great authority, such as in budgeting.
- Mr. Yasuno introduced himself as an AI engineer, entrepreneur, and science fiction writer with multiple faces who has worked to create a vision of the future through technology. He also mentioned the possibility of AI-based communication in elections.
- Regarding the impact of technology on democracy, Mr. Anno stated that it is a double-edged sword, but if used well, it can help the socially vulnerable. As concrete examples, he cited the introduction of automated driving in depopulated areas and the DX-ization of government administration.
- Mr. Ishimaru pointed out the negative effects of the concentration of power in Tokyo and emphasized that Tokyo and the regions are teammates, not adversaries. He argued that Tokyo's efforts to raise the level of the regions will lead to the development of Japan as a whole. He pointed to the lack of economic rationality in Tokyo's administration as a problem, and called for an emphasis on return on investment.
- Mr. Yasuno asked how to balance Tokyo's international competitiveness with correcting the disparity between Tokyo and the rural areas, but Mr. Ishimaru's answer was not included.
- Overall, although the two men differed in their methods, they were united in their direction of developing Tokyo through the use of technology and administrative reforms, while at the same time aiming for a symbiotic relationship with the local regions. It was a thought-provoking conversation in which they discussed their visions as governors of Tokyo.
