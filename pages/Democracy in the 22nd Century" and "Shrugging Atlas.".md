「 [[Democracy in the 22nd Century]] 」
p.139
- The [[democracy]] we have now has become an institution that emanates the [[ressentiment]] of the ignorant [[majority who create nothing]]."
    - It could be from the line "Atlas shrugs."

p.149
- [[Running away from democracy]].
    - This is already Atlas shrugging his shoulders.
- We're taking it one step further.
    - The [[right of secession]] prevents [[capital dictatorship]].
        - On the other hand, with [[Plural Money]] and stuff like that, they're going to try to [[lock-in]] you with a [[withdrawal tax]].
    - "People who acquire money and power arrive at the [[desire for approval]] to be coveted as great men. This begets charity for the weak."
        - I'm amused that you write about Yusaku Matsuzawa's money distribution as a case study.
        - In Atlas, the majority of the weak are forced to give alms to the weak, and they get fed up and leave the country. But beyond that, there are those who approach the weak and give alms themselves, whether because they are tired of the meritocratic world or because of their greed to be pampered.
            - [[In a community full of competent people, no one comes out on top.]]
            - Maybe this trend will occur if there's a desire to stand on top of Monkey Mountain.
            - And the old democratic "[[majority is right]], [[majority has no power]], [[so]] [[the one without power is right]]" [[Sklavenmoral (slave morality, as a philosophical concept of Nietzsche)]] is reproduced

It's a book I'm getting over in light of "Shrugging Atlas."
