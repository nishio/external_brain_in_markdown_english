title: "Observe the network of relationships and intervene where appropriate"
---

I was trying to abstract the "small patches and improvements to software" that software engineers do, such as the more general "hacking the system" (which still uses the engineering term "hack"), and to express it in a vocabulary that would be understood by non-engineers, and finally came up with the expression "observe [[networks of relevance]] and intervene [where appropriate" became the expression

Many people take this concept of [[relevance]] in the abstract and don't really want to delve into it in a very concrete way
    - [[What is a relationship?]]

[[Interventions]] are also diverse, and each individual has different strengths and resources, so the possible interventions are different.
