Taiki seppo is one of the methods of transmission of the teachings in Buddhism, and refers to preaching the Buddha Dharma according to the disposition and level of understanding of the hearer (disciple). Ki" here means "disposition or ability.

For example, in the same teaching situation, if the listener is a beginner, use simple language and metaphors; if he or she has an advanced understanding, explain the deeper content and more advanced doctrines.

This concept is very important in the dissemination and transmission of Buddhism, and can be seen as an expression of Buddhist compassion and care to ensure that each believer or learner receives the Dharma in a way that is easiest for them to understand.
