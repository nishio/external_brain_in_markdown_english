the way (of proper conduct, etc.)
There is a path that is given to me. There is a path that is given to you, a path that is precious to you.
I don't know what kind of path it is, but others cannot walk it.
This irreplaceable path that only you can walk and that you can never walk again.
Sometimes it is wide. Sometimes it is narrow. Sometimes it is uphill, sometimes it is downhill.
Sometimes it is flat, sometimes it is raking and sweating.

Is this a good or bad road to take?
There may be times when you are at a loss for ideas.
There will be times when you will want to seek solace.
However, this is the only way to go, after all.

I am not asking you to give up.
This is the road I am standing on now, this is the road I am walking on now,
Anyway, we must not rest on this path.
It is an important path that only you can walk.
Isn't this an irreplaceable path that is given only to me?

Even if you are lost in the paths of others, standing still in thought,
The road is not open at all.
To open the way, we must first walk the path.
We must walk hard.

Even if it seems like a long way,
A new path will surely open up from the first steps we take.
It also creates deep joy.
