title: "I'd better be able to."
---

The question, "Is it better to be able to do it?" is a fruitless question, because "able" is naturally better than "not able" if you ignore other factors and compare "able" and "not able" [[fruitless question]].

We need to clarify how much it will cost to make it "doable."

Next, make the comparison "I can do A" and "I can't do A" instead of "I can do A" and "I can't do A".

We need to consider how the benefits of "being able to do A" and the cost of "being able to do A" compare to the benefits of "being able to do B" and the cost of "being able to do B."
