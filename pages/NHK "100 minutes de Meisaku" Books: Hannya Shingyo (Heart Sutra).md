- NHK "[[100 minutes de Meisaku]]" Books [[Heart Sutra]].
- [[Sasaki, quiet.]]

I bought this one because I enjoyed [[NHK "100 Minutes de Meitoku" Books: Buddha's Words of Truth]] by the same author.
- "In Japanese Buddhism, they often say, 'Different sects have one summit to aim for,' but it's not true!"

- [About 500 years after Gautama's death, a new movement called "Mahayana Buddhism" emerged. At this time, various lineages such as "[[Lotus Sutra]]", "[[Vimalakirti Sutra]]", and "[[Avatamska sutra]]" were born, and one of them is the "[[Prajna Sutra]]" lineage.
- The Great Prajnaparamita Sutra is about 13,000 times longer than the Heart Sutra, and the title of the Sanskrit version of the Heart Sutra does not have the word for "sutra," so it is like an abstract of the Heart Sutra.
- This was translated into Chinese by [[Genjo Sanzo]], and later Kukai stated in his commentary "[[The Secret Key to the Heart Sutra]]" that "the Heart Sutra is a spell.

Gautama tried to observe and understand the principle that there are five elements of human existence ([[the five skandhas]]) and that they produce suffering, but the Prajna-sutra lineage insisted, "There is no such thing! The Prajnaparamita Sutra lineage, on the other hand, insisted, "There is no such thing!

I said, "In other words, Gautama was trying to think about the existence of the human body and the mechanism by which we feel suffering. On the other hand, the Heart Sutra says, 'Everything is empty! There is no such thing! There is no such thing!
Wife: "Looking at [[MBTI]] and other things, it seems that humans have Thinking and Feeling types that can't understand each other, so maybe any religion will inevitably split into T and F when it spreads."
I said, "In that sense, Gautama himself is someone who was curious and thought about "Why do people suffer?" is someone who cares and thinks about it, so it's obviously a T."
