title: "Relation Question"
---

- [[question]] in [[relationship]].
- Is there a relationship between X and Y? No?
    - Most neutral but muddled
- Is there a relationship between X and Y?
    - Seemingly neutral, but some recipients have a bias to answer "no, not really."
- What is the relationship between X and Y?
    - Bias towards the "relevant."
    - Hard to answer, "No, there is no relationship."
- Are X and Y the same thing? Are they different?
    - Seems neutral [[False dichotomy]].

        - I'm ruling out the possibility of [[implication]] or [[overlap]].
        - [[What is between X and Y?]]
        - Only after it turns out to be something different.
    - relevance
            - [[Difference or no difference is a false dichotomy]]
            - [[Similar but not identical]]
            - [[Difference between "same" and "similar."]]
