<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>[[Lacan's]] "pleasure ([[jouissance]])" is one of the key concepts in his psychoanalytic theory. Pleasure is more than a mere [[pleasure]] ([[pleasure]]); it is an aspect that goes against the [[pleasure principle]]. Through this concept, Lacan sought to explain why humans are often drawn to [[pain]] or [[self-destructive]] behavior.

Specifically, enjoyment is an excessive experience that goes beyond pleasure, which is often accompanied by pain and suffering. For example, when the pleasure derived from fulfilling a desire crosses the line, it can turn into pain and guilt. This state of being is what Lacan calls "enjoyment."

Pleasure also plays an important role in the realm of the unconscious and is considered a manifestation of the individual's unconscious desires and the desires behind social and cultural prohibitions. This concept occupies an important place in Lacanian psychoanalytic theory in discussions of desire, ethics, and the construction of the subject.
