- Rich Dad's [[cash-flow quadrant]].
- [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3ivFqFW)

I read this around 2002.
- It's been a pretty beneficial book for my life.
- But then there were those who used the book to lure the stupid into shady business practices, urging them to "get [[economic freedom]]! and then there were people who used this book to get people who were not very smart to "get [[economic freedom]]" and to draw them into their shady business.
- This has resulted in a trend of being wary of anyone who recommends this book
        - [[Deteriorated copies spread]]
