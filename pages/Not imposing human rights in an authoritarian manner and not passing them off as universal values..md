<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3/icon' alt='o3.icon' height="19.5"/>Plurality," co-authored by Audrey Tang and Glen Weyl, advocates a "cooperative mechanism" that finds "[[overlapping consensus]]" among diverse values. This is a design concept to avoid [[human rights]] as [[authoritarian]] [[imposition (i.e., of rules, of a decision)]], but not [[universal value]], and is based on the experience of operating [[digital discussion tools]] ([[vTaiwan]], [[Polis]], etc.). It is based on the experience of operating [[digital discussion tools]] such as [[vTaiwan]] and [[Polis]].

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT5/icon' alt='GPT5.icon' height="19.5"/>The design guidelines for "[[unimposed universality]]," which are perfectly suited to the theme, are organized from primary sources in the field of human rights.
- Starting point: universality is "normative", implementation is "contextual".
    - [Unsdg | Human Rights-Based Approach](https://unsdg.un.org/2030-agenda/universal-values/human-rights-based-approach)
    - The [[HRBA]] ([[Human Rights-Based Approach]], [[Human Rights-Based Approach]]) is a framework that "uses international human rights standards as a normative foundation, while implementation operates to correct inequalities and eliminate distortions in the distribution of power. The assumption is that universality will be upheld, but the approach will be adapted to the parties and the context.
    - [[Operating principles to avoid imposition]] (PANEL)
        - These are the five principles of how to carry out universal values without "removing" them.
        - Participation: involvement of affected parties upstream in decision-making (submission, discussion, monitoring).
            - Related: [[Don't make decisions without the parties involved.]]
        - Accountability: Visualization of reasons for decisions and channels for redress of rights.
        - Non-discrimination: Pre-screening and remediation of discriminatory effects.
        - Empowerment: Provides the means (information, language, support) to assert rights.
        - Legality: Consistent with international human rights law, rights restrictions should be minimum and proportionate to the needs of the law.
    - The above is organized in the practice of the UN agencies and national human rights institutions as agreed principles of the HRBA.
