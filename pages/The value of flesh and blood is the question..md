title: "The value of flesh and blood is the question."
---

I was rereading [[Type-specific advice for contest applicants]] that I wrote two years ago and reconfirmed that I have been wondering since then whether I should give them knowledge or not.
- Addendum: Doesn't giving knowledge in [[command (from superior to inferior, government to private sector, etc.)]] undermine [[spontaneity]]`? The question is`

Reflect on your own behavior
- If you were asked, "Which would you prefer, Method A or Method B?" I would say, "Of course A, because..." but if someone says, "I'll do it with method B! I see.
- The more spontaneous the behavior, the less knowledge you gain, and the more you're doing the opposite of what's ideal.
- The former question is, "I leave the helm to the PM."
    - If the former is favored over the latter, it would be counterproductive to the goal of fostering human resources who can run alone.
- Why do you want B?" I wonder if it would be better to ask the question.
    - Neither books nor web articles [[Situational questions]] will do.
        - The value of having [[a flesh-and-blood person]] accompany the project is [[question]].
