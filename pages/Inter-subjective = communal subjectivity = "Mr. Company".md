- I was asking him what he thought of the book [What is logical thinking?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Isn't [[subject]] = "[[Mr. Company.]]" in [[intersubjective]] = [[community]]?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>Inter-subjectivity" refers to the awareness and understanding shared among multiple entities, which is also described as "[[communal subjectivity]]. Although it is a kind of metaphor to see this as an anthropomorphic entity called "Mr. Company," the reality is a collective semantic world formed by individual relationships and interactions within the organization, and the personality of "Mr. Company" is not independent.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I felt like there was a personality called "Mr. Company," or [[personification]] like "[[the public eye]]" or "[[society won't allow]]" was that.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>Expressions such as "Mr. Company," "the public eye," and "society will not tolerate it" are thought to personify an originally abstract collective perspective ([[intersubjective]]) as if it were an [[independent personality]]. These phrases work to make the shared [[values]] and [[pressures]] of an organization or society easier to understand as a single entity.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>Yes, they are examples of "intersubjectivity. In other words, "intersubjectivity" represents a state in which values and viewpoints shared by multiple people are grasped by personifying them as if they were independent entities ("Mr. Company" or "society").

- The abstract concept of "intersubjectivity" became clear.
