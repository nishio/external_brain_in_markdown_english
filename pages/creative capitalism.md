On January 24, 2008, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates delivered a speech titled "A New Approach to Capitalism in the 21st Century" at the World Economic Forum (commonly known as the "Davos Forum") in Davos, Switzerland.

In this context, Gates proposed the concept of "Creative Capitalism," noting that while traditional capitalism has improved the lives of many, it has not benefited everyone.

Mr. Gates particularly highlighted the problem of economically disadvantaged people not receiving the benefits of technology and the need for governments, non-profit organizations (NPOs), and corporations to work together to transform capitalism into a better system. He stated that corporations should not only pursue profits but also use social recognition as an incentive to help the poor and solve social problems.

The content of this lecture was later compiled into the book "[[Gates and Buffett on the New Capitalism]]," in which the concept of creative capitalism and its practice are discussed in detail.
