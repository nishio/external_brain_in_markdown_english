- I can't make out the back and bottom of the [[1x4 Curved Slope Leg Tachikoma]] carry because I can't see them at all.

Even if you want to make it retractable, other Tachikomas are not helpful.
- [[1×4 tile leg Tachikoma]] has the Lego studs facing up, but the curved slope leg Tachikoma faces both sides.

Then I thought, "Should I give up on opening and closing the door and just close it properly? I thought about it, but that would be too much freedom and I would not be able to make a decision. What should I do? I think I'll just close it symmetrically with the visible side...

I was tinkering with the structure and unexpectedly created a structure that could open and close.

The lamp holder and horizontal clips grip and articulate the bar.
- I would like to correct the color.


Hmmm, both sides of this door would open up a gap.

Oh, maybe this is the right thing to do?

Now I just need to figure out how to close the bottom... there's a convenient gap, so maybe I can insert a bracket here...
