title: "If you're busy, write out method"
---

- It's when you're feeling [[busy]] that you should take the time to do something like [[opening sentence or paragraph]] for a task.
- why?  [[Should→why?]]

- At any rate, the [[think after writing]] stance is useful.
- Appears large by not seeing the whole picture
    - That would be [[stress]].
- The benefit of writing it down is that it somehow seems bigger when it's vague, but by making the boundaries clear, you can see that it's not as big as you might think. The disease of feeling like [[busy]] can be cured by visualizing that you are actually not busy at all.


- I was about to go crazy because [[task scheduler]] was buggy, but when I calmed down and wrote it out, it was obvious what the top priority should be.
    - The feeling of being busy is not the same as whether or not you are actually busy. [[The Curse of Yoichi Ochiai]]
    - Not busy, just buggy task scheduler.
    - I'm not busy, my brain is out of gear and spinning like crazy...
