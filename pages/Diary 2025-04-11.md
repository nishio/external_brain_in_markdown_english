- [[Fast and Slow Worlds]]

I'll remember to transplant what I wrote in the well yesterday or so.
- I did [[Everyday Shikinen Sengu]].

He wrote, "[Coined words are not intellectual production.
- I have often used the word "concept," but I felt it would be better to elaborate more on what kind of concepts are often useful.
- →I thought one concrete example (not all) would be "[[section]]".
- →The "[[section]]" page was blank, so I generated it and got a good one.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1910695586539676104) I combined [[Gemini 2.5 Pro]] and [[Cosense Export for AI]](2 hop links) and got this output, "Wow... (vocabulary)".
- [[Gemini 2.5 Pro with Cosense Export for AI]]
