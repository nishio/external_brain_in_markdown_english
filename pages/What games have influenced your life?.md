[What games have influenced your life?
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1832084837915918765) I'm thinking about it because the topic "What games have influenced your life" came up at a drinking party.

- [[Factorio type games]]
    - Understanding [constraint theory
- Narrowly focused improvements often result in worse overall performance ([[local optimum]] and [[global optimization]])
- [[Muddy manual labor in the early stages is inevitable.]]
        - [[automation]] is important. However, it is impossible to automate from the beginning, and until automation is ready, muddy, manual digging is inevitable.
- Do not produce what is not in demand. You can't put back what you have processed.
- When there is an overflow of intermediate inventory, adding more storage without eliminating the factors that cause the glut will only fill it.
- Other than identifying and eliminating bottlenecks, most of the work is not outcome-driven work, but simply moving the problem position.
- Distinction between real time and work time. Ten minutes where a human being sticks around and works is completely different from ten minutes where he or she is free to be active. If you can automate unattended, you can leave it alone.

- [[go]]
- Understanding of the efficiency of actions
- Go is a game in which players take turns performing the same amount of actions, and the more efficient player who grasps the overall situation wins.
- Acting rigidly out of fear of risk is almost always the worst efficiency.
- Clarification is inefficient.
- Striving for a single objective is also inefficient; a hand with multiple aims is better.

[[Ragnarok Online]]
- The experience of destroying all of my assets and deleting my account was a [[virtual death]] experience.
- Earthly wealth is lost with death, and attachment to it is futile.
    - This will change again when there are children.

[[Civilization]]
    - Understanding the disadvantages of [democracy
- Democracy is not something you can choose from the beginning.
- Not always the best option for achieving objectives
- There are advantages and disadvantages.
- Once a democracy is established, it can be destroyed by its rulers.

[[SimCity]]([[SimCity type game]])
    - Understanding the benefits of [debt
- Understanding situations in which it is more detrimental not to borrow money.
- This is LinCity, but in a system where happiness increases population, and as population increases, resources are consumed, the ultimate destination of ultimate development is a structure where unhappy people are produced and die. (A moderately happy society where everyone is equally happy is theoretically possible, but it is an unstable solution and will break down quickly in reality.)

[[Dominion]]
- [[The obvious choice is not the only choice]].
    - Often the unobtrusive and uninteresting option aside is the correct one.
- Different styles of play depending on what the goal is.
    - Which style of play is right depends on the situation, so it's hard to say which is right.
    - but none of them can be achieved because of inefficient use of resources if there is ambiguity about what the objectives are.
- Having a lot is not always beneficial.
    - Discarding what is valuable is often a strong strategy.
    - Increase the density of value by discarding low-value items.
    - [[increase the probability of a stochastic event occurring]].
    - Gifts of low value are an obstruction.
- [[What everyone wants will soon wither]].
- It is a toss-up whether the frontrunners will win or the chasers will win. The key to decision making is to understand the situation.

- [[quantum chess]]
- While action reduces the likelihood in the short term, not acting will eventually lead to convergence to the weakest piece.
- The first is ambiguous, and therefore all possible. The more ambiguous it is, the wider the effect.
- The first piece to act as a flying car monopolizes the possibility of a flying car.
- Converge probabilities at a time that suits you.

Rogue-like ([[JNetHack]], etc.)
- Life is a series of [irreversible decisions
- Think about the best solution in the current situation instead of regretting past decisions.
