[What games have influenced your life?
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1832084837915918765) I'm thinking about it because the topic "What games have influenced your life" came up at a drinking party.

[[Factorio]]
- Understanding Theory of Constraints
- Narrow focus on improvements often makes them worse overall
- Automation is important. However, it is impossible to automate from the beginning, and until automation is ready, muddy, manual digging is inevitable.
- Do not produce what is not in demand. You can't put back what you have processed.
- When there is an overflow of intermediate inventory, adding more storage without eliminating the factors that cause the glut will only fill it.
- Other than identifying and eliminating bottlenecks, most of the work is not outcome-driven work, but simply moving the problem position.
- Distinction between real time and work time. Ten minutes where a human being sticks around and works is completely different from ten minutes where he or she is free to be active. If you can automate unattended, you can leave it alone.

- [[go]]
- Understanding of the efficiency of actions
- Go is a game in which players take turns performing the same amount of actions, and the more efficient player who grasps the overall situation wins.
- Acting rigidly out of fear of risk is almost always the worst efficiency.
- Clarity is inefficient, striving for a single objective is inefficient, and a hand with multiple aims is better.

[[Ragnarok Online]]
- The experience of destroying all assets and deleting accounts became a virtual death experience.
- Earthly wealth is lost with death, and attachment to it is futile.
    - This will change again when there are children.

[[Civilization]]
- Understanding the Disadvantages of Democracy
- Democracy is not something you can choose from the beginning.
- Not always the best option for achieving objectives
- There are advantages and disadvantages.
- Once a democracy is established, it can be destroyed by its rulers.

[[SimCity]]
- Understanding the benefits of debt
- Understanding situations in which it is more detrimental not to borrow money.
- This is LinCity, but in a system where happiness increases population, and as population increases, resources are consumed, the ultimate destination of ultimate development is a structure where unhappy people are produced and die. (A moderately happy society where everyone is equally happy is theoretically possible, but it is an unstable solution and will break down quickly in reality.)

[[Dominion]]
- The obvious choices are not the only choices. Often the unobtrusive and uninteresting choices that are set aside are the correct ones.
- The style of play depends on what the objectives are, but if the objectives are vague, none of them can be achieved because of inefficient use of resources.
- Having a lot is not always beneficial. Discarding things of value is often a strong strategy. Increasing the density of value by discarding things of low value. Increasing the probability of stochastic events. Gifts of low value are obstructions.
- What everyone wants will soon wither.
- It is a toss-up whether the frontrunners will win or the chasers will win. The key to decision making is to understand the situation.

- [[quantum chess]]
- While action reduces the likelihood in the short term, not acting will eventually lead to convergence to the weakest piece.
- The first is ambiguous, and therefore all possible. The more ambiguous it is, the wider the effect.
- The first piece to act as a flying car monopolizes the possibility of a flying car.
- Converge probabilities at a time that suits you.
