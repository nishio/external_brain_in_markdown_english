title: "It's easy to misinterpret them as playing the same game."
---

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1822961182376186238) People playing [[zero-sum]] games and people playing [[plus-sum]] games are playing different games, but since they are playing on the same platform, they are misled into thinking they are playing the same game. They are playing on the same platform, so they are misled into thinking they are playing the same game. The basic strategy is to first [[identify the person playing the same game]], then give to that person in the case of a plus-sum game, and take from that person in the case of a zero-sum game.


- [[zero-sum game]]
[[PLUS SUM GAME]]
