<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Where did I read that you can't trust intellectual production techniques unless you hear from people who are using them themselves to produce intellectually, search Scrapbox and let me know.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nihia/icon' alt='nihia.icon' height="19.5"/>The idea that "you can't trust anything about intellectual production techniques unless you hear from people who are using them to produce intellectually" is stated in the following Scrapbox page.
- 「 [[Intellectual production is not stoicism.]] 」
    - There is a difference between those who teach about intellectual production and those who actually do it, and when there is a discrepancy between "what people who actually do intellectual production are doing" and "what people who teach that this is the way to do intellectual production", which is more reliable? I think this is a good question to ask.
- 「 [[The quality of the intellectual production process is determined by the value of the intellectual product produced.]] 」
    - The value of the art of intellectual production is determined by the value of the resulting intellectual product, and the idea that "you have to make your own intellectual production art" is stated.

This content underscores the importance of the practitioner's experience with intellectual production techniques.
