- 1993 Soros Statement--NATO booklet, Toward a New World Order: The Future of NATO, November 1993.
    - [Full text of "Toward A New World Order: The Future of NATO"](https://archive.org/stream/toward-a-new-world-order/documents.pub_toward-a-new-world-order-by-george-soros_djvu.txt)
- The post-Cold War world has lost its old order and is headed toward "global disorder.
    - Soros pointed out that "a new framework is needed now that the bipolar structure has collapsed," and warned that traditional country-country diplomacy alone cannot control the turmoil.
- Analytical framework: (1) [[Theories of revolutionary change]] (2) [[Open society]] vs. [Closed society
        - Based on [[Karl Popper.]], "open society" is defined as a system with [[freedom]], [[tolerance]], and [[critical spirit]], and "closed society" is defined as an [[exclusive]], [[tribal]], and [[authoritarian]] system.
- Proposal for a "True Partnership for Peace
    - He argued that the existing NATO should be reconfigured as "security plus support for democratization," and that open societies should be fostered through economic inclusion of Eastern European and former Soviet Union countries.

> Democratization is inseparable from security, and peace in Europe will not last unless we build an open society.

Soros' concept of "open society
- philosophical origin
    - Democracy as an institution that enables regime change without violence" is at the core of Popper's "[[Democracy as]] an institution that enables regime change without violence" in "[[An open society and its]] enemies" (1945).
- Practices around 1993
    - 200 million to the International Science Foundation to address the hollowing out of scientific research (supporting more than 30,000 people in the former Soviet Union).
    - Relief teams were dispatched to restore infrastructure under siege in Sarajevo.
    - All of the above aimed to "[[create]] an environment in which citizens can become self-reliant immediately after the collapse of a closed society.
- institutional requirement
    - Power is bound by law ([[rule of law]])
    - [[Pluralistic civil society]] and [[independent media]]
    - Market economy, but with "[[investment in public goods]]" and "[[correction of market failures]]"
    - [[education that allows criticism]] and academia (e.g. Central European University)

The relationship between "open society" and democracy
- Purpose and Means
    - Soros does not position "democracy = optimal means" but rather "an indispensable institutional device for maintaining an open society.
    - Requirement of [[citizens' ability to criticize]] and [[minority protection]] as well as elections.
- risk perception
        - He warned that if [[majority rule]] polarization and [[market fundamentalism]] get out of control, it will lead to a closed society.
    - Hence the need for foundations and NGOs outside the democratic system to strike a balance.
    - Nodal with [security guarantee (e.g. military security, network security, etc.)
    - When democracies expand solidarity and open societies, the roots of military conflict ([[exclusionary nationalism]]) are curbed - this leads to the 1993 NATO proposal.

Implications for Today
- Maintain a "culture of continuous criticism" as well as institutions.
    - The Popper-Soros lineage calls for an attitude of "verification and disproof" even in the information space of the AI generation.
- Design a set of security, economic support, and [civil society support
    - In discussions on the Ukraine and Western Balkans assistance packages, the 1993 proposal for a "Comprehensive Partnership" is being reevaluated.
- Reinforcement of "intermediary groups" to control the outburst of the majority
    - The role of media literacy education, public interest foundations, and citizen platforms is key to countering populism in the age of social networking.

summary
- In 1993, in the post-Cold War vacuum, Soros presented his vision of an "open society" philosophy embodied in the three aspects of security, economy, and civil society.
- As Popper's theory shows, democracy is a rare mechanism that can change governments without shedding blood, but it is not enough to complete an open society.
- Only with the rule of law, the [[pluralistic public sphere]], and education and media to support criticism can democracy prevent a backslide into a closed society--this is the core of Soros' 1993 proposal.
