- Read [classic
    - [[Test of Time]]

> We should always take a certain short time for reading, and during that time we should peruse only the works of geniuses of incomparable excellence of spirit, that is, those born of all ages and peoples.

> The condition for reading a good book is not to read a bad book. For life is short, and time and strength are limited.

> Do not be too late and do not touch anything that a large number of readers devour every time they read it. For example, do not touch political pamphlets, religious pamphlets, novels, poems, etc., which cause a great commotion in the reading world, and which go from one edition to another as soon as they are published. Such publications have a lifespan of one year.


wide-ranging criticism
- >  A [[diligent]] person who spends a day [[wide (extensive) reading]] gradually loses the ability to think about things for himself.
- It's not good to read all the time and not think for yourself.
    - [[Reading a lot makes you stupid.]]

> The diligent person who spends almost an entire day reading a lot gradually loses the ability to think for himself.

> The more you read, the less of what you read remains in your psyche.

> Any important book should be read twice. This is because the second time, you will better understand the connections between the matters, and since you already know the conclusions, you will correctly understand the important beginnings of the matter. Moreover, the second time you read it, you will naturally read it in a different mood and get a different impression from the first time. In other words, we experience a subject as if we were looking at it in a different light.

About Contemplation
> A thinker needs a great deal of knowledge as material, and therefore must read a great deal. But his mind is so powerful that he is able to digest, assimilate, and merge all of it into his own system of thought. In other words, the mind is able to place its material under the control of a grand insight that constantly expands its vision but never loses its organic organization.

- [[intellitech]].

- The concept of "[[consider]]" is equivalent to "combine" in "[Rushing to output results in a degraded copy.
