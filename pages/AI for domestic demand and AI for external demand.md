AI for domestic demand and AI for external demand

- AI for internal demand is to satisfy a need within a company. For example, when there is a significant need within the company, as in the case of Daikin and Microsoft.
- AI for external demand is to satisfy needs outside the company. When domestic demand is insufficient, it is necessary to look for external demand; it is important to connect with companies that have demand, as in the case of the collaboration between PFN and Fanuc.
- The demand for the product needs to be uncovered itself, not clearly verbalized demand that comes first. Technical expertise is needed to convert "a sense of the problem" into "a problem that can be solved," but the "sense of the problem" itself is not clearly verbalized, so it does not circulate in the market.
- The "resources that are difficult to market because they are tightly coupled with the field" and "resources that are difficult to market because they are tightly coupled with the brains of experts" need to be combined by sending experts into the field.
