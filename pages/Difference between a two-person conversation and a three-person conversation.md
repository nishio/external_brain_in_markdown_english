I sensed a difference between the EXPERIENCE when "Mr. A and I" were talking and the EXPERIENCE when "Mr. A and Mr. B and I" were talking.

Mr. A said [[high context]].
- When we are talking together, I ask questions to make sure I understand the [[concept that is slightly floating around]] from the [[context]].
- When it's just the three of us, if Mr. A and Mr. B are talking and Mr. B doesn't seem to be catching on, I'll insert the foundation if I can.

This experience reminded me of Mr. C, with whom I often do [[interpretation (i.e. oral translation)]].
- We have quite a bit in common [[side]] with Mr. A.
    - [[People have diverse aspects.]] I'm comparing them carefully because it's not a good idea to summarize only the similarities I just saw from [People have diverse aspects.
    - [[Being connected does not imply zero distance]].
