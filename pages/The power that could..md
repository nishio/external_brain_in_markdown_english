title: "The power that could."

The power of [will be able to
- [[power to do maybe]].
    - [[Maybe I can.]]

The power to think that since A1 tried in the past resulted in B1, we can probably do A2 and make it B2, even though we haven't tried it.

For example, regarding "AI writing practical programs".
- You will be able to do it in the near future!"
- "It may be difficult for the time being."
- Neither opinion is informative because it's just a low-resolution blurry perception with emotional bias riding on it, positive or negative.

- By accumulating a certain amount of information as actual experience, such as "A1 became B1, A2, which was too large, did not become B2, which part did not work," abstraction occurs in the brain and a [[future prediction model]] is created.
- That future prediction model will allow us to predict to some extent what the outcome will be for the A3s that we have not yet done.
    - A3 is difficult as it is, but if you take out a portion of A4, I think you can do it easily."
    - You'll be able to make these decisions.
