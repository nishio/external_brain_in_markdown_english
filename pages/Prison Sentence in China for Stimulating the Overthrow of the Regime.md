>
>  At a panel attended by the chairman of the committee promoting the introduction of surveillance cameras and facial recognition for the Paris Olympics and a professor from the University of Paris II, in the context of the need for adequate human rights guarantees and regulations, a statement was made something like, "If we are not careful, we will end up like China, haha".
>
>  During the Q&A session, a professor from the University of Macau, China, spoke up.
>
>  "China," I heard the word three times, but even in China there are laws and regulations regarding the use of surveillance video footage, and it must only be used for criminal investigations. In Paris, you have to watch your bag on the subway, but in China, if you are snatched, you don't have to worry about it, because they can identify the culprit on the surveillance cameras. We welcome you all in China."

>  The audience applauded, and the Paris II professor commented, "There were some statements that lacked details.
>
>  It is easy to forget that when you speak in public, you must do so with the assumption that others are listening.

However, since it is a country where "it is a crime if a feminist gathers at home" (link), it is no good at all if it is "used only for criminal investigation".
