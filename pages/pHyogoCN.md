Just a thought, but is it possible to extract and analyze [[Community Notes]] about Hyogo Prefecture?
I wonder if Tech can do anything to improve the current situation where some people think the events in Hyogo Prefecture are a destruction of democracy and others think it is a restoration of democracy (I can't think of anything in particular...bonny).
â†’I think the parallel lines this time may be a difference of opinion on "what is fact". Hypothesis

Thank you very much!
I would like to see it too.
However, please give me a little more time, as I feel that the House of Representatives election is finally about to be taken down due to the limitations of X's API.
I am thinking that once we have a CN for the election period or the week leading up to the vote, we can extract keywords from that CN.

I too am curious about the relationship between the results and the use of social networking sites.

Maybe you could do [[Talk to the City]] only for the CN part.
