1. organize the definitions and measurements of IND and COL, and point out the complexity of these concepts.
2. a meta-analysis of international comparisons to test the common assumption that Americans have higher IND and lower COL than other countries.
3. a meta-analysis of racial comparisons within the U.S. is also being conducted.
4. reviews the impact of IND and COL on psychological processes such as self-concept, well-being, belonging style, and relationships.
5. main findings
    - - Americans tend to have higher IND and lower COL than many countries, but the effect sizes are small and differ little from European and English-speaking countries.
    - - There are also differences among Asian countries, with Chinese descent having a larger gap with the U.S. than with Japan or Korea.
    - - Within the U.S., African Americans had the highest IND, and only Asian Americans had a lower IND and higher COL than their European counterparts.
6. points out problems with the way IND and COL are measured and defined, and proposes a simpler, clearer definition.
7. future research questions include the use of diverse samples and a more detailed elucidation of the IND and COL influence process.

This study provides an important analysis that prompts a reconsideration of conventional assumptions about INDs and COLs.
