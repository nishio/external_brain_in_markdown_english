title: "Anger is infectious."

from  [[Diary 2023-07-15]]
- [[anger]] is [[infection]].
- I usually think "[[Anger is a form of self-pity]]" and at best I am restrained, at worst my emotions are flat.
- I observed the young man's anger and he was [[emotionally activated]] for a while.
    - It's like "[[resonance]]" to "[[righteous indignation]]."
- There is an "expectation [[of others]] that if they do more [[properly]], they can make the world a better place."
    - Gap between ideal and reality] is created because expectations are ideal and others do not meet those expectations in reality
        - [[You're losing time when you expect others to do the same.]]
- I used to think that I didn't understand the expression that older people often use to describe how they "suck the lifeblood [[longevity]] out of young people," but now I understand it a little better.
        - The [[power of emotion]] in the person has been reduced by [[adding to one's years]].
    - Therefore, when [[one's heart is moved]] by [[the emotion of others]], it becomes [[Rare resources]].
    - After all, you're [[living someone else's life]].
    - However, if we ignore personalities and look at it as a system, if the amount of [[public output]] increases by putting in the missing [[resource of emotion]], I think that is a good thing.
        - We have to make a distinction between bloodletting for [[personal satisfaction]] and bloodletting for [[public interest (e.g., public good)]].

[[Elixir]].
- [[countermeasures against aging]]
