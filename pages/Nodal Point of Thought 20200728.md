How can we communicate when we have different meanings of words?
- [[joint warning]] ？
It's possible you're mistaken in thinking you can do it.
- Are we all acting like we know what we're talking about when we don't?
- You don't understand that you don't understand itself.
    - There is no reason to believe that you can know whether you know or not.
    - The public cannot know if you know or not.
    - Acting on the assumption that you don't know what you're doing is high cost, so you usually act on the assumption that you do know what you're doing.

Spiral encoding of number concepts
- Just as the spiral was a natural representation of the concept of number, there must be a natural representation (different from a vector) for the concept of meaning
        - [[Learning Addition]]
    - What is Nature?
        - Low computational load
            - What is an operation on meaning?
                - For example, inversion of meaning
                - Natural units of meaning do not have a one-to-one correspondence with words
                    - If an operation is frequently used, it is more efficient to create a word that describes the operation itself than to create a new word.
                    - Not X" "not X
                    - Auxiliary verbs and case particles
                    - [[semantic identity]]
                    - [[Mapping words to sets of individuals is a metaphor for containers]]
    - [[finite and recursive]]

- [[Need to weight the graph of knowledge]]
- [[Mapping layers of meaning]]

chain of suspicion
A: An approach that builds on top of the axioms

usefulness
realization
B: Digging approach

C: An approach that seeks to understand through observation

Both B and C are the same in that [Digging deeper with questions
- Different methods of verification?
- The method of verification is the same as the composition, but different in the weight that humans place on it.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/f3bf690751ce25b6290867508fdf0d5f/thumb/1000)
    - Real profit by output to the world
        - Crying and screaming to get toys, etc.
        - Start to improve the output with the input as to whether the actual benefit is obtained or not.
        - It's a cycle after the fact.
    - Gaining understanding with input from around the world
        - This is the approach of trying to understand by observation
        - Begins manipulation of the world in an attempt to gain new input
            - experiment
            - [Understanding is just a hypothesis, and when you think you understand something, it doesn't mean it's right.
            - Need to output and verify
            - This idea is not self-evident.
            - Human civilization acquired it rather late.
            - Even Aristotle believed the false understanding that "heavy things fall faster" without verifying it.
        - It's a cycle after the fact.

    - The right is easier to understand because the goal is to increase the real benefit.
    - Left?
        - Seeing what you want to see is the real benefit
        - Understanding what you want to understand is the real benefit.
        - Here's the problem, even if you don't understand correctly, you are satisfied with the feeling of "understanding".
