Team Mirai Various Data

Talking Manifesto: 8559 proposals, 192 taken in
- (FYI: on GitHub at the time of the gubernatorial election, there were 104 proposals, 85 taken in, so an increase of 1~2 orders of magnitude)

Adopted Policy Proposals
- A. Direct merge: 192
    - A-1. Merge on policy out of: 159
    - A-2. of which system-related: 33
- close with B.thankyou: 95
    - In cases where there are multiple related proposals and the policy team merges them with reference to each other, it is not clear whether or not they have been merged with reference to each other, so a "thankyou" label is added to the label.
- Of the proposals for the policy, 159 were directly merged, including 95 proposals that were referenced, so 159 + 95 = 254 is a good number
    - I'd like to express this for the general public like "254 suggestions for improvement were used to improve the manifesto" because it's hard to convey the "merge" in this case!
    - Bottom line, we were able to adopt about three times as many proposals as we did during the gubernatorial campaign.

People gathered at the microphone end of the day
- 10,000 people, according to the official announcement by the police
- I have a suspicion that it was combined with the Japanese Conservative Party that was next door.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3/icon' alt='o3.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Team Mirai Number of votes
    - 1,517,890 votes
- Divide value of the 7th seat of the Constituent Assembly (the value that determined the 50th seat)
    - 7,397,467 ÷ 7 ＝ 1,056,781
    - 50th largest quotient in DʼHondt method
- Team Mirai Current value of the second seat 1,517,890 ÷ 2 = 758,945 Divide value to get the second seat
- The condition to win the second seat is (number of votes) ÷ 2 > 1,056,781
- Therefore, the additional number of votes x required is
    - $​(1517890 + x) / 2 > 1056781$
    - $x = 595672$
- Conclusion.
    - With about 600,000 additional votes (about 596,000 to be exact), Team Mirai would have won a second seat for proportional representation.
    - An increase of approximately 39.2% was required.
- *The calculation is a simple DʼHondt simulation using the finalized vote count. The threshold may change by a few thousand votes due to slight movements of votes or fluctuations in the vote counts of other parties, but generally "just under 600,000 more votes" is a rough estimate.
