title: 'The "end of the hierarchy" is nonsense.'

- [[What will govern tomorrow]]  p.11
> Today we hear a lot of "end of the hierarchy". This is nonsense. Every organization needs a boss as the highest authority. Every organization needs someone who makes final decisions and has followers. In the event of a total crisis, which every organization will encounter sooner or later, the fate of the organization will depend on the existence of a clear mandate.
>  When a ship is about to sink, the captain does not hold a meeting. He gives orders. To save the ship, everyone obeys that order. Opinion and participation are irrelevant. In a crisis, hierarchy and obedience are the lifeline.
>  Moreover, the same organization sometimes needs a discussion, sometimes a team.

In other words, top-down leadership is essential in [[Contingency Management]].
The organizational structure should change according to the situation, and since there will surely be an emergency situation someday when there is no time to discuss what kind of organizational structure is best, it is necessary to have predetermined individuals to whom decisions in such an emergency situation will be centralized.
