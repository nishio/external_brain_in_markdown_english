[[How I joined the Yasuno team]]

Late May 2024, a turbulent time.
- I became involved in [[Takahiro Yasuno]]'s campaign when he contacted me (5/13) to say that he had read the Japanese translation of [[Plurality Books]] that Nishio had published and found it helpful.
    - [/plurality-japanese](https://scrapbox.io/plurality-japanese).
- I introduced Mr. Yasuno to [[Haruyuki Seki]] on 5/13 and we had a meeting on 5/23 and exchanged a lot of information.
        - [[Nodal point of thought 2024-05-23]] #Governorship x Digital Democracy
- In the chat that followed, Seki-san brought up the subject of [[Talk to the City]], and Yasuno-san said, "Sounds really interesting.
    - I knew about Talk to the City from [[Gisele Chou]], but when I saw [[tkgshn]] trying it out, I left it alone and thought "that looks like a pain in the ass!
        - [/tkgshn/Talk to the City](https://scrapbox.io/tkgshn/Talk to the City)
        - [/tkgshn/report on Taiwan's same-sex marriage debate at Talk to the City](https://scrapbox.io/tkgshn/report on Taiwan's same-sex marriage debate at Talk to the City).
        - This was one of two types of Talk to the City ([[Talk to the City Turbo]]).
- Nishio showed [[Opinion cluster analysis of 110,000 people]] at this time
    - Polis-like analysis of 110,000 anonymous data provided by [[JAPAN CHOICE]].
    - Yasuno's comment
        - 'If you had some natural language data collected during the campaign, could you try it out?'
        - "I'd like to see the AI pub-commentary that got the ball rolling as a personal interest, the one that collected about 20,000 comments."
    - After explaining that "Polis is input by opinion vectors," I'm starting to wonder how Talk to the City does its clustering of natural sentences.
        - After doing some research, I wanted to give it a try and decided to give it a try with the AI pubic
            - This is [[Talk to the City Scatter]].
            - Mr. Seki: "It would normally be useful to organize on the administrative side."
- I tried Talk to the City by [[AI PubCom]] (5/30).
        - [[TTTC: Public Comments on AI and Copyright]]
- Mr. Seki saw it and decided to introduce it in the next day's [[Updating Society and Democracy through Civic Tech]] on 5/31.
    - I told him he could use any image in Scrapbox, and he laughed when he saw my hand-drawn picture of [[broad listening]] being used.
    - This picture was later even used in Yasuno's manifesto and became a famous diagram.
        - Of course, both have given permission.
        - I thought people would rather use it, so I decided to go with a CC0 license around here.
    - Finally, [[Broad listening in practice]] even jokingly referred to me as a super designer. w
    - It was later called [[Broad Listening "That Figure"]] and aired on television and other media.
