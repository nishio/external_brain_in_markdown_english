title: "noblesse oblige"

[https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ノブレス](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ノブレス) obrige

- I wrote noblesse oblige in [[Since I have received charity from the world, I should also give charity to the world]],
By the way, after I wrote it, I thought that there is a lame way to call yourself noble and a lame way to say that you are [[obligation]], which makes it sound like you don't really want to do it, but you have no choice.

People who feel that gravity is natural do not feel "obligated to be restrained in their vertical movement by weight on the ground."
