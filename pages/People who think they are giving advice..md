title: "People who think they are giving advice."

> [aoringogreen](https://twitter.com/aoringogreen/status/1769983399622856811) I just found out something interesting.
>  People who say a lot of negative words or are stingy with others, their self-image is not so much in denial, but their image of themselves denying others is neatly replaced with "I am a wise person who gives advice".

> [sakusakumocchin](https://twitter.com/sakusakumocchin/status/1770252912465489944) A long time ago, after a chat with a few relatives, my mother said, "I'm telling you a funny story and no one wants to listen!" She became angry. I said, "Because the whole time you were talking, you were just bad-mouthing people you know. The first thing you did was talk about..., and the next thing was..., and the next thing was..." When I pointed this out, she replied, "...what? You were talking about that? Me!" And he started to get upset.
> [sakusakumocchin](https://twitter.com/sakusakumocchin/status/1770252914118053936) My mother's self-image seemed to be "me telling little funny stories about everyday life. But she seemed to remember what I explained to her, and for a while she couldn't seem to wrap her head around the difference between her self-image and what I actually told her.
>  When I think back on my mother's words and actions from the past, I think she may have always been like that... difficult...

> I'm afraid there are some people who don't even realize they are on the "other side" of the story. I'm afraid there are a few people who don't realize that they are also on the "other side", and it's like a rakugo ghost story.

- In some cases, people who use a lot of negative language or point out only the shortcomings of others think they are giving constructive [[advice]]. However, from a third party's point of view, it may appear that they are only speaking negatively.
- In sakusakumocchin's example, the mother thought she was telling interesting everyday stories, but did not realize that in reality she was only talking bad about acquaintances. She is depicted as confused when confronted with the gap between her self-image and her actual words and actions.
- And as warunathubi pointed out, some people think they are making a point from a sensible standpoint while sharing the complaints and negative episodes of others. It is ironic that they are unaware that they could be in the same position.
