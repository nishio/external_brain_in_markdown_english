Various interpretations by various people

> [ikedanob](https://x.com/ikedanob/status/1850567024587706734) The fall of Komeito's representative shows that the issue in the upcoming election was not just a slush fund issue, but a revolt against [[silver democracy]]. This is the first step in a long battle.
> [ikedanob](https://x.com/ikedanob/status/1850571647180480926) Komeito is a cancer in Japanese politics that has prolonged the life of the expired LDP government. Ichiro Ozawa attached it to the LDP through the LDP-LPP coalition and has been a parasite on the LDP's elderly interests. Removing this cancer is the first step toward reform.

> [shinjukuacc](https://x.com/shinjukuacc/status/1850564078613454941) It is important that this perception is shared by more and more people. Because we now know that the most corrupt power in Japan is the media.
>  However, despite the all-out negative campaign against the Liberal Democratic Party, the Liberal Democratic Party remained the first party. And, ironically, the media will accelerate its decline in the future.
>  >BCAA20000: This election coverage is really too much.
>  Everywhere I look it's terrible.
>  I feel a strong will to incite the people by labeling them and continue to incite them in an interesting way even after they are elected.
>  This approach is a real problem.

> [hokusyu1982](https://x.com/hokusyu1982/status/1849062190449614969) Hatred of the elderly is used as an alternative to hatred of race and ethnicity. It is so unusual that there is no perspective that the elderly are our future selves. There is no inherent interest group that is the current generation to begin with. Many young people have been duped by rhetoric into supporting the wealthy's preferential treatment of tax cuts.
>  >[hokusyu1982](https://x.com/hokusyu1982/status/1849062190449614969) The NDP is not a workers' party. You don't have any class perspective at all, that there are workers among the elderly. Rather, in order to distract from class issues, the "mob" (Arendt) and the bourgeoisie have allied themselves with the bourgeoisie to incite hatred against the elderly as a clear enemy, and to involve the middle class who fear their downfall, many times in history.
> [hokusyu1982](https://x.com/hokusyu1982/status/1849956093537157544) The fact that people are influenced by business influencers who have money and vote for political parties that further widen the economic gap is a problem of our time, similar to the picture of YouTubers/VTubers who earn hundreds of thousands or millions in one day and young people who have no money to spend on them. This is similar to the situation of YouTubers and VTubers who earn hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars in a day and young people who have no money to spend on them, and I think this is a contemporary problem. This is a contemporary problem.

> [pakase2020](https://x.com/pakase2020/status/1850352510067933694) By the time we become elderly, we will not receive the same welfare as we do now, but they try to deceive us with words like "the elderly are our future selves" and round us up.
>  Many young people have been duped by rhetoric and forced into the elderly preferential treatment of welfare.
> [aihao_mizugoro](https://x.com/aihao_mizugoro/status/1850565031504777468) I make choices because I believe that having a lighter burden now is more important than having less welfare in the future, but to be told this I really hate it!


> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1850695191784735065) This election tends to feature the loss of the autocratic majority, but I would also like to focus on the progress of minority parties that are pro-network. National Democratic Party of Japan, Reiwa, Sangen, Japan Conservative Party, etc. This was probably the first election in which the Internet had a significant impact on a national election. And this is not a temporary trend, etc., but one that will continue to do so at a high rate in the future.
> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1850697095059292491) How society should deal with this new speech space will be questioned. social networking sites are an opportunity to pick up pluralistic values but at the same time it also engenders division. Mechanisms and algorithms will be needed for calm and effective collective decision-making in the midst of the buzz frenzy. But no one has explored that yet.
> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1850700392658862429) I am also concerned about whether Nagatacho's ability to handle decision-making will be able to keep up if, instead of having a stable ruling party that takes a majority as it did this time, we have a swarm of majority parties. I am also concerned about this. If things go well, we will have a "right-or-wrong" Diet, but if things go badly, nothing will be decided.
> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1850700672339169708) It is usually insanely difficult for a group of a few hundred people to coordinate on a difficult issue. Humans have a limit to their cognitive abilities. How far can Nagata-cho's information processing capacity be raised?

> [yamamoto1369](https://x.com/yamamoto1369/status/1850516830042874165) Osaka has a strong Restoration party and every time Osaka residents are made to look like fools.
>  As a person who actually lives here, I'm not so swayed because I've experienced Osaka getting better.
>  No matter what they say, there is only Restoration. We can't go back to the days of the LDP.
>  From our point of view, it is unusual that Kanto is the one where Rikken is on the rise.
>  If the people don't get it, the people are the only ones who can.

> [cactus_airfoil](https://x.com/cactus_airfoil/status/1850597895206305846) For reference.
>  ![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ga6k-iOa8AAl0Q5?format=jpg&name=medium#.png)

> [yoppymodel](https://x.com/yoppymodel/status/1850551057535185332) I've been hearing more and more discourse like "Osaka people who let the Restoration win are idiots" again...
>  Why is the Restoration Association so strong in Osaka (Kansai)?
> [yoppymodel](https://x.com/yoppymodel/status/1850554403369218398) By the way, I wrote this last year, but the Dorogawa hot springs I mentioned at the end of this article are not "reviving in popularity" but are now so popular that it is hard to make reservations at hotels. It's now so popular that it's hard to get a reservation at a lodge, or too many tourists come and say, "There's not enough parking space. It is now so popular that it is hard to make a reservation at a hotel, and so many tourists are coming that there are not enough parking spaces.

- > [@takashikiso](https://x.com/takashikiso/status/1850638662046003386): 215 for the LDP and 148 for the RPP against a 233 majority. The LDP can only win a majority if they team up with either the KMT or the Ishin.
- > While dividing the elderly vote by conservative/innovative ideology, a centrist party with an emphasis on the working-age population will capture the casting vote. The ideal "three-way split under the sun" for the Silver Democratic era has been established.

- > [@C9SDV2hLnx67990](https://x.com/C9SDV2hLnx67990/status/1850703181489303596): I fear that the politics of the future will be neither a one-party dominant party system nor a two-party system, but "an unstable popular government in which the major parties run the government in the face of the populist parties. The future of politics is neither a one-party system nor a two-party system.
- > The current trend of "the party that cries [[tax cuts]] is righteous" is honestly quite scary.
- This tweet is interesting because it points out the same structure, but the way it is perceived is the exact opposite.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/blu3mo/icon' alt='/villagepump/blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I've been collecting those things, so that helps.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I'm glad to see material like "a series of pictures of two people saying different things" and "false dichotomies" springing up in the natural way they do.
