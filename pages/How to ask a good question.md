title: "How to ask a good question"

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1687658008388800512?s=20): a case study of useful information gathered by way of a good [[question]].

- > [nonNoise](https://twitter.com/nonNoise/status/1687434594860326912/photo/1) I'm not familiar with this field, but I wonder if the current trend is to use static const instead of writing in Define (I've seen it a few times I've seen it, but I'm not sure.)

    - > [felis_silv](https://twitter.com/felis_silv/status/1687472727710740480) I'm assuming that this has indentation on the left side, like in a class? Unlike define, the advantage is that it can be organized and stored in the namespace. However, this may unnecessarily eat up space in memory, so constexpr is smarter in this day and age.
        - > [nonNoise](https://twitter.com/nonNoise/status/1687611744821391360) Oh! That might be it! Indeed! (Okay, namespace awareness, or waterfall sweat)

    - > [jo7ueb](https://twitter.com/jo7ueb/status/1687509127181037568) I think it is more convenient to leave the type and symbol information as opposed to replacing it in the preprocessor!
        - > [nonNoise](https://twitter.com/nonNoise/status/1687611241873977347) I'm starting to see the goodness in it! (but there are a lot of words to write, ugh)

    - > [ueshita](https://twitter.com/ueshita/status/1687461831181565952) static inline constexpr is all the rage these days!
        - > [nonNoise](https://twitter.com/nonNoise/status/1687612397509586945) I'm of the school of thought that even JAVA has been reduced, so why not reduce the number of declarations that are the same every time (it's hard to remember how to spell!) I understand that things are slowly evolving here!

    - > [take_cheeze](https://twitter.com/take_cheeze/status/1687608107814531075) I think it would be useful to have a type that allows bit lengths and such.
        - > [nonNoise](https://twitter.com/nonNoise/status/1687610908535836672) If you think about it, they could optimize the moot data too w

    - > [diysmartmatter](https://twitter.com/diysmartmatter/status/1687643133717487616) I think it's because it also tells the type when used as an argument, which eliminates ambiguity when using overloaded functions (functions with the same name but different arguments). I think this is because it eliminates ambiguity when using overloaded functions (functions with the same name but different arguments) and also serves as an error check.
        - > [nonNoise](https://twitter.com/nonNoise/status/1687643524316205056) I was surprised to find that the meaning is quite deep (I thought I had a lot of words and didn't want to write them down.)


> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1687658319731998720?s=20): It's interesting because just a few minutes ago a "bad write-up" caused a "I thought about giving feedback? I was just about to give it some feedback, but decided not to because it's a pain in the ass.
- > [nonNoise](https://twitter.com/nonNoise/status/1687660860867788800) I can't recommend it because if you make a mistake, you'll get burned. waterfall sweat tears w
    - > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1687663175918047233) I thought you were good at drawing a line of defense in advance with "I'm not familiar with this" and quickly changing course after seeing the reply. I'll learn from you.

# bad questioning
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The following questions are not very good. Explain in abstract form without quoting the original text what part is not good. <Example of a bad question
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>We see the following problems with this question.
- Too long: The questions are so long and incorporate multiple ideas, assumptions, and perspectives that they are difficult for the reader to understand. In particular, the logic that leads from one theme to the next is not always clear, and the reader may have difficulty following the content.
- Biases and Misunderstandings: The questioner seems to have a bias against some industries, companies, or certain technologies or products. They may have an inadequate understanding of them or be based on outdated information. This tilts the question from one seeking objective information to one sharing personal views.
- Overall misconception: The questioner seems to have a misconception about software engineering and the industry as a whole in which it exists. They may not fully understand the current state of the industry trends, product selection criteria, and technical constraints.
- Excessively negative tone: The question is written in a negative tone, which may cause the reader to become defensive. Such a tone can also cause it to be unclear whether the questioner is really seeking information or is trying to emphasize his/her own point of view.
To remedy these problems, the questioner should keep questions short, focus on a single topic, and ask in an objective and open manner. It also helps to reconfirm existing knowledge and understanding before seeking information.

> Unclear whether the questioner is really seeking information or is trying to emphasize his/her own point of view.
- Oh I see, so this is in the guise of a "question", but it's actually "listen to me" and "you're all idiots".
- You lost motivation to think about pointing out a technical fact because you sensed that I subconsciously felt that the questioner wasn't really asking for information.
