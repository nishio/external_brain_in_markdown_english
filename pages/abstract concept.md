title: "abstract concept"
---

- Q: Are A and B compatible? I've looked them up, but I'm not sure, some say they are compatible, some say they are not.
    - A: I think the reason there are mixed claims of compatibility and lack of compatibility is that people have different ideas of what they mean by "compatibility".
    - So instead of "Is it compatible or not?", we should be more specific: "Can we do ~ or not? Can't we?" I think it would be better to ask the question, "Can we do it?
