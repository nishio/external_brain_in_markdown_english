title: "abstract concept"
---

- I've looked up A and B. I'm not sure if they are interchangeable or not. I've looked them up, but I'm not sure, with some stating they are compatible and others stating they are not."
    - I think the reason there are mixed claims of compatibility and incompatibility is that people have different ideas of what they mean by "compatibility".
    - So instead of "Is it compatible or not?", we should be more specific: "Can we do ~ or not? Can't we?" I think it would be better to ask the question, "Can we do it?

    - [[Too abstract.]]
    - [[abstraction]]
    - [[lower the level of abstraction]]
    - [[embodiment]]
    - [Same meaning as [[abstract concept]].
