<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>Participatory budgeting (PB) is a form of citizen participation in which local governments and others allocate public funds to projects proposed and voted on by residents, and it is important to prioritize the voices of low-income people and people of color, who have historically been excluded from PB.

Best practices for making PB inclusive include
1. sufficient funds for PB projects and activity plans
2. utilize funding sources other than capital projects
3. prioritize the participation of low-income populations, people of color, and historically excluded populations
4. pay for participants' time
5. provide many options for discussion and voting
6. provide educational opportunities on the City's budget and priorities with PB
7. follow up on decisions and next steps after voting
8. track and monitor outreach and inclusiveness goals
9. establish legislation for PB continuity

While PB has the potential to increase citizen participation, it is not a substitute for broader outreach and equity efforts. With careful planning and intensive outreach, PB can bring more voices to municipal decision-making.
