title: "Add the ability to post facts with sources in Polis"

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1661281219118612482) Just a thought, but maybe we could add a feature to [[Polis]] where you can post a [[fact]] with the source, and then we can vote for or against "this is a fact that is relevant to the topic". I think it would be a good idea.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1661281436865896450) According to the "Survey on Problematic Behavior and Truancy" released by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, the number of truant students who were absent from school for 30 days or more in fiscal 2021 at elementary and junior high schools nationwide increased by 40,000 (24.9%) from the previous year to 244,940, a record high. The number of truants increased by 48,813 (24.9%) from the previous year to 244,940, the highest number ever recorded. This is the ninth consecutive year of increase in truancy, and compared to 10 years ago, elementary school students are 3.6 times more likely to be absent from school

This is the ninth consecutive year of increase in truancy, with elementary school students and junior high school students increasing 3.6 times and 1.7 times, respectively, compared to 10 years ago.
