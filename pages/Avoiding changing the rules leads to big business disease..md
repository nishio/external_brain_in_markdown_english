    - In terms of population, probably more people are resistant to changing the rules.
    - If you're doing normal recruiting, you're going to have more people obeying the rules.
- When a person who is obedient to the rules and resistant to change becomes the boss of the type of person who changes the rules, he resists the [[reform]] that his subordinates try to cause.
- If the obedient and transformational types are promoted with equal probability, the overall result will fall on the obedient side.
