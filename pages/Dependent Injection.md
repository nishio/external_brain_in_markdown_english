title: "Dependent Injection"
---

- I thought the term [[Dependent Injection]] didn't sit well, but this interpretation is refreshing.
> The translation of "dependency" (the object that the object to be injected uses) as a translation of "dependencies" (the object that the object to be injected uses) has become established, mistranslated into the dictionary's first sense of "dependence".
