title: "Handwritten and recorded"
---

    - Record the process of [handwritten
- It would be nice if this could be combined with [Voice Recording
    - If this voice is [[transcribed]] and subject to [[search (e.g. for someone using a search engine)]], it can compensate for [[Handwritten search difficulties]].
