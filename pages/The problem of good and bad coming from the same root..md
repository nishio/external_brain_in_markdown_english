title: "The problem of good and bad coming from the same root."

- From the same root X comes good one A and bad one B.
- At this point, if you point out the bad ones and fix them fundamentally, even the good ones are gone.
- If you don't solve the problem fundamentally, pointing it out will only increase friction and be futile.

No one has an incentive to give feedback even if they notice the harm of B, especially if the benefit of A is significant by those around them
- I feel like there are a number of people with this kind of composition.
