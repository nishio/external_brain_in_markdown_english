- I think in the end this is a [[definition of axis]] issue.
- If you measure on the exact same axis as [[axis]] used for [[cluster disconnection]], they should be separated, and if you measure on a different axis, they will be mixed.
- The following chart is unclear on the definition of "academic achievement"

> [ProfMasuda](https://x.com/ProfMasuda/status/1820286402044858873) Contrary to the feelings of many people, the relationship between the deviation score ranking of a university and the academic ability of the students enrolled in that university is not clear, even in universities with a high deviation score ranking. Contrary to many people's beliefs, even universities at the top of the deviation score ranking are not at the bottom, and there are usually students with high academic ability at universities at the bottom of the deviation score ranking, which are ridiculed as "F-rank" by some unfortunate people who only rely on their university backgrounds.

Even if comprehensive selection is possible, things like sports recommendations and one-talent entrance examinations of the past will not be allowed. I think that is a good idea.

We know that there are people who cannot think scientifically because they do not have sufficient knowledge of physics and chemistry, which they should have acquired by high school.
