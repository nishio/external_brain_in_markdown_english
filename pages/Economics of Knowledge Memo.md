- The same is true for [[knowledge]] and information, but the [[constraints]] on [[exchange]] and distribution are a little different.
- The value of what you have created can only be known [[after the fact]] after you have created it.
- While the dimension of the search space is small, it was reasonable to run in one direction to reach the edge and improve from there because the unexplored area is far from the origin, but it becomes less reasonable as the dimension of the search space increases.
- The inability to intuitively understand human-type dimensional space ([[curse of the dimension]]) has a fundamental impact.
- In the early days of capitalism, there was a cycle of "use capital to invest in production equipment in factories, and that equipment earns capital," but as far as [[the knowledge industry]] is concerned, the production equipment is human.
