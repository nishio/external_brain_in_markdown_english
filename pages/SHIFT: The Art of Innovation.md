    - [[Shuji Hamaguchi]]
- [Design Thinking Beyond "Design Thinking" DIAMOND Harvard Business Review Article](https://amzn.to/2zQY2xx), also included.

The title "SHIFT" refers to the classification of change in companies into [[Sequential changes]] (improvement) and discontinuous change (transformation), with SHIFT and JUMP as discontinuous change.
I think the "continuous/discontinuous" metaphor is broken, but... well, if we ignore the inconsistent language, it's "There are other ways to change than JUMP. A book about that"?

The biggest key to SHIFT is "reshaping cognition.
- Internal marketing (internal marketing) is necessary before marketing in the market (external marketing)

This book is a methodology for innovation, not for individuals or ventures, but for companies with existing businesses that are profitable.
- Assuming the scale at which internal marketing is needed and the existence of bias due to existing business.
