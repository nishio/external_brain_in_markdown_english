title: "Not in the dictionary sense, of course."
---

Suppose a book devotes one section to a word X and explains
- The meaning to which this word X refers is, of course, not the [[dictionary meaning]] of X
- Because if you want to refer to the dictionary meaning of X, just cite the entry for X in the dictionary.
- The observed fact that the author devotes paper and effort to explain the meaning of X strongly suggests that the meaning to which X refers is not the dictionary meaning of X

I thought about titling it "Naturally [[non-parallel symbol]]," but I thought this would be easier to understand.

concrete example
- [[COMPREHENSION]], the author himself uses it with "UNDERSTAND", so it should not be translated as "understanding" in an English-Japanese dictionary.
    - This is why we have chosen to express the special meaning of the word in English capitalization without translation
    - [[conviviality]], the author himself writes in the preface, "not in the dictionary sense."
