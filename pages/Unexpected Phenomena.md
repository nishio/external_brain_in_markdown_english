    - The "A beats B" relationship is not transitive.
:

```
A = (0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4),
B = (3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3),
C = (2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 6),
D = (1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5).
```

    - Unlike the calculation of expected value, the calculation of "probability of winning" involves a nonlinear function that says "win small, lose big, win/lose once", which can be used to create a die with the same expected value but with a higher probability of winning.
- The probability of winning a gacha with probability 1/N drawn N times is rather low.
- In backgammon, throw two dice or throw one and go twice as far, and the latter will finish first.
    - [[Deviation from the mean and sample size]]
    - Low incidence in rural areas, but also high incidence in rural areas
- Uniform random numbers added together approach a normal distribution
    - [/prog-exercises/generate normal distribution](https://scrapbox.io/prog-exercises/generate normal distribution).
    - The public doesn't seem to understand the "shape of the distribution," as evidenced by the "random number cock" response.
    - How to experience it? → [[A game to get under the skin of probabilistic events]].
- Repeated seemingly equal transactions create a gap between the rich and the poor.
        - [[Not a natural occurrence of disparity.]]
    - [[Identifying things that are not equal and cannot be identified by increasing difference#5a56c7bcaff09e00000cb8d0]]
- Random distributions do not look random.
        - [[Distribution of random points]]
    - What humans naively imagine as a random distribution is more uniform than a truly random distribution
    - Because what humans usually observe, such as the distribution of trees in the mountains, is not a truly random distribution, but a homogenized distribution due to the effect of "too close together and they exclude each other".
