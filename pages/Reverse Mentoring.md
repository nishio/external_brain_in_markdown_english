> This was the introduction of the Reverse Mentorship Program. This was from the people who were occupying Parliament at the time, and when the ministers wanted to learn how to do their jobs, they were able to partner with them. The Reverse Mentors are all under the age of 35, though.
>
>  So the older ministers taught the reverse mentors how politics works in society, and the younger reverse mentors taught the ministers about private hacker initiatives. It was that kind of partnership.
>
>  I was a reverse mentor of [[Jaclyn Tsai]] ([[Jaclyn Tsai]]). She was previously at IBM Asia and was a minister in the Ma Ying-jeou administration at the time, back in late 2014.
>
>  So the young people who took the new direction were hired as Reverse Mentors. I am now 39 years old and of course still working with the Reverse Mentors.
