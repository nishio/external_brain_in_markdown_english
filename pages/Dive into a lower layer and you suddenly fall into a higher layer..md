The minuscule and the maxuscule are connected, and when you get to a certain point, it suddenly reverses.

This creates dependence on [[continuity]] and [[compatibility]], as changes in the lower layers may unintentionally cause catastrophic effects on the upper layers. As a result, it becomes difficult to change the lower layers. creat (2) still has no e

When you become responsible for "maintaining" the lower tier, you will encounter situations where you have to make changes to the lower tier, and you will have to face these problems. You have to face the real demands of the people in the upper layer, or negotiate and get them to give up. The layers of the story jump off the page.

However, software engineering with such a long time horizon has not been done systematically, so it tends to be a craftsman's art.
