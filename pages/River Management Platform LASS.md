> English Description:
>  Welcome to use english in the group. Taiwanese are very friendly for the foreign.
>  Why we do this? What is our dream?
>  We like to see the sensors data on the map. Many sensors, in a global area. How to deploy? how many money needed? It seems very difficult. It maybe just a dream 5 years ago, but it is possible with the current maker movement. That's the thing we are going to do.
>  LASS Features:
>  It is a system with full sensors network architecture.
>  We help makers can build their own sensors
>  The data owner is belong to users.
>  Everyone can monitor all sensors data.

>  Why are we doing this? What is our dream?
>  We want to see the data from our sensors on a map. There are many sensors all over the world. How would we place them and how much funding would we need? It sounds very difficult; it may have been a dream 5 years ago, but it is possible in today's maker movement. That is what we are trying to achieve.

(c) Focus on developing high-value data applications and services.
The government's [[Open Data Platform]] provided a large number of data with high applied value, such as air quality, weather observation, real estate value registration, agricultural trade quotations, and electricity supply and demand, and encouraged the public and industry to activate and use the data. Through cross-domain collaboration mechanisms between the public and private sectors, the project promoted the activation of data application cases. For example, the establishment of a carbon reduction action media platform by the Carbon Exchange Town and Village Community. For example, the Carbon Exchange Urban and Rural Community established a carbon reduction action media platform, the Hailong Studio Community established a beach cleaning platform, and the LASS Community established a public-private partnership platform for river basin management.
