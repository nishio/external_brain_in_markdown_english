title: "Looking back soothes my anxiety."

I heard about this kind of composition.

- The [[darkness]] of [[an uncertain world]] makes you sick at heart if you keep looking at it.
    - I'm tormented by [[anxiety about not knowing the future]].
- When you look back at a time like that and see people not facing [[the changing world]], [[it's healing]].
    - Do you feel that you can live without thinking about details when you see [[people who live without seeing the darkness]]?
    - Can you get a sense of "[[contribution]]" by teaching someone who doesn't know?
        - Can we thereby gain [[self-assurance]] that "[[the world]] needs us"?
- AI's language on this
        - [[o1, o3, Deep Research Comparison 2025-02-14]]


This reminded me of "[[Torn of the world]]".

    - If Mr. A's movement speed is greater than Mr. B's, the distance between them increases over time
    - Then eventually Mr. B won't understand what Mr. A is talking about.

        - The "tearing apart of the world" occurs when communication between Mr. A and Mr. B ceases to exist.


This was the image of a village steeped in old values that bullied and drove away residents with new values who came from the city and became more and more isolated, but it points out that this may not necessarily be the case.
- It is the invention of television
- The speed at which information from the city is shared in rural areas has increased dramatically.
- In the future, the development of AI will allow "TV programs" to be generated according to individual needs.
- That way, the interface remains TV, but the speed of information sharing is even faster.
- in other words

    - The assumption that this velocity is constant and the distance continues to expand could be incorrect.
    - The speed at which B is catching up may be faster than the speed at which A is advancing
- Only if you're willing to play catch-up...
