title: 'When people say to me, "Learning that stuff won''t help you."'

The fact that it was said is not the same as whether it is true or not.
If the person who said it has never learned it, he or she is either able to judge the usefulness to others of what he or she has not learned or simply assumes it is not useful to justify what he or she has not learned. The latter possibility is more likely.
