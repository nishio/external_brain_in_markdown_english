> [@owocki](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1653081117837398017?s=20): Contract Secured Revenue (CSR) allows you to claim a percentage of all transaction fees paid by users when interacting with your smart contracts.
> Is anyone working on an L2 that does this? I'm considering writing an EIP outlining how CSR would work on an EVM L2.

> [@owocki](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1655631005800095763): EIP-6969 presents a generalized protocol which networks can reference in order to implement Cantoâ€™s Contract Secured Revenue (CSR) on any EVM L2.
> Contract Secured Revenue = developers get revenue when ppl use their contracts .

> [nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1655840746593976320) So it is a kind of donation system which easily distribute the money to the author of the components, right?
