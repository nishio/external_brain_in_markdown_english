Keichobot in 2025

- It's a good time to make KeichoBot an LLM.
    - I had to stop using GPT 3.5 because it was slow and Heroku would time out, but it's fast enough now, I thought.
    - I would like to include LLM support in my work with Kozaneba, KeichoBot and Cosense.

    - In 2023, they decided that it was better to wait and see and not continue development now.
    - [[New Keichobot]]

[[Where's the source code for keicho?]]
- It used to be on Bitbucket or something, but now it's on GitHub privately.

Let's get Devin set up.
- Once that's done, you can fix what's broken just by chatting with them.

    - Kozaneba's menu was broken, Devin fixed it.
        - Fixed broken images in [/kozaneba-forum-jp/menu](https://scrapbox.io/kozaneba-forum-jp/menu).
        - I left it for a few days after I noticed it, thinking "I need to fix it, but it's a pain in the ass," but when I requested it, it was done in a day.
        - Human beings are the bottleneck!
    - Let's set up Keichobot to be developed by Devin too!
