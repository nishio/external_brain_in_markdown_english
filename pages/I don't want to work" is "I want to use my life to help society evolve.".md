title: 'I don''t want to work" is "I want to use my life to help society evolve."'

> First, let us define "[[work]]" as "to do work" and check the definition of "[[work]]".
>  Work is "to receive [[Monetary Consideration]] by lawful [[toil]]" (This is the definition that Dr. Yasuo Suwa, who was the chairman of the Central Labor Relations Commission, gives every year at the Tokyo Tech Startup Design Course. (This is the definition given by Dr. Yasuo Suwa, former chairman of the Central Labor Relations Commission, in his annual lecture at the Tokyo Tech Startup Design Course.)
>  Therefore, being a bank transfer scam operator (=illegal labor) or volunteering (not receiving monetary compensation) is not a job.
>  In other words, to summarize, "not working" can be broadly classified into the following three categories.
>  1. receive monetary compensation for illegal labor
>  2. receive no monetary compensation for legitimate labor
>  3. not doing any of the above work
>  I am quite exceptional about 3. Even if I'm playing Splatoon all day or watching TV, I'm still in 2.
>  I've got it all sorted out so far. Now it's time to get down to business.
>  In my arrangement.
>  "Working = a way of life that emphasizes relative [[individual well-being]]."
>  "Not working = a way of life that is relatively conducive to the evolution of society."
