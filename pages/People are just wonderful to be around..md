>  If any of the following apply to you, please stop for a moment.
>
>  ・It is assumed that subordinates will listen to what you say.
>  > They all think they can do PowerPoint and other work quickly and easily.
>  ・Disregard for the field. Never done it and have no intention of doing it in the future.
>  ・Naturally and without malice, looking down on those around you (although you don't realize this yourself).
>  - Grinning or bushy-tailed (I don't have a problem with that because ″great″ is justice within the consultancy).
>  ・Lack of discernment of people (living in a small world, so the variety of racial experiences is poor)
>  I think I'm excellent (natural condescension)
>  ・Negotiation, not good at politics

>  May peace be with him and everyone in his new position.

>  ・ Unlike consultants, we are responsible for ensuring execution, so it is not the fault of subordinates who do not do it.
>  - They don't quit as quickly as consultants do, and people don't come on their own unless they are a well-known company, so it's a headache to get people to do things.

It's like if you graduate into an [[overcrowded]] environment and adapt to the culture there, and then when you move to another environment, can you adapt to the change again?

    - [[New Graduate]]
    - [[Overadaptation]]
