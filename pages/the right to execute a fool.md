title: "the right to execute a fool"
---

- What is attributable to one's own possession should be left to the self-determination of the adult, insofar as it does not cause harm to others, even if the content of that decision may be considered foolish by reason.

- John Stuart [[mill]]'s [[(philosophical) libertarianism]].
    - Concepts presented in the discussion on [[utilitarianism]] and personal [freedom
- Principles Constituting Freedom
    - Principle of Preventing Harm to Others.
    - It cannot be legitimate to force someone to do something just because it is wise or right in the eyes of others.
- derived from

grounds of an argument
- It is the individual who has the greatest interest in his or her personal well-being.
- The interest society shows in him is meager,
- His judgment about his folly and any outside intervention in his purpose would be based on a general presumption, but likely to be erroneous.
- Thus, matters that concern only himself are the true sphere of activity of individuality, and in this sphere the harm of allowing others to force him to do what they see as happiness for him is greater than the harm he might do by ignoring their cautions and warnings.

- The criticism, scorn, and rejection that he or she receives as a result of his or her foolishness must be assumed by him or her.
