[Job guarantee - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_guarantee)
- (DeepL)The employment guarantee is an economic policy proposal aimed at providing a sustainable solution to inflation and unemployment. Its purpose is to achieve [[full employment]] and price stability by promising employment to the unemployed as a last resort (ELR) by the state.

- An employment guarantee is a policy whereby the government guarantees job opportunities to the unemployed. By doing so, it aims to promote job security and reduce the unemployment rate. The specifics of employment guarantee policies vary from country to country and region to region, but often include the provision of work opportunities for the public, job training, and employment assistance.
- Welfare, on the other hand, is a system under which the government guarantees a minimum standard of living to those in need. By doing so, it aims to provide opportunities to escape poverty and prevent social exclusion. Welfare includes support for basic needs such as food, medical care, housing, and education.
- These two programs have different objectives and instruments, as they focus on employment and livelihood security, respectively. The employment guarantee addresses labor market issues, while the livelihood guarantee addresses livelihood infrastructure issues. However, both are important policies to promote social justice and stability.
