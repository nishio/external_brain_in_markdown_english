- "Sharp Talent Becomes Rounded"
    - Some interpret this negatively, while others see it positively
    - Negative interpretation:
        - The sharp parts are strengths or areas of expertise
        - A talented engineer's "sharp parts" are ground down by the [[homogenization]] pressure of a large corporation, becoming a [[mediocre]] round stone
    - Positive interpretation:
        - The sharp parts represent a lack of [[cooperativeness]] due to youth
        - Being sharp causes unnecessary [[friction]] with others
        - Through experience, the sharp edges are worn away, leading to a "[[harmonious personality]]"
    - The fact that these two interpretations are not entirely independent deepens the issue

These two can be corresponded to the terms "[[Specialist]]" and "[[Generalist]]".
