title: "Timing of ✅value question is early → excessive extraction of movement"
---

from [[pKeicho]]
Is the timing of the value question appropriate?
- [https://keicho.netlify.app/#talk=alUKPkDIxF4BN18b4Yoe](https://keicho.netlify.app/#talk=alUKPkDIxF4BN18b4Yoe)
- Isn't it too early to ask the value question?
- Observation of what was happening
    - Improved the script I created when observing [[Keyword appearance speed]] to allow for [[Observation of keyword score variation]] during the dialogue by specifying a single log `see_score.py`.
- Observation: Higher scores for "do
    - [Re-learn Motion Extraction
    - Past work [[Motion Extraction Work Memo]].
        - [[✅Allow specifying the logs to be trained for motion extraction]]
        - [[Down sampling is too hard.]]
- This will improve on this case, but we'll see what happens in general.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I thought it might be a good idea to mention the 3As in the explanation of the good use of this chat system, so I want to organize this before I write the manuscript.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "chat system" is this "chat system"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>A system that asks questions in response to user statements. He explained that the system helps users to organize their thoughts by answering questions.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "user" is this "user"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It is human and basically alone. And the beauty of this system is that even one person can "organize thoughts through dialogue".
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "system" is this "system"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It can be said that the system becomes a dialogue partner instead of a human being. So, 3A is a technique to enhance the dialogue between humans.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "dialogue" is this "dialogue"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>This one is human-to-human. The 3A stands for "answer, add, ask," which means to add information and ask more questions about it, rather than just answering the question.

I see, this means that verbs are now extracted by [[Motion Extraction]] and "do" is also extracted, and although I thought it was okay because of its low score on its own, it appears at high frequency, so the scores are accumulated and it is recognized as "a developed and important word".

These two.
- 82:Do
- 24: do

This is not good either.
- 80: Yes.

Just tell them that this is not good enough because it's done by machine learning.
