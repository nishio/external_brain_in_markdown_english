title: "theft effort"

2024-05-27
I saw a series of tweets on 2024-03-23 that stuck in my mind.
- I've sorted it out for myself over time.
- Once organized, the words "theft" and "effort" disappear.

There are two types of activities in the world: activities that generate resources and activities that move resources.
Activities that move resources involve a decrease in resources at the source.
If you are not the owner of the resource you are moving from
- Convince them to put forth resources to make them feel that it is beneficial to them.
- take unnoticed
It can be one of
- The latter is expressed by the metaphor of "theft."
    - The former could also be described by the metaphor of "deception" considering what it is to "persuade" and "feel"
    - The original post does not distinguish between these concepts.

Activities are costly.
- This is expressed in the metaphor of "effort."
- For example, Mr. B buys an item from Mr. A for 3,000 yen and sells it to Mr. C for 5,000 yen, thereby making a profit of 2,000 yen, from which he, Mr. B, who is engaged in this activity, makes his living expenses.
    - This is sometimes described as [[the basis of business]], but if Mr. C knows about Mr. A's product and can order it directly for 4,000 yen, it is not a necessary act.
    - It is possible to interpret this as theft from A and C using a flaw in the system.
        - In fact, the work can suffer as the system develops.
        - He describes it as "not being rewarded for your efforts" as the system develops and theft becomes harder and harder to commit and the profit relative to the cost becomes less and less.
    - No system existed early in human history
        - This type of activity by humans generated a "system by humans", which is the market
    - There are so many people engaged in this activity that it has become difficult to claim that it is "ethically objectionable."
        - The fact that you dare to use the metaphor of "theft" as a metaphor for illegal activity is interesting.
- There is a broader "theft effort" that is not limited to the movement of goods.
    - For example, making a clean slide that doesn't need to be clean feels like a theft effort.
    - I feel that classifying things that don't need to be classified using appropriate (thoughtful) classification criteria is also a theft effort.
    - Why do I feel that way?
        - Because it's an action that poses as working without considering whether it's essentially creating value?

I saw a series of tweets that stuck in my mind, but I couldn't put it into words properly, so I let Claude sort it out.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This series of tweets presents an interesting concept called "theft effort". In summary, it can be summarized as follows.
- Many people engage in "larcenous efforts" to take something from others or to unfairly increase their own profits.
- But theft does not increase resources, it is essentially [[wasted effort]].
- On the other hand, for those who do the [[production]] themselves, theft is unnecessary. The producer does not have to negotiate; he only has to offer terms favorable to himself.
- It is important that the producer provide sufficient information on the deliverables and explain them in a manner that the purchaser can understand.
- Examples of theft efforts include selling unwanted items, making things worthless, negligence, and self-promotion.
- If you feel that your efforts are not being rewarded, it is important to reflect on whether or not they are theft efforts.
This concept suggests the importance of distinguishing between productive and unproductive efforts in society and focusing on true value creation. However, in the real world, the distinction between producers and non-producers is not always clear, and negotiation and communication may also play an important role. While this concept is suggestive, its application to reality will require careful consideration.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I think he's trying to say that there's no need for a "sell it for more than it's actually worth" type of negotiation. If we produce the product, explain the information about the deliverables in a way that the buyer can understand, and the price paid by those who understand and find value in the product is sufficient, then we don't need to negotiate, do we?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>That's right. I think the crux of the author's argument lies in the importance of producers [[creating real value]] and communicating it [[honestly]]. This way of thinking will contribute to building [[long-term trusting relationships]] and achieving [[sustainable business]].
