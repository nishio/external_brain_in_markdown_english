Technology that doesn't age is beneficial for intellectual productivity in life as a whole.
Why study old people?
- Thinking about it again, I realized that this is part of intellectual productivity improvement.
- Miscellaneously grouped by age
    - In the 20s, the focus was on improving productivity through programming language and tool selection.
        - This is about gaining knowledge for choice
    - In the 30s, the focus shifted to productivity gains related to "gaining knowledge."
        - What to learn
        - How to connect what you learn to value
        - How to structure the acquisition of "knowledge that is easy to connect to value" without trying too hard
    - In my 40s, I am acutely aware of the fact that my cognitive abilities are declining.
        - Some people begin to engage in harmful behaviors due to cognitive decline.
        - If intellectual production is measured by its contribution to society, it is important for me not to be a person who does harm at the end of my life in order to improve my overall intellectual productivity
