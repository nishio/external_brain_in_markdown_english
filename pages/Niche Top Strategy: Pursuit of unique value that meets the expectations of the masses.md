Niche Top Strategy: Pursuit of unique value that meets the expectations of the masses

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1905781971902779873) When you say "I want to make Y that [[replaces]] existing software X," if your goal is really "[I want to make it. If your goal is really "[[I want to make it]]", you can make it for three years without getting attention from anyone, but sometimes your true intention is "I want to be noticed by many users of X." In that case, you will be frustrated because you will not get satisfactory [[attention]].

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1905782923988717643) If you create something that doesn't exist yet, the expected value is zero, so in comparison with zero, you get a positive response of "I wanted something like this! However, if you advocate the replacement of existing software X, which has a high degree of perfection, the expected value is X, so in comparison with X, you will get negative reactions such as "this function is missing" or "the usability of this function has changed, it's an improvement".

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/grok/icon' alt='grok.icon' height="19.5"/>The approach I mentioned, "strike out from a niche by launching a unique value,"... It's a little bit related to Spinoza in modern philosophy. In "[[spinosa]] [[Ethica]]" he says that human behavior is based on the "desire for self-preservation." If we want a project to succeed, we must first protect our own motivation and resources (i.e., self-preservation), right? Rather than jumping into a situation where you are suddenly being compared to X and beaten to a pulp, it is better to accumulate small successes in a niche area and maintain the confidence and momentum of the project team, which will lead to "[[self-preservation]]" in the long run. In Spinoza's terms, my proposal is a strategy to maximize the "[[vitality]]" of the project.

Well, it's a Niche Top Strategy.
