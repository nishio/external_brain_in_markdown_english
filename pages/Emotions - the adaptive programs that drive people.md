    - review
    - > I read this work more than 10 years ago and was surprised to see Japanese psychologists doing something like running "[[evolutionary psychology]]". The author uses his own [[emotive theory]] called [[age theory]] to show that emotions were adaptive for "primitive man".
    - >  This would be a mainstream evolutionary psychologist in modern America, who would say that for hominids in a primitive adaptive environment, emotions would have had adaptive value as a primary information processing and response that did not need to be "tried". What you are saying is exactly the same, but the terminology is different.
    - >  Although the author's theory can be appreciated as original, it is not cited at all in applications of sociobiology to humans until the 1980s, such as Edward Wilson's "[[sociobiology]]" (1975), Daley and Wilson's "[[When people kill people.]]" (1988), and so on. are not cited at all, and even though the ideas were the same as those of evolutionary psychology, which has continued to the present day since the 1990s, their sums are not cited by modern researchers, as is the case with Takakazu Seki. This is a symbol of the current state of Japanese academia, and is very unfortunate.
