title: "Gutsy Motivation Person"
---

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>These tweets agree that the presence of a "Gutsy and Motivated Person ([[GYP]])" is very important in cutting-edge development projects.

The main points are as follows: 1.
- GYP will be the [[driving force]] that generates [[breakthrough]] ideas and findings.
- More than the size of the organization or its financial strength, [[GYP's will]] is [[the key to opening up the future]].
- On the other hand, as organizations grow larger, GYP tends to be marginalized. In the U.S., there is a culture of rewarding GYP with stock options.
- GYPs [[have already found what they want to do]], so [[it is difficult to call on them from the outside to join them]] in some aspects.
- With the GYP at the core, it is important to surround him or her with people who can complete the assigned missions, and to push those who only talk the talk to the fringes.
- An organization with GYP and his friends is strong, but if it is all GYP and [[flight attendants]], it will be corrupt.
- Some say they would like to be burned near GYP because it is difficult to be GYP themselves.
- When you have a GYP [[manager who reduces motivation]], the field is over.
- Many GYPs are the type who have been thinking about it since junior high school and [[immersing themselves]] in [[returning from holidays]].

In general, the report highlights the importance of "people who can immerse themselves with passion" and the difficulty of management to make the most of such people. It seems that not only [[expertise]] but also [[strong will]] and [[ability to get things done]] are required in cutting-edge fields. It seems that the way of organization also needs to be changed.

When there is a "Gutsy Motivated Person", the horsepower to assemble ideas and knowledge to break through at any cost will change. It may seem like a gut feeling, but it is not. >Pre RP

> [ShogoNu](https://twitter.com/ShogoNu/status/1773127089710919793) This is so true, no matter how big the organization is or how much money it has, the power to converge the future is nothing but people's will. I think the reason why startups and huge companies that have raised hundreds of billions of yen fail is because of the presence of GYP (Gutsy Motivated Persons). Of course, there is also luck.

> [nyaa_toraneko](https://twitter.com/nyaa_toraneko/status/1773157999034638592) This is true, but at the same time, for some reason, people tend to alienate that kind of "Gutsy and Motivated Person (GYP)"! This is true, but at the same time, for some reason, people tend to alienate such "GYPs". This is especially true when the size of the organization grows, but I think the American IPO culture is such that after a successful IPO, the GYP are given stock options to liquidate and receive the money, so that they can leave the organization amicably. On an individual basis, it's hard to have that kind of experience, so it's hard to notice.
>  It is important for a person with GYP tendencies to be in an organization at a time when the organization needs his/her "motivation" as much as possible, and it must be difficult for the person himself/herself if he/she does not know how not to "leave a trail of birds in the air" at the same time.

I think Apple is a rare company because they kicked out GYP Jobs once and welcomed him back when the company was about to seriously fail. I guess that's why the company culture has become a brand.



> [OKtamajun](https://twitter.com/OKtamajun/status/1773136915534844391) "Gutsy Person" is important, but it is also difficult to call on people from the outside to join the group because they are people who have already found a story to be stubborn about at this point. It is also difficult to call on them to join us from the outside because they are people who have already found a story to do something tough.

> [newHouse1973](https://twitter.com/newHouse1973/status/1773141175622320592) I am often involved in development projects that are far from cutting-edge, but I feel that it is important to have a core of "hard-working, motivated people" and to surround them with "people who can at least complete the given mission. I feel that it is important to have a core of "hard-working, motivated people" and to surround them with "people who can at least complete the given mission". It is important to keep the "commentator person who only talks and does not move his/her hands" to the periphery as much as possible.

> [aratafuji](https://twitter.com/aratafuji/status/1773306270222574024) It would be great if I could be a "Gutsy Motivated Person" myself, but since that is impossible, I want to be burned near a "Gutsy Motivated Person".

> [youten_redo](https://twitter.com/youten_redo/status/1773397225567326628) I thought I'd say something about the word "Gutsy Motivated Person (GYP)" because it's a nice word, but something tells me that both myself and ours are ".... Not so much, huh?" It's hard to talk about it because there's a part of me that's like "... not really?
