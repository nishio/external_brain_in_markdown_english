title: '9.11>9.9" is a false dichotomy.'
---

When I asked LLM to compare 9.11 and 9.9, he answered that 9.11 is larger than 9.9. I had interpreted this as "LLM is wrong", but then I realized that the string "9.11" is not the only absolutely correct interpretation of a numerical type.

I searched for "9.11" and found [September 11 attacks - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks), which made sense to me. If you give the LLM only the four letters "9.11" without any other context, it is not surprising that the LLM thinks "this is an expression referring to a famous incident, and it is natural to interpret it as a date".

If 9.11 is interpreted as a date, it is also widely interpreted as "greater than" the 9.11 that comes after 9.9. In other words, whether "9.11>9.9" is correct or incorrect depends on how one interprets "9.11.

Whether "9.11>9.9" is correct or incorrect is [[False dichotomy]].
[[Neither "right" nor "wrong" is right.]]
