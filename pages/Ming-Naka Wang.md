<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>Wang Ming-Ka (1953-) is an anthropologist and historian from Taiwan. He is known for his research on ethnic minorities in western China, especially nomadic peoples.

Primary Research Interests:
- Nomadic Peoples of Western China: Wang Mingqa studies the history and culture of the Mongols, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other nomadic peoples of western China.
- Ethnic Identity: examines the identity formation of nomadic ethnic groups and the impact of China's ethnic policies on ethnic minorities.
- Historical Anthropology: Combining history and anthropology, we use a research methodology that combines literary sources and fieldwork.

Main publications:
- Qiang zai Hanzang zhang zhi zhang: 一個華夏邊緣的歷史人類學研究" (1999): a historical anthropological analysis of the process of ethnic identity formation among the Chan ethnic minority.
- Yu zhusha taiyuan gutai: 面對漢帝國的北亞遊牧部族 (2008): A study of the relationship between successive Chinese dynasties and the nomadic tribes of North Asia, read from the perspective of the nomadic tribes.
- Mongolian Cavalry and the Great Qing Empire" (2016): a work that examines the relationship between the Qing dynasty and the Mongols in terms of the nomadic tribes' military power and imperial governing policies.

Wang Mingqa's research has attracted attention as an attempt to reevaluate the role of nomadic peoples in Chinese history. His approach, which relativizes the traditional China-centered view of history and sheds light on [[nomadic subjectivity]], has some resonance with Deleuze's nomadic theory.

Just as Deleuze focused on nomadic resistance to the state, Wang Mingka actively evaluates nomadic responses to imperial rule. However, Wang Mingka's research is solely an empirical historical study, distinct from the philosophical speculation of Deleuze.

Nevertheless, in highlighting the tension between the state and nomadism, Wang Mingka's research shares an awareness of issues that overlap with [[Deleuze.]]'s [[Nomadism]]. Wang Mingka's perspective also provides important insights into ethnic issues in contemporary China and Taiwan.
