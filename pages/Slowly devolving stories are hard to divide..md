title: "Slowly devolving stories are hard to divide."
---

When ideas develop on a time scale, they get lost in a one-dimensional output.
If you try to connect the end and the tip of a story after you've written it, they're too far apart to connect.
The lack of connection reveals "not one topic".
But each line is so densely interconnected that you can't even separate them.
