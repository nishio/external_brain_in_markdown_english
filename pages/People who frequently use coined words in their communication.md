from  [[Coining your own terminology]]
Who frequently use [[coined word]] in communication
- I've coined a term and used it, and sometimes I see people doing that in communities that deal with philosophy.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/biwachi/icon' alt='/villagepump/biwachi.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - They use it as a matter of course, but I can't find it when I look it up, and it's very annoying.
    - If you ask what it means, the definition is vague or already defined in other words
    - Very high context is there, but they don't realize it and don't communicate well
- is often the case[[playing smart]] の一種なのかなーと思う<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Yeah, well, playing smart is a fitting expression.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/biwachi/icon' alt='/villagepump/biwachi.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - He may be trying to act like a philosopher, though he may not be aware of it.
        - Maybe I shouldn't be too evil about it, but...
- You know, playing smart.[[stinging (barbed) words]] 感ある<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Is it because it sounds like it implies that I'm not smart?
- I see<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - This is exactly what the [[Intention to insult]] diagram shows.
    - Implicitly, they think you're not smart enough, which is why they use the nuanced term "not smart enough."
    - I haven't identified the person I'm talking to, and they're not here, but if they were, I'd be "insulted!" again. If they were here, I would be "insulted!
    - It's not good that "not smart" is vaguely derogatory.
        - Objective if you're "someone who frequently coined terms in your communication."
        - But that would involve decent mathematicians and philosophers.
        - Mathematicians define concepts in language, but philosophers don't necessarily.
    - I've given it some thought, but I'm not sure I can identify it.
        - When you observe a person "speaking with a coined word that you don't quite know the definition of," you don't know if that person is smart or not.
        - It's not a good idea to say, "You must be trying to look smart," because it's a judgment about another person's inner life, the same kind of thing as, "You must be trying to insult me.
            - [[Don't find malice in being incompetent enough to be explained away.]]
            - You also called this one "incompetent"...

少し考えてみたけど識別はできないかも<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Suppose a person A coined a word W to express a certain concept M.
    - I can't determine if A already has a word X that expresses concept M and I just don't know it.
    - So the act of assigning the coined word W to the concept you want to express anyway is not in itself inevitable.
- Suppose a person B asks A what W means and does not understand the explanation. At this time
    - Is it that "A doesn't really know what W means" or that "the concept to which W refers is ambiguous?"
    - I don't understand why B doesn't have the prerequisite knowledge to understand A's explanation.
    - This is not identifiable.
- When some person B thinks that the meaning of W is the same as the existing word X
    - Is the meaning actually the same?
    - I'm not sure if B just doesn't understand the difference now between X and W that A is trying to distinguish.
    - This is not identifiable.
- So nothing on an objective scale of "smart", "dumb", or "playing smart" can be determined from these phenomena.
    - From Mr. B's point of view, Mr. A's statement is unintelligible and unhelpful, so much for the fact
    - It is only an interpretation to think that the cause of the problem lies in A or in B.
        - Maybe [[Habits from when I was a monkey]] would want to drag it out and decide "which is better".
        - It is probably better not to try to decide
    - As a subjective measure, for Mr. B, "the probability is high that Mr. A's statement is futile."
        - Usefulness is not an attribute of the information itself, but of the recipient of the information
                - [[Beneficial and harmful are attributes of the recipient of information]]
