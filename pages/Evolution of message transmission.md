- 1: In early communication, people delivered messages orally. However, oral messages, once delivered, were not permanently recorded. Also, one had to be "present" to receive the message.

- 2: The next form is the way people communicate messages in the form of sending something written. This first took the form of paper mail and then evolved into e-mail. The advent of e-mail, in particular, brought a new advantage: "[[Searchable]]. However, access to information was limited because only the mail sent to you was searchable.

- 3: A more advanced form is to post messages in a shared forum. In this form, you can see communications that are not directly targeted to you. This feature relieves the person with the information from the burden of sending the same content repeatedly to several people. ([[Disadvantages of e-mail-based communication]])
    - On the other hand, as more and more people actively transmit information, messages accumulate, creating an [[information flood]] situation. A better means of information reuse is needed.

- 4: The latest evolution is a form of collaborative editing. This is a system in which information sent out by a particular person is not only accumulated, but can be edited by all members into a text that is the common property of everyone. The message is not only the personal property of the individual sender, but the message as common property is aggregated and summarized by the members.
