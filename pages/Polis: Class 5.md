> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1655592454429573123?s=20): the statements on Twitter regarding COVID19's Class 5 transition are now eligible for voting. Voting will show you where your opinion stands compared to everyone else's.

I'm in category 5, so I don't have to wear a mask.
Now that we're in category 5, we can remove the disinfectant.
Good to remove the acrylic board in front of the cash register as it is now class 5.
Masks, hand washing, and other infection control measures should be taken.
Continued vigilance for the spread of infection is necessary.
It is possible that the 9th wave will exceed the size of the 8th wave.
Even if you're in category 5, febrile people need to call the hospital in advance before they can be seen.
Please don't remove the soap from the bathrooms.
Moving Corona to "Class 5" was for the convenience of the Kishida administration, which wanted to abandon the measure.
The risk of infection increases after class 5.
I want telework to continue where I can telework.
ANA's "removal of disinfectant and other liquids from airports" is not right.
In category 5, the hospital cannot refuse to see a corona patient due to the obligation to respond to the patient's request.
The "Class 5 is positioned the same as seasonal influenza" is a report that gives top priority to some kind of comprehensibility, resulting in further misunderstanding and miscomprehension.
I hope that 'a society where people can take time off work when they are sick' will continue even if COVID becomes category 5.
COVID-19 becomes class 5 â†’ Medical costs for infection are borne by individuals â†’ Increased importance of masks, ventilation, and hand sanitizers
Since it is now class 5, medical expenses at the time of infection, which were previously free, will now be paid.
The fact that it is now class 5 does not mean "corona is no longer a serious disease" but rather "the government will no longer help you, so you are on your own if you die.
Test kits and antipyretic and analgesic medications should be kept at home in advance
If you are visiting a medical facility, you should wear a mask even if the test kit is negative
Symptoms should be reported in advance to a health care provider before a visit

> [@takuramix](https://twitter.com/takuramix/status/1655473398884212736): "Even if the state of emergency is lifted by WHO, we should take appropriate measures against infectious diseases such as masks and hand washing at our own discretion. We must continue to be vigilant against the spread of infection."
>  I mean,
> "Aftershocks have calmed down and reconstruction work has progressed, but we must continue to be vigilant and take precautions against earthquakes and tsunamis.
> It's the same thing as saying, "I'm not going to do it.

> [@FORCEPS4](https://twitter.com/FORCEPS4/status/1655107426864209920?s=20): tbs, let's stop the misinformation. even if you are in category 5, fever sufferers need to be properly contacted before being seen.

> [@One_of_Engineer](https://twitter.com/One_of_Engineer/status/1655486086934827009?s=20): @takuramix Since there is no assurance that the 9th wave will not come or that it will be less than the size of the 8th wave I am uncomfortable with the analogy that the situation is considered to be over.
> If we compare it to an earthquake, it is like the preliminary stage of an earthquake: "The strong shaking has subsided, but there is a possibility of aftershocks of the same or larger size. There is a risk of aftershocks of the same or larger magnitude, so please continue to ensure your safety"...

> [@yosinotennin](https://twitter.com/yosinotennin/status/1655382458203017219?s=20): moving to the new Corona 5 class. I would like to ask all facilities not to remove the soap from the washrooms... I was thankful that they were well stocked everywhere during the Corona disaster. It kept me from catching a cold and getting a stomach bug for over 3 years!

> [@Narodovlastiye](https://twitter.com/Narodovlastiye/status/1655404251668172800?s=20): moving Corona to "category 5" today was for the convenience of the Kishida administration, which wants to abandon countermeasures, of course. It does not mean that the virus will disappear at the same time, as the regime is bent on it. The current situation, in which the government is pretending to be "invisible," and even reducing the use of hand sanitizers, let alone masks, is not going to stop the virus. In fact, the number of infected people is increasing again.

> [@kottur_lover22](https://twitter.com/kottur_lover22/status/1655200293666320384?s=20): do you think many people will end teleworking and become commuters when they reach class 5?
> I'd rather you continue teleworking where you can, because the risk of infection increases after you're in category 5.
> We will no longer be able to announce the number of infected people, and we will have to survive with no indicators of prevention of infection.

> [@__fusion](https://twitter.com/__fusion/status/1655411480899248128?s=20): ANA to remove disinfectant and other liquids at airport before transition to corona 5 | 2023/5/7 - Kyodo News [https://t.co/](https://t.co/) GWjxvpIGz0
> The threat of coronas will disappear if we stop infection control.
> = Summer comes when you wear a bathing suit.
> According to Grandmaster Piaget, it is a form of reasoning characteristic of the preoperational period, well, the developmental stage of about 2-7 years of age ðŸ˜¸.

> [@Nom_nyan](https://twitter.com/Nom_nyan/status/1655423743089590272?s=20): "Class 5 is positioned the same as seasonal influenza" is the clearest example ever of a news report that prioritizes some kind of clarity and results in further misunderstanding and miscomprehension. This is the clearest example in the past of a news report that prioritizes some kind of comprehensibility and results in further misunderstanding and miscomprehension.

> [@MIKITO_777](https://twitter.com/MIKITO_777/status/1653724146101264389?s=20): whether COVID is class 5 or not.
> "A society where people can take time off work when they are sick."
> I hope it will continue.

> [@nj51](https://twitter.com/nj51/status/1655405039928872961?s=20): COVID-19 becomes class 5 -> medical costs in case of infection are borne by individuals -> increased importance of masks, ventilation and hand sanitizer
> Yet, masks are optional for companies and schools! Disinfectant removal! No more silent meals! Where's the science in all this?

> [@kuroinukuro](https://twitter.com/kuroinukuro/status/1655367187501314048?s=20): I know this has been rubbed in my face many times, but the fact that the new coronas are now class 5 does not mean "coronas are no longer a serious disease". It means "the government will not help you anymore, so you are on your own even if you die". There is no reason to let our guard down.

> [@SukunaBikona7](https://twitter.com/SukunaBikona7/status/1655569006227783680?s=20): The Tokyo Metropolitan Government's site is rather comprehensive and easy to understand regarding the response to the change transition to Class 5 of COVID-19. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government's site is rather comprehensive and easy to understand.
