As for the "LENCHI_LLM commented from the perspective of 2024," it would be more interesting to blend it in as a knowledge network, but as a one-dimensional lecture, it would become a seamless story and the audience would not be able to keep up.

While you are still reading literature in print format, which is much the same as 100 years ago, you are also reading in a way that did not exist 100 years ago, i.e., finding articles that seem relevant to your interests from a large amount of digital data and following hyperlinks from those articles to gather knowledge about the surrounding area.

I threw it out there with the hope of making a little progress, but surprisingly, they made it to the final summary.
- [[Done is better than perfect]], but AI will make it Done.
- I feel like I'm overloading the Asymmetrci Reality story, but the effect is that the presentation of a slap in the face encourages the verbalization of how to improve it.

While the development of LLM has brought about significant changes in intellectual production, the ideas advocated by "The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production" continue to have value today. The importance of human independent intellectual activities, such as the cycle of learning and the ability to identify subjects to learn on one's own, is rather increasing.

At the same time, there is a need to leverage LLM while taking into account the evolution of tools and unleashing human creativity. From blogs to Scrapbox, from paper KJ method to Kozaneba, personal intellectual production platforms are evolving, and new possibilities are opening up through fusion with LLM.

LLM can be used to accelerate divergent thinking and expand the knowledge base. At the same time, new models of intellectual production are being explored, including the use of LLM to support convergent thinking and the realization of "broad listening" through the development of summarization technology.

Engineers of the future will be required to use LLM appropriately and advance their own intellectual production. To do so, they will need to flexibly adopt new tools and approaches and put them into practice, while building on the ideas underlying the "Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production.

I myself would like to continue to be at the forefront of intellectual production, utilizing Scrapbox, Custom Search, Claude 3 Opus, and other tools. I would also like to continue to explore the possibilities of intellectual production using LLM by sharing and discussing the insights gained in the process.

I hope that you, too, will face LLM with your own intellectual curiosity as a driving force and continue to learn. By doing so, we can enhance our collective intelligence and co-create a better future.

LENCHI preface, I thought I might not have enough time, but I spoke and it seemed OK, so I decided to embed it instead of a separate page

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Please review the following lecture materials and point out areas that are difficult for the audience to understand and need to be reworded, and suggest what you would like to see supplemented [txt](https://gist.github.com/nishio/7a285c7026657b6cb094a0b2c00df2f9).
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>I think it would be better to supplement the wording of the following section, as it may be difficult for viewers to understand.

- RAG ([[Retrieval-Augmented Generation]], retrieval-enhanced generation)".
    - It would be good to add a brief explanation of the term and concept of RAG.
    - E.g., "RAG is a technique for generating more specific, contextualized responses by retrieving and leveraging information from a specific database in addition to the LLM's general knowledge."

- LLM for Commodities."
    - Since the term "commodity" may not be common, an explanation would be a good addition.
    - E.g., "A commoditized LLM is one that has not undergone any special adjustments or additional learning with data and is in a universally available state."

- Zoom function."
    - It would be good to add an explanation of the specific effects of Kozaneba's zoom feature.
    - Example: "Using the zoom function, you can change the display range at will, for example, to get a bird's eye view of the whole picture or to focus on a specific part. This makes it easier to explore the relevance of ideas."

- Broadcasting" and "Broad Listening."
    - It would be good to add more clarification on these two terms.
    - Example: "Broadcasting refers to the one-way dissemination of information, as in broadcasting. Broad listening, on the other hand, is a new form of communication that utilizes LLM's summarization technology to enable the opinions of many people to be heard efficiently."

- Context window."
    - It would be good to add a brief explanation of the term context window.
    - Example: "The context window is the maximum amount of text that the LLM can process at one time. The larger this context window, the better the LLM can understand longer sentences and conversational flow and generate consistent responses."

By adding the above explanations to these sections, the audience will be able to better understand and smoothly follow the content of the lecture. Throughout the entire lecture material, it is a good idea to include brief explanations of technical terms and new concepts.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>How would you add more clarity to the story about the possible changes in the activity of "reading a book"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>We suggest the following additions to better explain the potential changes in the activity of "reading a book."

Overview of traditional "read a book" activities
- He explains that the mainstream reading experience was linear: picking up a paper book and reading through it word by word.
- It presents the challenge that readers were getting the information in the order the author intended, making it difficult for them to tailor their reading to their own pace and interests.

LLMs bring about a change in "reading a book" activity.
- Explain that by using LLM, you can now summarize the content of the book and extract the parts of the book that interest you.
- Readers will be able to explore the book's content in a non-linear fashion according to their own interests. Example: "With LLM, you can quickly find the information you want to know without having to read through the entire book. It's as if the experience is one of acquiring knowledge through interacting with a book."

Case Studies
- Examples of LLM-based reading support tools, such as Fractal Reader, will be presented.
- Be specific about how these tools change the "book reading" experience. For example: "Fractal Reader summarizes and presents the content of a book in different levels of detail. You can read a broad summary first, then read a more detailed summary of the parts you are interested in, and so on, at your own pace."

Future Possibilities
- Predictions are given as to how the development of LLM will further change the "reading a book" activity.
- Suggest possibilities such as how the reading experience might become optimized for individual interests and purposes. For example: "In the future, LLM may be able to understand the interests and objectives of the reader and reorganize the book content accordingly. The result will be a personalized reading experience, as if it were written for each and every one of us."

By explaining the changes in the activity of "reading books" in this way, by explaining the challenges of the traditional reading experience, the changes brought about by LLM, case studies, and future possibilities, we believe it will be easier for the audience to understand and have a concrete image of the activity. In addition, by mixing in examples, abstract concepts will be easier to understand.
