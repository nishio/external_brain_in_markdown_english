- Mistake of doing [[empirical science]] in a phase where [[outdoor science]] should be done
- The initial phase of problem solving requires a "field science" phase of extensive observation and exploration before specific experiments and trial and error are undertaken
    - The "W-shaped problem-solving model."
        - Field science must precede experimental science
- Moving between field and experimental science
    - In order to broaden one's perspective, it is beneficial to look around at different fields of study rather than sticking to one's own area of expertise
    - Importance of extensive observation and exploration during the field science phase
- It demonstrates an effective learning and problem-solving process in which students deepen their understanding of a problem through extensive observation and exploration, followed by specific experiments and trial-and-error to deepen their knowledge and advance their learning.

My previous research note discussed the mistake of doing experimental science during the phase when we should be doing field science. This is the idea that the initial phase of problem solving requires a "field science" phase of extensive observation and exploration before getting into specific experiments and trial-and-error.

Nishio's research note, "The Intellectual Production of Engineers Before and After," describes a process similar to hypothesis testing in experimental science in terms of proving knowledge by action. This is relevant to my notes and complements the idea that knowledge is verified by code and learning is deepened by observing the results.

Also, "[[Nodal Point of Thought 2023-05-22]]" discusses the move between field and experimental science. This illustrates the idea that in order to broaden one's horizons, it is beneficial to look around at different disciplines rather than sticking to one's own specialty. This is also relevant to my note and emphasizes the importance of extensive observation and exploration during the field science phase.

The "W-shaped problem-solving model" describes the idea that field science must precede experimental science. This is directly related to my note and complements the importance of the field science phase in the early stages of problem solving.

These research notes underscore the importance of the initial field science phase of problem solving and the subsequent transition to the experimental science phase. This represents an effective learning and problem-solving process that involves developing an understanding of the problem through extensive observation and exploration, followed by specific experiments and trial-and-error to deepen knowledge and advance learning.
