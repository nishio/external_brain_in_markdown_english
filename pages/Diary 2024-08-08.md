So in order for the West to never let this become a precedent again, they are taking the unthinkable action of having all of the G7, except Japan, and even the EU, absent from the meeting. But I think this will have a huge impact on the world in another way.

>  There are differences even in the same bombed city.
>  Hiroshima bears the burden of "history" as the "first A-bombed city", while Nagasaki bears the burden of "politics" as the "last" city to be "bombed".
>  This is one reason why Hiroshima tends to talk about past tragedies and Nagasaki tends to talk about current wars.

> [suzuki46genki](https://x.com/suzuki46genki/status/1821158239750558123) Thank you for your various comments regarding the Nagasaki Peace Memorial Ceremony. We would like to concentrate on preparations to make this a day of prayer for lasting world peace in a peaceful and solemn atmosphere. For this reason, we will refrain from sending out social networking services and responding to comments until the ceremony ends the day after tomorrow. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

> [KS_1013](https://x.com/KS_1013/status/1821480045975843057) I was interviewed by someone today and said that it is important to note that only the G7 countries reacted to the non-invitation of the Israeli ambassador to the prayer ceremony in Nagasaki. The only countries that reacted to the non-invitation were the Western countries, and many countries, including the Global South, did not see it as a problem. The issue surrounding the situation in the Middle East has isolated the Western countries from the rest of the world.

> [blackoutrussia](https://x.com/blackoutrussia/status/1821529409800810890) Note that "it is the West that is isolated" is also the logic of China and Russia.
>  In fact, even here in the comments section, I see people spreading the narrative that the West is isolated on the Ukraine issue as well! and those who try to spread a Russia-friendly narrative here and there are conspicuous.
>  >[blackoutrussia](https://x.com/blackoutrussia/status/1821388731410231633) Some countries in the Global South, like India, have taken a pro-Israeli stance, and the world outside the West is not united in being anti-Israeli and pro It cannot be said that the world outside the West is united in anti-Israel and pro-Palestine.
>  There is a danger of being taken in by Chinese and Russian propaganda by claiming that "the West is isolated from the rest of the world.
