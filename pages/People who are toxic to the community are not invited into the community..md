title: "People who are toxic to the community are not invited into the community."
---

- People who are [[harmful]] to the [[Community]] are not invited to the community.
- natural

However, the interpretation of "beneficial/harmful" depends on the [[axes of values]] of each individual, so [[mismatch]] occurs
- Suppose a community sees value in X, and Mr. A does not see value in X, but sees value in Y.
- Then, from the community's point of view, Mr. A is judged to be harmful because he is a person who does not respect the values that the community holds dear.


- [[A community of people enjoying life.]]

- [[People who value the exchange of information are not invited to join a community that values having fun.]]
