title: "Group stickies without categorizing them"
---

- In the [[KJ method]], you group stickies." "You classify stickies?" "No, I don't classify them, I group them." "What?"
    - It is not communicated that [[Classification.]] and [[grouping]] are used to mean two completely different things.
- Commentary by Jiro Kawakita: [[Do not classify.]].
- Maybe we should dare to designate "classification" and "grouping" as NG words to find new words.
- Classification:
    - Assume an existing "[[structure]]" such as [[framework]], [[framework]], [[four quadrants]], [[axis]], etc., and place stickies according to the assumption.
- Grouping:
    - Without assuming any structure, find "[[Pairs that may be related]]" among the stickies and place them nearby.
    - Repeat this process to create a "group of stickies that seem to be related to each other.
    - Based on the relationship between stickies, [[Create structure]] work

- Assuming structure" is contraindicated in the KJ method.
    - The purpose of the KJ method is to [Discover new structures
    - Assume a structure" is "[[assume a structure]]".
    - Assigning a structure and placing stickies according to that structure does not create a new structure.

Specifics.
- 'I've put together a sticky with my experiences in running a dating agency. I am going to divide these into male, female, and other perspectives." "No, you can't. Please look at those lined up stickies and pick the one pair that you think has the strongest relationship."
