title: "Causes of Chunibi Disease"
---

- How does [[behaving in a way characteristic of teenagers going through puberty, esp. by being overly self-conscious]] occur?

hypothesis
- Essentially, this is "[[Desire to be special]]."
    - In early childhood, "being treated as a special person by one's parents" and a small world make "the state in which one is treated as a special person by the rest of the world" perceived as a normal state of affairs.
    - But when he starts elementary school, of course, he is just one student.
            - [[The average time available to others is less than one second.]]
        - This is where [[cognitive dissonance]] begins to occur, but in the early elementary grades, it can only be expressed as something like "I feel uncomfortable.
    - Around junior high school students begin to believe the story that they are a special person in the world.
        - This may be a [[meme]] from a cartoon, etc.
            - "I am a [[reincarnation]] of a past hero, and I am only seeing signs now, but in the future I will fully awaken," etc.

Q1: To begin with, are there similar concepts outside of Japan?
Q2: Consider this discussion.

## What is chuunibyo?
- In Japan, it is a slang term that originated in a radio program by Hikaru Ijuin in the late 1990s, and refers to "painful self-absorption that develops around the second year of junior high school. Currently, it has become an established Internet slang term for the exaggerated image that one is the only chosen one, as well as for chuunibi-like behavior in general.

## Psychological Foundations
.
- Adolescent egocentrism: adolescent egocentrism proposed by Elkind.
    - [Revisiting the imaginary audience and personal fable constructs of adolescent egocentrism: a conceptual review - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11214204/)
- Personal fable: the tendency to believe that one's feelings and destiny are unique.
    - [Personal fable - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_fable?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- Imaginary audience: the feeling that someone is always observing and evaluating you.
- Need for uniqueness: Motivation to seek uniqueness over conformity peaks in the teens.
    - [Does the need for uniqueness lead to non-suicidal self-injury? The mediation of depression and the moderation of gender - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37771826/)

When combined, these tend to reinforce the belief that "only I must have special powers hidden in me.

## Similar concepts outside Japan (Q1)
- U.S.A. & U.K.
    - Personal fable / Special-snowflake syndrome "I am special and the only one suffering"
- US net
    - Edgelord, "a young man who attracts attention for his radical, middle-class behavior."
        - [Edgelord - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgelord?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- Germany
    - Egophase (Ich-Phase) The egocentric phase of puberty. Standard in parenting guides for parents.
- medium and high (platform, etc.)
    - Chunibyo Imported as Japanese and penetrated the otaku demographic.
        - [中二病也要谈恋爱! - 维基百科，自由的百科全书 [https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E4%B8%AD%E4%BA%8C%E7%97%85%E4%B9%9F%E6%83%B3%E8%AB%87%E6%88%80%E6%84%9B%EF%BC%81?utm_](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E4%B8%AD%E4%BA%8C%E7%97%85%E4%B9%9F%E6%83%B3%E8%AB%87%E6%88%80%E6%84%9B%EF%BC%81?utm_) source=chatgpt.com]

## Considerations for Hypothesis (Q2)
- The desire to be special.
    - Cognitive developmental research defines personal fable as a narrative tendency in which "the self is the hero of the drama," and also points to the adaptive aspect in which strong "[[special desires]]" protect self-esteem.
    - Individual differences in need for uniqueness are correlated with parental overprotection and excessive praise.
- Early Childhood → Elementary School Gap
    - [The drop from "omnipotence at home" to the school average is reported as "self-discrepancy stress" and leads to rebellion and delusions of grandiosity that become apparent during adolescence.
- Manga/game influence
    - In Japan, where there are many chunibi-like works, "kitchen poses and spell chanting" are specifically presented as a repertoire of behavior, creating an environment that is easy to imitate (the [[cultural script]] hypothesis).
- Social Feedback
    - In the online community, "edgelord" characters are more likely to win approval, and symptoms tend to linger in a reinforcement-learning fashion.

## summary and suggestions
.
- Chuunibyou is a [[named phenomenon]] that is a fusion of universal [[adolescent cognition]] + Japan's unique pop culture, and is essentially a universal "[[adolescent egocentrism]]".
- Watching over: It is easier to fulfill [[self-efficacy]] in a healthy way by sublimating [[exaggerated behavior]] into [[creative activities]] and [[community participation]] rather than just denying it.
- If one can join one's "[[sense of specialness]]" to [[social contribution]], the chuuni can be turned into a "[[budding motivation]]".
