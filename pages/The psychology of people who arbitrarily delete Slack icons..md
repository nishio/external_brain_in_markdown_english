People who delete items placed in "[[everyone's place]]" such as custom Slack emojis without [[consensus building]] can be divided into four main types: (1) order-oriented and fastidious, (2) authority-promoting and controlling, (3) risk-averse and brand-protecting, and (4) unaware and mishandling. (3) risk-averse and brand-protecting, and (4) unaware and mishandling. Below we explain the motivations and background, and provide hints on how to deal with them.

- Organizers "don't like clutter," consider superfluous icons = noise and delete them immediately.
- Appeal to authority "I'm the manager" signal to show off authority and secure control
- Risk alert "to avoid flames," blocking copyright, brand, and external leakage risks.
- Inadvertent "I didn't know it affected the entire company" UI/authority misinterpretation and mishandling

Ensure psychological safety
- "Respecting someone's favorite creation" conveys the value of "respecting someone's favorite creation" and discourages impulsive behavior.
