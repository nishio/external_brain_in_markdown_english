> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1648181108713074688?s=20): I let my guard down thinking, "I'll never need English speaking skills again in my life," and suddenly I need them by a month from now. You can never let your guard down. I guess I should charge for an English conversation school and force myself to spend time speaking only English. I think I was level 6 at Gaba back in the day, wonder how much I'm dropping by not using it...

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1648225589722234880) I bought a [[Bone Conduction Headset]] so I can listen to English podcasts and try to get to the next event venue
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1648232198590595072) It was great for walking to the station, but not when the train starts running. I also brought my AirPods in case that happens.
- > [@kuboon](https://twitter.com/kuboon/status/1648233994692214784?s=20): @nishio I also recommend a combination of bone conduction and earplugs
- > When I put in earplugs, I suddenly hear bone conduction better.


> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1648268592427991041): seems to be a Murder Mystery from China!
