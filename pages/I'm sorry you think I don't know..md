title: "I'm sorry you think I don't know."

Regarding one person saying, "I am very sorry if you think I might not know X."

from [/villagepump/ sorry you think I don't know](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/ sorry you think I don't know).
Suppose that Mr. B acts to teach X, assuming that "A does not know X" about X, which he A knows.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- I can understand being miffed and disappointed in A's position.
    - I get miffed myself sometimes.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I took some time to think about it, and I don't think I'd ever say to someone, "It's too bad you don't know that I know X."
            - I can't help what I don't know, even if you told me that.
            - I have a feeling it's just going to come down to, "Oh, you're sorry."
- I think it's reasonable to assume that from B's perspective, "we don't know what A knows and what he doesn't know."
    - B doesn't know "I know X" because it's about A's inner life.
        - Unless A has stated in advance what he knows about X...
        - There was a similar story just the other day.

If she did, then the man who shared the information with [[futility]] is [[stupid]]. If not, then the woman is stupid for [[assuming]] that others know her [[inside]]. (4/10)
