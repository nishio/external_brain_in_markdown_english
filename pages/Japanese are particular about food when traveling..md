It is one of the aspects that Japanese people do not recognize. There are not that many people who travel for the purpose of eating delicious food.

>  Japanese respondents ranked "want to visit world heritage sites" (7.1%) and "want to relieve stress" (4.7%) within the top 10, but these were also found not to be included in China, the United Kingdom, or the United States. Wanting to eat good food," which ranked second in Japan, ranked eighth in China. It did not rank in the top 10 in the U.S. and U.K.
