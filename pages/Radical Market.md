<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>Key takeaways from the book, "Radical Markets," by Glenn Weil and Eric Posner, include
- The current [[market economy]] has problems such as [[monopolization]], [[disparity]], and stagnation. This suggests the need to review the market rules themselves.
- The [[property system]] should be reformed and a [[joint ownership self-assessment tax]] (COST) should be introduced. This would create incentives for property owners to properly value their property, and would result in more efficient [[resource allocation]].
- The [[one-person, one-vote]] system should be replaced by [[quadratic voting]] (QV), which maximizes the [[collective well-being]] of society by allowing individuals to vote more on issues they value.
- [[Liberalization of immigration]] should be promoted and a system should be created where appropriate compensation is paid between the host country and the immigrants. The economic benefits of immigration will be widely enjoyed by society.
- Limit [[corporate control]] by [[institutional investors]] and increase the influence of [[individual shareholders]]. This will prevent the concentration of [[market dominance]] and promote innovation and competition.
- A system should be established where data is treated as a form of labor and data providers are appropriately compensated. Prevent [[data monopolies]] and enable [[decentralized innovation]].  #DataLabor
The authors argue that through radical [[market reforms]] such as those described above, negative aspects such as inequality and monopolies can be corrected while maximizing the use of market forces.
