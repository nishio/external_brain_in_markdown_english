I was told by my boss, an old man in his 50s, "You know a lot about it. You should hold a study session. Why is it that the first option for old men when they want to understand something is "[[study meeting]]"? I'd understand much better if I made an account and touched it for 5 minutes, right?

We need to subdivide a little more among those who want to have a study group.
- A: I want others to provide knowledge and I want the place to be set up by others as well.
    - the worst
- B: You want others to contribute knowledge and you set up the place.
    - This would be a different kind of resource trade, not bad.
    - Will trade with C.
- C: Participate in a forum set up by someone else and offer your knowledge

A is not bad because it's a "trade of different kinds of resources" if, for example, B pays at a level that makes it profitable.
- It's a pain in the ass when people make the mistake of thinking "I'm a customer because I paid, so entertain me" when in reality they didn't pay a lot of money.

[[Better to learn by doing than by being taught.]]
- [[Learn]]
    - [[experience]]
