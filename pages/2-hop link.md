title: "2-hop link"
---

It is a useful concept, but the notation is shaky. The person who invented it uses "two-hop link," so the title of this page has been adapted.
- Consideration of [/masui/2-hop link](https://scrapbox.io/masui/2-hop link).

Not just "show two ahead".
- [[I didn't understand the /villagepump/2 hop link]].
    - [[2 hop link]]
    - [[2 hop links]]

Brief description from [[Obsidian 2022-06-17]].
- Notice X to Y when there is a link X->A Y->A
- that pages that mention the same page (=concept) must be related.
