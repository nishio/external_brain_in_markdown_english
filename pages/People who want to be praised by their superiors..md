People who want to be praised by their superiors.
> [zunzun428](https://twitter.com/zunzun428/status/1780568406905024878) If you don't experience much praise from your parents in your childhood, you look to your "boss" for that role in society.
>
>  So you work to get praise from your boss.
>
>  This can work out perfectly if you work under a boss who looks at his/her subordinates well and gives them praise and approval, but most bosses don't give that much praise... → ...

> [zunzun428](https://twitter.com/zunzun428/status/1780569085379789147) To begin with, it is too heavy to ask such a role from the boss...
>  If you work hard and continue to not be praised and appreciated
>
>  "I, I'm not wanted.
>
>  and you feel more frustrated. Then you think, "If I work harder, won't they recognize me?" and you work too hard and end up crushed.

> [zunzun428](https://twitter.com/zunzun428/status/1780569641238339934) The role of the boss is management, not an approver of the subordinate's raison d'etre or whatever... Holy shit!
>
>  So I wonder if those who have experienced being crushed by working too hard have become focused on "getting praise and recognition from bosses and coworkers" rather than "doing what I want to do.

> [zunzun428](https://twitter.com/zunzun428/status/1780571322814439463) You might want to think about it.
>
>  Holy shit, it's actually easy to let other people's evaluation axes determine how you evaluate yourself.
>  You can do what you are told, you don't have to think about what you want to do, and you can blame others if you fail... →.

> [zunzun428](https://twitter.com/zunzun428/status/1780571740764348496) Of course, other people's evaluations are important in work, but if you don't learn to praise yourself, you can't give yourself a break. If you don't learn to praise yourself, you won't be able to give yourself a break, and you'll end up working too hard and getting crushed...over and over again. I'll tell myself that I'm doing my best.

> [zunzun428](https://twitter.com/zunzun428/status/1780572468819984602) There are also light psychopath bosses who know what they're doing, praise them a lot, and make them work like a horse with a carrot hanging in front of it to make it run. I'm not going to fall for that.... I'm done.
