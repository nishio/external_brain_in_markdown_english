- [[Drucker.]]
> The highest priority for one's own [[growth]] is the pursuit of excellence. From this comes enrichment and confidence (in oneself).

- It's not hard to outrun those who avoid making the effort to outdo you.
- Excellence is [[Knowledge Exchange Requirements]] and has nothing to do with the total amount of knowledge
    - From the opposite perspective [[Learn from those with little knowledge.]].


> The highest priority for one's own growth is the pursuit of excellence. From this comes fulfillment and confidence. Competence is significant because it not only changes the quality of work, but also changes the human being. Without competence, there can be no good work, no confidence, and no personal growth.

> The first priority for the non-profit executive’s own development is to strive for excellence. That brings satisfaction and self-respect. Workmanship counts, not just because it makes such a difference in the quality of the job done but because it makes such a difference in the person doing the job. Without craftsmanship, there is neither a good job, nor self-respect, nor personal growth.
