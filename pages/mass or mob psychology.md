- > At the end of the 19th century, when [[democracy]] was advancing and the "[[crowd]]" was driving history, French social psychologist Gustave Le Bon attempted to elucidate the psychology of crowds from a psychological perspective. [Based on historical facts such as the French Revolution and the emergence of the Napoleon, he sharply analyzed the characteristics of "crowd psychology" and its merits and demerits, and warned against the "irrational behavior of the crowd" associated with immature minds such as "following blindly. This is a classic work that paved the way for the development of today's social psychology research.
