title: "Is the technology lasting longer or are people staying?"
---

When someone A says about a technology X, "X is a long-lasting technology, I use it for a long time, therefore X is good," whether technology X is really what that person A interprets it to be, or whether A just keeps staying in the range ([[comfort zone]]) of "what X can do," is [[ observation of the same phenomenon from different perspectives]].
