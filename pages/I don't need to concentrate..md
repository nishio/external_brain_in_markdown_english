    - [(powers of) concentration
    - [[Hirotsugu Mori]]
- [Amazon](http://amzn.to/2HmO7OV)

    - [I was thinking, "Is it good to focus?" and my wife told me.

- It is said that Hiroshi Mori can write 6,000 words in an hour, but this is only the equivalent of writing 1,000 words in 10 minutes, and in reality he cannot sustain it for an hour. p.63
        - [[pomodoro]] has a similar misconception: people talk about working intensively for 25 minutes, the author himself says it would be better if he could do it 8 times a day, but people say "8 hours a day, so he should be able to do 16 pomodoro".
