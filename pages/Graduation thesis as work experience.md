- You're going to get shit code, you're not going to get the source code carried over,
- I couldn't verbalize it well, so I was thinking about it bewilderingly,
- "Isn't it because you're doing 'the [[thesis]] as [[work experience]]?'"
- The first time I saw this, I was surprised.

- A thesis that emphasizes [[experiencing the process]] rather than research results ([[human resource development]])
- We want to give them the experience of building software from scratch, so we don't take over their assets.
- It's not worth passing on because those people created it.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> I see.
- Well, it's certainly hard to do "continuous software development" with [[people who graduate and are gone in a few years]], so it's a form of "experience the process and bye-bye".
- In the first place, when [[novelty (patentability)]] occupies a large weight in the evaluation function, I think the problem is that the evaluation function is crazy because it encourages the act of destroying and rebuilding new software rather than improving existing software, both in universities and companies (...).
