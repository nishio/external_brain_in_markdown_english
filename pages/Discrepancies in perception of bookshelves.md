- This episode shows how people can look at the same object but perceive and pay attention to it differently. The husband does not notice that the door of the bookcase has been removed and focuses only on the red book.
- The "familiar" phenomenon of everyday life affected her ability to recognize changes in things, and her husband was not aware of the existence of the bookcase door itself.
- In communication, the gap between expectations and actual perceptions is highlighted as a source of misunderstanding and interesting misconceptions.

- Discrepancies in perception of bookshelves
    - My wife asked me, "You know what changed when I looked at your bookshelf?" She asked me.
        - He thought for a moment, noticed a red book in the middle, and replied, "I don't think this book was on the bookshelf before."
        - They told me, "You really don't see it."
    - Commentary by my wife
        - The bookcase had wooden doors.
        - They put a box in front of that door with red books, etc.
        - The door would not open, so I removed the door.
    - Commentary.
        - In fact, no one was aware that there were "bookcases with doors."
        - Rather, you put the thing in front of the door because you were no longer aware that it was a bookshelf.
    - Maybe my cognitive style is more wrong, but I found the examples of discrepancies interesting, so I recorded them.
