title: "An industry where people fighting with their real names get the sack."

> [gucci0730](https://x.com/gucci0730/status/1828435010204115105) I would like to tell students who want to become architects. I would like to tell aspiring architects to ignore the people who criticize you on [[anonymous account]] even though you are in the same profession, because they are scum and they just want to show off their knowledge. Who would dream of an industry where people who are fighting for the future of the architectural world with their real names on their shoulders are beaten to a pulp? I fear that the culture of architecture in Japan will be crushed.

> [gucci0730](https://x.com/gucci0730/status/1828437885332398090) I don't expect you to agree with everything. It is rather wonderful that there are various opinions from all angles on the architecture being planned. However, I think this current situation is too hard on the architects who are fighting on the front lines. I wonder what will happen if the industry puts unnecessary pressure on Mr. Kudo and the other young architects involved in the Expo.

> [gucci0730](https://x.com/gucci0730/status/1828440787941839273) I want to visit the completed pavilion and tell the architect directly what I experienced and thought. I don't know how many years it will take, but I want to catch up with them so that I can meet them and tell them directly what I thought was good and what I thought was not good.

> [gucci0730](https://x.com/gucci0730/status/1828442882581340348) I wish everyone would monitor the anonymous critics of their peers to see if they went to the Expo afterwards. There is no one more untrustworthy than a person who criticizes something so highly and then doesn't go see the architecture.

- [[real name]]   [[anonymity]]
[[Criticize, don't go see]]
