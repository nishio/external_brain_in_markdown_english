Examples of spam accounts pretending to be disaster-related on social media
2024-01-01 Observed during earthquake in Japan
It's like a monster imitating human noises.

> [YoshifumiSeki](https://twitter.com/YoshifumiSeki/status/1741783144150204814) I saw a lot of Arabic in an account that tweets "please help me" with an address, and I got the impression that a monster that learns popular tweets and generates similar tweets is active. I'm not sure if it's the same thing or not, but I'm sure it's not the same thing.

> [mitsumame_pkmn](https://twitter.com/mitsumame_pkmn/status/1741747567594189234) Arabic solid that is cracking up with words or tagging earthquake or tsunami, know what you can do and what you really can't. You should know what you can and can't do.

>  I've been getting a tremendous amount of spam posted, what's this?

> [FhkrmKk](https://twitter.com/FhkrmKk/status/1741784011276775477/photo/1) These weirdos are copying earthquake and tsunami related posts all over the place, so I'm watching the news and reporting and blocking spam.
