AI Task Management System 2025-01-19
- [[AI Task Management System]] is so good that when I loaded backlog.json into o1 Pro and asked for advice, I got the following
- Devin or 4o is fine for everyday use
- It would be nice if o1 could look at the whole idea once a week or so.
    - Right now I'm only saying "advise me" as appropriate, but it would be good to improve the prompt more.
What is the task T0011 that is being trapped.
- This is like "important, but the condition of completion is unclear, so it's left without a done status".
- 4o can assist in organizing it properly.
It would be interesting to do the same thing a week later and compare.

Briefly summarize the overall status of the task, its priority and how it will proceed.

1. hold down the flow of tasks with dependencies
- T0011 → T0012 → T0013
    - The task recording mechanism design (T0011) is the foundation. After the design is complete, the process proceeds to AI instance role definition (T0012) and finally to knowledge documentation (T0013).
- T0008 → T0009 / T0010
    - MVID Data Set Analysis (T0008) must be completed before proceeding to TTTC Configuration File Generation (T0009) and Report Sharing Environment Documentation (T0010).

Priority Actions
- Early completion of T0011 (task recording mechanism)
- Proceed with T0008 (MVID dataset analysis) in parallel or immediately after

2. prioritize tasks with immediate deadlines and due dates
- T3243 (due 1/31): Plurality book guerrilla check
- T0057 (2/25): Lecture on Democratic Scalability
- T0058 (2/5): In-house presentation (not yet finalized, but we'll get an overview as soon as possible)

Priority Actions
- Proceed with Guerra Check (T3243) as a top priority.
- For the February lectures (T0057, T0058), at least an outline of the contents should be prepared at an early stage.

3. organizing larger system-related tasks
- AI Direct Writable Management System (T0017)
- ChatGPT + Advanced Voice conversation export (T0018)
- Digest function for electronic KJ method (T0021)
- Private Look Back System (T0022)
- AI input system as Inbox for GTD (T0023)
- Integrated Management of Public and Private Information (T0024)
- Automated Periodic Digest (T0025)
- Task management using ChatGPT 4.0 API (T0027)
Since there are many "system improvement" and "automation systems" such as the following, it is efficient to create a roadmap of tasks in the same line first to organize duplication and order.

4. individual points of interest
- T0026 (Completion Task Management System)
    - Consider a simple mechanism that can be easily incorporated into existing task management to reduce the operational burden.
- T0034 (OpenAI API Mocking)
    - Direct use of LLM for testing is not reproducible, so mocking is necessary. Since it directly improves the quality of automation tasks in general, it will be easier later on if you start early.
- T0035 (Task Persistence Guarantee)
    - Important task to prevent "task loss" that tends to occur frequently in task management via LLM. This group is close to the highest priority group as infrastructure tasks.
- Reading Support (T0051-T0054)
    - The goal is to improve the efficiency of personal information input. Although not urgent, non-destructive scanning of physical books (T0052) is time-consuming and labor-intensive, so it would be good to try it early to identify problems.

5. progress on personal and practical tasks
- T1766 (jersey purchase), T0056 (Novolok registration), etc. are Done.
- T0028 (Transcription of interview audio) → T0050 (Investigation and correction of inconsistencies)
    - Checking accuracy of transcription and correction flow is important; ensure a final human check system to avoid relying on AI.

6. simple action summary
- Complete (now) T0011 & T0008 to move subsequent tasks
- (During January) Plurality book guerrilla check (T3243) Top priority
- (Toward February) Lecture preparation systems (T0057, T0058) make outlines/slides early, clarify backlog and schedule.
- (System lineage) Since there are many dependencies and similar functions, group tasks once to create a roadmap, and proceed in the order of infrastructure system (T0035, etc.), then individual functions.
- (Reading support system) Perform scanning trials (T0052) when time is available, and verify practicality of OCR/AI collaboration.

If you proceed in this fashion, you will be able to do high-priority tasks that meet deadlines while eliminating dependency blockages.
