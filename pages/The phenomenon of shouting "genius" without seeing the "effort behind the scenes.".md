The phenomenon of people shouting "[[genius]]" without seeing the "effort behind the effort."

- There's this story about an engineer's intellectual production techniques." Sometimes you look at someone else's activity and think, "I wonder how he came up with this way of doing things, ... maybe he's a genius," but you feel that way because you don't see the huge amount of trial and error he's doing behind the scenes." On Twitter, it really feels like this is a remarkable phenomenon.
- What I wanted to convey through this story is that there is no need to be depressed and say, "He's a genius, but I'm a useless guy who can't do anything..." Instead, we should do a lot of trial and error, discover 10,000 different ways that don't work, and finally find one good way to do it. He can write about his last discovery on Twitter, and voila, a genius is born.
