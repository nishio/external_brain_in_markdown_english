A [[sci-fi]] [[short short (story)]] series on Twitter.
- A world where an alien civilization is sending out information to homo sapiens via Twitter.
- Its protagonist is Mr. Qualia.

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1586924110403162112?s=20&t=8fFeOavxyts7SwG1UBnbyA): Q: Is Qualia an enemy of humanity? Is she an ally?
> A: Of course, we are not enemies. To use a simple analogy, we are doctors. We think it is good to cure the diseases of Homo sapiens civilization. Some young Homo sapiens are afraid of doctors, but that is foolish.
