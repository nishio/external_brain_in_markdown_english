title: "current topics"
---

I believe that some people have a mental condition that causes them to repeatedly say a few words about current events. What causes this?

Is it more likely to get a reaction if you say something about current events?
- Is it actually high? Misperceived as high?
- People who are starved because they usually don't get reactions no matter what they tweet, happen to get reactions when they happen to comment on current events, and end up getting addicted.
        - A kind of [[reaction dependence]]?

relevance
    - [[person who craves the limelight]]
