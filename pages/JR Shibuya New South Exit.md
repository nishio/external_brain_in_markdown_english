title: "JR Shibuya New South Exit"
---

> Originally, the area around [[Shibuya Station]] was divided by the JR line from east to west and by Route 246 from north to south, and there has long been a problem of weak pedestrian flow lines.

> Left: The "South Exit North Free Passage" connecting "Shibuya Stream" and "Shibuya Sakura Stage" across the JR line.　Right: "JR New South Gate" connecting to the "South Exit North Walkway" will be open for service. Date of photo = July 18, 2024
>  Access to Sakuragaoka-cho, Nanpeidai, and Dogenzaka will become dramatically more convenient by using the "JR New South Gate" and "[[West Exit Underground Passage]]" which will be relocated and newly constructed on July 21.

I see

The other day, I looked at a Google Map plan at random and when I got out of the central ticket gate, I couldn't get to where I wanted to go at all.
In such a case, I would say, "Let's go to the first floor for now," but I can't go through the first floor, so I guess that's a mistake.
