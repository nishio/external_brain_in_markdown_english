fuzzy set
1005:  [[fuzzy set]]

An ordinary set (crisp set) is expressed in terms of whether each object belongs to the set (1) or not (0). Fuzzy sets extend this "membership" of 0 or 1 to real values between 0 and 1. #From Discrete to Continuous

Fuzzy sets are [Boundaries are ambiguous.
    - [[Boundary blurring]]
    - For example, the blurring of organizational boundaries is not a binary "belonging/not belonging" but allows for intermediate ways of belonging
        - The process of moving from the perception of "company employee" as only working five days a week, eight hours a day to one that includes reduced days and reduced hours.

This is done in the reverse direction [[Discretization of real numbers]].

### summary of notes
.
A fuzzy set is a set whose boundaries are ambiguous, with a real value between 0 and 1 indicating whether the subject belongs to the set or not. For example, the disambiguation of an organization's boundary is not a binary "belongs/not belongs" but rather admits intermediate ways of belonging. The discretization of real numbers does this in the opposite direction.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The fragment "It is a false dichotomy to take it as a set" is related to the idea of fuzzy sets in the memo. A fuzzy set expresses whether an object belongs to a set as a real value between 0 and 1, and admits continuous values rather than binary values. This is consistent with the fragment's assertion that "it is a false dichotomy to take it as a set".

### deep thinking
The fuzzy set concept allows us to view things from a continuous perspective rather than a dichotomous one. This reflects the continuous nature of many phenomena in the real world. The existence of the reverse process, the discretization of real numbers, also indicates that an interconversion between continuous and discrete is possible.
