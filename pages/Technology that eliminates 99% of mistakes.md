- Nikkei Associe April 2018 [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2GrZl8Q)
- My wife insists I read it.
- For what?
    - Not to mimic this, the circumstances surrounding the work process are different for each job.
    - Keep in mind the types of mistakes that can occur and the types of measures to prevent recurrence when mistakes occur, and use them in combination when you are in a position to consider preventive measures and recurrence prevention measures
- That means the same as programming.
    - This is like a library reference or sample collection
- According to my wife, "Nothing is ever 'huh.'"
    - They say it's all stuff that everyone thinks they know.
    - If you want me to read it, you're telling me that I don't know something that everybody knows.

Gen Terao, Barmuda: "I don't make safe choices because I don't want to make mistakes. Put yourself into interesting and difficult work, and you will become more resistant to mistakes."
- Learning from Mistakes
- Increased ability to detect mistakes
- Increased tolerance for mistakes and faster recovery

This is [[DIPS Intellectual Productivity System]], which is introduced as an example of FCE. p30
- I use [[HIROEN]] as a perspective to subdivide tasks.
