There is person A, who operates solely within the company, and person B, who crosses the [[Organization's Boundaries]]. #CrossingBoundaries

Assume both A and B use the same skills and effort in their activities. When evaluating activities only within the company, person A receives a higher evaluation.

This "[[Internal-Only Evaluation]]" makes engaging in activities outside the company disadvantageous for individuals.
- Consequently, more employees like person A, who engage in "internal-only activities," will emerge.
- As a result, in the long term, the company will lose [[Connections Outside the Company]] and be at a disadvantage.
    - For example, the [[Cost of Acquiring Knowledge]] from outside will increase, making it difficult to adapt to external changes.

This is an example of [[Optimization Against a Misguided Evaluation Function]].
- To avoid this phenomenon, the form of evaluation needs to change.
- Activities outside the company should be evaluated equally to those inside, making "internal-only activities" and "[[Activities Outside]]" equally valued.
- If a culture where "internal-only activities" are predominant has already formed, it is necessary to evaluate "activities outside" higher than "internal activities" to promote external engagement.

To mitigate the tendency for "external activities" to be undervalued based on current internal values, it is useful to refer to "external evaluations."
- [[Cybozu]] considering [[Market Evaluation]] is an example of this interpretation.
    - [When We Stopped Deciding Salaries Based Solely on Internal Evaluations, Diverse Work Styles Became Possible | Cybozu Style](https://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m001021.html)

This thought occurred while listening to [[BMOT20190411]].
