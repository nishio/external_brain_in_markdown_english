Updated README.
> This is a repository that demonstrates "AI-assisted code reading" as one of the applications of Yasukazu Nishio's research on "efficiently extracting information from large amounts of information and creating value for humans". It aims to efficiently extract information from large amounts of source code to understand and improve the state of the repository.
>  Furthermore, when "a large amount of information" becomes "the opinion of many people", it becomes "[[broad listening]]". When abstracted one step further, there is not much difference in structure.

Before you start making WebUI or something, first [[concierge-type MVP]].

I used to put it on Gist, but then I thought it would be hard to find it later when I was wondering "what was it?". I thought it would be difficult to find it by search, so I put it in a repo and added a link to it in Cosense.
Especially the feeling that this is useful in the long run, especially since I was able to get him to verbalize "what kind of revision process he has been following" as something I tried today.

If you looks something interesting but the auto-translated English is not good enough to understand it, feel free to let me know at [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en). I'm very happy to spread my thought to non-Japanese readers.
