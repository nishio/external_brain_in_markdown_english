title: "stamp notation"
---

is probably not the name of the named now to refer to this concept.

A few days ago? ago, I started actively using a notation that expands [[iconic notation]] by further bracketing it
- concrete example
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/上に積む/icon' alt='上に積む.icon' height="19.5"/>

I feel this is very good.
- Name]" is a [[handle]] <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/handle/icon' alt='handle.icon' height="19.5"/> for "[[concept]]", but existing word combinations are not always the best way to refer to that concept
    - Sometimes I feel it's better represented with images.
