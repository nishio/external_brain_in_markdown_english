- Why is that?" ([[why]]) repeatedly [[delving into]], you will eventually reach [[The Limits of Science]], and when you get further answers to the "why" from there, you will obtain [[physics]] knowledge. The image of dividing.
- On the other hand, when you have something you want to make or realize and you ask yourself, "How can I make it?" ([[how]]), we attach them together by saying, "Let's combine this and that.
- Sometimes the result of attaching is different from what was [[expected]]. By asking "Why is it different from what I expected?", we can gain [[engineering]] insight. By actually taking action, you will notice [[blind spots]].


- Right-side thinking and left-side thinking are not antithetical.
    - The figure expresses that there is also a "digging down" phase in the right side of the idea, which is aimed at ascending
    - Conversely, there is a phase in the left side of the concept, which is not drawn but is intended to dig deeper, in which "if this hypothesis is correct, this is what should happen" "[[experiment]]" is performed and the results are seen. This is the same as the right side.
    - They zigzag along with each other.
