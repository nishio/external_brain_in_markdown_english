title: "Fedibird Reference"
---

summary
- Fedibird can "reference" multiple posts
    - > References are complementary to replies, quotes, and boosts.
    - > Unlike replies, you can mention more than one post. [src](https://fedibird.com/@noellabo/108082057659111183)
- You may loosely couple the clarification of the mention and the notification to the person mentioned, and only do the former.
    - > References can make references explicit.
    - > Mentions will not be included and the other party will not be notified.

I pressed it thinking that (A) it adds the post to a global "reference list" of sorts, and (B) when I try to post normally, it tells me that a reference has been granted. Then when I try to post normally, (B) it tells me that a reference is being added. I did this without understanding either A or B, so I got an unintended reference. I think.
>  If that post had not contained a link, it probably would have shown the reference, but it happened to contain a link to an external page, so it was overwritten.
