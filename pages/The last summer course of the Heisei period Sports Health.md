- They discuss what challenges lie ahead if we were to become a society where everyone is healthy and enjoys sports.
- The keywords are "[[wellbeing]]" and "[[solitude]] and [[connection]]. In particular, it is important to build relationships with people you can rely on when you are in trouble.
- Sports are both "exercise (individual physical activity)" and "social participation (community building)," and the latter can be part of the solution to the problems of loneliness and the elderly.
- However, it was also pointed out that public places and school gymnasiums are not readily available due to laws, use of facilities, and responsibilities.
- Connections through the use of technology (AR/VR, online matching, etc.) and ideas to open up hospital waiting rooms and in-hospital facilities were also raised, and the creation of new venues for interaction is needed.
- Ultimately, the major focus is on "[[not]] leaving people alone," i.e., how to create shared spaces where diverse people can come together.

Explanation of points
- Health and Sports
    - Once the majority of the population is exercising and becoming healthier, the next step is "higher order issues for society and individuals". For example, how to prevent isolation and increase wellbeing.
- The Importance of Solitude and Connection
    - A major influence on the level of happiness in Japan is whether or not there are people to whom one can turn when in need. Sports and community activities can easily become the foundation for such connections.
- Two Faces of Sports
    - Exercise: Improve health through personal physical activity
    - Social participation: building friendships and preventing isolation through participation in teams and clubs
    - Emphasizing the latter is effective in preventing dementia in the elderly and creating friendships among young people.
- Usage environment and institutional issues
    - Public facilities such as parks and school gymnasiums are often restricted in their use due to safety and liability issues.
    - However, there are many vacant hours, such as at night, and there is an opinion that it would be better if they could be opened more flexibly.
- Technology Utilization
    - Use AR and VR to visualize sports that are difficult to understand, and utilize means to easily connect online.
    - As in the case of snow shoveling in Finland, there could be a way to link daily activities to exercise.
- New uses for hospitals and public spaces
    - Hospitals are "safe and professional places," but difficult to use outside of illness. On the other hand, the waiting room can be a natural place for conversation.
    - Opening more public spaces, such as hospitals and parks, to the community has the potential to create places where people living alone and the elderly are not isolated.

In summary, in a "society where everyone is healthy enough to play sports," the next major themes are "how to reduce loneliness" and "how to create and support connections with others. Sports itself will take many different forms, and it will be necessary to consider not only the promotion of individual health, but also community participation and the use of public space in a comprehensive manner.
