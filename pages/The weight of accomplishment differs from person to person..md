title: "The weight of accomplishment differs from person to person."
---

[[Social Hack Day #70]], I heard someone who did [[Open StarTer Village]] say, "There were a lot of projects, but they were just different flavors and not really related to the game."
- (I think it's fine the way it is now because it would be too difficult if it wasn't so game relevant, but that's beside the point.)
- Every project accomplishment is two points, every contribution is one point.
    - In reality, everyone has different "preferences" and different degrees of what they want to see accomplished in different projects.
    - When it comes to distributing 5 contribution tokens to any project, "which project to distribute them to" is influenced by the preferences of the project.
        - In reality, I think we contribute the most per unit of time when we do our "preferred projects" and "preferred ways to contribute".
    - The victory point "impact point" itself is not subjective to the individual, but rather a sort of evaluation from the "masses", so it is not surprising that it is out of step with personal preferences.
        - Not all individuals use "influence on the masses" as a KPI to begin with.
        - This is what happens when you're constrained by the fact that this is a game and there's no way to decide who wins and who loses without setting common KPIs for everyone.
