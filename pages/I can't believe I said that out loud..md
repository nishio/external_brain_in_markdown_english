> [kumagi](https://x.com/kumagi/status/1832050035569340890) The fable "[[ant and grasshopper]]" has a punchline that admonishes, "If you don't prepare for the future, you'll be in trouble someday," but reality is ruthless, so you neglect to save. The grasshopper, wielding human rights, comes to threaten the ant, saying, "It's obvious what will happen if we squeeze social security, isn't it?

>  It's obvious what happens if you squeeze social security under those circumstances.

I think that Kumagi-san is probably in need of some kind of welfare or support right now.
