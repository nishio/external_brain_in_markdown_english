title: "It's normal to fail vs. a company should not fail"

> [atrzdflw](https://twitter.com/atrzdflw/status/1699775904451584024) A founder of a listed company told me that it was really difficult to steer the company during the start-up period when people who were completely different from us joined the company. I asked him about it.

>  "I had a spirit of "[[failure is normal]]" with my colleagues from the founding period, and we had an agreement to fix what we were not doing one by one.
>  "Gradually, however, people started coming in with the attitude that "[[the company]] can't fail," and dissatisfaction with internal processes and systems that were not fully in place exploded."
>  "Plus, they think the company is bad, so they don't want to take steps to remedy the situation themselves."
>  and the reality was amazing.

I think the difference between a company's growth and its growth is when the company expands and new employees join the company. I think the company will not grow if it learns how easy it is to work with colleagues and starts to exclude new employees.

- [[failure avoidance]]
- [[failure]]
