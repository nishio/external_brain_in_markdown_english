- [[broad listening]] is [[glasses]] for a better view of people's opinions.
    - [[Wearing glasses does not make your eyes unnecessary.]]  by Audrey Tang

What is that "[[seeing]] better"?
- People often ask, "Aren't online opinions biased?" The question is asked, "Are opinions on the Internet biased?
    - This implicitly assumes that it is ideal to get the correct ratio of data
    - I felt a real difference in this regard, but I couldn't verbalize how it was different.
- Vaguely looking at opinions makes it seem like the "big, prominent opinion" is all there is.
    - It looks like a dichotomy between big opinion A and the opposing big opinion B.
    - But if you look closely, neither A nor B is monolithic, and there are many slightly different opinions.
    - Opinions C, D, E, ... that are neither A nor B There are also
    - The key to developing the conflict between A and B in a productive direction is those detailed opinions

        - 2025-08-22 [[Broad Listening is a qualitative analysis]] I added the picture because this article was discussed in the context of
- Not much point in being "right ratio" on this.
    - The information that A is 60% and B is 30% is meaningless.
        - The distribution of people's opinions is not clearly segregated, only those who stand out are segregated.
        - So the percentage changes depending on how the boundaries are drawn: [[Division and the Silent Majority]].
    - It doesn't even matter if C is 1% or 2%.
        - Fluctuates due to noise
        - It is important to realize that "C exists."

After "[[Broad Listening and Brainstorming]]" was verbalized, this was retroactively verbalized.
