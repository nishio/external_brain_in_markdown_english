title: "Third character."

When you're thinking about [[interaction]] between two parties, there's actually a third character.

The composition is similar to [[choosing the wrong two options]] in that it is "assuming there are two, but there may be a third." It falls into the [[Wrong 2]] series, but "wrong two-party interaction" could be interpreted in a different way.
