Q: Is it difficult to have a discussion on the Internet without a correct answer?
- I think the term "internet" is overly vague on this one.
    - It's going to be hard to have a debate without the right answers in "a place where everyone has an inexhaustible amount of say, and as a result, the total volume of statements is so great that no one reads them all."
    - The speech arena is a place where "hearing the whole story" is achieved by restricting the right to speak.
