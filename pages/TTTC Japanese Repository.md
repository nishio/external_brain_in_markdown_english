title: "TTTC Japanese Repository"
---

It was too much trouble to release a patch in a separate repository for something that only changed the UI, so I released it in the form of a patch (2024-07-17).
- [How to use Talk to the City in the Tokyo Gubernatorial Election 2024｜NISHIO Hirokazu](https://note.com/nishiohirokazu/n/n0661204bda5b)

However, afterwards, when I started applying it in various environments, I thought it might be better to release it in the form of a repository (2024-09-19).

Why not do [[TTTC how you learned about your life choices.]] as sample data for Japanese?

The repository was already forked.
- [https://github.com/nishio/talk-to-the-city-reports](https://github.com/nishio/talk-to-the-city-reports)
- I did some pull reqs and some were waiting to be fixed.

- This branch is 2 commits behind AIObjectives/talk-to-the-city-reports:main.
    - This means my pull req has been merged.

    - Oh, I can push this.

I wonder if I can create a `japanese` branch here that doesn't push to the main house...
- UI Japaneseization patch
- Japanese Sample Prompt
    - Every time "using the one published by An's team" is subtle.
- Japanese Sample Data
    - Maybe I could do without this one.
- Japanese morphological analysis for future analysis part
        - [[TTTC: Morphological Analysis]]
