I'm sure it's not the same as the one that came up in the discussion, but I'll include GPT's explanation because it's also interesting.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/> Since [[Marx's]] theory, many scholars and thinkers have examined the structure of social institutions. Here we introduce three representative social institutions that inherit Marx's ideas but add new perspectives.

## [[Welfare State]] System
- The welfare state system is characterized by the state providing a variety of [[social welfare services]] (health insurance, pensions, unemployment insurance, etc.) to its citizens within the framework of a [[market economy]]. This system aims to reduce inequalities and social risks brought about by [[capitalism]]. The welfare state developed in the 20th century, especially in [[Scandinavian countries]], but has since been adopted by many developed countries. Since Marx, it is positioned as one of the attempts to resolve the contradictions of capitalist society.

## [[Neoliberalism]]
- Neoliberalism is an approach to economic policy that gained momentum in the late 1970s that promotes [[market liberalization]], [[privatization]], and [[deregulation]] and advocates minimal state intervention. This approach emerged as a reaction against the welfare state system, and policies that prioritize economic growth and efficiency were adopted in many countries. Neoliberalism, as another form of capitalism, provides a contrasting answer to Marx's critique of capitalism.

## [[Postmodern Social Structure]]
- Postmodern social structure is an idea that emerged in the late 20th century that critiques the traditional understanding of large-scale narratives, [[ideology]], and [[unified social structure]]. In this perspective, society is not explained by a single principle or structure, but emphasizes [[diversity]], [[difference]], and [[de-centering]]. Postmodern thought distances itself from Marxian analysis that focuses on economic foundations and seeks to understand society through [[culture]], [[identity]], [[forms of consumption]], etc.

Each of these social institutions and ideas takes the basic framework of Marxism as its starting point, yet each seeks a different direction. Each system can be seen as an attempt to deepen our understanding of the structure and function of society and to address the complexity and diversity of modern society.
