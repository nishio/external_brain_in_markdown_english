- The gap between reality and ideals creates the power to change.
        - [[creative tension]]
- But often there are forces that impede change.
        - [[Feelings of "I can't do it."]]
- It would be beneficial to break it down.
- 「 [[Why do you think it can't be done?]] 」
- There are a number of reasons why you can't do it.
- The reason for this is [[Fact or Interpretation.]].
- Is the reason [[physical restraints]]?
        - [[physical restraints]] If it's not, we can change it.
            - [[policy constraint]]

At the level of abstraction in this diagram, I think it could work, but I'm not sure it would in reality.
- I feel like digging into the negative side is a streak.
        - [[PRO Model]]

Similarly, decompositions of reality and ideals can be established
- That's [[status quo analysis tree]] and [[Future Analysis Tree]].
