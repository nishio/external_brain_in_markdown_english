The strange composition with the body disconnected, the colors and touches are all so René Magritte that I think people will be fooled if I mix them in my art collection.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>If a print on canvas were displayed in an art space and called a cat exhibition, I'd be saying, "Wow," while appreciating it.
- I'm sure I'd be completely fooled if someone gave me a caption that sounded like that....

- "a painting of a white cat in a box, an art deco painting by Gertrude Abercrombie"
- Generated by img2prompt!
- I didn't know Gertrude Abercrombie, but I'll add her to the query candidates.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>Oh, the names of painters that Nishio-san doesn't know are generated? That's amazing!

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I'm using René Magritte as my prompt, but img2prompt only gives me the generated image and doesn't know the original prompt information, so I decided that Gertrude Abercrombie is the closest to it.
- This is how you can discover painters who are close to your favorite painters.
