- [[2023 SNS Considerations]]


I am trying to verbalize something that has not yet been clearly verbalized.
- Twitter, the de facto standard, is collapsing, and people are experimenting with different social networking sites.
- [People choose different SNSs because they have different needs. In other words, we can [[subdivide the utility that SNSs satisfy]].
- There are two types of SNS: SNS as a place to input random stimuli and SNS as a destination to write down thoughts that can be written anywhere, and in my mind, the latter has become Scrapbox's main focus, so there is little need to come to SNS to write. So I dared to write on SNS instead of Scrapbox.
- I thought it would be an interesting development to think about what social networking is again, as it became relevant to my thinking about "why do some people need to chat" during the Corona period.

Key factors influencing SNS selection are summarized below:

- Providing Random Stimulation: Stimulation through the provision of new information and perspectives is part of the appeal of social networking. It provides value for unexpected information and randomization of thought.
- Concentration of Interest: Focusing on a specific subject, social networking sites may be used as a place to deepen knowledge or explore new information in that area.
- Promptness: SNSs provide real-time information. This is especially important in the context of news, educational resources, networking, and communication.
- Educational Resources: Social networking sites may be used as platforms to share knowledge, form learning communities, and explore new learning opportunities.
- Networking: Social networking sites allow individual users to connect with each other. Meet new people or maintain and strengthen existing relationships.
- Communication: SNS is a discussion forum and has a real-time nature, while tools such as Scrapbox allow for communication with a relaxed real-time nature.
- Time-synchronous chats: SNSs are also used as a place for chats that provide new perspectives and ideas to take advantage of boredom.
- Information flow and stock: Twitter and Facebook are responsible for information flow, while Scrapbox is responsible for information stock.
- Branding and Marketing: Companies and individuals build their own brands and promote their products and services through social networking sites.
- Advocacy and Activism: Social networking sites are also used to raise awareness about social and political issues and organize movements for change.

These elements can be thought of as characteristics that a SNS should have, and each SNS offers a different balance of these characteristics. Therefore, it can be said that a "good destination" is determined by how these characteristics match one's own needs.

- Your own needs.
    - That's right.
- That said, this list is hard to choose from.
- Why, because this one has cut off the branches and leaves that grew up, leaving only the base.
- That's not a good idea.
    - Rather, you should choose the branch you grew up on.
- Useful in noticing blind spots
    - I can see my "branches that haven't grown up yet."
        - What is the divergent phase that would benefit from knowing that?
    - If you want to converge now, throw out the branches that aren't growing and pick the "communication" branches that are growing.
    - If you don't need to converge now, just extend the branches that aren't growing.
        - Branding and marketing/advocacy and activism are the value I enjoy from Twitter now, even though I was unaware of it.
        - That's why I didn't see much value in moving to another social network.
        - It's not a "choose which" if you're going to do this place.
            - The objective is set to "get more followers on all social networking sites."

Create a bullet list picking out only the parts you think are useful because they are lost.
- I would have used Kozaneba in the past in terms of organizing the unorganized, but the current Kozaneba is not LLM friendly
    - New LLM-friendly tools are needed.

I am trying to verbalize something that has not yet been clearly verbalized.
- Twitter, the de facto standard, is collapsing, and people are experimenting with different social networking sites.
- I too feel that I need to find a place to move to instead of staying on Twitter.
- What is a "good destination?"
- People choose different social networking sites because they have different needs.
- In other words, the utility satisfied by SNS can be subdivided.
    - Random stimulus input
        - The Value of Being Unexpected
            - Thought [[randomizer]].
        - Concentration of interests
        - speed
    - SNS as an educational resource
        - Share knowledge, form learning communities, and explore new learning opportunities
    - Networking:.
        - Individuals connect with each other
            - Meet new people
            - Maintain or strengthen existing relationships
    - Communication: (English)
        - discussion
        - I understand that some people find value in real time, but to limit communication to real time is ridiculous.
            - Scrapbox allows for communication with less real time.
            - The well creates a place for members' attentions to gather throughout the day in the form of a diary.
        - Time-synchronous chat
            - Chit-chat is the human interaction that occurs during times of waiting and boredom
                - Presenting new perspectives or generating new ideas = Random stimulus input
            - Conditions for the conclusion of a chat:.
                - Chit-chat is most valuable in situations where there is constant "waiting" or "boredom".
                - Chatting is a form of mutual consumption, where people share their time and create value by receiving input from others.
        - Information flows and stocks:.
            - Twitter and Facebook are responsible for the flow of information (real-time information exchange),
            - Tools like Scrapbox are in charge of information stock (long-term information storage and organization).
            - Scrapbox is,
                - Discover relationships between individual entries,
                - By structuring stocked information,
                - Maximize the value of information.
            - There are social networking sites as a place to input random stimuli and social networking sites as a destination to write down thoughts that can be written anywhere, and Scrapbox became the main one for the latter in my mind
                - There's not much of a need to come write on social networking sites.
- Branding and Marketing
    - Companies and individuals use social networking sites to build their own brands and promote their products and services.
    - Accounts with a lot of followers can be used as such a tool.
- Advocacy and Activism:.
    - SNS can help raise awareness about social and political issues and organize movements for change.
    - I hadn't thought of this idea, but I certainly hear that it influenced the "Arab Spring" or something like that.

I am trying to verbalize something that I have not yet clearly verbalized. Ask questions to encourage verbalization.

Could you start by telling us a little more about what themes and perspectives you would like to deepen your thinking and verbalize? Once we know that, we can suggest more specific and valid questions. Or, if a specific theme has not yet come to mind, we can pose the question from a completely new perspective.

Do the latter.

Absolutely, which brings me to suggest some completely new perspectives on the question.
- Think about "adaptability." Today's society is rapidly changing. What do you think about individual "adaptability" to cope with these changes? What do you think are the elements necessary to enhance adaptability?
- Consider "human consciousness." How much of the reality we experience every day is objective reality and how much is shaped by our own perceptions and emotions?
- Think about "time." Time is something we feel and experience every day, but it is also an abstract concept that has no physical properties such as concrete shape or color. How do you understand such time?
- Think about "education." Today's education system is undergoing major changes due to the evolution of the Internet and AI. What do you think is the future of education?
- Consider "economic disparity." It is said that technological progress and globalization have made economic disparity more serious. What is your view on this? And what do you think is the approach to solve the problem?
Hmmm, not so good.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

Social networking services (SNS) can fulfill a variety of roles depending on their design and usage. The following are examples of some of these roles:
- Information Sharing: People use social networking sites to share news articles, blog posts, videos, images, and more. This allows users to quickly obtain information of interest.
    - This is what I read as "random stimulus input"<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - There are several elements to this as well.
        - The Value of Being Unexpected
            - Thought randomizer
        - Concentration of interests
        - speed
- Networking: Social networking sites provide a platform for individuals and organizations to connect with each other. This allows them to meet new people and maintain or strengthen existing relationships.
    - There are two elements.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Meet new people
        - Maintain or strengthen existing relationships

- Communication: Social networking sites enable real-time communication. This allows users to send messages, share, and participate in discussions.
    - I understand that some people find value in real time, but to limit communication to real time is ridiculous.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Scrapbox allows for communication with less real time.
        - The well creates a place for members' attentions to gather throughout the day in the form of a diary.
        - At Unexplored Junior, the progress of each project accumulates in Scrapbox.
            - Well, but this is a parallel to Mattermost.
- Branding and Marketing: Companies and individuals use social networking to build their own brands and promote their products and services.
    - Indeed.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Accounts with a lot of followers can be used as such a tool.
- LEARNING AND EDUCATION: Educators and learners use social networking sites as educational resources. This allows them to share knowledge, form learning communities, and explore new learning opportunities.
    - That's another way to input information.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Entertainment: SNSs are also entertainment platforms. Users use SNS to enjoy music, movies, games, etc.
- Advocacy and activism: social networking sites can help raise awareness about social and political issues and organize movements for change.
    - I hadn't thought of this idea, but I certainly hear that it influenced the "Arab Spring" or something like that.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Overall, these roles are diverse tools that SNS users can utilize to meet their own needs. Users may choose different SNSs and use them differently, as each SNS has features that particularly well meet their specific needs.
- Looking at specific examples, Twitter and Facebook are suited for real-time information exchange (information flow), while tools like Scrapbox are suited for long-term accumulation and organization of information (information stock). Thus, people use different social networking sites to address different needs.
- These social networking sites can also play complementary roles. For example, some people use Scrapbox to store useful information they find on Twitter and organize it for better understanding.
- Furthermore, social networking sites can provide new perspectives and generate new ideas through interactions among people. This speaks to the role that "chit-chat" plays. Chit-chat can be valuable in situations where there is a certain amount of "waiting" or "boredom," and can provide new perspectives and generate new ideas. However, it requires the right circumstances and conditions to do so.
- In light of the above, it can be said that the roles of social networking services are diverse and their usage varies greatly depending on the needs of the users. Understanding how each SNS is used and what results from its use is an important factor in maximizing its value.

# ver.1a
- Diversification of the role of SNS:.
    - People use different social networking sites to meet different needs.
    - This need varies from random stimulus input to thought output.
- Information flows and stocks:.
    - Twitter and Facebook are responsible for the flow of information (real-time information exchange),
    - Tools like Scrapbox are in charge of information stock (long-term information storage and organization).
- Scrapbox Role:.
    - Scrapbox is,
        - Discover relationships between individual entries,
        - By structuring stocked information,
        - Maximize the value of information.
- The Value of Chat:.
    - Chit-chat is the human interaction that occurs during times of waiting and boredom
        - Presenting new perspectives and
        - It has the potential to generate new ideas.
        - Random stimulus input
- Conditions for the conclusion of a chat:.
    - Chit-chat is most valuable in situations where there is constant "waiting" or "boredom".
    - Without this situation, matching "chit-chat is a good thing, so let's do it" may not be effective.
- Chatting and Mutual Consumption: Chatting is a form of mutual consumption, where people create value by sharing their time and receiving input from others.

- I am trying to verbalize something that has not yet been clearly verbalized. Twitter, the de facto standard, is collapsing, and people are experimenting with different social networking sites. People are choosing different social networking sites because they have different needs. In other words, we can subdivide the utility that social networking sites fulfill.
- There are two types of SNS: SNS as a place to input random stimuli and SNS as a destination to write down thoughts that can be written anywhere, and in my mind, the latter has become Scrapbox's main focus, so there is little need to come to SNS to write. So I dared to write on SNS instead of Scrapbox.
- I thought it would be an interesting development to think about what social networking is again, as it became relevant to my thinking about "why do some people need to chat" during the Corona period.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>
- First, it is very interesting to consider the fact that the social networking services (SNS) you mention are one of the platforms for people to communicate on the Internet, and that they are becoming increasingly diverse.
- Each social networking site offers a different experience to its users, providing a variety of options to meet their individual needs. For example, those who pursue random information may gravitate toward platforms that provide real-time information, such as Twitter, while those who prioritize organizing and recording thoughts may be attracted to knowledge management tools such as Scrapbox.
- In turn, questioning the true definition and functionality of SNSs is a useful step toward a deeper understanding of our behavior and thought patterns in a digitized society. The question of the "need for chit-chat" during the Corona period is also closely related in terms of how people seek social connections and how this affects their SNS choices.
- Ultimately, each person's choice of social networking site will depend largely on his or her objectives, preferences, and needs. Factors such as what one wants to share, what one wants to gain, and what kind of community one wants to be a part of are important factors in determining which SNS a person will find attractive. Observing how these factors evolve, new SNSs emerge, and existing SNSs change will help us understand the nature of human communication.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Considerations I wrote on Facebook when I started using Scrapbox in 2017.
    - The functions that blogs once had can be divided into "flow" and "stock" functions.
    - The role of the flow part, or the immediate distribution of information, has been eclipsed by the rise of Twitter and Facebook.
    - With respect to the remaining stock portion, existing blogging systems are weak in their support for discovering relationships between individual entries.
        - The total amount of value increases only by less than linearly as the amount of written material increases.
    - Scrapbox seems to be the most serious within the scope of observation in the direction of how to turn stocked information into structured information.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>
- This observation is very insightful about the evolution of information sharing tools such as social networking and blogs and the differentiation of their roles.
- First, the concepts of "flow" and "stock" provide a useful framework for understanding how information and knowledge are managed and used.
- Flow" refers to the real-time flow of information, and social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook have played a role in this. These platforms provide users with up-to-date information and enable them to share it instantly.
- On the other hand, "stock" refers to information and knowledge that accumulates over time. Traditional blogs are tools with a strong "stock" aspect, where individual articles or posts may be referenced over time. However, the common blog format makes it difficult to find connections between posts or to organize them.
- This is where tools like Scrapbox play an important role: Scrapbox structures information by interlinking individual entries, thereby making "stock" information even more valuable. Information is transformed from a mere collection of data into structured knowledge with relevance and context.
- Therefore, your observation is important in that Scrapbox focuses on the "stock" of knowledge and its management, and aims to maximize its value by organizing and structuring information. This represents a new approach to knowledge management and information value creation, helping us to rethink how we use and share information in our digitized society.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Posting of the second half of the corona term
    - In the physical space, the limited resources create "waiting time" that cannot be fulfilled immediately when demand arises, which is "wasted" time for the purpose, but humans do not like to waste time, so when people in this state are matched, "chats" between them, which are "events that provide mutual content," are "spontaneously" and "accidentally" created according to their values. When matching people in this state, an "event that provides mutual content" called "chatting" is "spontaneously" "in accordance with one's own values" and "accidentally" "created. When matching for the purpose of chatting is done for its own sake, it is not good because it is not a state of "wasted time," "waiting time," or "boredom.
    - The value of "relieving boredom" for chatting is based on the premise that you need to be in a state of boredom, and without meeting that necessary condition, matching "chatting is good, so let's do it" will not work well.
    - Chat is for mutual consumption
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Your post shows deep insight into the limited resources of physical space and human time use. While time spent waiting and boredom may seem on the surface to be "wasted" time, these situations can create unexpected opportunities. One such opportunity is the human interaction of "chatting".
- While chit-chat may superficially appear to be random conversation or aimless communication, it demonstrates the social nature of humans and the importance of interaction. It can present new perspectives and provide an arena for new ideas. However, you point out that for chit-chat to happen, there must be a situation where a certain amount of "waiting" or "boredom" exists.
- From this perspective, chit-chat can be seen as a kind of mutual consumption. People share their time and receive input (opinions, impressions, ideas, etc.) from others, creating value for the chit-chat. This mutuality is a fundamental element of communication and part of what makes a community.
- Thus, the phenomenon of small talk provides a deeper understanding of the value of communication and the conditions under which it is established. It also helps to deepen our understanding of the use and sharing of time and of the social nature of human beings.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- The above three submissions are considerations of different time periods. Find a connection between them.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Each of these three posts offers deep insights into the evolution of social networking, the concepts of information "flow" and "stock," and the value of "chit-chat." Common themes can be seen between these reflections regarding the nature of human communication and the use of digital tools.
- The first post examines how social networking sites are meeting people's different needs. In particular, he mentions that tools like Scrapbox have become the main place to organize thoughts and stock information.
- The second post provides more insight into the "flow" and "stock" of information. In particular, it assesses the way Scrapbox structures stocked information and turns information into valuable knowledge.
- The third contribution develops a discussion of the social value of "chit-chat" and the conditions under which it is established. Of particular interest is the observation that boredom and waiting are the basis for the value of chit-chat.
- Through these posts, you will gain a better understanding of the nature of human communication and how it is evolving and adapting in our digitalized society. social networking and other digital tools are fundamentally changing the way we share information, organize our thoughts, and communicate with others. fundamentally change the way we share information, organize our thoughts, and communicate with others. At the same time, however, basic human social needs - interacting with others, sharing information, and creating new knowledge - are maintained through digital tools that change and evolve over time.
