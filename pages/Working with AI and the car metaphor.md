title: "Working with AI and the car metaphor"
---

If I were to use an analogy to describe how I feel now,

I had a new car, so I got in it and accelerated, wondering how fast it would go,
I was going faster than I thought I would, and I was like, "Oh no, oh no, I'm going too fast, I can't keep up with the steering wheel, I can't, I'm dying! I can't catch up with the steering wheel, I can't, I'm dying!

As I got a feel for how much skin to tread, I began to tread moderately "lightly".

Yesterday I asked Devin to "just make a WebUI that reads and displays the data."
Today I asked Devin to "make the data editable in the browser" and "create a test" (the latter could have been more compact).

I started assigning tasks in such a way that they would be in a DONE state before the weekend started.
This is like slowing down before entering a corner.

Just as it is more difficult to debug when there are multiple bugs in the system,
When multiple AI failures overlap, it becomes very difficult to resolve them.
This is similar to "too much speed makes it harder to steer."

I will complete what I asked Devin to do this morning by the end of the day.
If this rhythm can be maintained, the work-in-progress tasks should not pile up...
...
I'd like to make this test run on CI... or something like that.
If I start here, I'll say "I'm almost ready to move" again, and then it'll be late at night and my health will suffer, so I won't do it.
...
(this)
...
Okay, I get it,
If you eat dinner when you are halfway through a task and then fall asleep.
Will I no longer be able to complete or [[successfully interrupt]] a task?
(I got sleepy [[fell asleep]] and woke up while reading after dinner.)
