- 1: When I think of culture fit, I think of Mr. A's culture CA and Mr. B's culture CB as near equals (≈)
    - It is easy to think that "one person and one culture corresponds to one person" implicitly here.
- 2: But in reality, each individual has a number of culture emulators.
    - Of course, some people only have one primitive emulator (his/her way of thinking).
    - There is a culture CX in organization X
    - Mr. A's "emulator of culture CX" CAX is near-equal to CX, and Mr. B's "emulator of culture CX" CBX is indirectly connected by being near-equal to CX
        - Mr. A and Mr. B are not directly connected.
- 3: This structure lowers the need for N and N people to understand $N^2$ other companies when the organization has more people.
    - N each person can have their own CX emulator.
        - This is sometimes called "understanding the culture."
        - It could be called internalization of thinking.
    - This causes "[[unifying organizational culture lowers the transaction costs of the intra-organizational market]]".

It is only an [[emulator]] and does not have to be consistent with the individual's way of thinking
- One person may have several emulators.
- Creating this emulator is "[[making it]] culture fit".
