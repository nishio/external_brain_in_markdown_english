    - Second half of [making a leap (e.g., in logic)
    - If you think of the utterances here as stickies for the KJ method, it's not surprising that they're not consecutive.
    - However, the atmosphere is different when I'm thinking, "I'm going to make stickies for KJ way," and when I'm writing here, what's the difference?
    - The KJ method inhibits writing stickies that are connected to other stickies because they are supposed to be broken apart. That's simply because there is no paper sticky note "that points to another sticky note and keeps its connection even if the paper sticky note itself is moved!
    - When writing stickies for the KJ method, I rarely write "although" because if I move it, I won't know what "although" is in response to.
        - If you use [[Electronic KJ method tool]], you can trace stickies in order of creation date and time to the one immediately before and after.
    - First, write down "The atmosphere is different when I'm thinking "I'm going to make a KJ sticky" and when I'm writing it here, what's different?" and then it will be updated to "The state of mind is different when I'm making a KJ sticky and when I'm writing it in chat, etc." after the fact.
    - The KJ method differs from Outliner, Mind Map, etc. in that it allows us to treat objects separately from "the order of output and the serial relationship".

- If you look at the multiple writings in [[time series]] overlaid on "[[position]]", which is unrelated to the time series, you can see what is [[the main story]].
