title: "Stable trade routes spring up"
---

[[stable trade routes]] are [[gushing]].
- [[trade]] and [[settlement]] are [[False dichotomy]]

Consider the contrast between a "settlement strategy" in which profits are gained by settling at a resource "spring point" and a "trading strategy" in which profits are gained by "moving" resources.
- At this time, [[stable and profitable trade routes]] are themselves resource outlets, and trade using only those trade routes is a type of settlement.


- [[Old trade route]]
    - [[New trade routes]]
