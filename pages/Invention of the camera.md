title: "Invention of the camera"

> In 1826, the French Niepce brothers improved on the [[camera obscura]] and took a single photograph in about eight hours using asphalt, a material used for road embellishments, as the photosensitive material. Later, in 1839, Louis Daguerre of France introduced the [[daguerreotype]] technique, which used a silver-plated copper plate as the photosensitive material. This reduced the exposure time to about 30 minutes.
