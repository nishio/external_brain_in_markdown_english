For those who want to read the book in a one-dimensional way, you can give them one "next question candidate" for each answer.

Questions can also be generated to elicit them for sentences that have already been written
You can also have the system generate a list of possible questions for your answers.
[[Only one answer is needed, even if there is more than one potential question]].
It's easy to feel like you have to answer all of them, but in terms of taking care of people who want to read in one dimension, I'd rather just have one.
