### own opinion
.
The notes and fragments provide an important perspective for a better understanding of the difference between near-zero values and zero. In particular, from the perspective of quantum mechanics, this difference is so important that ignoring it can lead to erroneous conclusions. On the other hand, however, it is also important to take the perspective that treating near-zero values as zero simplifies the problem. This seems to be an important concept to maintain a balance between theory and practice.
