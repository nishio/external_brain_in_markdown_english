>  III. Planned Priority Investments for a New Capitalism

> 3. Accelerate startups and promote open innovation

> (1) Formulate a 5-year plan for startup development

> 4) Expansion of support system for young people with excellent ideas and skills
>  It is meaningful to select and support young human resources with excellent ideas and technologies for startup development. In Japan, the Information-technology Promotion Agency (IPA) has a project called the "Unexplored Project" to discover and foster such human resources in the IT field. The "Unexplored Project" has been highly regarded, with 300 people having started or commercialized their own businesses, but the scale of the project is limited. Therefore, after establishing a mechanism to provide business advice, the program will be expanded to the national level.
>  In addition, we will launch initiatives to select and support young human resources with excellent ideas and technologies in fields other than IT (National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization, etc.).
>  Through these measures, the scale of its selection will be increased from about 70 to about 500 students per year in five years.
