title: "Putting a place where good discussions can take place after visualization"
---

It's important not only to see [[Talk to the City]], but for it to be a catalyst for [[discussion]], and the current system is still lacking that."

Yasuno: Are there any areas of Talk to the City that are still not good enough?
Nishio: Yes, we did a Talk to the City event for Mr. Anno's gubernatorial campaign this time, and after seeing a scatterplot full of dots, there was no place for people who saw it to get together and discuss or write their opinions. Well, if you post it on Twitter with `#TOKYOAI`, someone might see it.
Yasuno: Yeah.
Nishio: We need to have a place where people can have better discussions after this (visualization by Talk to the City). After the visualization, I looked at the diagram and said, "There is a cluster about audio data," and then without any discussion at all, Mr. Yasuno and I got very excited about portrait rights for audio data.
Yasuno: Yeah, yeah.
Nishio: In short, this kind of [[visualization (data, results, etc.)]] is the foundation to provide a platform to start better discussions. The main content is better discussion among people, and a mechanism to encourage and support that discussion must be attached to this (Talk to the City).
Yasuno: Yeah, in a way it's the same as just looking at a website, and there is no place to interactively express what you think when you look at it.
Nishio: Yes, this is the same as receiving information one way on TV. People need a place where they can ask questions about their thoughts and ideas, or if they have any questions about this. So [[AI]] was providing a place where people could ask questions.
Yasuno: Yeah, I see.
