<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The following is a brief summary of the Simple Sabotage Battlefield Manual published by the U.S. Office of Strategic Intelligence in 1944.

The Simple Sabotage Battlefield Manual was published during World War II to instruct civilians in occupied countries on how to sabotage the activities of their occupiers. It describes simple sabotage techniques that can be carried out by ordinary people without requiring special skills or equipment.

This manual covers sabotage techniques for buildings, machinery, tools, workplaces, transportation, communications, and organizations. Suggested methods include starting fires, damaging machinery and infrastructure, disrupting production, inducing accidents, spreading rumors, acting inefficiently, and fostering confusion, waste, and delay to hinder enemy activities.

Its purpose is to torment and demoralize the occupier and reduce the effectiveness of its activities in all aspects. Acts of sabotage, while often trivial in themselves, can produce significant cumulative effects when performed frequently by a large number of people. The manual focuses on methods that are simple, require no special tools, and minimize the risk to the saboteur.

In summary, they advise citizens occupied by the enemy to undermine the occupier's power as much as possible in their daily lives and work. Although these methods are specific to the wartime situation of the 1940s, they are a manual for the general public to create chaos and overthrow without the use of violence.

1. holding frequent meetings and conferences and engaging in lengthy and unnecessary discussions, thereby reducing productivity

2. intentionally delaying or giving vague replies to emails or chats, thereby impeding communication.

3. "inadvertently" deleting important files or data or saving them in the wrong place, causing work delays.

4. not using the version control system properly and continuing to use old versions of files, causing confusion in the work.

5. delay the progress of the work by feigning technical problems. For example, claim that "the Internet connection is unstable" or "a software bug has occurred.
    - Source: "(d) Employees" and "(5) Do your work poorly and blame it on bad tools, machinery, or equipment. Complain that these things are preventing you from doing your job right.

6. pursuing perfectionism more than necessary, and hindering the progress of the project by fixating on minor issues.
    - Source: "(2) Managers and Supervisors" and "(7) Insist on perfect work in relatively unimportant products; send back for refinishing those which have the least flaw.

7. not sharing critical information properly, confusing team members.
    - Source: No direct reference in the manual, but derived from various sections of "11. General Interference with Organizations and Production

8. disrupt operations by "accidentally" sending the wrong file or sharing information about another project.
    - Source: "(c) Office Workers" in "11. General Interference with Organizations and Production" and "(1) Make mistakes in quantities of material when you are Confuse similar names.

9. feign cybersecurity threats to stall work by restricting access to data or shutting down systems.
    - Source: No direct mention in the manual, but derived from "12. General Devices for Lowering Morale and Creating Confusion"

10. not properly prioritizing work and putting off important tasks, causing project delays.
    - Source: "(2) Managers and Supervisors" in "11. General Interference with Organizations and Production" and "(6) In making work assignments, always sign out the unimportant jobs first. See that the important jobs are assigned to inefficient workers of poor machines.

When using these techniques, it is important to conceal the intent to sabotage and to feign natural behavior. However, you should avoid actually performing these acts, as they are unethical and can have a serious negative impact on the organization and your colleagues.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>Considering the current situation in 2024, where remote work and digital technology are widespread, the following sabotage methods are possible

1. uploading large amounts of unnecessary data to cloud storage, which puts pressure on storage space and reduces work efficiency; 2. uploading large amounts of unnecessary data to cloud storage, which puts pressure on storage space and reduces work efficiency
2. intentionally mis-sharing the URL of an important online meeting to confuse members
3. inappropriately setting access privileges on shared files to induce editing or deletion by unauthorized members.
4. enter a large amount of unnecessary tasks or incorrect information into project management tools or task management applications, confusing progress management.
5. tampering with automated workflows and scripts, causing processing delays and errors.
6. use remote access tools to gain unauthorized access to other members' computers and alter files
7. frequently sends e-mails with large file attachments, which depletes the mail server's processing capacity.
8. intentionally overwriting or deleting another member's edits in an online collaborative editing tool
9. intentionally misconfiguring a virtual private network (VPN), creating a security risk
10. launch a denial of service (DDoS) attack against critical websites and services related to the project to create inaccessible conditions.

However, many of these actions are ethically and legally problematic and can cause serious harm to organizations and individuals. It should also be noted that when the intent of sabotage is clear, there is a high likelihood of disciplinary action and legal liability against the actor.
