> I'm not afraid of getting hurt, but I'm not strong, and I don't want to do nothing and regret it.
- Why are you not afraid?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - This phrase implies a readiness to accept difficulties and pain in the process of growth and learning without fear. Although hurt is an inevitable part of the process, it shows a willingness to have the strength to overcome it rather than avoid it.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - > [[Imagine more strongly, smiling, believing in yourself, which, more than anything or anyone else, brings you closer to your dreams.]]
        - The message is that by imagining a positive self and working toward that image, we can get closer to our dreams and goals.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - Throughout the poem, the importance of [[a positive attitude]], [[the will to persist]], and [[the power to believe in oneself]] is emphasized.

>  Here we go! go! keep running [[nothing can stop me]] give a reason for life to my future self
- [You don't suddenly become strong. You don't suddenly become capable.

- [[No leaning on the goal]].

>  [[Here we go, go, go! Keep running, no one can stop us.]]
- [[Nothing can stop me.]]
>  give a reason for life to my future self
