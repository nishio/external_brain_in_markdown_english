This is one of the most outstandingly "giddy" hiragana I've ever seen. I decided it was "Maruka" because it was written as "Mitsuruga", but when I came back and compared it with <a href='http://www10.plala.or.jp/koin/koinhentaigana.html'>Koin variant kana</a>, I found the corresponding character indeed, and it has a very similar shape. It is interesting. Interesting.
