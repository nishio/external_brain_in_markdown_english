## Digest 1
Pyramids do not necessarily need to be stacked.

## Digest 2
.
The Pyramid Model, "Taking the Top of the Pyramid is Not What You Expect," "The Parable of the Pyramid," "Recognizing the Unrecognized through Dialogue," "What is the Bottom in the Parable of the Pyramid?" , "Pyramid of Knowledge," "Cases in which the accumulation of knowledge is not necessary," "Pyramids are widest at the bottom," "Long accumulation of time," and "If you don't accumulate, you go around the same place" fragments found a connection with the "Pyramid of Knowledge. These fragments indicate ideas about the need for knowledge accumulation and the pyramid model. However, the notes state that pyramids do not necessarily need to be stacked. This is directly related to the fragment "[[Cases that do not require knowledge building]]. The fragment "[[Recognize the unrecognized through dialogue]]" also suggests that it is possible to gain new recognition through dialogue even when knowledge building is not required.

## deep thinking
The idea that stacking pyramids is not always necessary provides a new perspective on knowledge acquisition and learning methods. Traditional methods of learning and knowledge acquisition are not always optimal, and the best method may differ depending on individual circumstances and objectives. In addition, the idea that it is possible to gain new perceptions through dialogue underscores the importance of communication.

[[**Title of Thought]]
Learning without stacking pyramids: gaining new perceptions through dialogue."
