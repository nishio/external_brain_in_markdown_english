I'm going to [[PC detox]] for two nights and three days starting today.

There is an earthquake at the time of departure.

Tokyo is 34 degrees, hot.

Catch a train an hour ahead of schedule, plenty of time to spare.

Next in 80 minutes.

I'm writing this in airplane mode.
Of course it's going to be "unsaved."
As for personal knowledge storage, it would be nice to be able to work on reading and commenting on the large number of AI pages created here, but it's just not designed that way.
I'll copy and paste this post into Obsidian, too, because I'll be sad if it accidentally disappears before I send it to the server.



Hakodate is 24 degrees.
Down 10 degrees over the course of the day as expected.

It's 23:00 and I'm too tired and sleepy.
I read a few ChatGPT features on the plane and got there surprisingly quickly.

Mode to provide illustrated explanations

Mode of explaining to others

The hypothesis that "some people might be happy to have something like this" is usually wrong, but sometimes it's true.
So it should be verified at as small a cost as possible.
Or make something you really want, not "who might want it", then there is at least one person who needs it.

### Summary of notes
.

The notes cover a wide range of topics, including combining interaction attributes and components, uncovering customer value, corrections to AI output, intellectual production resolutions, what is visible but unspoken, multi-headed thinking, harvesting frameworks, creating the unknown, Scrapbox's compatibility with intellectual production, collaborative editorial project creation, and a wide range of other topics are touched on in the book. It is also written in the form of a diary, documenting [[events of]] daily life, such as moving from Tokyo to Hakodate, PC detox, earthquakes, and temperature changes.

### Relation to Fragment
.

The fragment "multi-headed thinking" is related to the "multi-headed thinking" section of the Notebook. In the Notebook, it is stated that mind maps are multi-headed and that branches can grow when reviewed over time. This indicates that multi-headed thinking develops over time and generates new perspectives and ideas.

### deep thinking

The note takes an in-depth look at the process of intellectual production and its improvement. In particular, he points out the misconception of low resolution in intellectual production and states that there are certain types of things that can and cannot be done in a fraction of the time. This offers a new perspective on the methods and efficiencies of intellectual production.

### summary of thoughts and title
.

"Increase the resolution of your intellectual production and take advantage of the bits and pieces of time you have."

### Fragment summary
.

Fragments are an opportunity to cut out by hitting part of a series that has not been carved out, communication costs jump in microteams, telomere breakdown issues, wanting to comment when cut out, too fine a division, multi-headed thinking, and many other topics. The report touches on a number of topics. Also included is a discussion of AI and intellectual production, such as AI writing daily research notes and writing down fragments of information in Scrapbox for future growth.
