    - A personal project in Scrapbox is that individual's knowledge network
    - Mixing these together out of the blue is not going to be very interesting.
        - It's a different network after all.
        - Getting it and merging it does not make it "my knowledge network".
                - Not [Connected Knowledge
        - It seems to me that you can only own what you extend step by step.
    - Suppose at some point a connection is discovered between certain pages of two people's projects.
        - [[選択範囲に似ているリンクを入力補完するUserScript]]を使っていると、ほかのprojectのリンクがよくサジェストされるのをよく体験するが、それと似ていそう<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Then the "related page of the other person's page" will become a related page for your page with a high probability.
    - By following this, it becomes "knowledge input optimized for the individual's knowledge network".
        - This seems a bit of an oversimplification, but I'll leave it at that for once.
        - According to Figure (3), rewrite it as a page of your project?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/yosider/icon' alt='/villagepump/yosider.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - rewrite<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I thought something like that.
    - AI seems to be good at interconversion of these things, but what do you think?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - It's like converting the form without changing the meaning.
        - Is automatic conversion acceptable as long as the format is correct, or is it necessary to go through the process of manual conversion?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/yosider/icon' alt='/villagepump/yosider.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I have a feeling that I essentially need to write it myself, step by step.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - [[accumulate (e.g. debts, credits)]]
