title: "Don't look at your inbox right after you get up from bed."

from  [[Diary 2025-08-15]]


When you go to bed and wake up, return from a break, or return from a time-bound event, there is generally a message in your inbox
- It is important not to be swayed by this.
- It might be better if the morning "state after reboot" and the inbox process were not tightly coupled.
- In other words, instead of waking up in the morning and looking at your inbox first thing, you can decide in advance what you are going to do first thing in the morning.
    - It's an oft-discussed technique.
- I'm talking about the fact that it's not good to have 100% of "morning time" always used for "inbox processing" because it's tightly coupled, so it doesn't mean that you should always do something other than inbox.

OLD TITLE: Don't look at [[inbox]] right away [in the morning
- Important to be [[living (with)]], not to be in the morning

relevance
- [I don't look at social networking sites immediately after waking up from sleep.
