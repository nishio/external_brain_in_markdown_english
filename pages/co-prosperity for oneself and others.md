Prosperity for oneself and others
- [[Win-Win]]

>  The fundamental meaning of [[judo]] is the best use of [[vigor]].
    - [[working assiduously for the good of the people]]
> In other words, it is the most effective use of one's energies for the purpose of good.
    - [[effective altruism]]

> What is [[good]], then, is that which helps the continuance and development of group life, and that which prevents it. (Omitted) And since the continuation and development of group life or social life is achieved through "mutual assistance and mutual concession" and "co-prosperity for oneself and others," mutual assistance and concession and co-prosperity for oneself and others are also good.
- Jigoro Kano, Best Use of Vigor, Osei Vol. 1, No. 1, 1922
