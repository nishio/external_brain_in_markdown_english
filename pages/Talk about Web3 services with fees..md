Talk about [[Web3]] services that cost [[fee]].
- Web2 services also cost money to maintain servers.
- Who is paying for it and how?

To begin with, we've been living in an era where most Internet services are free for a while, and we're used to it at this moment.
- But [[business practices]] of enjoying a useful service and not paying for it is crazy!
- Social networking sites and YouTube are getting to the point where if you want to avoid ads, you have to pay for them.
- News sites with useful information are also starting to ask people to sign up and pay for membership.
- In the end, I think this comes down to consumer familiarity.
