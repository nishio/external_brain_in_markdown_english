title: "Good Question Stamp"
---

- I have created a "[[Good question.]]" emoji in the [[unexplored junior]] chat and am actively pushing it in response to [[question]].
- Cultivate [[psychological safety]] that says, "It's okay to ask questions."
    - It is hard for the questioner to ask a question and not get a response to it
    - When they leave me alone for long periods of time, I feel like I shouldn't have asked those questions here.
    - Fast rewards should be given to those who ask questions.
- However, I can't always answer for myself.
    - And to reply without an answer:.
        - Pointless notifications are noise
        - Questions drifted away, and not well.
- I'm just wondering if it's a good idea to add an emoji reaction.
    - I made a custom emoji that says "[Good question.
