title: "All I can do is study."
---

> I have never seen such a person in my life, but I wonder if he/she really exists, and I have a feeling that it is a delusion thought up by people who cannot study.

I feel that there are people who cannot learn new things without [[textbooks]], and when you pair them with people who cannot be properly trained, B will say, "A can [[study]], but he cannot learn his job, he can only study," but in essence, both parties are at fault. But in essence, both parties are at fault [[miscommunication]].

This miscommunication is especially likely to occur when B is the type of person who learns from actual experience rather than from textbooks.
