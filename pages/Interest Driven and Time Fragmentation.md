Interest Driven and [[Time Fragmentation]].

When other people's projects have [[synergy]] with my project, I tend to assign a lot of [[attention]] because it's interesting to see unexpected developments, but then time [[fragmentation]] slows down [[my project]]... It slows down [[my project]] and slows down [[my project]].
- Difficult to balance
- Probably an eternal problem.

- I feel that working with [[Interest Driven]] is basically more of a good thing.
- I have no reason to believe that my project is [[only "what I thought I would do in the past"]] and therefore should be prioritized over "what I thought I would do now.
        - Could be a form of [[Foolish Consistency]].
        - [[Goals may be modified.]]

In that sense, it's not good for a talented young person with a fraction of the money to be [[lock-in]] to a particular project.
    - [[irresponsibility]] I hope you run around doing high and interesting things.
- I think it's because I'm not a [[stakeholder]].
    - [[All have a bias.]]
