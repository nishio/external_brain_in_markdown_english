Regarding the interpretation of "[[better late than never]]," the importance of having a strategic and planning perspective is emphasized. This is the perspective of aiming for long-term success rather than short-term success, a perspective that is also important in research and business.
But having this perspective requires a certain [[tolerance for anxiety]].
People with low anxiety tolerance tend to be "[[zero-risk orientation]]" and may be more likely to pursue short-term success.

- This is a hard one to read, W.
- I'm talking about what we mean here by "necessary anxiety tolerance."
- Confusion arises when the interpretation of "[[better late than never]]" is taken ambiguously.
    - I am not saying that we need an anxiety tolerance to "not try to do it well" in order to do it poorly and quickly, instead of preparing slowly and trying to do it well,[[*]] but that we need to be able to do it well.
        - That interpretation makes it hard to see why "zero-risk orientation" leads to "short-term pursuit of success.
    - Need to read the commentary on the link.
        - It is explained that after success, it is "skillful and slow" to continue and "poor and fast" to withdraw.
    - Low anxiety tolerance and zero-risk orientation make people want to continue what has worked
        - I'm anxious to do something new because it's unknown, not because I'm anxious to continue doing the same thing I've always done.
        - So, after achieving success, in situations where they should withdraw from the market from a long-term perspective, a bird's-eye view, or for the sake of overall optimization, they continue to do the same thing they did in the past [[by following precedent]].
- So "anxiety tolerance" here means "not being anxious about doing [[pivot]] in a successful
        - In [[Trade-offs between use and exploration]]:.
        - People with low anxiety tolerance and zero risk orientation, seeking short-term success, only use known resources without exploration
        - Then you're stuck with depleted resources.
        - It is precisely when resources are available that we must make a conscious search
        - Same for [[Barbell Strategy]] in [antivulnerability
