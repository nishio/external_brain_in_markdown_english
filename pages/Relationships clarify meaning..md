- 1: There is a concept X that cannot be clearly expressed in words
        - Cannot be represented by [Parallel symbols
    - No clear boundaries either.
- 2: Clarify the concept of surroundings
    - Surroundings = Nearby = Relationships ([[RELEVANCE]] is in place)
- 3: A lot of it makes X clearer.

- [[Felt Sense and Symbol Diagrams]]

This commentary came out of nowhere while I was doing [[Kozaneba:dwell-think]].
- > The same thing that happened in Madoka Magica where Madoka became stronger by the threads of causality being connected to her, happens when RELEVANCE is connected to felt sense (a subtle metaphor that may not be conveyed).
- The metaphor was born by changing it to be a little more communicative.
- In Heidegger's [[Building, Living, Thinking]], "building" is not "building" in the dictionary sense (= "building" is a [[non-parallel symbol]]), and Heidegger repeatedly connects various [[RELEVANCE]] to it to express it. Heidegger repeatedly connects various [[RELEVANCE]] to express it, and "a very strong witch" is created.
    - [[Concepts that can be represented by parallel symbols are commodities]] So these faceless, faceless witches are the real rascals.
    - Defeating such a ruthless boss (internalization] of concepts expressed in non-parallel symbols) is the goal when reading difficult documents.

The diagram looks like it's trying to say that "sets that don't overlap each other are lined up so that the boundaries are clear," but relationships are not limited to that, I just haven't come up with a good illustration.
