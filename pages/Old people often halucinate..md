> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1646698949192060930?s=20): rant of the day "Old people often halucinate, so it's ok to refer to them, but don't trust them to be right."

> [@kentaro](https://twitter.com/kentaro/status/1646700869545766912?s=20): In the last few years, I feel that I have been making more and more statements that are unclear as to their truth, but with the development of LLM, I have learned that such a situation is I have learned that such a situation is called "hallucination" (i.e., gibberish) due to the development of LLM. We need to apply RHLF once again to see if this is due to aging or over-learning. Let's incorporate a lot of human feedback.
