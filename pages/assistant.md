title: "assistant"
---

We were experimenting with hiring an assistant on an annual contract for 30 hours per month, but as the one-year contract expiration date approached, we decided not to renew it.

I am not good at cutting out work, so it was too much of a burden to cut out 30 hours worth of work per month in a form that could be delegated to others.

Early on, I was still willing to try to make the most of it, but then it became tedious and I started asking them to do tasks like transcribing that didn't require them to think about the instructions, and then they said, "I've transcribed a few times, but this doesn't really create much value," and that stopped too.

This case was a good learning experience. It confirms that I have been told for several years that I need to acquire more skills, but I am not sure what I should do in the future.
