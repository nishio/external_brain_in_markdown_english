title: "Customer Value and Asset Value"
---

When I thought about creating value in my life, I wondered what this "value" was.

After some thought, the phrase "[[customer value]] and [[property (asset) value]] need to be distinguished" came to mind.

Customer value is easy to understand and can be found in "how much customers are willing to pay"
- There is an atmosphere in which the pursuit of customer value is a good thing, but it is not good to be all about it.
- As an extreme example, if we optimize the provision of customer value by denying customers any studies or other activities that do not directly lead to customer payment, we will be working a day job to the limit of our strength every day.
- You'll be creating value with someone else's value system, the customer.
        - [[intrinsic motivation]] Activity is inhibited in

property (asset) value
- not proportional to time
    - I hear it grows on its own.
        - Super Modular Production
    - Unearned income is another example, but narrower in scope.
        - Unworking emphasizes that there's zero labor involved.
        - In a market world that pays 1 for 1 labor, a type of trade where you get 0.1 every month for 1 labor is a loss in the short term and a gain in the long term.
            - After 10 months, the initial investment has paid off, and the unearned income will be in the form of 0.1 per month, but it is a short-term vision to think that it can be obtained "without labor".
            - That's 0.1 of every month earned by labor that was invested 10 months ago, willing to take a temporary loss.
    - [[Create an engine for exponential growth]]
    - Basically, investing before [[others notice]] is a winning pattern.
    - Here we have a fundamental conflict with "making value out of other people's values".
    - Venture capitalists want their investment targets to do this.
        - However, I want to be able to cash in at an appropriate time in the future.
            - Because that's customer value to me.
        - You have to be careful about being a customer with rather tricky values.
