> In the early days, there was an examination for those who wanted to settle in the village, which may be why I was surprised at the high deviation of the children born in the village afterwards.

> The entire area of the village was created by reclaiming the Hachiro Lagoon, which used to be the second largest lake in Japan and the largest reclaimed land in Japan. It was established as a new village on October 1, 1964 (Showa 39) as a [[local government]], and was the last [[newly established municipality]] in Japan that did not involve the merger or division of an existing municipality.
