- [[information]] and [[emotion]].

> [madanaizo](https://x.com/madanaizo/status/1828743465020330411) In the world, between "I don't understand what you are saying" and "I understand it well", there is "I understand what you are saying, but I don't understand why it has to be said in such a tone of voice (sarcastic tone ...a tone of intense condemnation...as if it were the end of the world...), I don't understand why it has to be said in such a tone. I mean, I don't understand why you don't like it.

> [tomoya_sense](https://x.com/tomoya_sense/status/1829002346623578321) After all, "the way you communicate is 90%" in life.
>  It's a waste of time because even if you say something good, if you don't communicate it well, people won't receive it.
