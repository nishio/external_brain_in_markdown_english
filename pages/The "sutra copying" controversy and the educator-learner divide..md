>  [[Learning of an engineer]] and [[copying of a sutra]], including the way learning is changing with the advent of LLM. It was an interview with many points that made a lot of sense to me after listening and writing about it.
> [keikoka](https://x.com/keikoka/status/1884416149510840759) I'm relearning [[knitting]] for the first time in a while, and this also fits perfectly with the "[[Learn from the necessary part]]", "[[Read the Table of Contents]] of the reference if you don't understand", and "[[Finally, copy the sutras]]". I am now relearning [[knitting]] for the first time in a long time.
