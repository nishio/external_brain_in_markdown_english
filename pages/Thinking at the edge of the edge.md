- edge
    - EDGE of VERBAL and ALINGUAL
        - [[linguistic]] and [[non-verbal]] [[border]]
- Translated as "[[think in terms of a limbic edge]]"
    - Metaphor with the linguistic at the center and the non-linguistic at the [border
- Nishio's most commonly used metaphor is [[water's surface]] of [[sea]] in "[[What is not verbalized]]".
        - [[iceberg model]]
- In German [[Wo noch Worte fehlen]].
    - 「 [[Where words still lack]] 」「 [[Where there is still no word]] 」
    - In Nishio's image, it's where the road called "language" breaks off.
            - [[Parable of the Forest]]
        - Image of "the road will be extended in the future, but there is no road yet."
    - I also rather like the forest metaphor.
        - There is a slight difference between the ocean metaphor and what it means.
        - The dark forest will eventually be cleared and a path drawn.
            - Once the road is drawn, it is no longer "where there is no road yet."
        - The ocean will not disappear.
            - We are not pumping up the ocean or lowering [[water's surface]].
            - I'm taking [[fish]] from the sea.
