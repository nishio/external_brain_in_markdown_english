There is one [[large community]].
It's prominence makes it look like "that's [[the main community]]".
But in reality there are [[countless smaller communities]].

Twitter has been the look and feel of this "primary community" for a while.
Then I saw people move to diverse communities because of the backlash against Elon Musk, etc.

But since information can be easily duplicated, the value of the information itself is close to zero, and [[summary tailored to one's own situation]] (= [[personalize]]) has value. For this personalization, it is necessary to be known as a [[person]], so it is inevitably required to be [[Small Communities]] to the extent that this can be done.

Speaking of small bandwidth, I feel that about chat tools and behavioral discussions.
