- Whether an uncertain event will result in state A in the future is described by a probability
- Are you confident you can be an A?"
    - If I say there is, they say I'm an idiot who doesn't understand the current situation, believing that an event that has only a low probability of occurring will happen.
    - If you say you don't have it, they beat you up for not wanting to be an A.
    - This question pushes [[choosing the wrong two options]].
- We have no choice but to engage in activities that increase the probability of occurrence.

- So what if it was in this state?
    - Dozens of times more likely than the original state.
    - On the other hand, it has not yet exceeded 50%.
        - If you're going to pick the option with the highest probability, it would be reasonable to predict that it won't be "A."
