Projects with time gaps are missing contextual information from the raw brain.
contextual information when resuming the project (A, B below).

A
- Contextual information must be reloaded into the raw brain when the project is restarted
- The cost of losing information about where information should be loaded in a project is high.
    - Finding where it is is a kind of Search or Deep Research
- Would be nice to be summarized instead of simply finding and reading RAW data
    - A summary should be produced from a detailed work log.
- Summary-type questions are [[GraphRAG]]-oriented

B
- We should not have to load contextual information into the raw brain when we resume a project.
- If we can decide on a next action?
    - Patterns with no information to determine next actions
    - Patterns where the next action has been decided, but we don't know why it was decided that way.
        - It is common to write only tasks on the TODO list and not objectives, etc.
- Even though I couldn't remember Kozaneba's code, I assigned the task to Devin and he implemented it properly.
    - This is a successful example of a policy of not loading the raw brain.
    - If it's a small task, it works.

Specifically, the Scrapbox English translation project
- I've been doing this since they used the name Scrapbox.
    - Symbols that point to concepts are shaken by external cradles
    - It is no longer possible to find it in a search in
    - [[Instead of designing a generic system, do one specific thing first.]]
    - [[pSomething]]
