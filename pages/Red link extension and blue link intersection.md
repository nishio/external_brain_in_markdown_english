title: "Red link extension and blue link intersection"
---

In [[red link extension]], the idea was that the LLM would generate the page with the link being an empty page

Calling it a "red link" is not appropriate.
- Scrapbox link color is not determined by whether the link is empty or not
    - Even if the body of the linked page is empty, it will be blue if it leads to another page via another link.
- Red link is [[dead end]] vacant lot
- Blue link blank pages mentioned from 3 or more pages are empty space in [intersection

Isn't it different in nature?
- Intersections are proven keywords that already connect to many pages
    - There are already multiple statements about it.
    - Linked sites are important, then string search is important, then vector search is important
- Dead ends still lead nowhere.
    - We attempted to generate this by vector searching [[red link extension]].
    - I tried both searching from my Scrapbox and from other sources and the feeling was different
        - As for the red link extension, it's not appropriate because if I search my Scrapbox for "keywords that came to mind when I was kneading my Scrapbox recently", I usually get hits for what I was looking at just before.
        - But on the other hand, if you want to fill in the blue link intersection, why not?
