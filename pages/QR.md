- COVID19 settled down and met more people in physical venues.
- Let's keep in touch online! When it came to "Keep in touch with us online!", it used to be good to say "My Twitter account is @nishio.
    - But that's not good enough anymore.
    - TwitterID is Nisio" is confusing because there is no idea that the ID is easy for new users to read, which is made into a random string-like ID instead of a readable, short ID (added on 2025-02-14).
    - I think it would be better to create a page listing the accounts and a QR code to get there.

- Difficult to communicate URLs and social networking IDs in a physical setting because humans still communicate using noisy voice channels
But more and more people have smartphones and can use the "take a picture of the QR code" method.
For iOS at the moment, long press on the QR code part of the image to open it.
Many social networking sites have their own QR code reading capabilities.

So I thought it would be useful to create a page in my Scrapbox with a collection of QR codes to tell people about it.

- I don't have the habit of looking much.

This page is auto-translated from [/nishio/QR](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/QR) using DeepL. If you looks something interesting but the auto-translated English is not good enough to understand it, feel free to let me know at [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en). I'm very happy to spread my thought to non-Japanese readers.
