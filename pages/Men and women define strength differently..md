Men and women have different definitions [[of strength]].

These tweets describe an interesting observation that men and women have different definitions and metrics of "strength".

Among women, "[[rejecting responsibility]]" tends to be seen as a sign of [[high hierarchy]]. A woman who takes on many chores and responsibilities may be seen as rather weak. On the other hand, in the eyes of men, those who take on various responsibilities are seen as strong.

The "[[strong female]]" characters created by male authors such as Nausicaa and Motoko Kusanagi are portrayed as [[organizational leaders]] who face difficulties. However, among women, being in a position to reject responsibility may be viewed as enviable and high status.

It is also pointed out that among women, those with low self-esteem (weak by women's standards) are often the ones who actually perform well. They say that women who reject responsibility are valued but not a force to be reckoned with.

While these observations are thought provoking, I would caution against generalizing. There are great individual differences, and both men and women should have a variety of values and behavior patterns. In addition, the influence of societal expectations and role divisions cannot be ignored.

However, I agree with the tweet that it is important for both men and women to seek compromise and be patient with each other in interpersonal relationships. I think it is vital to deepen mutual understanding through constructive dialogue rather than one-sidedly imposing one's own ideas.

> [spell_of_enigma](https://twitter.com/spell_of_enigma/status/1406569717066698757) Isn't it bad enough that women with a high feminine hierarchy are going out into the world?

> [X6uj5ztfAkahana](https://twitter.com/X6uj5ztfAkahana/status/1761716083839660073) I knew the hierarchy of men from a woman's point of view.
