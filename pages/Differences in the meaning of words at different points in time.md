case
from [/villagepump/ you should not write the program yourself](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/ you should not write the program yourself).
- By the way, every few years or so, every cycle or so, a solution comes along that says, "You don't have to write programs anymore," but we don't live in a world where you don't have to write programs.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>
- プログラムを書かなくていい世の中にはなっていない これは「 [[programming]] 」の意味が各時点でずれてるな<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - [[machine language]] is no longer written directly
        - Since [[FORTRAN]] was created and "[[Automatic Programming]]" was realized
        - It is what we now call a "compilation"
    - The majority of programmers no longer write [[memory management]] programs.
        - [[GC]] was invented and Java and Python, which adopted it, became major
    - The only change is that the part of the act that used to be called "programming" is now called "programming" for the part of the act that remains human.

relevance
    - [[Part of it disappears, part of it remains, and a new one is born.]]

- [[A series of pictures of two people saying different things]]
- [[Blind Card Candidate]]
