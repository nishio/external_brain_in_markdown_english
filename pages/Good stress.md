>  We're designing a system that attracts "rule-followers" rather than excellence, and if they follow the rules, sales will increase and everyone will be happy.
>
>  "Good stress" because it is properly designed and the level of demands on employees is raised.
>
>  Raising the level of requirements without design and making it a matter of employee heat level will result in "bad stress".

>  Bad stress leads to [[disengagement]].

>  Bad stress feels like pressure to run as fast as you can even though it's pitch black.
