> The DAO is a fake democracy.
> The China DAO Emphasized Voting System
> Hong Kong DAO, no intention of going anywhere.
> Taiwan DAO easily makes birds 獸散.
> I have been thinking about this for a couple of years.
- DeepL
    - The Chinese run DAO for a first taste of democracy
    - Hong Kong people run DAO to keep democracy;
    - Taiwanese operate DAO to pretend to be democratic.
    - Therefore, Chinese DAO emphasizes the voting system.
    - Hong Kong DAO deliberately does not have a big stage.
    - Taiwan DAO is easy to scatter.
    - This is the insight of these two years of care.

> [nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1654417413134495749) Japanese people like to make consensus of all people rather than strong leadership. The information sharing is important to make good consensus. However, on the other hand, they tend to hesitate expressing their opinions. They don’t share information about how they feel.

> [nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1654418623858089984) I don’t have much experience on that. It is just my guess but they may give all members equal amount of vote power, and only a few people express own opinions. So in that case the vote become the way to express own feelings anonymously.

> [nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1654419896497995776) I’m writing my opinions with my legal name identified. That is an outlier in Japanese culture. I wonder why so many Japanese prefer to make unidentified account on sns.

DAO and Culture
> [@mashbean](https://twitter.com/mashbean/status/1654148076179783681?s=20):
- Chinese taste democracy for the first time in a DAO that operates
- Hong Kong people run the DAO to maintain democracy;
- Taiwanese run DAOs to pose as democracies.
- For this reason, DAOs in China emphasize a voting system.
- The DAO in Hong Kong intentionally does not provide a large stage.
- DAOs in Taiwan are easily scattered.
- This has been the insight of the past two years of care.

> I don't have much experience in that regard (DAO management). I am only guessing, but I think that all members may be given equal voting rights and only some may express their opinions. In that case, voting would be a way to express one's feelings anonymously.
> I write my opinions with my name clearly stated. That is unusual in Japanese culture. I wonder why so many Japanese prefer to create unidentified accounts on social networking sites.
