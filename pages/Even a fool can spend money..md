> [erukiti](https://x.com/erukiti/status/1906492325049913668) I wrote a bare bones article about how I used Roo Code to generate just under 30,000 lines of code in 4 days, and then eliminated the approximate technical debt in the next 5 days.

>  * Technical debt should not be neglected when programming with coding agents
>  * Or rather, if you feel uncomfortable, don't leave it (which it is).
>  * In just a few days, you can experience what it's like to "realize the tremendous technical debt
>  * You can eliminate that ridiculous technical debt in just a few days
>  * In just a few days, we had a very good quality experimental asset that could be used for a variety of experiments.

You spend $200 in four days to generate just under 30,000 lines of code, and then spend three times as much in the next five days, $600, to eliminate the technical debt.
- Many people lose heart in the first half.
    - If you end up here, you won't get the code that creates value.
    - Some people are satisfied with the attention they get by saying on social networking sites, "Wow, I was able to generate something like this! and get attention and satisfaction from it →[[AI Surpriser]].
- They make decisions that cost even more, and they do it at nearly three times the cost, and they produce something really useful.
