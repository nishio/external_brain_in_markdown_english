title: "Don't solicit ideas from all employees."

Don't solicit ideas from all employees.
- Just a lot of hard work gathering "a large number of miscellaneous ideas that might be useful."

Use Case Formulas
- What data is being gathered on a large scale?
- What are the technically possible functions?
- What is the [[business impact]] of the cross-fertilization?

- Good ideas for using AI are likely to come from people who are familiar with AI and have technical knowledge
- Ideas collected from all employees tend to have unknown [[feasibility]] and a lot of garbage
- It's good to [[let the AI do the convergence]] of the collected ideas, but it's better not to collect them in the first place because there's too much garbage.
- On the other hand, getting all employees to think about what they can do with AI is a good [[festival for enlightenment]].
