What is the "start time of the videoconference?"

[Zoom
- The "start time" is "the time everyone is expected to be in the room."
- It's not "time for rooms to be made."
    - So is the real [[conference room]].
- Room is made when you schedule a meeting.
    - So, even if the meeting starts a week from now, you can enter the room now, depending on the settings.
- If "Enable previous host participation" is ON:.
    - Allows other participants to enter the room and converse before the host.
    - This is an image of an "unlocked conference room".
- When OFF
    - A message to the effect that "it has not started yet" or "wait for the host to start" is displayed to those who come to the conference room before the host.
    - This is an image of "the conference room is locked and you can't enter until the host opens it.
