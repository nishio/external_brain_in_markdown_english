### Comparative perspective: [[centralization]] and the coordination of diverse [[interests]]

    - By reducing the power of the feudal lords (daimyo) and concentrating their authority at the center (the Meiji government), the new government sought to establish a system of governance.
    - During the Meiji Restoration period, a time of great change in the transition from [[feudalism]] to a modern state, priority was given to building a unified country rather than to the [[right of]] regional [[autonomy]].

- [[Madison]]'s "[[federalist]] No. 10" (1787)
    - In one of the papers persuading the United States to ratify the Constitution, the main issue is "how to control the harm of [[factions]] (factions).
    - By creating large and diverse [[federal republics]], the government sought to create a structure in which it was difficult for any one faction to dominate the whole, and to achieve political stability by forcing factions to compete with each other for interests.
    - Rather than centralization, the approach was to decentralize power under [[federalism]] while maintaining unity.
