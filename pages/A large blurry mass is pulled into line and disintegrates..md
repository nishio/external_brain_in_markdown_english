title: "A large blurry mass is pulled into line and disintegrates."
---

from  [[KJ Method Study Session @ Loftwork Pre-map comments]]
- People who have trouble organizing groups tend to create a big blurry mass of many labels just gathered in one place.
- Such a mass is likely to be either
    - The nameplate is very abstract.
        - It's a mass of things that were originally [[abstract concept]] that I had, and I used it unconsciously, and then I collected a bunch of things that fit that concept.
    - I can't put a nameplate on it.
        - It's all about what's in it.
- If a line connects to label X in that clump, then shrinking that line will break up the larger clump.
    - Is it ok to [[tear off]] only X. Are there labels that want to follow X?
    - A pair that resists being torn apart shows that there is a line between them.

- [[foggy]]
- [[disassembly]]
- [[They put it in a jar and mix it up.]]
