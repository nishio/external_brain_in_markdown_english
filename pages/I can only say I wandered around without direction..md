- Without [[direction]], you can only say [[wander]].
- A: When there is a direction, even if you run into obstacles and things don't go as initially expected, it becomes an interesting [[storyline]] in itself.
- B: [[wandered]] [[random walk]] [[ad hoc]] with no direction, you can only say "I wandered"
    - Even though B is as far along as A.
    - B is taking twice as much time and effort as A because of all the wandering around.
    - However, it is overwhelmingly A that is valued as [story

Well, it depends on the situation whether the evaluation should be aimed at as a story.
- With the caveat that "[[storytelling]]" may be useful for higher-level objectives.

    - [[Workers tend to talk about work]]
    - If the direction is set, you can say, "We thought of this, implemented it, discovered this obstacle, changed it to avoid it, and think it would be good to do it this way in the future.
