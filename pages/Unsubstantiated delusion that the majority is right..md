title: "Unsubstantiated delusion that the majority is right."
---

Person A who thinks the majority is right, and "that person and this person are in favor of it" is the basis of rightness.
I don't think that's grounds for person B to believe that "the majority isn't always right."

The result is a disagreement about "is there any basis for this claim?"
