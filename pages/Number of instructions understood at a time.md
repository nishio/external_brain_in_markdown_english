Number of instructions understood at a time
> [kohaken_dsl](https://x.com/kohaken_dsl/status/1808606646987600176) There is an approximate number of instructions that can be understood at one time, depending on age.
>
>  Of course, this is just a reference as there are many individual differences, but at 5-6 years old, for example, two instructions are considered to be the limit.
>  Therefore, you should refrain from giving too many instructions at once, write down at least 3 or more and pass them on, or devise a method to repeat the instructions ^ ^.

I'll look into this as I think I've written the source.
