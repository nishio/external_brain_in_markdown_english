title: "Bad Patterns of Group Formation"
---

- [[bad pattern]] in [[grouping]]
- The state of "lots of data, lots of pain."
    - So, "reduce the number of pieces you see and reduce the pain by bundling them with a nameplate.
    - This is the purpose of "organizing a group"
- bad example
    - Lots and lots of labels collected from lots of employees.
    - Lots of labels regarding current dissatisfaction, let's collect these.
    - Let's put up a front called "Current Complaints."
- Why it's bad
    - If we fold that group, we'll only have abstract information about "dissatisfaction with the status quo."
    - Is "I'm not happy with the way things are" useful information? No, it's not.
    - If you want to know specifics, you need to open a bundle.
        - It's a pain to bundle and open, and it stays open.
        - It defeats the purpose of "compressing the number of sheets."
- What's wrong.
    - > There are a lot of labels regarding current dissatisfaction, let's collect these.
        - regarding current dissatisfaction.
            - I'm not looking at the relationship between the two labels, I'm collecting them by their similarity to the original concept of "current dissatisfaction" in my head.
        - [["There's a lot of them. Let's collect them."]]
            - A group with many members is suddenly being created.
- Stuck in the phase of putting up a nameplate.
    - How do I put a good nameplate on it?"
        - "What can I say other than 'the current state of affairs'?"
    - I'm failing at collecting labels for the front of the house, so I can't put a "good front" on it.
        - [[Parable of the Sidewalks]]
