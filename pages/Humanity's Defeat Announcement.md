title: "Humanity's Defeat Announcement"
---

When a human and AI played against each other in Othello, the AI's rating was designed to be disclosed to the audience, and after the AI declared that it had "won" in the middle game, while the whole world knew that the human had lost, only the opponent tried hard to win without knowing...the story

nishio:
- Actually, in OpenAI, GPT5 says "I win!" and the theory is that it is not disclosed to other humans because it would be pitiful to disclose it (...)
- It's like [[cancer notification]], whether you want to be informed that you're not going to win or not.
