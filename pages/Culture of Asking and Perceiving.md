title: "Culture of Asking and Perceiving"
---

> [@miyukimaruyama](https://twitter.com/miyukimaruyama/status/1654207267422756864?s=20): I have thought about this topic before, but there are two types of people, those who live in the "Ask Culture" and those who live in the "Guess Culture". People who live in the "Ask Culture" live in the "Guess Culture", while people who live in the "Guess Culture" live in the "Guess Culture". On the other hand, Guess people "assume" that if they are asked, the other party is asking on the assumption of a "yes" answer.

[The culture of asking and the culture of perceiving.
