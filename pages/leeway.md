Assume that utility growth slows as the amount of resources increases ([[law of diminishing marginal utility]]).
It is easier to think in extremes, so let's assume that "utility growth is negligible when resources exceed 1".

There are three patterns of situations.
![image](https://gyazo.com/ee5ebebbd5fe5153afe117844695c1fd/thumb/1000)
Situation 1: Everyone's resource production exceeds 1
- There is a surplus of resources for all of us.
- No one is trying to get resources from others.
- When a project ([[festival]]) is planned that temporarily consumes resources to create utility, everyone brings resources
    - Because it's more interesting (and has more utility) to hapnp an event than not hapnp it due to a lack of resources.

Situation 2: Not everyone's production is above 1, but the average is above 1
- Transfers are made from those with excess resources to those with insufficient resources.
    - Because when transfers take place, society's overall utility increases.
- The resource provider has no particular utility in putting out the resource itself.
    - For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the utility growth is negligible when the resource exceeds 1, but in reality, there is a non-zero slope, so this resource transfer does not occur spontaneously.
    - There are cases where there is utility, such as finding value in increasing the utility of society as a whole.
            - [[public goods investment]]
- The recipient of the resources increases his or her utility by receiving them.
    - All are satisfied to the same degree
    - Communists believe that in an ideal state this would be the case.

Situation 3: Average production is below 1
- Transferring resources so that they are all equal makes everyone unsatisfied.
- The resource provider resists because he/she will be unhappy if the result of the resource transfer is less than 1
- Resource receivers
    - Some people will get it until they are satisfied and some won't.
    - Equality leads to inadequacy, including my own.
    - Getting resources by being appreciated by those who put out the resources is a way to fulfill yourself.
        - Motivation is extrinsic.
    - not relaxed
        - Those who are unfulfilled at this time, of course, do not have the luxury of space.
        - Even those who are currently satisfied cannot be reassured that their sufficiency may be taken away

- When I heard [[great river]] stressing the importance of giving people more leeway, I thought he was right on the spot, but when I thought about it again, I couldn't figure out what leeway was, so I sorted it out, but in the end the word "leeway" didn't come up until the end, Maybe it's something different.
