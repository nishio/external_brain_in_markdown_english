title: "parable of the bridge"
---

- boundary spanner
- A person who connects the boundaries
- Span is "straddle", so the image is straddling a wall.

- pipe
- Image of two different areas connected and objects flowing through them.

- go-between
- Use it as a bridge between IT and pharmacy.
- The bridge straddles a boundary (river)
- Connecting this side of the border and that side, people come and go.
- It can be said to be a fusion of both boundary spanner and pipe images.
