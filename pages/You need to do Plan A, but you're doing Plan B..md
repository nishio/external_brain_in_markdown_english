title: "You need to do Plan A, but you're doing Plan B."

You're doing Plan B when you should be doing Plan A. That's outrageous! That's inexcusable!" I think that the people who say, "We are not doing Plan A" are simply making an assumption, or "Plan A needs to be done" is wrong, or even that "Plan A" is not feasible. I wish I were calmer. And I want a program that will automatically filter out the comments of people who are not calm.
