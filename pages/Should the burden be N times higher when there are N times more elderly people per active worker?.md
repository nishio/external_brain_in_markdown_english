title: "Should the burden be N times higher when there are N times more elderly people per active worker?"

Should the burden be N times greater when there are N times more elderly people per working age person? (I don't think so), and I was wondering exactly how much that N is.
N=6 apparently.

Statistics Bureau, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications [Statistics on the elderly in Japan](https://www.stat.go.jp/data/topics/pdf/topics138.pdf)
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>In 1950, the elderly (65 years and older) were about 4.9% of the total population, but by 2023 they will account for about 29.1%.

- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>In 1950, about 12 people of working age supported one elderly person; by 2020, the situation has changed to about 2 people supporting one elderly person. This means that the burden on the working-age population has increased by a factor of about 6!

    - In 2023, 7,398 people aged 15~64 and 3,623 people aged 65 and over
    - The 1950 data is not here.


How many times more has the working-age population had to pay?
- Is it about 6x or $\sqrt{6}$times more?

They don't give me very good answers.

This would be 1.7 times
