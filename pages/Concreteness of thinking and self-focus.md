title: "Concreteness of thinking and self-focus"
---

Study finds that individuals with high depressive tendencies are less specific in their daily thoughts and that ruminative self attention is positively associated with negative emotions only when thoughts are less specific.
- It's less negative when you're specifically ruminating, "Oh, I made mistake X, I should have done Y first," and it becomes negative when it abstracts and you start thinking, "I make this kind of mistake all the time," and people with high depressive tendencies are in the habit of thinking the latter way.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This paper reports on a study that investigated how [[thought concreteness]] and [[self attention]] are associated with [[depressive symptoms]] and [[negative emotions]]. The main points are as follows:.
- [[the experience sampling method]] was used to investigate the thinking patterns of 31 college students in their daily lives.
- We found that individuals with higher [[depressive]] tendencies had lower [[concreteness]] in their daily thoughts.
- There was a positive association between ruminative self attention and concurrent negative affect, but this was only found when the thoughts were less specific.
- These results suggest that individuals with high depressive tendencies chronically process self-related information at an abstract level.
- This abstract processing reflects a dysfunctional self-regulation cycle and can lead to the maintenance or worsening of depressed mood.
- The researchers hypothesized that the specificity of thoughts would play a role in regulating the relationship between self attention and negative emotions.
- This study takes a unique approach to capturing the variability of thought patterns in daily life and examining their relationship to depressive symptoms.

These findings may contribute to a better understanding of the [[cognitive processes]] of depression and to the development of intervention methods.

The paper describes existing research as follows
- [[Self-attention]] and depression:
    - Many previous studies have shown that increased self attention is associated with increased negative affect and depressive symptoms.
    - In particular, [[depressive ruminating]] (the tendency to repeatedly focus on symptoms of distress, their causes and consequences) has been found to be an important risk factor for depression.
- Adaptive aspects of self attention:
    - On the other hand, it has also been theoretically proposed that self-attention may have adaptive and beneficial consequences.
    - An important dimension that determines the adaptability of self attention is the distinction between concrete and abstract configurations.
- Concrete and abstract thinking:
    - Concrete thinking is operationally defined as situation-specific, definite, and unitary.
    - Abstract thinking is defined as imprecise, trans-situational, and ambiguous.
    - Worry and depressive ruminations have been shown to show reduced concreteness.
- Experimental Studies:
    - There are experimental studies that have investigated different functions of self attention by manipulating the level of concreteness.
    - These studies show that abstract self attention negatively affects emotional responses and social cognition.
- Integration with control theory:
    - Watkins (2008) integrated concrete vs. abstract dimensions into control theory.
    - In this theory, goal pursuit is organized hierarchically, and switching from the abstract to the concrete level is critical for successful self-regulation.
- Studies using the empirical sampling method (ESM):
    - Prior ESM studies have shown a positive relationship between momentary ruminative self attention and concurrent and subsequent negative mood.

Building on these existing studies, this study takes a novel approach to investigate the variation in the concreteness of thoughts in daily life and its impact on self attention and emotional states.
