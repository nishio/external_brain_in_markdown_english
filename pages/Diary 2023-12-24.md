I switched my weekly journal and so on.
- I have decided to publish the original English version of the commentary on Japanese culture that I wrote for the [[Omoikane Project]] in its English version.
- [[Discovering Japan]]
- [/omoikane/explanation for those unfamiliar with Japanese culture](https://scrapbox.io/omoikane/explanation for those unfamiliar with Japanese culture).
