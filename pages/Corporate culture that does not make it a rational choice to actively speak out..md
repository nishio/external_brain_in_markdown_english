> Fourth, with regard to the issue of "corporate structure and culture," we often observed a weak attitude toward deterring and resolving problems through proactive and voluntary actions beyond the scope of one's own position in the event of a contingency such as the failure. In addition, there were situations in which the respondents refrained from speaking up and taking action when the full details of the disorder and its impact on customers were not completely clear, assuming that there was a risk.
>  The reason for the lack of such a proactive and voluntary attitude among executives and employees may be due to a [[corporate culture]] in which it is more rational for an organization to act in a way that says it was doing what it could in its own area, rather than taking the risk of becoming a liability issue by actively speaking out. This may be due to the fact that the organization has a [[corporate culture]] that makes it a rational choice to take actions that can be said to have done what one can do at one's own location rather than to take the risk of liability issues by actively raising one's voice.
