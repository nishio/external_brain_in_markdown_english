<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "Keichobot" is this "Keichobot"?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "chat format" is this "chat format"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>The program asks questions and you answer them.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is its "shape"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>👎 type
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "program" is this "program"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Extract keywords from the user's input, determine which keywords are best to drill down on, and fit them into a question template and return them.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "question" is that "question"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/> Questions that emphasize not distorting the speaker's thinking, created with reference to a technique called [[symbolic modeling]].
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "thoughts" are those "thoughts"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Or rather, there are already "metaphors that have not yet been verbalized" in the speaker's mind, and we help to bring them out in the form of words without distorting them.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "as yet unarticulated metaphor" is that "as yet unarticulated metaphor"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>A structure created in the speaker's mind from past experiences, which often takes the form of a metaphor during the verbalization stage.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "metaphor" is this "metaphor"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>The concept of metaphor is abstract, but do I need to explain this to you to get the point across? Indeed.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that "metaphor"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>When things are verbalized, they do not always come out in a form that can be understood by others, but first come out in the form of personal metaphors, which cannot be understood by others as they are, so they are not useful as "tools for communication," but they are useful as "tools for thinking," as they have a handle to manipulate your vague thoughts. It is useful as a "thinking tool" because it is like a handle to manipulate one's vague thoughts.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is the "metaphor"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>We're just coming up out of the sea of "what has yet to be verbalized" that comes out of the user's mind.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I think that putting thoughts into words is very useful, and groupware supports sharing "what is put into words" but does not support "putting into words" itself.

- How do you know this "metaphor"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>As we talk, I realize, "Oh, this is just like that one.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>

- Where is this "metaphor"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>While you are talking, you swim close to the surface of the ocean of "what has not yet been verbalized," and you imagine scooping it up with a flick of your hand.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "verbalization" is this "verbalization"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>The metaphor [[handle]] is added after the fact: "We talked about a lot of things, but metaphorically speaking, it's like something like..."
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen with respect to that "metaphor"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It would be good if it were better known that the process of verbalization is often accelerated by the creation of personal metaphors, and that the creation of these personal metaphors can be accelerated with the assistance of this software.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to the "metaphor" for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>The concept of "metaphor" is abstract and difficult for the uninitiated to grasp, so it needs to be made easier to grasp.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Can you do that with regard to "metaphor"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I don't know, never thought about it, worth the challenge.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  The concept of "metaphor" is abstract and difficult for the uninitiated to grasp, so this itself needs to be made easier to grasp.
- What does this "metaphor" look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I guess I need to be able to explain that. So far, I've been thinking of "the object to scoop up" and not "the fish", but I can't pinpoint the part where scooping up the fish makes it easier to verbalize it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about this "verbalization"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>If verbalization is "making words understandable to others," then "making words" comes first, and then refining them into a form that others can understand comes later.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>How do you know its "verbalization"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>You can tell if you've been able to put it into words that others can understand by throwing it at them and seeing if they catch it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "word" is that "word"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>hmm
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  The concept of "metaphor" is abstract and difficult for the uninitiated to grasp, so this itself needs to be made easier to grasp.
- Where does this "metaphor" come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>If you're talking about where personal metaphors come from, it's from personal experience. If you're talking about where the notion that metaphors are important came from [Eugene Gendlin.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "concept" is this "concept"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I think it would be better to summarize Eugene Gendlin once in Scrapbox rather than chatting about this now.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "speaking" is this "speaking"?
