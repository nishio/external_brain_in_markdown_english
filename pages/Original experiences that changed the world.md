title: "Original experiences that changed the world"
---

- I was watching an animation at SIGGRAPH ASIA 2021 and thought that for many people, the [[formative experience (from one's youth)]] of [[changing the world]] might be the moment when they picked up a pen and drew a line as a child.

It is not to play with "oil clay, which is prepared for kneading and can only be used for kneading and shaping."
To make a change in one's own hands in one's everyday dwelling or tools used by one's parents with "oil-based markers that can be used to draw lines on anything".

I guess there are those who were subsequently returned with rage and violence for their "world-changing" actions, and those who were receptive and then guided to write in this [[general-purpose notebook]], "But if you write here, I'll be in trouble."
- (Is it [[double bind]]-like to be given a free book and ordered to "write freely" after being violently returned to free action and atrophied?)

relevance
    - [The process of acquiring the belief that "I can change the world.

(By the way, I wonder if that animation will eventually be published somewhere so that we can link to it from here?)
