title: "Make it good."
---

- The words "[[good]] making things."
    - Create what you think is good by assuming it is "good" without considering what [[another person]] thinks.
    - Making what others say is good, regardless of how you feel about it.
- Not very happy in the long run with either of the
    - I made something that I thought was good and others said it was good.
    - Improving what others think is good because I think I can make it even better
- seems to be a good cycle going around.
