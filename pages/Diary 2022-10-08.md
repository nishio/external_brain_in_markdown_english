I'd like to automate it to the point of img2prompt and load it into the insta buffer.
- There should be an accumulation of unreviewed images now, as well as images waiting to be insta-ready for review.
    - I'd like to be able to see the size of each buffer and the amount of change.
    - You're totally playing as Factorio, yourself.

I'd like to merge the Scrapbox file generation in a swell way that doesn't break the human edits, too.

- Machine-generated messages have an icon at the beginning, so I think mechanical merging is possible.
    - Gyazo link at the beginning of the page
    - Below that [[CAP-tan]] message
    - In some cases, there's a human being writing something underneath it.
        - Maintain this.

```
new, not reviewed 16129
reviewed, not good 21219
reviewed, good, not insta-ed 550
good_to_inpaint 356
instagram published 747
```

- There are more than 300 sheets that you said, "I'll inpaint them later.
    - There are several patterns.
        - The ones that just need to be trimmed.
        - The one you want to inpaint.
            - Remove extraneous material and fill with background texture (this may be done without inpaint)
            - Draw no eyeballs.
            - Ears on and off.
            - Turn off and connect tails.
        - Good composition
            - The one that has a good color scheme, composition and rhythm, but not the details of the picture.
            - ![image](https://gyazo.com/8b8e7bc7d16eca8f8575f16f7aac775f/thumb/1000)
            - For example, the details of this one are not good at all, but the composition of "a black cat, a white cat with a little space between it and the bee ballet" is interesting.
            - As for this, there is a way to "simply use it for img2img".
- I put them all in img2img5 for now.
    - I've tried a few things, but I'd like to see a "Keep Prompt".
