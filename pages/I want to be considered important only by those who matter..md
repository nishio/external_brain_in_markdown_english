title: "I want to be considered important only by those who matter."
---


There are two ways to detail [[the desire to be thought of as important]].
- A: [[Desire to be considered important by an unspecified number of people]].
- B: [[Desire to be considered important by important people]].
    - Only to those who matter."

Whether or not there is a [[gender]] difference in modern Japan, let's put it aside.
In an environment where one [[boss monkey]] had dozens of female monkeys
- Male monkeys want to be the "boss monkey" that everyone thinks is important.
- Female monkeys want attention from important "boss monkeys".
I think there was a gender difference that

relevance
    - [[I want to be noticed.]]
- [[Desire to be perceived as a larger-than-life figure]].
- [[The desire to be perceived by others as a significant person.]]
- [[Desire to be told I'm great]]
