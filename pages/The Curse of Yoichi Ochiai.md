title: "The Curse of Yoichi Ochiai"
---

2018-03-11
Whenever I am about to say "[[busy]]" out of my mouth, [[the critic in me]] will ask, "Can you say the same thing in front of [[Yoichi Ochiai]]?" and I am forced to say, "I feel busy...but physically I still have time.

It makes you realize that busyness is only subjective, which means that the cause of busyness is not external but internal to you, and you are 100% responsible for the change....

> I've been living a life where my schedule is filled by multiple people without my permission for the past five years, so regardless of holidays or anything else, it just gets filled without consideration for my health or condition, and I'm not mentally busy at all because I'm optimized for that way of life.
- He says that, on the contrary, he is "[[not]] mentally busy."
- Feeling busy may be due to the amount of information and difficulty in deciding which task to do
    - So I don't feel mentally busy when others are deciding for me.
        - [[How to take the load undetermined task]] in relation to "overflowing anxiety"?
    - On the other hand, I am not adapted to this situation, and I feel strong stress about others filling my schedule.
        - Is it because I didn't schedule myself to keep my schedule from being filled?

relevance
- A similar curse is the "Curse of Tōdaiyū," which prevents people from saying, "I'm an engineer, so I don't know much about the law.

    - > The curse of NISHIO Hirokazu: Whenever I use a word with a half-defined definition, he asks, "What does that word mean?" I am forced to clarify the definition range and make it clear that my topic deals with a limited range.
- No, I'm sorry, sir. But that's your subjective opinion, isn't it?" (myself).
