The following is a summary of China's National Intelligence Law (NIL), focusing on Article 7 in particular, based on both English and Chinese sources. To summarize the main points first

**Article 7 provides that "All organizations and civilians must support and cooperate with national intelligence activities in accordance with the law and protect the secrets they learn."
While in Chinese-speaking countries, "dependent law" (i.e., subject to the restrictions of other laws) and protective clauses are also emphasized, in English-speaking countries, the imperative nuance of "shall support, assist and co-operate" tends to dominate. shall support, assist and co-operate" in the English-speaking world, the imperative nuance of "shall support, assist and co-operate" has taken on a life of its own and tends to be interpreted as an "unlimited duty of cooperation" on the part of the **company or overseas subsidiary.
