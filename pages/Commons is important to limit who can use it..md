title: "Commons is important to limit who can use it."

Some people use the word "[[commons]]" to mean something like "something that can be used by a vaguely unspecified number of people."
I'm fine with it as general everyday language, but not when you say "the commons of [[ostrom]]".

[[Elinor Ostrom]], through her work on "Sustainable Management of Shared Resources," has identified the conditions under which resources are not overexploited (depleted) and are maintained over the long term.
The following principles are considered to be of particular importance.
### "Clearly Defined Boundaries for Users" (Clearly Defined Boundaries)
- Ostrom points out that in the sustainable management of "common resources (commons)," it is first necessary to clearly define "who has the right to use those resources.
- When there is ambiguity about who can use a resource, there is a risk of a "tragedy of the commons," in which everyone puts their own self-interest first and overuses the resource.
- Therefore, it is important to draw clear boundaries as to who is a user of the resource and who is not, and to place restrictions to prevent unregulated entry by outside non-users.
