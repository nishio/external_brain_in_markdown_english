- Carl Rogers, a 20th century psychologist, is best known as the founder of client-centered therapy (also known as Rogers therapy). The following is a brief description of his ideas.
    - [[Client-Centered Therapy]]: Rogers' therapeutic approach emphasizes placing the client (patient) at the center. The therapist supports the client's self-understanding and self-acceptance and aims to help the client solve his or her own problems.
    - Three Key Attitudes: Rogers emphasized three key attitudes that a healer should have in an effective therapeutic relationship.
        - [Unconditional Positive Attention: Unconditional acceptance or positive attitude toward the client.
        - [Empathic understanding: a deep understanding of the client's feelings and perspectives.
        - [[Truthfulness]]: The healer is truthful and honest, does not hide his/her own feelings and thoughts.
    - [[self-concept]]: Rogers was concerned with the beliefs and felt values people have about themselves. He believed that people are more harmonious when there is consistency between our self-perception (self-concept) and our actual experience.
        - [[self-realization]] : Rogers believed that people have an instinctive motivation toward realizing their best selves. The more supportive the environment, he believed, the more an individual could advance this process of self-realization.
- Carl Rogers' approach has influenced many later psychotherapy methods and counseling techniques and holds an important place in the modern realm of psychology and counseling.
