I'm convinced that "[[DX]] and "[[A culture of hard work]]" are incompatible. It's because we don't work hard, so we let computers work for us. It's like the first one in [[The three virtues of programmers]] is "laziness. We need a culture in which "ingenuity to make things easier" is a good thing. #Ganbatte Nippon!
