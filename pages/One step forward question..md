One step forward question.

- When Mr. A has knowledge in the range of A and I have knowledge in the range of B, if I ask QB questions, which is my primary interest, Mr. A [[They don't understand.]] so I ask QA questions
    - It is natural that the scope of knowledge B extends beyond A in the direction of Mr. B's interests because he tends to be more knowledgeable about his area of interest than someone who is not interested in it.
    - Answer to that
        - X: The one that says it's obvious
            - A thinks he understands, but he doesn't understand B's intentions at all.
            - For B, the answer is worthless.
        - Y: Think in A's way
            - For A, it was an interesting extension of his own knowledge base.
            - For B, the answer itself is worthless because he already has it.
                - I like Mr. A for approaching me in my area of interest.
        - Z: Unknown answer even for B
            - This is very valuable to B
            - The picture looks like it's very far from A, but actually it might be closer to A from another perspective.
