Lowering the hurdle to speak reduces the attrition per statement.

When [[the hurdle to speak up]] is high, 10 out of 100 people speak up and 90 remain silent.
- Lowering the hurdle will get 90 out of 100 people to speak up.
- In this case, the amount of statements is multiplied by 9, so if the receiver remains the same, the attention per statement is 1/9
        - [[Attention is a scarce resource]]
- From the point of view of those who originally spoke out, the number has decreased from 9 to 1.
    - From those who did not speak up, the number is increasing by [[0 to 1]].

- [[attention]] is [[Rare resources]], which makes it impossible to lower the hurdle in the first place.
- As a result, the opinions of those who speak out without regard to cost appear larger than they really are.
    - There is no guarantee that those with the loudest voices are the majority.
        - So it is possible that following the opinions of those with the loudest voices can bring disadvantages to more people
            - [[noisy minority]]
    - Also, people with loud voices may start fights with each other.
        - The more extreme the views, the more likely they are to speak out, the more divisive they become.

There is an approach that lowers the hurdle by assuming that the AI compresses the data instead of a human reading it directly.
- It is assumed that humans do not read what is gathered
- Compression by AI always discards some information.
    - For example, abandoning emotions.
