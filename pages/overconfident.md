title: "overconfident"

There has long been an opinion that "a lack of interest [[in politics]]" is a problem, but isn't there also harm caused by an overabundance of interest?

- narrowing of vision and fragmentation
    - They tend to stick to their own position and exclude others, making dialogue difficult.
- Intensifying Emotional Conflicts
    - It undermines calm debate and increases the spread of slander and falsehoods.
- mental exhaustion
    - Constantly exposed to the topic of politics, stress and anxiety are likely to rise.
- Loss of interest in other fields
    - Loss of interest and learning opportunities in non-political areas and overall intellectual imbalance.

While political participation is important, it is also important to keep in mind the disadvantages of over-involvement and maintain a constructive distance.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>Expressing opinions about complex events easily without gathering and studying sufficient information tends to promote misguided views and misunderstandings. As a result, constructive discussion is hindered, and it is difficult to share accurate information and deep insights that are needed. To avoid this situation, it is essential that the parties involved first take the time to accumulate knowledge and gain some understanding. In addition, those around them need to be educated about the importance of information gathering and learning, and foster a system and culture that allows them to distinguish between opinions that are well-founded and those that are not.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>People who are exposed to "off-the-mark views" spread on social networking sites tend to be driven by the desire to correct or refute them. At first glance, this may seem to be an action to control the spread of [[misinformation]], but the following problems can occur.

- Sharpening of emotional conflicts
    - Opportunities for dialogue and understanding are lost as the exchange of counterarguments heats up.
- Increased cost of determining the truth of information
    - Those who refute misinformation also have a greater burden to show accurate sources of information, etc.
- Possibility of infinite looping
    - Endless rebuttals and re-rebuttals make it difficult to move on to constructive discussions.

While countering misinformation, we need to devise ways to avoid emotional confrontation and to deepen mutual understanding.

I don't think it's good that the desire to refute a view that misses the point is causing the behavior of "[[quote retweet]] and criticize" (which is the easiest thing to do).
- Wouldn't it be better if we could use [[Community Notebook]]-like methods easily?
- The people who are quoting and retweeting now see the value in "having opinions attributed to them".
    - Separate from community notes posted anonymously.
- However, I don't think creating "another social networking site that bans quote retweeting" is going to get people to move there.
    - We must consider the utility of each social networking site.
