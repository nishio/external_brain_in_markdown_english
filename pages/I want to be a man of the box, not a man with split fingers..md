I was thinking about self-display in VR space.
- I don't have a strong desire to be something other than humanoid, so I use humanoid avatars for the masses, but I don't have much desire to be humanoid, so if I had to make a full scratch avatar, I wouldn't choose a humanoid one.
    - Because the masses are unnecessarily discerning about humanoid objects, they are expensive.
- I was thinking about it, and then I got to the guy in the box.
    - However, the person in the box also slipped and fell into the sea in the play, which is not good.
- In the first place, physical localization is an old generation idea.
    - Isn't it not good enough to go to the trouble of mimicking the localization that is characteristic of matter in a world without physical constraints?
