title: "Don't take what you suddenly think is too good to be true"

> As we have already mentioned, valuable ideas may occur to you during the process of making a piece of paper, group organization, type-A diagramming, or type-B writing. We should never neglect these "[[occur to one]]" ideas. The most important aim of the [[KJ method]] is that these small ideas, however modest they may seem, will often have a [[cumulative effect]] and eventually bear a very valuable and large fruit.
- [[Continuing Ideas]]  p.107

I instruct people to write down on sticky notes anything that comes to mind while working on the KJ method, even if it seems irrelevant at first glance.
Because [[if you don't write it down, you'll forget it]] and I think forgetting is "doing it poorly."
