title: "Let's bug the humans."
---

[[sensor]] that cannot be measured correctly is not useful
- Buggy sensors need repair.

I see humans as a metaphor for sensors.
- What does it mean for a human to "[[be]] buggy"?
- Here, "to estimate that an event that occurs with probability p in reality occurs with a probability greater or less than p."

Let's bug everyone more.
- I was going to say "buggy people are less valuable."
- but there is absolutely no basis for it.
- On the contrary, I've always felt that buggy people make a more beneficial contribution to the advancement of civilization.
- →Let's bugger it up.

for some reason
- If everyone guesses the probabilities correctly and takes the same option, no search is done.
- Mistaking a low probability of success for a high probability of success [[Individuals engaging in high-risk behavior are necessary for the public good.]]

But if the reason it is better to have a variance in judgment is because of the need for exploration, i.e., you can't estimate accurately without exploration, so if you can really estimate accurately, shouldn't you have a variance?
- In other words, the conclusion is that humans are buggy and should be made more buggy!

relevance
    - [[human bug]]
    - [[Rebalancing to Emotions]]
    - [[People have personalities.]] It is beneficial
    - Even if the sensor returns an accurate value, if the perception of "what is of value" is varied, the behavior chosen will be varied.
