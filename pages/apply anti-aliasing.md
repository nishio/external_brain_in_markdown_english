    - [[anti-aliasing]] It doesn't look like it's on, but where do I turn it on?
    - Install [[Post Processing Stack]] in the Unity Store
    - Turn on antialiasing by referring to [Post-processing stack settings - Unity manual [https://docs.unity3d.com/ja/current/Manual/PostProcessing-Stack-SetUp.html](https://docs.unity3d.com/ja/current/Manual/PostProcessing-Stack-SetUp.html) Turn on anti-aliasing with reference to [[Post-processing stack settings - Unity manual ]].
