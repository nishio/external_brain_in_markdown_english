title: "Polis is a simple component"

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>Isn't [[Polis]] not a [[deliberation support system]]?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Polis feels like "[[a]] simple component" and not something to discuss on its own
- I think it's supposed to be used before or between discussions to break "[[assumption]]"
- For example.
    - I was surprised to find that there were different opinions on things I thought were "Yes, of course everyone says Yes.
    - I was thinking, "I'm more or less Yes, but I think it's controversial," only to find out that everyone agrees with me and there's no need to discuss it.
- The image that topping Polis with "discussion" makes it easier to become a "deliberative" discussion.

Conversely, the [[Stanford Online Deliberation Platform]] we experienced this time was like a "[[huge platform that contains everything]]".
- [[Decidim]] probably does too.
