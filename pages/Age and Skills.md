This study tracks how reading (literacy) and writing (numeracy) skills change with age (PIAAC-L data) among German adults. Conventional cross-sectional data appear to show that "skills decline from around age 30," but this may confound generational (cohort) differences.
The study retested the same individuals 3.5 years later and corrected for measurement error (regression to the mean) and found that, on average, both literacy and numeracy increased until about age 40, literacy hardly dropped thereafter, and numeracy dropped somewhat more strongly.
However, those who use their skills frequently (e.g., white-collar workers and highly educated people) continue to improve and hardly decline even in their 50s. On the other hand, those who use their skills less frequently begin to decline earlier in their 30s and 40s. In addition, women tend to fall more strongly than men, especially in mathematics (neumalacy).
In general, the report shows that "skills are lost if they are not used," while "they can be maintained and improved even in old age if used often," emphasizing the point that age alone does not mean a uniform loss of ability.


The following is a brief description of the main figures and tables (Figs. 1-5 and Table 1) in the text.

## Fig. 1: Cross-sectional age-skill profiles (OECD countries)
![image](https://gyazo.com/3e0014e3070bc15b82a61bdefb45f328/thumb/1000)
- Overview.
- Scores for literacy and numeracy are plotted by age for all OECD countries (25 countries).
- point.
    - In the cross-sectional data, skills appear to begin to decline with age in the late 20s and 30s.
    - However, the figure includes "generational (cohort) differences" and may not be the actual age change.

## Fig. 2: Longitudinal age-skill profiles

- (B) Marginal annualized change
- Plots "rate of change in skill (per year)" by age using longitudinal data with the same individuals retested approximately every 3.5 years. Values are shown corrected for error (regression to the mean).
    - Positive (rising) on average for both literacy and pneumacy until early 40s
    - Then literacy declined moderately and pneumatology declined somewhat more strongly.
- (A) Cumulative depiction
- The "Change in Skill Levels by Age" is the result of accumulating this information for each age group.
    - Literacy peaked in the mid-40s and has remained mostly flat.
    - Neumalacy peaks around age 40 and declines more clearly the older you get.

## Fig. 3: Age-skill profiles by skill usage
![image](https://gyazo.com/7ae03c5a0c022175658c1fae4644393a/thumb/1000)
- Overview.
- Literacy and pneumacy skills are divided by age into two groups: low frequency of skill use (Below-Median) and high frequency of skill use (Above-Median).
- point.
    - Those with high frequency of use show little or no age-related decline in skill, and even increases in their 50s
    - Starts to drop around 30s to 40s for those who use it infrequently.
    - Suggests that "use it or not" has a lot to do with skill change

In other words, "on average" skills decline from the late 40s, but that's because the people on the "not-using side" decline, and I'm probably on the using side, so I don't decline until I'm past 60.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

## Fig. 4: Age-skill profiles by background characteristics

> Fig. 4. Age-skill profiles by background characteristics.
>  Cumulative depiction of the predicted marginal annualized change in skills between the two waves at each age, adjusted for reversion to the mean. (A) By occupation. (B) By education. (C) By gender. Skills measured in SD units. Sample splits by blue-/white-collar occupations, (no) tertiary education, and gender, respectively. Sample: Employed workers, ages 16 to 65, weighted by sampling weights (N = 2497) (ages 22 to 65 for completed tertiary education). See figs. S10 to S12 for marginal skill changes by age. Data source: PIAAC-L.
- Overview.
- Longitudinal skill changes were compared by occupation (blue collar/white collar), education (with/without college degree), and gender (male/female).
- point.
    - White-collar and highly educated workers tend to continue to grow in skills as they age
    - Blue-collar and less-educated groups stagnate or decline in skills early
    - In terms of gender, the descent in pneumacy is particularly pronounced for women

## Fig. 5: Skill changes after age 40: By background characteristics and skill usage
![image](https://gyazo.com/e73a08262268ee359c7f7b3992cc01af/thumb/1000)
- Overview.
- Focusing on the 40+ age group, the previous subgroups of occupation, education, and gender are further divided by "frequency of skill use (High/Low)," and the change in skill use per year (positive or negative) is displayed as a bar graph.
- point.
    - In all subgroups, scores are more likely to be positive in the "high skill use" group, even in the 40s and beyond.
    - When "less used," scores tend to be in the negative (downward) direction for the same subgroup.
    - Women are particularly noticeable in the descent of pneumaracy, which is not as likely to rise as in men, even with more frequent use

In general, these charts illustrate the point that age does not automatically lead to a decline in skills, but rather the degree to which skills are used (especially literacy/numeracy use in daily life and work) is key.
