> [Raychaaaaan](https://x.com/Raychaaaaan/status/1806866466404454826) TakaraTomy, 2 million per child is great, but I also really like how you casually established a new allowance for those who covered maternity leave.
>  It's wonderful that you have a proper understanding of the field, and that you focus on and support the people who cover the holes of those who have taken a leave of absence.

>  >doctor_nw: Great effort so far by a major company. TOMY announced in July that it will introduce a program to provide 2 million yen per child for employees who take childcare leave for 28 days or more. 4 million yen for twins.

> [poizuukokatu](https://x.com/poizuukokatu/status/1806957814432051490) That's great! This will allow those who are taking a break to give birth and raise their children with peace of mind!

> [hayativeaction](https://x.com/hayativeaction/status/1806973513242460546) The twins are also amazing for those who don't take it!

> [Sayasay45057414](https://x.com/Sayasay45057414/status/1806968442043744660) It's good that it's easy to take maternity leave if you get a support allowance. It seems like it would be easier to return to work since both the person providing support and the person being supported would be able to spend their time without hesitation!

> [sakuaki_blog](https://x.com/sakuaki_blog/status/1806948911367778323) Those taking maternity leave will not have to worry as much as before!
>
>  Well thought out.

> [yuataso0222](https://x.com/yuataso0222/status/1807000096053342336) You're absolutely right!
>  I thought it was a vibrant system.

> [Nana77_Btc](https://x.com/Nana77_Btc/status/1806994049397838190) God help us all for giving benefits to those who cover parental leave!
>  This is a company that is properly addressing the nature of the problem.

> [OhAgXs1tsr64039](https://x.com/OhAgXs1tsr64039/status/1806957989355823442) I think we really need benefits for people covering maternity leave! It's a great way for everyone to feel good about themselves! I also got sick because my duties became two people and my overtime hours increased significantly, but my pay only went up by a sparrow's eye, and I honestly resented the people who took maternity leave, even though it really wasn't good for me.

> [YLMBY26Z6m3EZPf](https://x.com/YLMBY26Z6m3EZPf/status/1806957917335367773) maternity leave support benefits are great, if 3 or more people in the same department take maternity leave, they double their pay lol

> [yoshihito223](https://x.com/yoshihito223/status/1806990705077944493) I know this well. ‼︎

> [Misamisa00030](https://x.com/Misamisa00030/status/1806991992490283069) I want to work for Takara Tomy!

> [7BQhFZkVG0dEz8N](https://x.com/7BQhFZkVG0dEz8N/status/1806931328530874794) My company should do it!

> [chiiiitara6464](https://x.com/chiiiitara6464/status/1806973737356722461) They never did this to me. They threw everything at me and I was alone the whole time. I wish there were more companies like this.

> [taiyaki_sophia](https://x.com/taiyaki_sophia/status/1806965329719165179) I'm caught off guard by the 30% guideline for those who take maternity leave.

> [danshari_now_es](https://x.com/danshari_now_es/status/1806949605046980944) Excuse me from outside!
>  I think the support allowance is wonderful!
>  At my last job, if I covered for someone, somehow the amount of the maternity leave became the result of the person on maternity leave, and the person I covered for was treated as if he/she had not done his/her own work for that amount of time, and his/her appraisal was lowered.
>  I never got any thanks from my boss or even from people on maternity leave... why not?

> [nabbychan](https://x.com/nabbychan/status/1806968589687382112) This is awesome. TakaraTomy.

> [on2wheel](https://x.com/on2wheel/status/1806981103930232885) Somehow I think they are going to find out the salaries of those taking maternity leave, but it's a good system!
