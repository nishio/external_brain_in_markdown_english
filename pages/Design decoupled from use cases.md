Design decoupled from use cases
    - [[use case]] is numerous
- High cost of design and implementation to satisfy a large number of use cases
- User existence hypothesis abstracted from a small number of observed use cases
        - [[customer existence hypothesis]]
- Noise and overhead hang here.

- 1: B communicates with X, Y, and Z at other companies to collect information
    - thin line
- 2: Create a community where B, X, Y, and Z can come in and exchange information with each other.
    - [[Cross-organizational community]]
            - [[cross an organization]]
        - [[intersecting group]]
        - [[LoanDEAL Salon]]
        - [[Govtech kintone community]]
    - The line will be thicker than 1.
- 3: A, B, C become members of organizations X, Y, Z
    - Line between A and X is thicker
    - Line between A and B gets a little thinner.

If we ignore the pathway that ABC was originally from the same organization at stage 1, then there is no difference between 2 and 3?
