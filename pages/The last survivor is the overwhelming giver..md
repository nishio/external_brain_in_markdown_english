### Summary of notes
.
Influencers and social activists who engage in aggressive behavior on the Internet have a low survival rate on social networking sites. Such an approach makes it difficult to achieve sustainable growth and is not recommended for those who want to be active in the medium to long term. Ultimately, it is the givers who continue to create social value who will survive.

### Note and fragment association
.
The Note and the fragment "Why SNSs Rise and Fall" share a discussion of behavior on SNSs and its consequences. The note points out the low survival rates on SNSs of people with aggressive behavior, while the fragment explains how the composition of SNS users changes and how this affects the growth and decline of SNSs.

### deep thinking
Behavior on social networking sites has a significant impact on their viability. People who engage in aggressive behavior may attract attention in the short term, but such behavior is not sustainable in the long term. On the other hand, givers who continue to create social value will survive in the long term due to their contributions. This supports the notion that SNSs are shaped by individual actions and grow or decline as a result.
