title: "Proposal support mode for making"
---

A purpose-specific mode for [[Keichobot, a chatbot that brings out your ideas]] that helps people who propose creating something new to persuasively explain why it is necessary to create it.

how to start
- [https://keicho.netlify.app/#mode=value_hypothesis](https://keicho.netlify.app/#mode=value_hypothesis)

procedure
- As we begin, we start with six questions (the question text changes a bit depending on the situation).
    - Who is it for?
    - What would you like to see happen to that person?
    - What needs to happen for that to happen?
    - What kind of things would make it so?
    - What made you think that way?
    - What can you do to help?
- Once you have answered the six questions, you will be asked to dig deeper based on your answers up to that point.
    - Answering this will clarify the meaning of the words you used
- You can answer the six questions again from the beginning by pressing the "Again" button.
    - By repeating the process several times, you will gradually refine the story of why it is important to make this

how it ends
- There is no end to the dialogue, so you can leave and ignore the program's questions at any time.

examples showing the use (of a word)
    - [[Support for proposals to create new]]
    - [[Create a system that motivates people to chat with each other.]]

relevance
- The base question is [[Value Hypothesis Sheet]], but after using it several times, a "trigger question" and a "what you can do question" have been added

- [[Listening Chat System]]
