    - [Start up [[update]] [[model]] by drawing [[conceptual map]].

    - I had a fantasy of a real-life model rising from the shadows.
    - I remember thinking something similar (?). I remember thinking about this once.[/motoso/現実理解モデル](https://scrapbox.io/motoso/現実理解モデル)<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - > Dimensions can be reduced to understand things ([[dimensional reduction]]).
            - Maybe I'm losing a dimension.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/meganii/icon' alt='/villagepump/meganii.icon' height="19.5"/>

                - In order to materialize a concept, you have to drop a dimension to express it.
                - See what you represent and give feedback to the model.
        - > Opportunity to modify the model by comparing the model output with the external world if time is available
            - > Technology is evolving in a spiral [[and may look the same but be different]], so the model needs to be updated appropriately
                    - [[spiral staircase]]
            - Comparing your model to the outside world and updating your model when there is a difference may be exactly what you have in mind.
    - Mmmm, sounds like an interesting story!<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Feedback stories of misalignment with reality
                - [[PDCA and error back propagation]]
        - A story of rising from the shadows
                - [[Always in the shadows.]]
            - > Tower casts a flat shadow on the ground
            - > higher abstractions have information that corresponds to concrete layers of lower abstraction
            - > By learning this less abstract information in a way that we don't understand, we accumulate the knowledge that "A and B are connected.
            - > Eventually, when A is understood, A, which was placed on the ground, is lifted high, and B and C are also pulled up.
            - Oooh, I was horrified by what it said.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/meganii/icon' alt='/villagepump/meganii.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - There is always a shadow."
            - When I wrote this I was disappointed that the person I spoke to didn't get it, so I'm saved by being helpful here, I'm coming of age 🙏.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - [[井戸端に置いて供養]]🙏<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/meganii/icon' alt='/villagepump/meganii.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - [[image]] というメタファーを複数人が使っているのは胸熱<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/sta/icon' alt='/villagepump/sta.icon' height="19.5"/>
