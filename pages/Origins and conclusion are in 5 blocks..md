>  What is called "Kiyo Seisen" is actually a composition theory based on five blocks, not four, or even more specifically, eight blocks, and is actually the same as the "Hollywood-style eight-act composition.
>  ・The beginning and ending are the parts that "structurally come into existence," and the ending is the highlight of the work.
>  ・The key is the rhythm of the forward and inverse tangent.

(the succession and maximization of the oscillations)/resolution (the establishment of the final stability)", which is actually perfectly in line with the Hollywood style of three acts and eight scenes, or 1:2:1.

> [kasai_sinya](https://twitter.com/kasai_sinya/status/1782364845754761604) In a medium like film, where time flows automatically, "1:2:1" is the time distribution, but in novels and manga, rather than the physical amount of time, should we think of it as " Is it better to think of it as "episode amount"?

I'm like a bean sprout with a poor physique and insufficient will to fight.
