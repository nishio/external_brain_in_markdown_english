title: "Failure is an opportunity to make new friends."

Audrey's question at [WIRED UNIVERSITY x Miraikan

Q: I am negative about failure.
A: Failing as quickly as possible is an opportunity for the next co-creation.
Publish the manifesto online, take suggestions and revise it, this is co-creation
Don't be a perfectionist and release as soon as possible!
You'd have to complete it and then claim it wasn't a failure in the release.
Transparent failure would eliminate ego. To the person who pointed out the failure, "Let's do this together!" can say, "Let's do it together!
Failure is an opportunity to make new friends.


It stung like hell.
