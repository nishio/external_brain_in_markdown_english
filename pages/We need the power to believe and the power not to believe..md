- My experience with [Mercury (company name)
Me: I was not aware that Raku-Raku Mercari-bin and Yu Yu Mercari-bin are different things.
Wife: My husband trusts too much that the world's system design is organized. He assumes it is rational and that it should be rational. But the real world is not. We need [[the power of belief]] and [the power of unbelief
Me: You need to dig a little deeper. [We must not assume that society is rationally designed.
Wife: Don't assume that they are properly manualed or checked to work properly. It's human beings who make them, so there will be mistakes.
Me: The power of belief, on the other hand, is the assumption that if no one can do it, it must be more complicated, so there must be a solution?
Wife: And the assumption is that it should be something that can be arrived at with some kind of straightforwardness, and not "a type of solution that can only be arrived at with the use of advanced brainpower".

A: There are two kinds of places in the world: "where the grass grows thick" and "where the grass has been trampled on by many people.
B: Many people follow the directions on the sign, but when they come to the [[grassy knoll]], they think, "This must not be the way to go," or "The sign must have been wrong.
- Not believing that "the signs are right."
- Believe that "where there is less grass, there must be a goal."
    - Thinking, "There is no way I would do something so obscure."
        - Therefore, problems such as "not reading the written instructions and performing appropriate operations" can also occur.
C: I would trust the signs and go straight ahead even if the grass is bowed down, and climb up to the oka or rocky hill.
- Maybe it's not so much that you believe so strongly in the sign, but that you're not very good at changing your mindset to "there must be a goal where there's no grass."
- Because in research, there is no answer in a "trampled and weedless place," and the answer is found when you trust yourself and go straight through the weeds, right? [[(a metaphor for) pushing through a wasteland]].
- When you try to do what the majority public does, you don't need [[a research mental model]], you need [[to behave like the majority]].

relevance
    - [[Running away from difficulties does not make you stronger.]]
    - I guess this is another phenomenon where people see the grass is greener and think, "There must be an answer where the grass is not greener.
