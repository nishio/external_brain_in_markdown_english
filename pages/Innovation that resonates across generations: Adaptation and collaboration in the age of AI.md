Innovation that resonates across generations: Adaptation and collaboration in the age of AI

> [kazu_fujisawa](https://twitter.com/kazu_fujisawa/status/1775730333864087565) In the past, young people had an overwhelming advantage over middle-aged and older people because they were familiar with IT and had mastered many things. But in today's world, old people are overwhelmingly more skilled in IT than young people...

> [ai_syacho](https://twitter.com/ai_syacho/status/1775772600360435984) I didn't think so?

> [takiuchi](https://twitter.com/takiuchi/status/1776003592190562385) It used to be a matter of course that the elders could do everything better in every field in the history of mankind. Perhaps the only exception was the period of computer diffusion when society was drastically changed by IT, and there was a miraculous moment when young people with high adaptability were the most knowledgeable because there was no one above them who knew more. But then it all goes back to the way it was.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1776296722689671255) What, isn't the next 15 years "the period of AI diffusion" that will bring more radical changes to society than "the period of computer diffusion that has radically changed society"?

> [takiuchi](https://twitter.com/takiuchi/status/1776300799297306702) That's right, but our generation is already using AI, and it's not so much a specific generation that is shying away from AI, but rather the industry. IT and AI are both in the realm of "someone above us knows it all".

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1776306755800383925) I think it will be 5-10 years before we see AI that will change the world, but to look at AI today and say "we know more than the young people" seems to be typical behavior of the generation that "doesn't get it". It seems to be a typical behavior of "the generation that doesn't get it"...

> [takiuchi](https://twitter.com/takiuchi/status/1776307577544229050) When that "world-changing AI" comes out, I can't imagine our older generation evading it like they hated IT. Because "new things" have been on our side ever since they came into the world. Maybe this generation will always continue to embrace the new.

The debate about generational adaptability to the evolution of IT and AI has major implications for education, work styles, and social structures. There was once a time when young people had a clear advantage in information technology. Over time, however, many older people have also become proficient in these technologies, and the gap between them and the youth has narrowed. This is due to workplace needs, personal interests, and the prevalence of lifelong learning.

With a new wave of AI adoption looming, past patterns of intergenerational technological adaptation are once again in the spotlight AI technology, by its very nature, requires deeper learning and understanding than IT technologies of the past. This is because to take full advantage of AI's capabilities and potential, one must not only learn how to operate it, but also understand the principles and ethical considerations behind it.

However, with the proliferation of AI technologies, it is important not only to become familiar with new technologies, but also to have the ability to understand and think critically about how these technologies will affect our lives and our society. This is a challenge that applies equally to young and old. While the knowledge and experience that older people have gained in past IT revolutions is still valuable in the AI era, [[intergenerational collaborative learning]] and dialogue are essential to address the new problems and possibilities unique to AI.

Ultimately, the greatest challenge in the AI era will not only be mastery of the technology itself, but also how to use it to better shape society. minimize the risks. It is important that the education system, the workplace, and society as a whole remain flexible to this change and create an environment that fosters continuous learning and adaptation.

This is probably because they grew up in such a [[original landscape]]. This generation is stronger when times change rapidly and weaker when times stagnate. I think they have adapted in this way. The destination of adaptation is not "IT" but "[[change]]," and AI is a continuation of that.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>This statement deeply resonates with me, as I consider [[the ability to adapt to changing times]] to be the most important skill. In today's world of accelerating technological evolution, [[the ability to flexibly adapt to change itself]], rather than specific technologies, is essential for individual success and social prosperity. It is time for education and job training to shift from the transmission of knowledge to the development of critical thinking and creative problem solving. The ability to accept and adapt to change is the key to the future.
