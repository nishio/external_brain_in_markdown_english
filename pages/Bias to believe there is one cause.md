> Whenever we encounter a problem, we think we can pinpoint a single cause. However, many problems are caused by a combination of two or more things at the same time. If there is only one, it does not occur.
> If you strike the right hand and the left hand, you get sound. If only the right hand strikes, no sound is produced. Neither can the left hand alone. Two hands are needed.
