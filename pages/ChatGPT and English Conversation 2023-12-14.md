- I see that the filler and other subtle grammatical errors in my statement have been corrected at the speech recognition stage.
- I'm not sure I'm hearing some of it correctly.
    - > I'm not sure, but maybe I think the group here can think more better than me.
    - I thought I said something along the lines of "I'm sure a smart AI can come up with better ideas than I can," but I didn't get it.
    - I wasn't sure why the rest of the section talked about Collaborative thinking, but I guess it was because of this mishearing
- I heard that if you hold down the speak button, it will continue to listen even if you are not saying anything, but I didn't do that because I was chatting while doing other things with it by my side, and it cuts me off with a blank after the because.
    - Optimizing for this is going to get me in the habit of saying "ehhhhh" or something like that.
        - [[faltering]] is an important linguistic opportunity, so I don't like the incentive to go in the direction of avoiding it.
    - I wish this place was adjustable.
    - With the current technology, the "speech to text component" creates the text and then passes it to the "text reading AI", which is why you get this kind of UX.
        - It's technically possible to have a system where the voice recognition results are sent to the AI as a stream, so I'm sure we'll eventually see an AI optimized in the form of voice input and voice response.
- When we have an audio exchange, a muffled image without much information is displayed, but I'd like to see the transcribed content of our statement and the text of the other party's statement displayed.
    - I'd love to see VR goggles or something with this on the front and related materials on the left and right.
    - About voice input
        - I used to see it as the equivalent of text entry on a keyboard, so I couldn't tolerate minor mistakes.
        - However, when used for the purpose of "conversation with an AI that understands English," if the approximate meaning can be conveyed, there is no problem in continuing the conversation.
        - So the line of "speech recognition accuracy that users find valuable" is going down.
    - I thought "VR goggles + communication in English" could be a form of "VR goggles + communication in English" not too far off.
