A passage from the lyrics of [Reflection
    - [[snare]] in [[kindness]].

Possibility that seemingly well-meaning actions and attitudes are actually traps
    - [[The road to hell is paved with good intentions.]]
- Forcing self-sacrifice for the benefit of others
- Superficial kindness is actually a means of pursuing self-interest.

- [[The "obviously good" trap.]]
- If something seems obvious and good, it may actually be an oversight or misunderstanding
