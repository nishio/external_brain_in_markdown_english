I made an account.
Because it was a required field on the registration form for the Speaker Only Event at [[Funding the Commons Tokyo]].

So it's like Slack or Discord.
- If you don't know the details and just listen to the news, you'd assume it's like "anonymous chat used for illegal drug trafficking, etc.".
- It's important to see everything with your own eyes.
