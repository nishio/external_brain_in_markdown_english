- It's been 10 days, why?
- 5th is Saturday
- The next Sunday was the Idobata development offline meeting.
    - Shouldn't we have been able to switch here?
        - Ah, yes, and then a bunch of us went to a diner and had a waffling discussion and our brains overflowed.
            - [[Nodal Point of Thought 2025-04-06]]
- The next Monday I took the wrong day off.
- 4/8 Tuesday meeting as usual
        - [[Championship for the best Vibe Coding]] Plan
    - I had to run an errand on Thursday, so I don't have time available to prepare materials for an in-house study session on Friday.
        - However, I don't want to delay review-machi PR for another week, so nn [[Wide Hearing AI2025-04-08]].
- 4/9 Wed.
        - [[Digital Democracy 2030 Study Group]] I had Devin create the materials.
    - Since the review process for the Unexplored Junior is not easy, I had Devin create a [[script that extracts text from PDFs and throws it to OpenAI with the Batch API]].
    - Week 4 Summary of Digital Democracy 2030
        - I've been generating it every Wednesday lately.
- 4/10 Thu.
        - [[Bouldering 2025-04-10]]
- 4/11 Friday, In-house study session to get serious about reviewing unexplored juniors.
- 4/12  [[Digital Democracy 2030 MeetUp]]
    - Coming home very sleepy
- 4/13 Deadline for judging of Unexplored Juniors
    - Worked on making yesterday's discussion an ISSUE so it wouldn't drift away.
- 4/14 I was tired, I had an interview and I shrugged it off.

Okay, in case you're wondering, I turned around.

4/23 I feel it's a problem that I haven't been able to switch my weekly journal.
