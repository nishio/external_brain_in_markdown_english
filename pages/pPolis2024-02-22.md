<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Below are the notes of my predecessor. I have taken over this service. I do not understand anything. Explanation.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>This memo describes the process of setting up an open source AI-based feedback platform called Polis on Amazon EC2. polis is a tool for collecting and analyzing large scale, open-ended feedback. Below is a summary and description of the memo.
- Setup Overview
    - Create an instance: select Ubuntu as the OS in Amazon EC2, type t2.medium, 8GB storage.
    - Docker installation: Polis runs on Docker, so install Docker on Ubuntu.
    - Polis installation: clone the Polis repository from GitHub, copy the environment configuration file and start the build. If you encounter permission issues with the Docker daemon during the build, add a user to the Docker group.
- Detailed process
    - Error during instance creation: We first tried with a t2.micro instance, but found it took too long to build, so we changed to t2.medium.
    - SSL Certificate: An SSL certificate is required to securely publish Polis on the Internet. By default, an insecure self-signed certificate is used, but in a production environment, a legitimate certificate must be obtained using Let's Encrypt or similar.
    - Domain authentication problem: When publishing Polis externally, the domain must be correctly specified in the configuration file. Attempting to use an unauthenticated domain will result in an error.
    - Security rule: EC2 security rules require port 80 to be open to allow HTTP communication. When obtaining certificates, the Polis server must be stopped to free port 80.
    - SSL certificate configuration: After obtaining an SSL certificate, edit the Nginx configuration file to apply the certificate. Considering the automatic renewal of certificates, it is better to use a tool such as Certbot to set the certificate to be renewed automatically rather than copying the certificate file directly.
    - Operational Issues: Since the development server is used as a production environment, the system may become unresponsive during periods of heavy access. It is important to check the logs to determine the cause of the problem.
    - Feedback on UI and functionality: issues with the same user interface causing confusion and Twitter integration not being set up were noted. Also mentioned is the ability to post opinions anonymously and the inability to track past votes.
This memo is a detailed record of the series of steps involved in setting up and operating Polis, the problems encountered and their solutions. This information will serve as a reference for future setups of similar platforms.
