title: "A system that asks better questions"
---

I realized that the two things I've been doing lately can be summed up as "systems that make questions better."

A:  [[Vector Search in Nishio]]
- This is not easy to understand at first glance, so I'll explain it in context
    - To begin with, my Scrapbox vector search was working locally.
    - There was no incentive to make it a public service.
    - I thought it would be interesting to see [[an AI Teaching Assistant]] that [[collects and improves]] questions.

B:  [[Questioning by OpenAI]]
- This polis "which questions should be delved into".
