title: "Design Thinking and Defensive Thinking"
---

> The other day, I asked the CEO of [[IDEO]] what he thought about the criticism that [[creativity]] is being lost due to the [[uniform frame]] of design thinking, and he told me that design thinking is like music: the more you learn about [[type (e.g. of machine, goods, etc.)]], the more you learn how to remove it. It was very refreshing to hear that even at IDEO, there are times when they don't listen to the users at all beforehand.
