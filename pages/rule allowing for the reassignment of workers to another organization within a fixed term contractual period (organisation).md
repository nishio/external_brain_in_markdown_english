### Intent at time of introduction
.
- Prevent abuse and disposable [[fixed-term contracts]] and guarantee [[stable employment]] (permanent conversion) for workers who work beyond a certain period (a total of five years).
- Aiming to improve productivity and working conditions by utilizing the skills and experience gained through [[long-term service]] on the part of both the company and the workers.

### Unintentional things that happened after the introduction of the system
.
- Increasingly, contracts are terminated before reaching the five-year mark ("five-year avoidance"), which in turn increases the risk of [[termination of employment]].
- The employment of [[researcher]] and [[part-time lecturer]] has become unstable due to the increasing use of [[5-year contract limit]] at universities and research institutes.
- Cases in which the "cooling period" is used to break up contracts intermittently, thereby undermining the purpose of the system.
- Some companies do not provide sufficient benefits, such as not changing (or worsening) the treatment of employees after a permanent change of employment.
