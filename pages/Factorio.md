#Management Games
- You can learn [[TOC]].
    - Focusing on local optimization does not contribute to overall improvement
    - Identify bottlenecks and tune there, other areas can be rather worse
        - So-called drum buffer rope
- The difference from reality is that there is no cost to inventory.
    - You could make it cost more with mods.
    - The information industry is not burdened with inventory.
- When money is available for lab research consumption, it looks like management.
    - Or biters mutate like a flu virus, and research efforts are needed to create corresponding antibodies.
- The change in flasks needed when the Factorio study is completed and the next study is started and the resulting change in factory utilization and inventory is similar to a factory being forced to respond to changing market needs.
