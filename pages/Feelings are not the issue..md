- I want as many people as possible to know about X."
- This is not an issue.
- I want (to) let a lot of people know about X."
- A mere statement of fact, "I think this.
- There is no reason to argue against it.

- A lot of people should know about X."
- This is a close call.
- In many cases, "many people should know X", which is not referred to as legally binding or anything, is not a literal proposition, but a shortened form of "I believe that many people should know X".

- When more people know X, it has a positive effect on their lives."
- This way we can discuss it.

- [[sensation]] is not [[subject]].
    - [[logic monster]]
