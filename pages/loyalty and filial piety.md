<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This series of tweets describes my experience visiting a temple in [[Taiwan]] that worships Japanese people as gods.
The main contents are as follows
- Seijiro Morikawa], a policeman in Taiwan during the Japanese colonial period, served the people of Taiwan and committed suicide in his final days against heavy taxes imposed by the Governor-General. Today, he is enshrined as a deity named "Lord Giai.
- Taiwanese people treat Lord Yi-Ai as a living being, celebrating his birthday and making offerings to him.
- In Taiwan, other deities are treated as living beings as well, and people have close relationships with them.
- Lord Yi'ai is not just a "pro-Japanese" figure, but a special one, and shows the characteristics of Taiwan's faith culture.
- We must not forget that there were negative aspects to Japan's rule of Taiwan. For example, the "Wusha Incident," in which the [[Sedek]] people rose up against Japanese [[colonial rule]].
These tweets convey the unique characteristics of Taiwan's religious culture and the complex aspects of Japanese colonial rule.

>  "你好，聽說這裡有日本人的神明 (Um, I heard there is a Japanese god here.)"
>  "Oh, yes, I'm here, I'm enshrined. Did you come all the way from Japan by any chance?

>  Seijiro Morikawa. A Japanese policeman in colonial Taiwan who devoted himself to the education and sanitation of the Taiwanese people, and in his last days committed suicide to stop the Governor-General from imposing heavy taxes on the people, the Kanagawa Prefecture-born Japanese man is now a god named "Lord Giai.

> [SEI__jou](https://twitter.com/SEI__jou/status/1785267678351122445) I was added to a circle of older men chatting and drinking tea. They talk about it in an endless stream.
>  The fact that he served the people of Taiwan in his lifetime, the fact that his "hometown" was not in Japan but in Dongshi, a coastal town a short distance from here, where he became a god, the fact that his "birthday" is April 8 in the agricultural calendar (lunar calendar)...

> [SEI__jou](https://twitter.com/SEI__jou/status/1785269255916659097) "On my birthday, I take God to the East Stone. It's God's 'home'."
>  With that, they proudly showed me photos of their pilgrimage on foot to the ancestral shrine of the branch spirit origin.
>  Japanese policeman Seijiro Morikawa is not dead. The Japanese God in front of him is "alive" as a matter of course.

> [SEI__jou](https://twitter.com/SEI__jou/status/1785270614930121086) It is not only Lord Yi Ai. Taiwanese gods "live" there, just like humans.
>  Because they are alive, they celebrate birthdays, desire incense and firecrackers as humans desire feasts, rise from ghosts to gods through spiritual tales, and sometimes travel.
>  And people are right next to the living God,

>  People set off firecrackers and techno-pop music, hoping to gain some benefit from this world, while taking for granted the fact that Mazu, who was born about a thousand years ago, is still alive.

>  I thought how beautiful the lives of such people are in front of their uncles who talk about Lord Yi'ai in an endless stream as if they were talking about a living acquaintance.

> [SEI__jou](https://twitter.com/SEI__jou/status/1785272629966090623) I received a booklet before I left.
>  "Biography of Prince Giai: Seijiro Morikawa lives beyond time and space.
>
>  "Thank you for coming from Japan. I am sure God is pleased with your visit. Next time, on his birthday, April 8, you should come to his 'hometown' (Dongseok) to make a pilgrimage.

> [SEI__jou](https://twitter.com/SEI__jou/status/1785309039209099303) Supplemental It would be unreasonable to view Lord Giai/Morikawa Seijiro, who committed suicide after failing to stop the imposition of heavy taxes by the Governor-General, as a mere representation of "pro-Japan" sentiment. It would be unreasonable to view him only as a "pro-Japanese" figure. In addition, while most Japanese deities in Taiwan began to be enshrined after the country's democratization, Lord Giai was enshrined before the war, making him a unique figure.

> [SEI__jou](https://twitter.com/SEI__jou/status/1785309909653065923) It is quite impossible to explain the fact that Japanese deities are enshrined in Taiwan simply on the basis of "pro-Japanese", and that there is a unique religious culture in the Chinese world at the root of this For example, Professor Yohei Fujino of Hokkaido University has explained about this ([https://youtu.be/qKziv6a7RUc?si=5zo8kpMpOSLaXv1z...),](https://youtu.be/qKziv6a7RUc?si=5zo8kpMpOSLaXv1z...),) so if you are interested, you should take a look. youtube .com
