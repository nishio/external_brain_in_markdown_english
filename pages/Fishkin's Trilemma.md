Fishkin's "[[Democracy's]] Trilemma" is
The argument presented by Stanford University political scientist [[James S. Fishkin]] is that it is difficult to satisfy the following three values simultaneously
- [Political equality: one person, one vote, reflected with equal weight. ([Deliberative Democracy Journal](https://delibdemjournal.org/article/id/638/))
    - [[careful deliberation]] (deliberation): reaching a considered judgment through informed and mutual discussion. ([Deliberative Democracy Journal](https://delibdemjournal.org/article/id/638/))
- [[mass participation]]: the actual participation of many citizens. ([Deliberative Democracy Journal](https://delibdemjournal.org/article/id/638/))
Fishkin summarizes it as "when you try to satisfy two of them, the other one is likely to be undermined" (he himself calls it a "trilemma of democratic reform"). ([Deliberative Democracy Journal](https://delibdemjournal.org/article/id/638/))

Three typical combinations and their limitations
- [[equality × participation]] (≈ elections/people [[voting]])
    - The majority can participate equally, but deliberation tends to be weakened by individual [[rational ignorance]] and [[incitement]]. ([Deliberative Democracy Journal](https://delibdemjournal.org/article/id/638/))
- [[Participation × Deliberation]] (≒ [[Town Meeting]]/Spontaneous Participation Deliberative Forum)
    - Participation may widen, but [[representativeness]] breaks down due to [[self-selection]] (participatory distortion), and equality is undermined. ([Deliberative Democracy Journal](https://delibdemjournal.org/article/id/638/))
- [[equality x deliberation]] (≈ [[mini-public]] of raffles/random selection/deliberative polling)
Random sampling allows for conditions of representativeness and deliberation, but not mass participation (many citizens do not participate as parties). ([Deliberative Democracy Journal](https://delibdemjournal.org/article/id/638/))

Directions presented by Fishkin
- Deliberative Polling implements "Equality x Deliberation" (but mass participation is not yet met). This arrangement is presented in a chapter as a central issue in the book When the People Speak (2009) ("The Trilemma of Democratic Reform"). ([Semantic Scholar [https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/When-the-People-Speak%3A-Deliberative-Democracy-and-Fishkin/a4eba3b30c396ca](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/When-the-People-Speak%3A-Deliberative-Democracy-and-Fishkin/a4eba3b30c396ca) 4dcc297595342880933746dcc?utm_source=chatgpt.com], [Cambridge University Press & Assessment [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/) perspectives-on-politics/article/when-the-people-speak-deliberative-democracy-and-public-consultation-by-james-s-fishkin-new-york- oxford-university-press-2009-256p-2995/CB1E4E773FBF39BC5E609460CF2FD7A5])
- On that basis, in my recent book Democracy When the People Are Thinking (2018), I discuss the first step toward achieving the three values simultaneously in a "deliberative system," including the Deliberation Day concept (which seeks to achieve deliberative participation on a scale close to everyone through technology and institutional design (A proposal to achieve deliberative participation on a near-universal scale through technology and institutional design). ([Deliberative Democracy Journal](https://delibdemjournal.org/article/id/638/))
