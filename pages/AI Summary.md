Hear you say, "I hate AI summaries."
- Well, I don't think the AI summary is very good.
    - But I think it's worth the plus, and I use it a lot.
    - I felt it would be beneficial to verbalize what the negative aspects are.
- AI summary is also a "summary," so it truncates specific branches and leaves.
    - the upper illustration
- On the other hand, when I read normally, there's a sense of connection and expansion with what I already have.
    - At this time, there is a sense that we are only expanding one step from what we already have.
            - [[I can only accept knowledge that is one step ahead of what I have now.]]
    - Experience starts with the concrete, and from there, the level of abstraction gradually increases to "my own interpretation".
        - So there are a lot of anchors in me in specific zones.
        - Summarizing and abstracting makes it harder to connect with your own experience.
- [[Hopefully the knowledge in the book will connect with your own experience.]]

I get the sense that you don't consider AI summaries a replacement for reading.
- When you're summarizing, that's like a table of contents.
