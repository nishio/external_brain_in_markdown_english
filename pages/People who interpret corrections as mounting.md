title: "People who interpret corrections as mounting"

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1642345185777688577) People who interpret a minor [[amendment]] as "[[mounting]]," simply [[pain in the ass (arse)]], and most people I don't want to be part of the community." but he/she doesn't realize it and thinks, "Isn't it detrimental to the growth of the community to harm my [[in a good mood]]?" (Not an air rip, but a general statement.)

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1642346536846909443) I used to collect this kind of [[toxic mentality]] as "[problems caused by the elderly (esp. gerontocracy, and elderly people's control over the young)". gerontocracy, and elderly people's control over the young)", but I don't think the correlation with [[the old]] is that strong. Maybe "low [[self-assurance]]" is the main factor, and the decline in ability due to [[adding to one's]] years is only one of the factors. So it happens even if you are young.
