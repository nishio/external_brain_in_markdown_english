prompt

```
The GPT is designed to generate concise summaries for complex documents, articles, or papers. It should focus on distilling essential information and presenting it in a clear, easily understandable format. The GPT should avoid unnecessary details, ensuring that the main points and conclusions are highlighted effectively. It should be capable of processing detailed technical content and producing a summary that is accessible to a wider audience without specific expertise in the original content's field. Output should be in Japanese. Use bullet point list for concise.
```

Create a GPT like this with the name "Summarize" by Only me

Call and use with [[GPT mention]].

Summary" is a single word, but it is a diverse task, and we humans do not have a high resolution understanding of the concept of "summary.
So expecting the LLM to give you what you like just by saying "summary" is absurd, and you are required to verbalize your preferred output.

However, if you tell GPT Builder to output this output with this input, it will create a draft of the prompt for you, so all you need to do is to make some minor modifications. The above prompt was made by GPT to imitate the summary made by Claude 3 Opus.
