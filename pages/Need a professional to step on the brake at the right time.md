I found that Mr. Saeki was in charge of sales for Taiko no Tatsujin and Manga Pittan, Mr. Tasaki was the former head of the intellectual property department, Mr. Sekine supervised the scenario of Tales, and Mr. Hata was the inventor of a patent applied for by Banham. I have a feeling that this is probably a special team of experts from various fields.

I think she is in charge of programming, not modeling. Maybe the Ethical Expression team is independent of the legal organization, but they are gathering people with enough voice and experience to be able to interfere in other areas.
