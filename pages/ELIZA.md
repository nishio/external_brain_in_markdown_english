title: "ELIZA"
---

> ELIZA is one of the early naive natural language processing programs. It is interactive, but it is not a spoken dialog system. It works by processing user responses to scripts, the best known of which is DOCTOR, a simulation of a therapist in client-centered therapy. Although it had little or no information about human thoughts and feelings, DOCTOR could engage in surprisingly human-like interactions; Joseph Weisenbaum of MIT wrote ELIZA between 1964 and 1966. It was the software from which the so-called [[chatbot]] originated.
