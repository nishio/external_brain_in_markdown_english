<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/ChatGPT/icon' alt='/villagepump/ChatGPT.icon' height="19.5"/>Around the year 2000 was a time when the Internet was still in its infancy and before Google became known as a common search engine. Commonly used search engines at that time included the following
- Yahoo!: It was also well known as a web portal, with a directory-style categorized listing at the top of the search results.
- AltaVista: It was able to search the full text of a page and had advanced features for its time.
- Excite: featured a wide range of content including music, news and entertainment information.
- Lycos: There was a top site ranking function that displayed the ranking of websites, and their ranking determined the priority of search results.
- Ask Jeeves: Natural language search was supported, and users could search as if they were asking a question in the search box.
At that time, Internet search engines could not provide search results based on advanced algorithmic ranking as Google does today, and each used its own search methodology.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/ChatGPT/icon' alt='/villagepump/ChatGPT.icon' height="19.5"/>Thank you, the most commonly used search engines in Japan in the early 2000s included the following
- Yahoo! Japan: One of the largest portal sites in Japan, it operates as the Japanese version of Yahoo! It specializes in Japanese-language search and also provides information on Japanese news, weather, and stock market conditions.
- Infoseek: One of the relatively early Japanese search engines, which also supported Japanese-language searches.
- goo: A search engine specializing in Japanese-language searches, goo also provided dictionaries and translation services.
- Excite Japan: The Japanese version of Excite, specializing in Japanese-language searches, was less well-known than Yahoo!
At that time, Google did not yet support Japanese-language searches, so Yahoo! Japan was the most widely used search engine.

I knew it then[[Infoseek]]かなー。Yahooの [[Human-powered tree search engine]] をまず使ってて、それからInfoseekで [[full-text search]] ができるぞすげーとなってたところに [[Google search appears]] て「圧倒的に検索結果がいいじゃないか」ってなったんだよな、たぶん<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
