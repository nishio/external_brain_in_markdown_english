title: "Put into words what you want to do"
---

In situations where you are asked to write down what you [[want to do]].
Often people worry that they don't know what they want to do.

Let's break it down into three parts: "What is it that you want to do," "How do you find what you want to do," and "How do you put it into words?"

What is it that you want to do?
- If you can't think of anything you want to do, you are stuck in a strange psychological state.
    - Often they raise the psychological hurdle by thinking, "I have to say something of social significance.

To find out what you want to do
- Sitting at a desk looking at a proposal format isn't going to give you any good ideas.

How do we put it into words?
