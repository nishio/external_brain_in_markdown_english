> [tamagoyaki19992](https://twitter.com/tamagoyaki19992/status/1756174012919767406) JTC's seemingly useless mechanisms and rules are designed so that even elementary school level personnel can safely run their jobs. They are only a brake for personnel with abilities above junior high school level. When this is at the level of a master's degree from an old imperial university, they can go so fast that it doesn't matter if they are braked. [[It would be even faster without the brakes]].

- [[Letting frustration build up and then releasing it through entrepreneurship]].

> [lvn4pC2bl5CTRjt](https://twitter.com/lvn4pC2bl5CTRjt/status/1756429346296999979) Seemingly useless mechanisms are essential as long as the system can be tracked from other departments and outside, right?
>  It's frightening that there are makers and people who don't understand such things.
