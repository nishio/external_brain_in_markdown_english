- 1: On burnable trash day in the Nishio household, my wife moves the bags in the trash to the top of the trash can, and I take them out at the appropriate time.
- 2:
    - On one occasion, my wife placed additional trash in front of the dumpster.
    - But I didn't notice it and only threw away the trash on top of the dumpster.

[[Discrepancy in recognition of the Nishio family]].
