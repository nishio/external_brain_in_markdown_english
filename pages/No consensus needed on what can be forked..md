No consensus needed on what can be forked.
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1740094998589452303/quick_promote_web/intro) I thought the counter actions against Japanese culture, "[[Done is better than perfect]]", "[Don't ask for permission. The third saying is not fully formed yet, but I think it is a very good one.

Originally it was in the form of [[If you can fork, you don't need politics...]] or something like that, but when I wrote about Japan being very consensus-oriented in [[Words as Public Goods]], this expression was born.

You don't need consensus on what can be forked, because ultimately you can just make it [[subjectivism]].
