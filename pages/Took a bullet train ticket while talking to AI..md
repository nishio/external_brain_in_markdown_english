> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1876861117428810090) Well, I think it's beyond me at this point (see below).
>  "I'd like to go to a programming symposium," a cursory verbal instruction, and they responded by knowing the station I would get off at and how long it would take.
>  In the meantime, I'll follow AI's instructions to reserve reserved seat tickets online and pick them up early.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1876863877217972401) Put the app in as you are told.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1876866157581348991) Now that's a chilling scene.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1876866594451669337) I doubt it.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1876867303867879696) I was wrong to be suspicious.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1876868422648152114) I even got them to decide where to sit.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1876869965774491934) Looks like it's done.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1876871164603007335) I asked ChatGPT what time I should leave the nearest station, assuming I'm buying a station lunch, and he usually answers by looking at the Navitime timetable, so I'll just follow his advice.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1876872482637955255) The nice thing about Advanced Voice is that the interaction with the AI is by voice, so while looking at a station internet app, you can naturally say something like, "This is what it says, what should I do?" You don't have to switch screens or type. There is no need to switch screens or type.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1876872835974434823) Even if 20 years from now I'll be too old to understand "recent devices", AI will politely tell me again and again when I say "I don't understand what this is". I felt like I didn't have to worry. Right now I'm just listening to the voice, but by that time the AI will also look at the screen and operate it for me.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1876873263436943865) But the danger is that if you get suckered into a transfer scam type thing, it's going to be a smooth transfer!
>  I might give up some privacy and turn on the option for the AI to watch my transfer activity and stop it if it looks fraudulent or call the police if necessary.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1879080476801180081) I bought a new headset for my iPhone because it's a pain to connect the headset I usually use on my PC to my iPhone, and it arrived when I went out. I hadn't tried it yet because I was going to try it and then I remembered after I went to the convenience store, I'd rather just use it in the house, I'll live my life consulting the AI...

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1879080680573002005) I was very comfortable the last time I had an AI conducting my business trip preparations and ticket arrangements...
