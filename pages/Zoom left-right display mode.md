A good setting when you want to see both the speaker's screen share and the speaker's face image.
- When sharing a presentation-like document, when a face image is superimposed on the document, a part of the document is covered up.
- Hiding the face image eliminates that problem, but it cannot be seen when the presenter uses gestures or a physical whiteboard.
- So, if you set it to "left and right display", the face will be displayed next to the presentation material, and you can see both without any problem.
