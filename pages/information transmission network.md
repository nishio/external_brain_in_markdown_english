title: "information transmission network"
---

I used to think of [[information]] [[transmission (e.g. news, chemical signals, electricity)]] networks implicitly in terms of business-to-business [[information transmission]].
As the company grows, if everyone [[broadcasts]] to everyone, there will be a [[notification flood]], but on the other hand, if everyone [[broadcasts]] to everyone, there will be a [[notification flood]],
If we separate the information transmission network by department, [["octopus tank" solar term (approx. Octopus vulgaris)]] would occur, so the composition would be the same.
