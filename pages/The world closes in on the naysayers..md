    - Variant of [The world of those who kill is not expanding.
    - [People who, when they want to praise something, belittle something else.
- The act of belittling the entirety of "people who have attribute X."
    - Attributes are, for example, nationality, race, gender, occupation, political party support, faith, and so on.
- People who "know someone with attribute X" don't belittle the entire population of people with attribute X.
    - Even if some people with attribute X are bad, not all people with attribute X are bad.
- From here, if it is observed that a person A is belittling "all people with attribute X", then
    - Which leads to the conclusion that "A's world is small and does not include people with attribute X."
- This situation is reinforced
    - People with attribute X do not want to have a relationship with A

    - [[Positive feedback]]
