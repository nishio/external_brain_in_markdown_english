title: "git submodule"

- Same as the one pocket principle, if you put the source code all over the place, it gets confusing, so you want to put it in one place.
- On the other hand, I'd like to make some of it public.
- Is git submodule correct?
- PyTorch or something. I did $ git clone --recursive and a bunch of repositories came down.
