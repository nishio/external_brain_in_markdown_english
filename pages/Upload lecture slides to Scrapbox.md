title: "Upload lecture slides to Scrapbox"
---

- Convert lecture slides to PDF
- Run a program to extract the PNG of each page and the text of each page from your own PDF
    - (I'll publish it later, I've already published it, but it's hard to find the place, so I'll sort it out)
- Upload the image to your web server.
- Run a program that outputs Scrapbox notation
- Paste it into Scrapbox

-----
- The way we do things has changed recently.
- Development environment will change soon
- There seems to be a need in society.
- So I'll put it in language.
