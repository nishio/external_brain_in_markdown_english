title: 'Not "don''t" but "do."'
---

- I was reviewing [[Attacking the unfamiliar without looking at it properly.]] and wondered why the title was "attacking" instead of "don't attack".

if you break it down
- There's a phenomenon called "~ing."
- I think this phenomenon is I think a bad thought pattern.
- So I'm thinking about being careful not to do it.

I guess it is.
So you are not writing to tell others not to do this.
That's unconsciously in the title.

relevance
    - [[Should" is harmful.]]
    - [[The "should" argument]]
    - [[Should→why?]]
    - [[~Thought to be]]
