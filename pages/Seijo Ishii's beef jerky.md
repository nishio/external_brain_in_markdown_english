- [[beef jerky]]
    - [[ITOHAM]] Daily
- Sharp aroma of spices.
    - Unique aroma
- The meat must be good, thick and easily loosened with few strands.
- Unfortunately, I don't really like it.
    - one's tongue tingles
- Is it supposed to be eaten in small quantities as a snack with alcohol instead of on its own?
