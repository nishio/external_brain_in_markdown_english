<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The difference between "I" and "me" is primarily related to the context in which it is used and the degree of self-awareness.
- Myself."
    - It refers to oneself in a broad sense, sometimes meaning "ego" or "self".
    - It is used to view oneself relative to others and to emphasize the internal aspects of the self.
    - E.g., it is easily used for self-reflection or to talk about personal awareness.
- Me."
    - It is a pronoun commonly used as the first person and refers to the self in relation to others.
    - Often used in formal and polite situations, it expresses a subjective position in distinguishing the self from others.
    - Example: Used in everyday conversation and business situations to express personal assertions and opinions.
In other words, "I" is a first-person expression that refers to oneself to others, while "myself" has a strong nuance that is conscious of the inner self and indicates a relative image of oneself.
