- Some people think that making an addition to A and then B makes it better.
- Some people think it's "[[Unconnected additions]]."
    - If the link is connected and you get a C, then it's "better than A."
    - At stage B, it feels rather worse.
        - Because we consider a network of closely linked links to be a good thing.
        - Strictly speaking, maybe it's not getting worse.
            - Because the cost of discarding the additions and returning them to A is cheap.
        - The cost of an additional "A→B" without [[context]] is much cheaper than "B→C" linking
    - If you're going to add something new, why not at least link to it from an existing one?
        - I mean, this [Zeros and ones and hundreds.
        - B is added to A, so it has increased or decreased in value.
            - Increased from 0 to 1.
        - But there are "ways to get more."
            - There is a way to turn 0 into 100.

    - You're not seeing the context.
    - What is a "pulse"?
            - Don't you understand that there is a [[Knowledge Network]]?
