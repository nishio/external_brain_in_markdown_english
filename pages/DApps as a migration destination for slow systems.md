title: "DApps as a migration destination for slow systems"

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1657682493980676097): I had no idea what to use the slow response [[DApps]] for. Finally figured it out. It's more of a transition point for [[Slow system]]. And the representative of that "slow system" is "[[Democracy by Paper and Box]]".
[[Democracy needs to evolve into a real-time system]]
- [[digital democracy]]
- [[democracy]]

next  [[States that do not need territory]]
