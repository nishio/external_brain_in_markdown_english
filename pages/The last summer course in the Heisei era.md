A diverse range of members will participate, and discussions will be visualized in real time using [[graphic recording]] and video streaming. In this free and vigorous forum that includes medalists and incumbent legislators, we aim to explore the possibilities of using technology to transform society, and to build momentum to break through the sense of stagnation toward a new era.
