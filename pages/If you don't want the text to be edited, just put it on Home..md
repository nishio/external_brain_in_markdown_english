title: "If you don't want the text to be edited, just put it on Home."
---

- If you don't want others to edit your writing, put it where others cannot edit it
- Therefore, anything placed in a shared place is considered to have been allowed to be edited by others.
- If you are dissatisfied with the edits after they have been made, you may of course express
- We may revert to the original wording as a result of the discussion.
- But that is done after the fact of the "edit", not before it is forbidden.
