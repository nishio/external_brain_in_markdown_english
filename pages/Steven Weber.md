This article is a discussion of the [[open source software]] development model by Professor Steven Weber of the University of California, Berkeley.

The main points are as follows
1. open source is not just a utopian ideal, but a practical and sustainable way to organize and innovate.
2. the open source community maintains cooperation through self-governance and solves the "why contribute without reward" problem.
3. open source reduces inefficiencies in software development through flexible governance structures and peer review.
4. in the next few years, open source OSs will become mainstream and proprietary OSs may become obsolete.
5. the open source method has the potential to be applied to fields other than IT, such as the pharmaceutical industry, and is expected to accelerate innovation and lower costs.
6. Prof. Weber himself is interested in applying open source models to drug discovery.

In short, it is a thought-provoking look at the potential of the open source model to foster innovation in a variety of fields beyond software.
