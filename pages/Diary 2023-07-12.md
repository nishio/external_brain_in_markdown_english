> [@Dongri_mom](https://twitter.com/Dongri_mom/status/1677290551773892608?s=20): my oldest daughter said "everyone has a smart phone, I want one too" so I left! The one that says everyone even though there are only a few of us! I thought, "How many people are "everyone"? I told her to check how many people in her class had a smartphone, and she immediately made a survey using the school's tablet function, distributed it to the whole class and collected the results, which showed a 60% ownership rate!

> Blue is the number of followers and red is the total delivery time
> Most distributors start their activity by looking at the yellow part, and most of them quit at the green stage because they are not growing as much as the yellow part.
> This is the actual number of even the top rated talent.
