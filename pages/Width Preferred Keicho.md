title: "Width Preferred Keicho"
---

In considering the next version of Regroup, I tried to use [[Keicho]] and it didn't work so well.

Why is that?
- Keicho's current priority is to delve into the keywords contained in the previous statement because "I don't feel like I'm connecting the story if I keep coming up with quoted questions.
- The result is inevitably a "dig deep" style conversation on the topic

Width Preferred Keicho
- Let the first question be level 0.
- The level of the keyword that first appears in the answer to a question at level N is N+1
- Make the system so that the score gets smaller as the level increases.

digression
- If you record not only the level but also "which children for which keywords", you can create a tree of keyword development.
    - In other words, you can [[mind-map]] when you talk in a chat room.
- Even with the current system, which isn't width-first, you can import it into Regroup in a tree-like fashion if you keep track of the parenthetical statements.
    - That seems more beneficial.
