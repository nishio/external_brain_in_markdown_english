title: "Cross-checking of two frequency tables"

relevance
    - Similar in feel to [[half-full enumeration]], but not necessarily a binary search.
    - When there is an equal sign condition instead of an inequality sign, etc.
    - If the whole enumeration is a [[frequency table]] instead of a set of values, the corresponding values can be found in constant order
