<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Techno-feudalism refers to the concentration of power in the digital economy in a limited number of large corporations and tech companies, thereby fixing economic and social hierarchies. The term is likened to the medieval [[feudalism]] and is seen as a modern form in which a few powerful people control the means of production and data of the majority. The concern is that under this situation, ordinary citizens and small businesses will remain dependent on large corporations, making economic independence difficult.
