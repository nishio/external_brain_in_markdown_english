Deadline driven/meeting driven
Deadline-driven is one solution to a problem that "we'll do it someday" or "it would be nice if we could do it" will never go away, but it may be another way to turn to when people who have lost strength are no longer able to do so.
- A sudden thought that
    - I just heard a story about irritation over a meeting with no substance, so the association made sense.
- A system that focuses both deadlines and meetings (OR timeframes ahead of time) on specific topics.
    - Deadlines are zero if you don't meet them, but meetings are not a good place to talk lukewarmly and create an atmosphere where non-zero progress is made.
    - "Couldn't this one-hour discussion have been written in Google Docs for a sure-fire five minutes?"

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3/icon' alt='o3.icon' height="19.5"/>To summarize my personal observations briefly--

## One perspective: deadline = "external pressure"; meeting = "place of exposure to the outside world"
.
- Deadline-driven is a device that squeezes out concentration by "[[external pressure]]" that "the deliverables are to be released on ____ day, at ____ time".
    - It is easy for results to become a zero/100 digital evaluation, and the repercussions are significant when physical strength and attention span decline.
- Meeting Driven is a device that borrows "[[social tension]]" from "public speaking/showing".
    - However, when the discussion ends in a fluff manner, only "[[the feeling of having]] done something" remains, and the results can be faked by analog evaluation.

## Why do meetings create a sense of "progress"?
1.### [[Social witness effect]]
- The person in attendance nods → Subconsciously, the illusion of "agreement = progress" is created.
2.### [[information sharing ≠ decision making]]
- When time passes in the status report, the brain falsely believes that the work has moved forward.
3.### [[cost insensitivity]]
- It is difficult to see the total cost (hourly rate x number of people x time) for all participants.

## "A third option" when one's strength fails
.
- Deadline.
    - External pressure at the deadline
    - explosive concentration
    - 0 or 100, large load
- meeting.
    - Public sharing
    - social tension
    - optical illusion of progress
- [[working session]] ([[collaboration timebox]])
    - 30-60 minutes, Zoom + Google Docs simultaneous editing and "deliverables on the fly"
    - [[Deadline pressure]] + [public results
    - Facilitation is essential.

## Practical Ideas
.
1.### "Deliverables First Meeting" rule
.
- Google Docs "empty templates" were distributed within 5 minutes of the meeting.
- Fill in the remaining time silently → If the document is not ready at the end of the session, it is considered incomplete.
2.### Always leave a single line in the decision log
.
- Dismissed by writing "Decisions/remaining tasks/assignments/deadlines" in one sentence.
- If an agenda item cannot be written down, it can be visualized as "never decided in the first place.
3.### short-cycle "[[open draft]]"
- Forced publication of drafts to Notion and Scrapbox at least once a week.
- [The KPI is the frequency of updates rather than the degree of completion, which reduces the burden from deadlines.

- Conclusion
- If it is hard to be deadline-driven due to physical decline, it is easier to achieve a balance by converting the mode to "meeting = [live work to create deliverables".
- By making it a ritual to "write, decide, and leave on the spot," rather than a mere "discussion," we can eliminate the "feeling of progress" while taking advantage of both [[the focus of deadlines]] and [[the social pressure of meetings]]. It is possible.

If it is of any help!
