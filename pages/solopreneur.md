<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>[[Solopreneur]] and [[Micropreneur]] are both terms for forms of entrepreneurship, but with slightly different meanings.
- A solopreneur is an entrepreneur who runs a business alone without hiring others. They manage all aspects of the business themselves (marketing, product development, customer relations, etc.) and usually work as freelancers, consultants, or online businesses. The goal is to work independently, controlling their own time and effort, rather than to scale.
- Micropreneurs are entrepreneurs who run small businesses but place less emphasis on growth and expansion and more on quality of life and flexibility. They prioritize their time and freedom to run their businesses on the scale they need, while utilizing a small staff and outsourcing.

The difference is that solopreneurs are basically one-person operations, while micropreneurs may comprise a small team.
