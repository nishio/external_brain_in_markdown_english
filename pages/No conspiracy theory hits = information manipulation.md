- [[conspiracy theory]] does not hit = [[information handling]].
> As a result of Dr. Google shutting out conspiracy theory types from his search results, the search engine DuckDuckGo has become a haven for conspiracy theorists.
- Interesting.

That's because they are actually manipulating information. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1372233076235898880)
