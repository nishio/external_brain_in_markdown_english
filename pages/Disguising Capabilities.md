> The students who have not been able to understand or who have been stuck in the past have not been able to produce the calculation results themselves or have been stuck at a very early stage, so the teachers have been able to grasp their level of understanding and support them according to that level of understanding.
> However, after the generation AI, it is very difficult for teachers to support the students because they can "pretend not to be stuck even though they do not understand".

When AI starts to overcome the "easy low steps" that educational institutions have provided, it becomes difficult to know if he has the ability or not.
- Discussion of whether the person needs to be empowered.
    - "Why should a flesh-and-blood human being be able to do it when an AI can do it?"
- Finally, you have to do the hardest step of all: "Create a [[new business]] and get [[market valuation]].
    - The evaluation standard that says it doesn't matter if you use AI, your connections, or your parents' money, you must produce results, and you will be evaluated only according to the results you produce.
    - Harsh for most people.

- [[Paid education is a tutorial paid for and prepared by the parents.]]
