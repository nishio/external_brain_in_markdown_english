- English translation [[Quartz]] line, pending
    - Quartz is infinitely customizable, so I'm tempted to customize it, and my focus is blurred.

- [/nishio-gpt](https://scrapbox.io/nishio-gpt)Got it.
    - Run alongside [/nishio-en](https://scrapbox.io/nishio-en) and swap if you think this one is better.


- 13379/17510 pages are Japanese titles

- Investigation of Scrapbox link information
    - Link information is not included in the exported JSON
        - Metadata not included when set to true
    - If [[api/pages/:projectname/:pagetitle]], you can get it.
        - Both red and blue links are included in the LINKS
        - Links to non-persistent pages are not included in relatedPages/links1hop
            - This includes backlinks
        - Not persistent, but the blue link is included in relatedPages/links2hop because the 2hop link is connected.
            - Only linksLc is available.
        - links is not lowercased.
        - I can finally identify blue and red links.

        - About External links
            - projectLinks does not include backlinks
            - relatedPages/projectLinks1hop contains backlinks.
                - Not included?
                - Ah, I get it, the API returns different information depending on the browser's logged-in user information.
                - So it's included when you hit the API in the browser and observe it, and it's not included when you hit the API without loading the credentials from the script.
                - Ugh, what a pain in the ass!
                - Pending!

- What we were trying to do is to ensure that the link title is always translated consistently to guarantee that the link is not broken by translation
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/blu3mo/icon' alt='blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>I was implementing that approach, but then I thought, "Hey, if the page is connected by a two-hop link, wouldn't it be possible to just translate the page title, since the page doesn't exist?" I thought.
        - That's right.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/blu3mo/icon' alt='blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - So, I'm pretty sure I got the blue links + red links on all pages and translated them.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/blu3mo/icon' alt='blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - I see, I thought that including the red link would increase the volume considerably, but you did it.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

Ranking of the number of other pages containing the title string
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/fd1823453994ad29b51bde00e9e96cb1/thumb/1000)
- The top of the list is the book table of contents, so that's no surprise.
- Many studies and events are documented.
    - Maybe it's simply because of the sheer volume.
- The ðŸŒ€ and ðŸ¤– are not so important because they are increasing mechanically.
    - I guess I'll leave it out of the translation.
- When you get rid of the mechanical pages, it's usually a lengthy article about a study group or event.

    - These are not frequently updated.
    - The fact that it contains the titles of various pages means that you can jump to various pages from here.
    - You could try to see if you can translate it with the normal system, and if it's too big to translate, you could split it up manually and translate it.
- Title translation costs
