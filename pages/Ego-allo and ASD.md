- Ego-centeredness (ego) and environment-centeredness (allo) of space appear directly in "conversational viewpoints" as well.
    - Typically Developing (TD) people can flexibly switch from ego to allo depending on the situation.
    - Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) Many report that ASD participants have higher switching costs and are more likely to remain in the egocentric camp.

Egocentric dominance is one of the characteristics of ASD, which is manifested in both spatial and social aspects, and the cost of switching creates a communication gap.

The TD side visualizes the environment-dependent references (allo), and the ASD side verbalizes its own point of view - the two-way device reduces "point of view conflicts" and promotes barrier-free dialogue.



Conversion to allocentric coordinates in spatial tasks is time consuming/increases errors

It has been reported that training participants to switch back and forth from "bird's-eye view" to "subjective view" in VR or board games improved the speed at which ASD participants switched perspectives.

Add tags such as "üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë opponent's point of view" and "üë§ my point of view" in chats and documents.
Verbal confirmation at the beginning of the meeting as to which viewpoint is being discussed now => Reduce cognitive load.
