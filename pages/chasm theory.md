To be precise, [[innovator theory]], but [[chasm]] is probably better known around the world.

- innovator theory
    - [[Everett M. Rogers]] proposed
    - 1962
    - Classification of attitudes toward product purchase into five categories in order of earliest to latest purchase timing
            - [[innovator]]
            - [[early adopter]]
            - [[early majority]]
            - [[late majority]]
            - [[laggard]]
- By the way, people who use the "for some reason the classification was determined and the percentage of those people was checked and it was a percentage" way of explaining things like "there are 16% laggards" are the ones who don't understand it properly.
    - Correct, "defined the bottom 16% as laggards."
    - Some people assume that 16%, a "number that doesn't look close enough" has some deeper meaning, but it is simply a normal distribution cut off by an integer multiple of the standard deviation that is close enough.

        - p. 247
        - The normal distribution was sliced into five parts at integer multiples of the standard deviation and named

- Later in the book "[[chasm]]" it is claimed that "the chasm between early adopters and early majority is deep

    - [[What slows down the laggard?]]
