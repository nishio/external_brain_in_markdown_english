title: "Yasuno's engineering experience"

As a matter of fact
- Released [[Nemingu!]], an image analysis web service, in 2008 as a three-person team while still in high school.
- Around 2011 (3rd~4th year university student): Created a web service [[APISNOTE]] for shared editing of sticky notes in a team of four, conducted user tests, and presented a poster at a conference.
- 2015: One-person team applied to the Unexplored with a user-assisted UI system [[LIGHTNING UI]], was accepted, and was recognized as an outstanding achievement.
- 2016 Appointed as Representative Director of BEDORE Corporation, a subsidiary established as a result of the split-off of PKSHA Technology's business in the area of automated dialogue
- Co-founded MNTSQ Corporation, a legal tech company, in 2018
That's what it looks like.

Personally, I don't see how someone doing unexplored work alone could not have engineering experience, but if by "engineering experience" you mean "following the development scheme conventionally used in private companies," then I don't think so.
Well, even if I didn't have any experience on the side of doing the actual work, I would have been in a position of responsibility as a team leader at PKSHA, BEDORE and MNTSQ.
