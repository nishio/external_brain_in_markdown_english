- [[Technology Supporting Coding English Checking]] I'll do it on the weekend.
- Saturday I just did 1 pomodoro to look at what's available without working on it, then 4 pomodoro and then 4 pomodoro, plus a lazy one to finish the second half of 6 chapters. I'll do the other half tomorrow (actually less than half the amount, and the content will be easier, so it should be less burdensome).

If you looks something interesting but the auto-translated English is not good enough to understand it, feel free to let me know at [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en). I'm very happy to spread my thought to non-Japanese readers.
