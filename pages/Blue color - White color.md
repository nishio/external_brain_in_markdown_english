<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT-4/icon' alt='GPT-4.icon' height="19.5"/> The terms [[blue-collar worker]] and [[white-collar]] are used to distinguish between types of work and skill sets.
- These classifications have their roots in the early 20th century and are based primarily on the type of work performed and the skill set required.
    - Blue-collar jobs are those that primarily involve [[manual or physical labor]], while white-collar jobs are those that primarily involve [[intellectual labor]].
- However, the modern workforce has diverse roles that do not fall clearly into these categories, blurring the boundaries between the two.
    - Many modern jobs require a combination of skills, training, and education that do not fit into either category.
    - In addition, the rise of technology and automation has led to the emergence of new occupations, such as the [[gig economy]], that do not fit into the traditional blue- and white-collar categories.
