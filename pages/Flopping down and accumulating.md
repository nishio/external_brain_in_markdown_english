I have a mental model of "flop down and [[accumulate]]" for one phase of [[intellectual production]].
- This phase cannot be rushed.
- If the quantity is increased in a hurry, the quality is reduced

- Even if the rate of flopping down is constant, there is a difference in the "amount of accumulation" when compared after a long period of time between those who "throw away without accumulation" and those who "accumulate properly".
    - [[Keep a large network and cut out as needed]]
    - This "keep" is equivalent to "accumulate."
