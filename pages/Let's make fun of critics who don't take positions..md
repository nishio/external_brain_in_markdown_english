> [dennotai](https://twitter.com/dennotai/status/1754265180568179086/photo/1) Adult manners are "[[position talk]]".
>
>  Don't talk about positions! you say, but from my point of view, a businessperson who is an adult with no position to claim and no enemies to criticize is serious about his/her work? I would ask.
>
>  If you really believe in that position, then you must naturally be in that position. In other words, the talk of people who are serious about their work is always position talk. If you criticize position talk, you are also making fun of the position talk of people who are serious, and that means denying the great change, the revolution in the world.
>
>  It is always the position talk of those who have taken a position that has changed the world. It is the same with Mr. Sun and Mr. Jobs. They bet on the Internet. They bet on the smartphone. And they took a position, and they talked about their position with a lot of energy. What is happening now?
>
>  Of course, positjon talk has its weaknesses. Of course, positjon talk has a weakness: people around you may think, "Oh, he's just talking about himself. So, if you meta-recognize your own position talk on a regular basis, and occasionally mutter shyly to yourself, "Well, it's position talk," people around you will think, "Oh, you are aware of it, but you still insist on it," so please give it a try.
>
>  In any case, businesspersons, let's take a firm position and develop position talk! That is the proper way to be a businessperson!

- >  "[[Sharing of concentrated knowledge]] based on [[the unique experience]] of [[the person who took the position]]."
- >  Therefore, it cannot be worthless.
- >
- >  Position talk is disliked because it tends to be [[self-serving]].
- >
- >  I think that if the suggestions are used to empower someone, the sharing of concentrated knowledge will spread more widely in society.


> [kensuu](https://twitter.com/kensuu/status/1754325110851506568) This is so true. I think the criticism that "it's position talk" is generally off the mark, and that it would be more correct to say "don't [[credit]] people who are talking without [[position]] as much as those who are talking."
>
>  Especially now, in the age of the great social networking sites, it is very easy to say "don't take a position, just say what's on the spot and earn likes" and it is easier to gather followers, etc., so many people behave in that way.
>
>  Rather, "Which position are you taking?" I think that we should be careful about people who look like they are "speaking honestly" or "speaking objectively" without knowing "what position they are taking".

> [kensuu](https://twitter.com/kensuu/status/1754325351470346293) By the way, this is different from something like "are you consistent in your statements or not". With positions, some people can be completely opposite in their statements depending on the situation!
>
>  If you have a habit of saying, "I look at [[consistency of statements]] to determine if a person is trustworthy or not," I think you should be careful with this.
>
>  It is basically difficult to keep one's statements consistent when the situation is changing so drastically.
