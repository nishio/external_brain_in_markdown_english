It seems that the winds of the engineering bubble are changing a bit, and people who used to say "talking about work skills other than engineering is different because it deviates from the specialty" are getting sicker, and they can't maintain their value unless they strengthen their claims.

There are a certain number of people who have become "I'm a strong engineer", and they are just planning to survive by changing the direction of their claim without changing their own consciousness.

There is an old saying that [[specialists]] are more vulnerable to environmental changes than [[generalists]], and that is why they need to become [[type T (human resources)]] or [[Π-type human resources]], etc. People who are confined to their current [[expertise]] may become [[radicalized]] to [[justification]] their judgment when they suffer from [[Environmental Changes]]. When people who are confined to their current [[expertise]] suffer from [[Environmental Changes]], they become more [[radical]] in order to [[justification]] their own judgment.

To begin with, "[[specialist]] → [[type T (human resources)]] → [[pi-type human resources]]" is a continuous process
