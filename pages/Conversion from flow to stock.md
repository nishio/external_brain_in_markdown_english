title: "Conversion from flow to stock"
---

- Try to organize [Flow to stock conversion (raw)

    - The concepts of [[flow]] and [[stock]] are vague.
        - [[stream]], [[accumulate]], and words that remind me of
    - But even in Slack, where chats flow, logs are accumulated and subject to search.
    - Pages that are not written and maintained and no longer referenced in wikis, which are supposed to be places to store information.
        - It's no different than drifting away.
    - Therefore, I don't think the "[[Flow ←→ Accumulate]]" cutoff is very appropriate.

- I'm interested in detailed output and assembling it later as a means of increasing personal intellectual productivity.
    - This "small stuff" and "later assembled stuff" is a composition similar to flow and stock
    - Smaller ones, imagine one line of chat posts, one tweet, etc.
        - Writing multi-paragraph sentences on groupware is not part of the "little ones" for me.
    - When multiple people are interacting in real time in a chat room, it tends to be a list of small things.
    - I understand there is a need to assemble it as a document to be referenced later.
    - As for my "small stuff", the only requirement is that the size of the output is small.
        - Whether you're interacting with others or not is another matter.
    - For example, if you keep a one-line diary, it is a "small one"

- If you are trying to communicate with others to make something "small," it is tricky when they speak in long sentences
    - Troublesome, at least for tools that flow one-dimensionally.
    - It is tempting to refer to more than one part of a single statement by the other party.
        - but because of the scarcity of means to point to a specific position in the sentence.
        - Permalinks may be per post or per line.

- Different individuals often use the same word with different meanings
    - The implicit assumption that word X would mean Y is often rejected
    - Creating a large text with insufficient sharing is like building a tower with bricks that have not been solidified.

- What does that "stock" look like? The question must be asked
    - My "stock" is a combination of small outputs that have been combined and enlarged after the fact.
- What is its "combination"?
    - Not everything is good.
        - For example, just putting them in chronological order would be a "combined big one".
        - But I am looking for a better "way to combine".
        - Chronological summary is a "better than nothing" summary

- How they should be combined is influenced by what they are combined for.
    - think in concrete terms
        - Let's say you ask some technical question, we communicate, and the problem is solved.
            - To sum this up.
                - You can find people who have encountered similar problems.
                - The person's problem is solved without having to discuss it again.
            - This is [[Summary Purpose]].
        - If you're looking for explanatory documentation for a library, you can use
            - First, we provide a "tutorial that allows first-time readers to learn what they need to know.
            - Then, explanations for various frequent needs
            - Then follows an API reference organized hierarchically so that if you want to know more, you can find it
- Creating red links in Scrapbox is a preparation in the hope that they will be connected to other things in the future and create value.
        - [[Preparing to create value]], or
    - Preparations to create value for customers and users can only be made after customers and users are clearly identified.
    - So the first would be "[[Prepare yourself for future reuse]]"
    - Take the time to think about it because it's a topic you value.
        - The output of the thought process is important to deepen the thinking on the subject.
        - [[Looking back over time]] When you get into an argument with your past self.
        - Sometimes your future self disagrees with an opinion you thought you had at a certain time.
        - If you don't record it, you won't know when your opinion has changed.
        - Record and [[Notice the difference]] to become a [Comprehensive Opportunities
            - [[Multiple perspectives]] to think from.

- My frustration with the current public Scrapbox is that I can't write anything that can't be published there.
    - Everything should go into the same place and connect with each other.
    - Book excerpts, discussions on private groupware, etc.
    - Everything should be connected.

- What is "connected"?
    - that [[Can be related ex post facto.]] that are written out at different times or from different sources.
        - [[Human memory is poor.]] So not all objects can be kept as association targets.
        - So, we leave retention to electronic systems (and paper).
    - You never know in advance what to combine with what.
        - So you discover the combination after the fact and gradually grow it into a larger system!

- Why is it good to [be brought up with tenderest care in a good family
    - I don't have to do [[Discovering Connections]] again, because I can do something more efficient by following the connections I discovered in the past.
        - What efficiency?
            - Exploration?
                - [[Discovering New Connections]] ？

    - [[Ideas are new connections of existing ones]]
        - [[Distant connections are more likely to produce beneficial results.]]
    - In other words, [[Increase the probability that useful ideas will be generated]].
    - Become the mother womb of ideas

- How do we go from having some large text on the groupware to the preferred state?
    - Once [[chew up small pieces of]] something big, you need a mechanism
        - Whether it's done by a human or a machine is beside the point.
    - What exactly does it mean to bite off more than you can chew?
        - It doesn't look like you can just carve it into sentence units.
            - [[semantic bundle]] need to be nipped out
            - [[Long-lived lumps]] and [A mass that will die soon
            - We need to create small chunks of long-lived
        - The whole "fair and square" thing is established as a long-lived little blob.
        - This too can only be known after the fact.
        - After cutting out, [[Test of Time]] will tell you
        - As a result, only the long-lived ones remain.
        - So we should [Review again in due time
            - What was left of value in that review will be the subject of another timed review.
            - A cycle like this is needed.
