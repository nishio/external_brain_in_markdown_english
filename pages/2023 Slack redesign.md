[Slack's "personal mute" function is a hot topic. "Workplaces that need this are in trouble," "It's a measure against harassment," and other pros and cons - ITmedia NEWS [https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/](https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/) 2309/08/news131.html]

> [akiroom](https://twitter.com/akiroom/status/1702168295795777576/photo/1) Slack's new UI, when I try to view a list of received mentions, all the text is omitted with "..." and I can't read them. I'm very interested in the development system that this will appear in the production environment.

- > [akiroom](https://twitter.com/akiroom/status/1702168463220113678) I would never do this if I were using it myself, but why did I choose this UI?
- > [akiroom](https://twitter.com/akiroom/status/1702168745698037947) Because we are developing while dogfooding on the contrary, as a result of screen sharing Slack, private channels and DM mentions are shown I wonder if they started to hide them...?
- > [akiroom](https://twitter.com/akiroom/status/1702168295795777576/photo/1) "The development system is very interesting" is a euphemism, and I'm actually holding my head boiling and giggling at the fact that I'm calling out the F-word.


> [9d](https://twitter.com/9d/status/1702207259970064494/photo/1) Slack, since the interface changed, I can't see the icons of other workspaces in this state, and I don't know if they have mentions, so it's hard to handle. I can't see the icons of other workspaces in this state. I wonder if it's possible to change it back to the previous state in the settings.

> [ssig33](https://twitter.com/ssig33/status/1698608372625678416) The biggest change in the new Slack UI is the elevation of DMs to first class citizens, which means that the primary use of Slack by employees in Slack adopting companies is for confidential conversations between individuals. I guess the main use of Slack is to have confidential conversations between individuals via DMs. That may be the case in reality, but I think they made a decision to move collaboration backwards.
- > [ssig33](https://twitter.com/ssig33/status/1698608374169182667) Slack is realistically used as a DM platform, so let's make DM easier to use! is a defeatist acceptance of the product concept and will not have a very positive impact on either the product or the customers who adopt it? I think this is a good idea.
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1698713218196361252) I was wondering how to move from 3 to 4 and Slack is moving from 3 to 2...

> [sora_h](https://twitter.com/sora_h/status/1701831750345957676) Slack, I thought they knew the importance of public channel usage to the extent of displaying it in their stats, but now they've started endorsing DMs, which really sucks. I'm wondering if it's a result of being steeped in Salesforce.
