These principles form the backbone of Kawakita's approach to understanding complex issues, particularly within the context of his fieldwork and the development of the [[KJ Method]]. Here's a brief overview of each principle:

- [[From 360-Degree Perspective]]: This principle emphasizes examining a theme or problem from all possible angles. It advocates for a comprehensive approach that considers every aspect and viewpoint to gain a deep and nuanced understanding.

- [[Stepping Stones]]: This metaphor suggests progressing through a topic or problem incrementally, similar to hopping from one stone to another across a stream. It encourages researchers to take manageable steps, [[connecting dots]] from one insight to the next, which allows for flexibility and adaptability in their exploration.

- [[Embrace Happenings]]: This principle highlights the importance of being open to unexpected events or findings (happenings) that occur during the research process. Instead of disregarding these as distractions, it suggests that they can offer valuable insights and lead to innovative solutions.

- [[Concern for What Stands Out]]: Paying attention to details or elements that seem peculiar, intriguing, or particularly significant is crucial. This principle advises researchers to notice and delve into anything that catches their interest, as these aspects can often reveal important paths to understanding or innovation.

- [[Qualitative Focus]]: Kawakita stresses the value of qualitative data collection, suggesting that rich, descriptive information is key to forming a deep understanding of the subject at hand. This approach contrasts with strictly quantitative methods, advocating for a more nuanced and context-rich exploration.

Together, these five principles guide researchers to approach their subjects with an open mind, thoroughness, and sensitivity to the complexity and richness of the real world. They encourage a holistic, flexible, and attentive methodology that can lead to more meaningful and impactful discoveries and solutions.
