Remembering the dimensions we are discarding

If there is a wide variety of scales, they may actually be a projection of one higher-dimensional scale onto a lower dimension.
Indicators such as GC-contents and GC-skew in the base composition of a genome are the length of a four-dimensional measure of the rate of occurrence of the four base types in the genome, projected against an arbitrary straight line that is easy for humans to explain.

Where diverse measures exist, they may be a projection of a higher-dimensional measure onto a lower dimension. For example, an index of base composition of a genome is a four-dimensional measure of the rate of occurrence of the four base species, which is then projected into a form that is easily understood by humans.
The fragment "Quaternions" introduces the concept of quaternions (quaternions) to represent rotations in higher dimensional spaces and is related to the content of the note. While the note describes the projection of high-dimensional information onto a lower dimension, "quaternion" illustrates the opposite process, i.e., the extension of low-dimensional information into a higher dimension.
Notes and fragment "quaternions" are complementary to each other in terms of the dimensional transformation of information. This provides different perspectives from which to understand and interpret information. Projecting high-dimensional information to a lower dimension transforms the information into a form that is easier for humans to understand, while extending low-dimensional information to a higher dimension makes it possible to represent more complex phenomena.

### Summary of notes
.
Where diverse measures exist, they may be a projection of a higher-dimensional measure onto a lower dimension. For example, an index of base composition of a genome is a four-dimensional measure of the rate of occurrence of the four base species, which is then projected into a form that is easily understood by humans.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The fragment "Quaternions" introduces the concept of quaternions (quaternions) to represent rotations in higher dimensional spaces and is related to the content of the note. While the note describes the projection of high-dimensional information onto a lower dimension, "quaternion" illustrates the opposite process, i.e., the extension of low-dimensional information into a higher dimension.

### deep thinking
Notes and fragment "quaternions" are complementary to each other in terms of the dimensional transformation of information. This provides different perspectives from which to understand and interpret information. Projecting high-dimensional information to a lower dimension transforms the information into a form that is easier for humans to understand, while extending low-dimensional information to a higher dimension makes it possible to represent more complex phenomena.
