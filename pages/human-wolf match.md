It's too funny that the inadvertent incentive design leads to the disturbing conclusion "hang the woman first".

#WerewolfMatch
I've only done three villages, but I found a winning strategy. Let me conclude first.

[[Hang the woman]]

Reason below.
First of all, the standard is 6 people: 2 wolves, 2 diviners (no wolves on the first day), 2 hunters, and 2 villagers, which means 1/3 chance of pulling out a wolf. The male/female ratio is basically male 4 female 2 or male 5 female 1.

In other words, the probability is that the wolves are often paired with male wolves (40% for 4 males and 2 females, 67% for 5 males and 1 female), but after 3 villages, all wolves were paired with a male-female pair. In addition, a woman who was in the same village testified
I did six villages, five of them were wolves.
One village where I was a villager, the other woman was a wolf."

Inferences that can be drawn from the above data include
[Matching is arranged so that wolves are always paired with men and women.
More likely. In other words, if there is only one woman, he is a definite wolf. If there are two women, one of them is definitely a wolf. If there are 4 males and 2 females in a village, and the divination is 2-co, the female diviner's viewpoint is confirmed to be the wolf and the gray female. On the other hand, from the male's point of view, the gray female will be the confirmed white wolf.

Since wolves can communicate with each other at night, it is likely that the management has chosen this type of matching system with the intention of having the wolves deepen their friendship. However, due to the nature of the application, the assumption that the male/female ratio of players is male > female will not change in the future. Therefore, as long as this system continues
The best way to play the game is for the men to get together on the first day, vote for the women, and expel them.
As a result, it seems only a matter of time before the ratio of female users declines even further and depopulation accelerates at a rapid pace.
