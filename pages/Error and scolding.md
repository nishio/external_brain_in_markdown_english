- [[error]] and [[scolded]].

> [joker1007](https://twitter.com/joker1007/status/1780296976195821576) I'm not being sarcastic or anything, I seriously don't understand what's so hard. What do you mean by "endure" ......?

> [luccafort](https://twitter.com/luccafort/status/1780389249734590548) I seriously felt the same way about this and didn't know what was so hard about the error.
>  If you're talking about enduring, what's more enduring than dealing with humans? I'm feeling like you are.
> [luccafort](https://twitter.com/luccafort/status/1780389638991155275) human "I don't know what it is, but I don't like it."
>  Machine "Error. The process was interrupted by a fugafugue while doing a hoge hoge."

>  ...... too much of a human commie?

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1780775349779071002/quick_promote_web/intro) Well, I've been talking to computers and exposed to error messages since before I could speak English (4th grade). I've been talking to computers since before I could speak English (4th grade), so I guess I'm just "very used to it". It is natural that people who are not used to it would be perplexed.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1780776125796622807) I think I was just aware that "Ill something" and "Syn something" were frequently used.

> [hrjn](https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1780783607344398560) I think the reaction to seeing an error tends to be divided between those who enjoy it as if it were a puzzle and those who are overwhelmed by their own helplessness and become depressed.
- > [hrjn](https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1780783811430842865) However, there are some error areas that are more complicated than in my old days...

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1780786321180729767) Children in their natural state are likely to think, "The world reacts in mysterious ways," and not just to computer errors, but to unexpected reactions, "Why is this happening? I wonder why this is happening". Then they learn that "there are powerful people in the world, and if they don't meet the expectations of the powerful people, they will do unpleasant things", and as a result, they may become afraid of being scolded.
