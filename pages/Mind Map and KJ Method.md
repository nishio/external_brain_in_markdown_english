title: "Mind Map and KJ Method"
---

- In the [[mind-map]] method, which is written from [[central]] to [[top-down]], the connection between the ends is strongly dependent on the [[flair]] ability of the creator, instead of a clear center. On the other hand, in the [[KJ method]], which is a [[bottom-up]] method of drawing up a map from the ends, the connections at the ends are clear, but whether or not the center is clear depends strongly on the [[information sorting]] ability of the creator. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. (2011)
