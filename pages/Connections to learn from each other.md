Yasukazu Nishio (Mentor) - Unexplored Interview
2019-04-22

My name is Nishio and I am the PM of Unexplored Junior.

## Q: Why do you PM?

Being involved with Unexplored Junior is interesting in and of itself. It is also interesting for me personally.

The word "mentor" tends to create a fixed mindset of "the mentor is the one who teaches" and "the creator is the one who is taught," but this is not the case.

Creators are not taught unilaterally, but learn from each other by teaching other creators. I think it is good to create an organic network of mentor-creator-creator connections.

## Q: Have you established an unexplored network?

The human network of (unexplored juniors) has not yet been established, but I wonder how it will be established,
At the "Unexplored Junior" boost meeting, a meeting where we are going to start a project, past junior participants and alumni of past IPA Unexplored participants come to the meeting to communicate and discuss with each other.
Through this process, a relationship of mutual trust is gradually cultivated, with both parties believing that this person is worthy of discussion. In the long term, this network will grow into a network of tremendous value after three or five years.

In fact, that is what has been happening at IPA Unexplored. Thanks to this network, I and Yasukawa-san got acquainted with each other. The reason why we got to know each other was through the "Unexplored Connection. And then we decided to work together on this project called "Unexplored Junior. I think that creating such a network is a very valuable project from a long-term perspective.

## Q: How do you get involved with the "unexplored" after the unexplored junior year?

The Unexplored Association was created as a "[[hub]]" for Unexplored alumni to come together and work on new projects together, a kind of [[flag]] for gathering, a kind of [[campfire (usually large, and for gathering and singing, etc.)]]. I hope that you will come back and get involved in various projects, not only this Unexplored Junior, as the Unexplored Association is involved in many projects, and the network will be further strengthened.
[We hope that you will use the Unexplored Foundation as a nucleus for regrouping.
