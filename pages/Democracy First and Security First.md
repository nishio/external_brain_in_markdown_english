title: "Democracy First and Security First"

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>[[Paul Collier]]'s discussion is about state-building priorities in [[fragile states]] in Africa.

Democracy First" is an approach that prioritizes the establishment of [[democracy]] in nation building. It seeks to ensure political legitimacy through the holding of elections and the establishment of parliaments. However, Mr. Collier pointed out that rushing to democratize without sufficient [[public order]] and [[administrative functions]] in place can lead to chaos.

On the other hand, "[[Security First]]" is an approach that first prioritizes the restoration and maintenance of security. The goal is to strengthen [[security institutions]] such as the police and military, and to establish [[deterrence of violence]] and [[rule of law]]. The idea is to then gradually introduce democratic institutions.

Collier argued that "security first" works better in countries that have experienced civil war or conflict. For example, in [[Sierra Leone]], after the end of the civil war, disarmament and security sector reforms took place first, followed by democratic elections. In [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], on the other hand, elections were held hastily under a comprehensive peace agreement, but the government's ability to govern remained fragile, and violence and political instability have continued since then.

However, "security first" also has its challenges. There is a risk that the security sector will become bloated and lose democratic control. From a long-term perspective, the question is how to strike a balance between security and democracy.

Collier's argument offers one potent perspective, but there is no universal prescription. Each country will need to consider its own state-building strategy according to its own history and social conditions. The international community must be flexible in supporting [[security sector reform]] and [[democratization]] of fragile states, depending on the situation.
