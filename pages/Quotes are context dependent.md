title: "Quotes are context dependent"
---

- Between people who share a lot of information, a certain phrase X is created to point to a concept that cannot be expressed in one word
- The phrase X is used repeatedly because it is useful among them
        - A real-world example of [[Putting handles on concepts]].
- This handle is beneficial in that it facilitates manipulation of the "concept" to which it is connected.
- So the wording of the handle itself is often "obvious" or "seems wrong".
        - [[People have personalities.]]
        - [[In the long run, we're all dead.]]
        - [[The goodness of means is influenced by the current situation and objectives]]
        - [[Problems that are not easy are complex]]
        - [[Properly subjective]]
        - [[People don't think alone.]]

- When given a list of quotes, it is only of superficial value to be impressed only by the words of the quotes.
