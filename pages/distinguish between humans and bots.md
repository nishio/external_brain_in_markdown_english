distinguish between humans and bots
A: So a lot of people are worried about not being able to differentiate or distinguish between humans and bots. Do you think that is a reasonable concern?
B: Yes, it is a reasonable concern. There is some kind of test to distinguish human-made pictures. I tried it and it is difficult. After I learned the points to check, I can distinguish, at least for now. For example, there is a different number of fingers. Sometimes they made six fingers or the drawing of pupils is different in each eye.
A: I see.
B: But usually most customers don't focus on those small parts. So it may replace humansâ€™ jobs. Currently, if the customer wants to control the picture in detail, AI can't do that, so we need to ask a human. But I'm not sure how long the situation that AI won't be able to continue.
