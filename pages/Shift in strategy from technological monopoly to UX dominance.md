- The business environment has shifted from technology dominance to user experience (UX) dominance, and market dominance requires products with superior UX.
- New business strategies have shifted from "product out" to "market in" based on market needs, and companies need to adapt to this paradigm shift.
- If the old strategy remains in place, internal consensus-building costs will rise, making it more difficult to develop and offer products that meet market needs.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1761622581898289252) The market has shifted from product-out to market-in, but the cost of consensus-building is rising for organizations that are working in a product-out style. The market has shifted from product-out to market-in.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1761625959055360392) Why has the cost of consensus building in "organizations that sit down to do product out" gone up? Is it because they no longer have an easy-to-understand product axis and don't know the answer, but are trying to find the answer through discussion?

This Twitter exchange discusses how the way we fight for business and new business has changed compared to the past and how this affects the cost of consensus building within organizations. The key points mentioned here are explained step-by-step.

- 1: Shift from technological monopoly to UX dominance: Traditionally, technological monopoly was the key to market dominance. However, we are now in an era where user experience (UX) dominance is directly linked to market dominance. This means that ease of use and customer satisfaction with a product or service have become more important than mere technological superiority.

- 2: Lack of understanding of the paradigm shift: Trying to operate under the old paradigm, i.e., the strategy of aiming for technological monopoly, without understanding this shift will increase the cost of consensus building. This is due to the increasing need to understand market and customer needs and develop products and services based on those needs.

- 3: Changes in the way new businesses are fought: The approach to launching a new business has changed from the past. Instead of "product-out," where the product to be marketed is determined internally and then pushed to market, a "market-in" approach is now required, where the needs of the market are understood first and products are developed to meet those needs.

- 4: Higher consensus-building costs: Organizations that operate with a product-out strategy find it difficult to build internal consensus when developing products that meet market needs. This is because in order to accurately identify market needs and develop products based on those needs, it is necessary to incorporate diverse opinions and build consensus among multiple departments. Especially when there is no clear product axis, the process of finding an answer as to what is the best product further increases the cost of consensus building.

In short, the exchange provides insight into the importance of adapting to paradigm shifts in the business world and how the difficulty of building internal consensus affects the success of new businesses. The importance of taking a "market-in" approach, understanding market needs first and developing products and services based on those needs, is emphasized.
