(Hei)
I met Mr. Anno the other day. I read in the newspaper that he has developed a system called "Broad Listening," which aggregates opinions from social networking services to visualize public opinion and reflect it in policy making. He said that the National Democratic Party of Japan, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, and the Restoration Association are going to use it right away.

After I became Minister of Digital Affairs, I asked Yasuno-san to join the team to create the strategy. [The team includes [[Manabu Miyasaka]], the vice governor of Tokyo, Kumagai, the governor of Chiba Prefecture, Takashima, the mayor of Fukuoka City, and Atsushi Hayashi, who is involved in regional development, and Yasuno-san is also a member. He is now helping me in various ways as the brain of the project.

So, Yasuno-san told me that he had created a "broad listening" system and wanted to explain it to me, but my time didn't work out, so today was the day. When I actually listened to him, he was so interesting that I asked him if he wanted to come on my YouTube page afterwards. But he said he couldn't because it was too sudden and that he would come back another time.

Mr. Anno has been an "interesting guy" since I was in the governor's race. Now the National Democratic Party, the Restoration Association, and others are using him, but I was paying attention to him first.

(Hei)
It's an interesting initiative that is still in its infancy, but it's well presented and visualizes keywords of interest in a colorful "brainy" way. They seem to be trying to do something about the current situation of division in SNS.

I asked him, "If we pick up the opinions of the divided social network and reflect them in policy, won't the so-called silent majority in the middle be left behind?" He said, "That's certainly an issue. It's up to the algorithm, but they are trying to make it less biased than what you see on the timeline. It was quite an in-depth talk.

So I invited him to come on our channel sometime.

The approach would be different for the LDP to use than for the KDP or Rikken, and there are many possible ways to use such a system.

Also, Dr. Matsuo was mentioned, but Yasuno-san seems to be busy too, and apparently everyone's schedules are not going to work next week. Well, anyway, from today's discussion, I have a general idea of what we're working on.
