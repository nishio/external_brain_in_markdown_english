> [@doshin_okhotsk](https://twitter.com/doshin_okhotsk/status/1678932302922137600): [[From the Hokkaido Shimbun Okhotsk edition]].
> Prof. Mikine Yamazaki of Hokkaido University's School of Public Policy gave a lecture on "Where We Are Now with [[Local Government]].
> Professor Yamazaki pointed out that there is a polarization between [[municipality]] that opts for [[maintenance of the status quo]] and [[reform]]-oriented municipalities.
