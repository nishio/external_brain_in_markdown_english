A
- Thoughts.
    - having not the slightest idea
    - N=100 in a directed graph
    - Question for expected value. Expected value DP?
    - When everything is in pieces, you can have 2^100 different states.
    - Find and sum for each independent component?
- Official Explanation

    - The "number of operations" is the number of times this table is added horizontally
            - [[The number of times is the sum]]
    - add vertically instead of horizontally
            - [[Sum of f(x,y) per x is sum of f(x,y) per y]]
            - [[Change the order of addition]]
            - [[The expected value of the sum is the sum of the expected values]]

C
- Thoughts.
    - I want 0 or less for ball 1, 1 or less for ball 2, and k or less for k-1.
    - Shave off the overhang?
        - That would be too easy.
    - Cutting off the overhang is not the shortest way.
        - "If Robot v. exists."
        - You can disable the whole thing if you destroy it beforehand.
        - Just rewrite one ball to one larger value.
            - Call that ball and it's all null and void.
            - This is a sufficient condition and we can cut more.
    - No need to count up if the robot is already destined to be destroyed by another robot.
        - Need a lightweight determination of whether the section is covered.
            - Sort by (tip, +1) and (tail, -1) in a list
            - Covered if cumulative summed to linear order and nonzero.
            - Related [[Imosu Act (fifth highest of eight hereditary titles, later demoted to sixth highest of eight)]]
        - →37WA
- Official Explanation
    - I'm not sure.

    - > C:A robot with A ≤ B can either a) reduce B so that it cannot reach 0 or b) move the right robot to destroy it.
    - >  a is used in at most one location. b costs 1 per ball. balls used in a are reused in b
