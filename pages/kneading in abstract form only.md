In the first place, it is interesting to note that there are situations in which the word "[[abstract kneading]]" is viewed positively and situations in which it is viewed negatively.

Example of a Mr. C-like mental model
    - [[Climbing down metaphor]]
    - [[U-curve model]] turned upside down
    - Central part of [W-type problem-solving model
    - [[The fastest course is not the fastest." birth process]]
    - I'm not talking about thinking abstractly and being good at verbalizing it, I'm talking about standing on the concrete and abstracting it.
            - [[It has to be bottom up to be applied.]]


In an environment with many Mr. A-like people and few Mr. B's, does Mr. B consider his abstract thinking to be superior?
- There is a segment of the population that is tired of Mr. B-like people.
    - ( [[People who want to do it but haven't.]] )→ [[People who have never wanted to make it and have never made it.]]
        - [[Type-specific advice for contest applicants]]
        - I'm putting Mr. B-like behavior first as type 1.
    - [[Meeting with Scott Wu]]
        - Scott Wu is amazing for taking the initiative to come to client meetings," says Anno himself, "and he's amazing for taking the initiative to make speeches in the streets."
        - From the culture of those who understand that the "junction point with concrete reality" is the "springboard" for the harvest, Mr. B's behavior seems to me like "you don't get it.

- > A model is a set of hypotheses, and the certainty of the hypotheses gradually increases as the hypotheses are used and acted upon, and the results are as expected / [[Knowledge must be verified by action]] --- from [[Diagram of the updated model of how engineers learn ]]
    - Since "[[abstract]]" (= [[model]]) is a [[hypothesis]], it must be [[Validated by Action]].
    - Mr. C is running a cycle of abstraction and verification by action of it.
    - So from that perspective, Mr. B appears to be "[[not verifying what should be verified]]" and "[[not]] grounded.
        - People who don't act but are very much book-learned were useful in the past because there was no search, but their value decreased around the time search evolved and LLM allowed [[search for words by meaning]].
    - Rather, it appears that it is just not currently verbalized, and that it would be useful if we could successfully get words out of Mr. A.

Q: Why do we need to do abstractions like Mr. C instead of doing more and more concrete like Mr. A?
- A:  [[Walking eyes and airplane eyes]]  /  [[eyes of a bird]]
    - Because you need to look at a wide area from a high perspective to figure out the direction you need to go.
