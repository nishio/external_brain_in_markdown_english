Sense of center of gravity
- [[bouldering]]
A story that I didn't realize on my own until it was explained to me, but when it was explained to me, it turned out to be true.

- (1) to the protrusion as shown in (2), or (3) to hang only the toe on the protrusion as shown in (4).
- Which is more "stable"?

You would think it is (2), but the correct answer is (3).

Posture is more stable when the feet are away from the wall because the center of gravity is away from the wall by the width of the body.

- It's obvious from a physical point of view, but I didn't have this feeling at first.
    - Maybe when you put your foot down, all you're thinking about is your foot.

There was also a story about going up and down with one foot on top of the other, and I thought, "This is in essence a sense of where the center of gravity of the body is and how to move it, so to speak.
