I thought the vote would be more divided since it was not a mistake to choose any of them, but reduce just barely won a majority.

reduce
- Name of a function in Python that repeatedly performs binary operations on a sequence of values to produce a single value
- Same in Lisp

inject
- Name of a method in Ruby that repeats a binary operation on a sequence of values to produce a single value
- Smalltalk origin
- [map and collect, reduce and inject -- the difference in ideas in the difference in names. [https://magazine.rubyist.net/articles/0038/0038-MapAndCollect.](https://magazine.rubyist.net/articles/0038/0038-MapAndCollect.) html]

prod
- When the binary operation is not specified, it is often assumed to be a multiplication.
    - > Often the binary operation μ is also called multiplication in magma M. The result of this operation μ(a, b) is the product of a and b.
        - [Magma (mathematics) - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%9E%E3%82%B0%E3%83%9E_(%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%A6))
    - Binary operations repeated on a sequence of values into a single value are $\prod x_i$
        - TeX with `\prod x_i`.

fold
- > In functional programming, fold (also termed reduce, accumulate, aggregate, compress, or inject) refers to a family of higher-order functions that analyze a recursive data structure and through use of a given combining operation, recombine the results of recursively processing its constituent parts, building up a return value.
