title: "When you don't realize that it's not exhaustive."
---

If you want to solve the problem of "not being [[exhaustive]]," it would be better to show [[framework]] on [[top down]] instead of [[KJ method]] on [[bottom-up]] and say "fill all of this in," and then make [[existence of a blank space]] a [[ visualization (data, results, etc.)]].

- [[Not exhaustive.]] To [[unconcerned]] when
- [[Top-down and bottom-up]]   [[blind spot]]
