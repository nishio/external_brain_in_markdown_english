Can app businesses survive?
> [@kajikent](https://twitter.com/kajikent/status/1644573284707565568?s=46&t=gkSZtjGEtUZPO0JCzBxCBw): In the next few years, like the ChatGPT Plugin, interactive AI will become the new OS Layer and Plugin should become the new Application Layer, but what is clearly different from the current OS is that the infrastructure of interactive AI will acquire the data and capabilities of the apps on top of it, so I wonder if app providers will ultimately be able to survive? I would think so.
Hmmm...I guess so. Right now we only have a chat screen style view, but there aren't that many variations of the UI that people use on a daily basis, so I guess we can talk about what would be the remaining advantages of an independent app if they could be selected and customized as a GPT view for the most part.
