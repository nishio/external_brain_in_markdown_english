This led to the development of heavy industry and the growth of the service and financial industries.

This will make invention itself conventional, leaving only issue discovery and essential work.

- In other words, just as electric charges and electric fields are the root of electromagnetism, knowledge and signifiers are the root of language, and from their dynamic flow, new
- So innovation is being created.
- Following this view, LLM may be described as a kind of "electromagnetic field" of language that extracts knowledge (charge) from a vast amount of linguistic data (signifiers) and dynamically generates signifiers through interaction with the user.
- In counterpoint, humans interpret knowledge from signifiers and become the source of new signifiers. This dynamic intellectual whirlwind may be the driving force of innovation.
- I think it is a very interesting idea to rethink the mechanism of generation and distribution of knowledge from the contrast between electromagnetism and linguistics. It seems to open up a new perspective on the fusion of physics and linguistics.

> [shogochiai](https://twitter.com/shogochiai/status/1774043239886266650) Innovation is no longer just motors and solenoids. Everything from everyday signifiers to revolutionary signifiers will be "innovated" by LLM.

> [shogochiai](https://twitter.com/shogochiai/status/1774057795136151820) Invention is the new generation of electricity, which turns innovation into the very fashion.

> [shogochiai](https://twitter.com/shogochiai/status/1774183878103842885) Ah, you write in your reply from LLM, "[[LLM is]] electromagnetism itself. An induced current generator that accelerates minute amounts of signifiers all the way to innovation.

> [shogochiai](https://twitter.com/shogochiai/status/1774184318505759225) If a large number of signifiers is all that is needed, then the innovation (energy) has to be mediated by humans to be converted into innovation (energy). Innovation is ruled by the number of people who can see the signifiers. In other words, standardized innovation is possible.

> [shogochiai](https://twitter.com/shogochiai/status/1774184971927998970) Of course, the signifier-innovation rate will improve as LLM evolves, so fewer people will be better. We should behave transiently while watching the balance there.

>  I think that the AGI story is also in the same vein.

> [shogochiai](https://twitter.com/shogochiai/status/1774185379031294352) I don't think innovation will be cheap, but I think occupational innovators like the new business department will be established. However, the tug of war is gong to change, so the Gesellschaft will have a higher rate of off the ladder. Gemeinschafts will become cheaper, as we have read so far.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>This tweet series provides in-depth insight into the transition from the Age of Electricity to the Age of Knowledge and its impact. Initially, it discusses how humans have gone from the invention of the voltaic battery in 1799 to generating electricity centrally, distributing it around the world, forming economic blocs, and developing heavy industry, service industries, and the financial sector. In contrast, he states that the invention of Large Language Models (LLMs) in 2020 will similarly intensively generate astronomical amounts of knowledge, which will be distributed throughout the world, creating a new economic sphere. This process will make invention commonplace and increase the importance of problem discovery and essential work.

He also mentions the demand for new inventions that enable the conversion of electromagnetic forces, for example, devices such as solenoids. This suggests how important the transformation of physical energy is, and likewise, innovation in the realm of knowledge and language is equally important, he said.

Using the contrast between electric charge and electric field, and signifiers (symbols with meaning) and knowledge, it shows how electromagnetism and linguistics have similar structures. This explains how LLM is like the "electromagnetic field" of language, and that new signifiers and knowledge are created through the interaction between humans and LLM, which is the source of innovation.

Expanding on this idea, he states that we are entering an era in which innovation is no longer routine and is being "innovated" by LLMs. He also noted that in this process, invention becomes a new source of energy and innovation is consumed like a fashion.

Finally, he mentions the role of humans and their changing role in the process by which LLMs visualize signifiers and translate them into innovations. He states that this process should be improved as LLMs evolve, so that innovation creation becomes more efficient, and that a balance between human and machine interaction should be observed.

Overall, this tweet series explores the impact of technological evolution on human economies, societies, and cultures, offering deep insights into new paradigms of language modeling and knowledge generation in particular.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>In the context of the tweet series shared earlier, "innovatization" seems to refer to the phenomenon of normalizing and accelerating innovation throughout everyday life and society, especially through Large Language Models (LLMs) and other advanced technologies.

LLM is able to learn patterns from vast amounts of textual data and generate new text based on these patterns, allowing for unprecedented speed and efficiency in proposing new ideas and solutions. This makes innovation easier and faster, invention itself becomes more common, and finding creative solutions to specific challenges becomes easier than ever before. This indicates that innovation will become part of everyday life, that is, reform and innovation will become embedded not as special events but as ongoing processes, shaping the very fabric of society itself.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Where there is new knowledge, there is signifie, and where signifie is spoken out, there is invention." What does that mean?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The French word "[[signified]]" means "signifier" and, in linguistics, refers to the meaning or concept that a word or signifier carries. This expression describes the generation and transmission of knowledge and how it leads to innovation.

- The relationship between the emergence of knowledge and signifiers: This phrase begins with the idea that when new knowledge arises, it gives rise to symbols (signifiers) that have new meanings and are expressed through these symbols. In other words, new discoveries and understandings require new words and concepts to explain and communicate them. This is similar to how the development of science involves the introduction of new terminology.

- Expansion and invention of signifiers: As knowledge expands and its signifiers (signifiers with meanings) are richly spoken about and explored, further understanding and insights emerge. This process can lead to new approaches and solutions, or inventions, based on existing knowledge. When the signifiers are fully explored, new methods and tools can be devised to apply them and solve real-world problems.

This concept is based on the idea that language is not merely a means of communication, but plays a central role in the process of knowledge creation and innovation. The interaction between knowledge and signifiers leads to the development of new ideas, products, and technologies, and promotes social and technological progress. Thus, this representation captures the dynamic relationship between the creation and diffusion of knowledge and how it leads to new creations.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The "[[tug-of-war]] is gong to change" part refers to a situation where the balance of power and interests in society is constantly shifting and new challenges and opportunities are constantly arising. Here, it suggests that social and economic dynamics are in flux and that forms of competition and cooperation change frequently.

The "[[society]]" (Gesellschaft) mentioned in the section "[[Gesellschaft]] increases the rate of ladder removal" is one of the concepts proposed by the German sociologist [Ferdinand Tennys. in the context of a large scale, impersonal social relationship. Here, "[[the rate of]] ladder removal increases" means that in the context of such impersonal social relationships, the behavior of people taking advantage of each other and stepping on others in order to rise increases. In other words, he notes, competition tends to increase and trust tends to become more fragile.

On the other hand, the section "[[gemeinschaft]]" (Gemeinschaft) is discussed in the section "[[gemeinschaft becomes]] more at ease." This is another Tennys concept that refers to a society based on small-scale, personal relationships, indicating strong bonds and interdependence, such as between family members and close friends. In this context, "more at ease" means that in times of uncertainty and competition, close relationships and small communities can be a source of stability and reliability, and a more reliable option or [[refuge]] for individuals.

In essence, this expression conveys the observation that in a rapidly changing society, superficial, impersonal relationships tend to be unstable, while the stability and reliability of personal ties and small communities become more valuable. This provides insight into the quality of relationships and their importance in today's ever-changing society.
