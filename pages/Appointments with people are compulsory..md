title: "Appointments with people are compulsory."
---

- When I heard that [[personal trainer]]'s job is to "cheer them on at all costs" and "not let them slack off," I thought about how [[Ring-fit adventure]] has been cheering them on at all costs but has slacked off....

And they told me that I had to pay monthly to continue, but unfortunately, I skip it even if I pay monthly.
- Probably when you pay the monthly dues, you already know it's [[sunk cost]].
    - They recognize that it is something they cannot get back whether they go to the gym or not, and they ignore it completely.
- So even if I pay a monthly membership fee, I don't go to the gym because it's a hassle because it's a "go to the gym to exercise or not" comparison and it's a hassle.

Looking back, I once paid a monthly fee for a gym and only went once in three months, but I consistently went to an English conversation school without skipping a single appointment because they made me set a specific date and time each time.... Is it inherently important to take [[appointments]] with a human being....

- [[compelling force]]
- [[continuity]]

True story: I'm paying for the Asuken, BookScan and Owl stuff, but I'm not using it...
- I'm not sure when you can't open the app without just thinking of the name.
- It was Duolingo.
