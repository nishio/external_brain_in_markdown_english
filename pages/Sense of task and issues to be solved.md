- [[sense of the issues]] and [problem that can be solved
- A vague [[sense of the issues]] cannot be [[solved]] as it is.
    - We need to find [[problem that can be solved]].
- In order to "be wide-eyed (in surprise, anger, etc.)," someone with high [[insight]] needs to "[[take a good look at]]"
    - The fuel for this "look closely" is "[[enthusiasm]]."
    - The [[person with the power to find out]] needs to [[empathy]] for the sense of challenge and [[observation]] with enthusiasm as a [[personal affair]].
- After a solvable problem is found, an [[IDEA]] is generated to solve that problem.
    - For example, one person says, "If you can do X like this, it will solve the problem," and another person replies, "X can be solved by using technology Y like this.
    - The discovery of a "solvable problem" and an "idea" can occur almost simultaneously within a single person.
