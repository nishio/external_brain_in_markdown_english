<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It would be good if the policy on the content of the lecture is set and the content of the short lecture is verbalized.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "lecture" is this "lecture"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's a lecture I'm giving in June, and I was caught off guard thinking it was still a while away, but I already needed to submit a lecture outline.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that "lecture"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>In our last chat, we talked about conveying "information that will have a beneficial effect on the audience's future life choices."
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "audience" is this "audience"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>A very low diversity population that is middle and high school students in a progressive school, some of whom go on to Tokyo University.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "low group" is this "low group"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The majority's pattern of behavior, to get into a college with a high deviation score for the time being, is not so bad, but while they are doing that, there are people in their age group who are using their minds to make a variety of choices about their lives, and they are behind the curve in terms of skills in that area.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "life" is that "life"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>With so many choices, it is difficult to know which option is correct before making a choice. You wrote about this in [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]]. [Correctness of decision-making.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "choice" is that "choice"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>That seems to be the key word. However, if I keep diverging, I might not get to the lecture outline, which is the purpose of this lecture, so I took a look at the previous lecture, which was titled "Designing Learning Methods. The material from that lecture later led to "The Intellectual Production Techniques of Engineers.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Maybe I should talk about this kind of developmental process. Since I only do it in lectures at my alma mater; I gave a talk with the same title in 2014, and how it has developed since then.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen with regard to this "lecture"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I hope this will help young people in their future choices, but it's hard to apply simply telling the facts of my case.

- What does this "lecture" look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> [[snowball]] Duh, it may be small, but once it starts rolling, it gets bigger and bigger. I wrote about this story in an article in the Technology Review.

- How do you know about this "lecture"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I have the lecture materials on Scrapbox for you to read over. It would be good to specify the connection to the intellectual production techniques of engineers. I just remembered that "[[Rolling snowballs]]" is [[planned contingency]]. It is related to what you said about becoming observable after the fact.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where do these "lectures" come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I've done a lot of this kind of talk before, so there's a network-like structure inside me and in Scrapbox, and if you hook into it and pull it out, the story will come out like a sack of potatoes.

- Where is this "lecture" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I'm still muddling through, writing this chat log and hooks of things I remember in bits and pieces on the Preparing for a Lecture page on Scrapbox.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is this "lecture" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's in me, and it's in the process of fishing it out, pulling it out, putting it into words, and putting it in Scrapbox.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "Scrapbox" is this "Scrapbox"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Pages are linked to each other, so it's easy to pull them up like a sack of potatoes.

- What is this "story" about?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>There are a few specifics that I don't remember, but the next action is to write what I almost remembered from this chat in the Scrapbox and hook it up firmly.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that "Scrapbox"?
