The main implications of this paper are as follows

1. development and peak of working memory
- There is a significant increase of an average of 23 standard points between the ages of 5 and 19, the most rapid growth period of one's life.
- It reaches its peak in the 30s, followed by a gradual decline.
- The 50- to 80-year-olds show a decline of only about 6 points, and those in their 60s perform almost as well as those in their 20s.

2. asymmetry of age-related decline
- Linguistic working memory is relatively preserved even in old age, and is comparable to that of teenagers at ages 70-80.
- Visuospatial working memory declines markedly in old age, dropping to the level of 9- to 10-year-olds at ages 70 to 80.
- Possibility that this difference is due to asymmetry in age-related deterioration of the left hemisphere (language system) and the right hemisphere (visuospatial system).

3. structure by domain
- than functional distinctions such as "retention and manipulation" as a result of confirmatory factor analysis,
The best fit is a model in which there is a consistent distinction between the information domains of "language" and "visuospatial."
- The linguistic and visuospatial systems are not completely independent, but have certain relationships.

4. possible reason for the slow decline due to aging
- Possibility for adults to compensate by using their extensive knowledge store (long-term memory).
- Possibility that this study did not apply time pressure, thus reducing the effect of aging on processing speed reduction.
- Executive functions (task switching, updating, and inhibition) were stable in adulthood, which may have led to stable WM performance.

5. practical implications
- In education and support, it is useful to understand the domain profile of a learner's working memory strengths and weaknesses.
    - E.g.: dyslexia → weakness in verbal WM, visuospatial WM is relatively strong.
    - ADHD and motor coordination disorders → Weakness in visuospatial WM.
- Cognitive training for the elderly can be effective by focusing on visuospatial WM, which is prone to decline.

If you wish, we can create a visualization of this paper that combines the developmental curve and the aging curve in a single chart. That way you can see the developmental peaks and decline patterns at a glance.

Executive Summary (in a nutshell)
Working memory is not divided by "function" (retention/operation) but by "domain" (language/visuospatial) and changes with development and aging. Development increases significantly from 5-19 years of age (average +23 points), peaks in the 30s, and the decline in old age is small, especially in the language system, which is fairly well preserved (comparable to teenagers even in their 70s-80s).

Key Implications
- Support for domain specificity: Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the best fit was a two-factor model for the "language" and "visuospatial" systems. Domain differences in stimuli are more essential than functional differences in retention and manipulation.
- Developmental dynamics: rapid growth at age 5-19 → apex in 20s-30s → gradual thereafter.
- Differences in age tolerance: verbal working memory is resistant to aging, while visuospatial is relatively vulnerable (interpreted as near 9-10 year old level in 70s-80s).
- Effect of Time Pressure: This study did not impose a time limit, thus relatively avoiding the effect of aging on processing speed reduction. A different conclusion could be reached for tasks that strongly include a speed factor.
- Educational and clinical evaluation: separate profiling of language and visuospatial is more useful than a single overall score. Should also be interpreted based on changes by age band.

Practical Implications
- Assessment Design:
    - Measure language/visual space separately (a composite span with a retention + manipulation component in each is preferred).
    - The senior assessment will clearly state and control for time limits (separating the speed factor from the capacity factor).
- Intervention and Support:
    - Child and learning support: reinforcement of language system WM for reading/language disorders, emphasis on visuospatial system for DCD/ADHD tendencies.
    - Older age: Prioritize strategies to maintain and replace visuospatial system (externalization, cue design, reduction of spatial load). Utilize the language system as a compensatory resource.
- Workplace/UX: Tasks for older adults maximize performance with time deferral and reduced visuospatial load (consistency of placement, staged presentation, visual noise reduction).

Limitations and Cautions
- This is a cross-sectional study (cross-section of 5-80 year olds) and longitudinal causality is unknown.
- Limited range of stimuli and tasks (2 scores for visuospatial derived from 1 real task).
- Bias of English speakers and online implementation.
- Due to its design with a low speed factor, it is carefully extrapolated to general tests (with time limits).

Next step (how to make the most of it)
- The evaluation standardized the two-axis report for language/visual space.
- Training/instruction is designed to be domain-specific, with a primary focus on proximal transition (improvement of issue proximity).
- The study separated the time limit x age x region interaction in the experimental design and tested the trajectories with longitudinal follow-up.
If necessary, we can create a summary table by age group from the figures in this paper (Table 1) and put it into a practical checklist of which areas to focus on in which age range.

Key Points (in a nutshell)
- Working memory (WM) increases significantly during childhood (mean +23 standard scores at ages 5-19), maximizes in the 30s, and declines slowly thereafter.
- Linguistic WM is relatively preserved in old age, while visuospatial WM is more age-sensitive.
- Factor analysis results indicate that WM is explained by a domain difference** of "language vs. visuospatial" rather than a functional difference such as **"maintenance vs. manipulation".

Implications for Practice
- Assessment design: WM should be captured in a domain-specific profile. Instead of a single overall score, measure the verbal and visuospatial systems separately (e.g., Backward Digit, letter task, and shape task compatible).
- Educational Assistance:
    - Language system WM assistance (chunking, phonological cues, linguistic externalization) for learners with reading and language difficulties.
    - Assist with visuospatial system WM for learners with DCD/ADHD tendencies (simplified diagram/location cues, sequential presentation, visual notes).
    - Growth is high among 5-19 year olds → high return on investment for early intervention.
- Elderly assistance/UX:
    - UI/materials that reduce visuospatial load and time constraints and increase linguistic cues (explicit labels, staged presentation, placement that does not force positional memory).
    - Reducing concurrent processing and easing deadlines and time pressure will increase fairness.
- Training direction: domain-specific training is more reasonable for task-specific training than domain-general "WM skills" (e.g., visuospatial system with navigation, mental rotation, etc.; verbal system with recitation + integrated summary).

Implications for Research and Measurement
- Modeling: data fit is better (CFI/IFI/NFI≈.98) when WM is treated as **region-specific (two factors: language/visual space)**. On the other hand, RMSEA is higher, noting the limitations of a model with small degrees of freedom.
- Issue design: This study was measured without time limits, which may have reduced the impact of age differences in processing speed on performance. The validity of the experiment and evaluation will increase if "with/without speed" is considered separately as a condition.
- Breadth of Measurements: Since visuospatial is estimated almost exclusively from a single task, it needs to be revalidated with **various visuospatial tasks (location, shape, mental rotation, etc.)**.
- DESIGN: Causal inferences are strengthened by incorporating longitudinal tracking for cross-sectional studies, covariate controls for processing speed, and separate measures of STM and WM.

Notes (tips on how to read the information)
- It is not that "WM does not fall with age." The decline is relatively gradual, especially in the language system, which means that it is easy to retain.
- Generalization scope: English native language and UK-centered sample. Differences in cultural and educational backgrounds are taken into account.
- External validity of training: it cannot be concluded from this paper that improvement in WM tasks is directly related to extensive transitions (e.g., Gf). With transitions in domain and task proximity in mind.

summary
- Great elongation in childhood, peak in 30s, and gradual change thereafter.
- Aging profile with strong language and fragile visuospatial.
- It is best to evaluate, intervene, and design by domain.
These three practical suggestions are common to education, elderly support, UI/work design, and research design.
