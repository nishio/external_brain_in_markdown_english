title: "An era when homo sapiens will be a minority"
---

Is it right to describe ideas in a [[natural language]] for Homo sapiens during the transition from an era in which Homo sapiens made up almost 100% of intelligent beings to an era in which Homo sapiens are [[minority]]?

Probably not.

At this time.
- No suitable new language has been invented yet.
- It is doubtful that Homo sapiens, whose intelligence is inferior to that of Homo sapiens, will be able to acquire a "[[new language]]" appropriate for the "intelligent beings that will overwhelm Homo sapiens in the future.


relevance
    - [[non-homo sapiens]]
