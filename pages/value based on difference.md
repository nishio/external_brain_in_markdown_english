- Summary of "value based on difference (valeur)" in [Saussure

The idea that the "value" of a [[linguistic unit]] (word, phoneme, etc.) arises from the [[web of relations]] of how that unit differs from and is connected to other units. Each element is not determined by its unique substantive meaning, but is positioned by its differences within the system.

Mechanism (relationship between the two)
- Syntagmatic: a relation that actually lines up. Constraints and roles created by the conjunction of words such as "black + cat + meows".
- Association/paradigmatic relationship: a selection relationship of candidates that can be replaced in the same position. Substitutability, such as "black/white/big...cat".
➡︎ The value of a word,
(1) what it can be coupled with (connectivity/function), and (2) what it can be coupled with (connectivity/function),
(2) What is it distinguished from in normative terms (conflict and substitutability)?
This is determined as the overall result of the

key point
1. product of difference: language is said to be "composed only of differences and has no positive terms". The opposition between /p/ and /b/ (voiced, voiceless, etc.) is given more value than the nature of the sound itself.
2. arbitrariness and convention: the connection between nōgi (sound forms) and shōgi (ideas) is not a natural necessity, but depends on social conventions. Hence, values are intra-system relative and vary from language to language.
- Example of language differences: French mouton can refer to both "sheep" and "mutton," while English is divided into sheep and mutton. Rather than a difference in the "meaning" of words, a difference in the way the system is cut (i.e., the way differences are established) creates a difference in value.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>This is [[segmentation]].
4. chess/currency metaphor: The value of a chess piece is not determined by its material, but by its relationship to other pieces and rules. Currency also has value not because of the inherent properties of the metal, but because of the exchange relationship within the system. Similarly for words, position (relationship) = value.

Difference (practically) between "value" and "meaning."
- Meaning (SIGNIFICATION): a description of what a word refers to.
- Value (valeur): the position the word occupies in the system (what it can be connected with, what it cannot replace, what it is opposed to).
Even if they refer to the same object, different systems have different values (sheep/mutton example above).

Points that are often misunderstood
- Value is not "frequency of use or social reputation". Technical terms based on relationships within the structure.
- Value is not a fixed entity. They change in tandem when the overall arrangement of vocabulary and phonology changes.

If necessary, do a specific analysis of how values stand up from differences in alliteration/normative sequences in the vocabulary of your area of interest (e.g., philosophical terms, technical terms, policy language). Which words will you try?
