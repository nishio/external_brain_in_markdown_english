Very good book, but also crunchy, so it's not a book you can read once off the top of your head like most books.
    - [[Books to chew on]]

- 【 [[Linear problem solving]] 】
    - A problem-solving method based on linear causality.
    - By tracing causality back in a linear fashion and removing or changing the ultimate cause that has been arrived at, the result is changed and the problem is solved.
- 【 [[Circular Problem Solving]] 】
        - A problem-solving method used when the cause and effect relationship is a loop, as in the [[Chicken and Eggs]] relationship.
    - Change the perception of the problem, not eliminate or change the ultimate cause
    - Bring change to a vicious circle and indirectly change the problem.
