<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>On April 13-14, nishio and Glen Weyl worked on pull request (PR) #884.
1. nishio reported that he has completed the indexing data and that the next phase, visual formatting, will be handled by Jason Entenmann.
2. nishio manually completes the keywords (50-80) that could not be detected by the script and determines that little additional work is needed.
3. two unfinished tasks: (1) italicizing book and movie titles, and (2) verifying that ROC and PRC are pointing to the correct location.
4. Glen Weyl pointed out a conflict in PR#884. The cause was that Glen and nishio edited the same file (index.txt).
5. nishio suggested taking Glen's changes and reflecting them in the index_for_copyedit.md file.
6. nishio used a script to automatically merge most of Glen's changes and manually merge the rest. nishio stated that he cannot guarantee that he fully understands Glen's intent, so a review is needed before approval.
7. finally, nishio and Glen Weyl agreed to transfer and format the index and the work was completed.
