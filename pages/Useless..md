title: "Useless."
---

The word "useless" with respect to a tool X can mean both "X is so poorly made that it is useless" and "the speaker's [[Usability Skills]] are so low that he/she cannot use X".

There is a Japanese proverb that says, "[[A fool and a pair of scissors are useful]]. Basically, it means that everything can be used as it should be.
