Fukabori mode to dig deep into the opponent's obsession and Yusaburi mode to shake up the obsession.

> [YukiAnzai](https://x.com/YukiAnzai/status/1819134929831448608) In the book "The Art of Asking Questions," published in 2021, I categorized them into two modes: the fukabori mode, which digs deep into the other person's particulars, and the yusaburi mode, which shakes the obsession, I organized the patterns of questioning.
>
>  Today's Voicy explained how to utilize each of these patterns through the case of yesterday's interview with Mr. Tonan, who actually used them.
