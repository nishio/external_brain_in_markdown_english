Discussion of the relationship between [[Eric S. Raymond's]] [[Cultivation of the Nowhere Sphere]] and [[Yukito Emaya's]] [interchange format

from  [[Cultivation of the Nowhere Sphere]]
> Most methods of organization that humans have are adaptive behaviors to scarcity and desire. Each method has a separate means of acquiring social status.
- [[Means of obtaining social status]].
- > The easiest way is the [[command hierarchy]]... The distribution of scarce goods is done by a [[central authority]], backed up by a [[military force]]... Social status is determined primarily by the ability to access [[extortion power]].
    - This is [interchange format B
- > Our society is solely an [[exchange economy]]... The distribution of scarce goods is [[de-centered]] by [[exchange]] and [[voluntary cooperation]]... Social status is determined primarily by the [[control]] of things (not necessarily material things).
    - This is [[exchange form C]].
- > ... There is a third model that is quite different from both of these and is not widely recognized except by anthropologists. This is the culture of giving.
    - >  [[Giving culture is an adaptation to excess, not scarcity]]... Social status is not determined by what a person controls, but by what he or she gives away.
        - Original English: Gift cultures are adaptations not to scarcity but to abundance. ... In gift cultures, social status is determined not by what you control but by what you give away.
        - Related: [[Wealth is not how much you have, but how much you can give]] ([[Larry Wall]])
    - Would this be [[exchange form A]]?
        - Strongly related to exchange style A in terms of gift culture
        - But to equate this with Exchange Form A seems like a [[low resolution]] representation.
        - It is important to point out that "adaptation to excess, not scarcity" is the key.
            - In the era when exchange style A was born, exchange was the exchange of [[tangible]] objects.
            - Technological advances have created [digital goods
            - Digital goods are cheap [[replication cost]], so they become excessive as soon as they are created
        - Progress from the invention of letterpress to the invention of the Internet has lowered the cost of reproducing and transporting the written word.
            - First, this generated a community of knowledge exchange called academia.
            - Knowledge exchange is another kind of exchange
            - Reproducible nature is similar to digital goods
        - These are the birth of [[New Exchange Style]].
            - I have reservations about whether to call this an exchange form D, because there is no clarity regarding the boundary between A and D.
            - It seems that Yukito Emaya sees more meaning in the exchange style D, so he puts together a big concept in a small way.
            - Personally, I don't believe that the wide variety of exchange activities should fit into the four classification frameworks A-D.
