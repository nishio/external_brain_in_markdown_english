title: "People who teach innovative thinking."
---

- For any given X, it is difficult for "someone who does not understand X" to determine whether what "someone who teaches X" is teaching is good or bad.
- If the person teaching programming had no programming experience, I would be rather suspicious.
- Similarly, we want those who teach innovative thinking to have experience with innovative thinking.
- Telling people to use a specific tool with a specific procedure is dogmatic and does not fit in with innovative thinking.
- The belief that innovative ideas will fall into place when certain tools are used in certain procedures is a type of cargo cult.
