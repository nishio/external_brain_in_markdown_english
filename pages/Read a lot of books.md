title: "Read a lot of books"
---

You might think that reading lots of books and "[[studying]]" is a good thing.
However, it is an action of making a degraded copy of "knowledge that is already [[verbalizing]] and circulating in the world" within oneself.
You are not generating knowledge for yourself, nor are you giving knowledge to others.
- In terms of [[Knowledge must be proven by deeds.]], it is not producing results.
