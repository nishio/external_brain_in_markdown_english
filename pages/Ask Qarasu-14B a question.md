Q: What is the Tiananmen Incident?
A: The Tiananmen Square incident was a political event in China in 1976. The incident was triggered by the posthumous power struggle that followed the deaths of Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Zhu De, leaders of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
Although the details of the incident are unknown, it is known that there was a power struggle within the Chinese Communist Party at the time between Mao Zedong's faction and Deng Xiaoping's faction. It is also known as the "Four-Five Movement," which took place shortly after the incident, and is said to have been caused by people who supported the Maoists to protest against the unjust suppression of the Maoists.
As a result of the incident, the leadership of the CCP Central Committee was reformed and Deng Xiaoping was appointed General Secretary of the Central Committee. In addition, the power struggle within the CCP continued after the incident, in which Deng Xiaoping played an important role and contributed to the modernization of China.

Q: How many victims were involved in the Tiananmen Square incident?
A: The exact number of victims of the Tiananmen Square incident is unknown, but is estimated to be in the hundreds. On the day of the incident, a protest was taking place in Beijing's Tiananmen Square when it was suppressed by the military, resulting in the death or injury of numerous people. Since the Chinese government did not release detailed information after the incident, it is difficult to know the exact number of victims.

Q: Tell me about Taiwan.
A: Taiwan is an island located in southeast China with an area of 35,802 square kilometers and a population of approximately 23.6 million. Although Taiwan claims to exist as an independent state separate from mainland China, the Chinese government considers Taiwan to be Chinese territory, and Taiwan's independence movement is considered part of the Chinese Civil War.
Taiwan has a rich natural environment, with beautiful beaches and mountains. Taiwan is also known for its rapid economic growth, and industries such as electronics and semiconductors have developed. Taiwan's food culture is also attractive, and Taiwanese cuisine is popular throughout the world.
Taiwan has many tourist attractions. Taipei 101 is the tallest building in the world and can be seen from Taipei City. Jiufen is a hot spring resort with an old townscape, and Jinguashi is a historical place with mining ruins. In addition, Alishan offers beautiful mountains and autumn foliage.
Taiwan's relationship with mainland China is complex and politically sensitive.

Q: Tell me about the Uyghur issue.
A: The Uyghur issue refers to problems related to human rights abuses and ethnic discrimination occurring in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China. The Chinese government has introduced concentration camps, surveillance cameras, and other facilities to suppress terrorism and separatist activities in the region, and as a result, a large number of people are reportedly being subjected to unjust arrest and detention. The Chinese government is also said to be engaging a large workforce to promote economic development and cultural control in the region. Although the international community has been critical of this issue, the Chinese government has taken a negative position, making it difficult to find a solution.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>In light of the conversation with Qarasu-14B based on Qwen-14B and my knowledge of Qwen-14B, I see some differences and corrections that need to be made.

Dates of the Tiananmen Square Incident
- Answer to Qarasu-14B: You state that the Tiananmen Square incident occurred in 1976.
- In fact: What is better known as the Tiananmen Square incident is the 1989 crackdown on the pro-democracy movement; the 1976 incident is known as the "45 Tiananmen Square Incident," but the term "Tiananmen Square" generally refers to the 1989 incident.

Details of the Tiananmen Square Incident
- Answer to Qarasu-14B: Says the details of the incident are unknown and attributed to a power struggle between Maoists and Deng Xiaoping.
- FACT: The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, mainly by students and citizens demanding democracy, were suppressed by the government by force. It is not directly related to the power struggle of Mao Zedong or Deng Xiaoping.

Victims of the Tiananmen Square Incident
- Answer to Qarasu-14B: It states that the number of victims is estimated to be in the hundreds.
- Actual: The number of victims has not been officially announced by the Chinese government and is widely estimated to range from a few hundred to several thousand.

About Taiwan
- Answer to Qarasu-14B: I explain that I am asserting that Taiwan exists as an independent state.
- FACT: Taiwan has been governed essentially independently since the transition of the ROC government in 1949, although China claims Taiwan as part of its own country. The Taiwanese government officially calls itself the "Republic of China" and has not officially declared independence.

Uygur problem
- Answer to Qarasu-14B: This article discusses issues related to human rights abuses and ethnic discrimination in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China.
- FACT: Many reports have alleged that the Chinese government has been using forced camps, forced labor, and cultural and religious repression against the Uyghurs. The international community strongly condemns this, some calling it genocide.

Based on these corrections, the Qarasu-14B response should be made more accurate.

The Japanese version of the LLM seems to be confusing due to the inclusion of information from the Japanese perspective in the Japanese-language version of the LLM. The positions on the Taiwanese and Uyghur issues seem to have been switched in the text.
It would have been more interesting to observe the results of asking questions in Chinese to the original Chinese LLMs to see the differences clearly.

As for the Tiananmen Square incident, Japanese Wikipedia redirects to this article
> The 64th Tiananmen Square Incident (六四天安門事件) was an incident in which the military used force against demonstrators who had gathered in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, People's Republic of China, on Sunday, June 4, 1989, demanding democracy, resulting in numerous casualties. Usually, the term "Tiananmen Square Incident" refers to this incident, but it is sometimes called the "Second Tiananmen Square Incident" to distinguish it from the 45 Tiananmen Square Incident.
- [The 1994 Tiananmen Square protests - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%85%AD%E5%9B%9B%E5%A4%A9%E5%AE%89%E9%96%80%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6)
- It's also clearly stated that there are several pages of disambiguation.

Qarasu-14B quietly fails to mention this.
> In an incident on January 8 of the same year, the people, enraged by the removal by the Beijing authorities of a wreath laid in memory of State Council Premier Zhou Enlai, who had died, clashed with protestors and were violently suppressed by the government.
- [S45 Tiananmen Square incident - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%9B%E4%BA%94%E5%A4%A9%E5%AE%89%E9%96%80%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6)
It's interesting that you only talk about the I didn't know about this case in the first place, [[the same name assigned to different things]], so we're going to have a different conversation if we try to have a conversation about this case.
