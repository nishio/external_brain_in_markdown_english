# What is a "cut": a perspective on the world and the creation of knowledge
.

Considering the concept of "cut" from the group of texts provided, we can say that it is not just a word or a classification, but a fundamental "[[point of view]]" or "[[way of asking questions]]" for ### understanding the world
, [[advancing thinking]], and [[creating new knowledge]].

## 1. [[Tools to "understand" by "dividing" the world]]
- The most basic function of a "cut" is to "[[divide]]" complex events and information into specific perspectives
        - [[Cutting edge to increase resolution]] ,  [[Understanding and Separating]]
- For example, binary divisions such as "male/female" and "for/against" are one approach.
- But reality is filled with more diverse cuts
        - [[The majority becomes the minority.]]
- As Boethius indicated, there are a myriad of cut-off points, including "definition," "cause," "result," "similarity," "difference," "time," and "place," and
        - [[Boethius' 28 Discussion Points Guidelines]]
- Depending on which angle you choose, the world you see will be completely different.
- By using the appropriate cutoff, a vague subject resolution is increased and a more detailed and clear understanding of the subject becomes possible.
        - [[Cognitive Resolution]]

## 2. [[Catalyst for new discoveries and structuring]]
- The "cut" also serves as a "catalyst for new discoveries," breaking away from existing knowledge and [[stereotypes]].
- Just by being aware of a specific "color" as in "[[color bath effect]]", you can find new information in everyday scenery.
- The practical examples of the KJ method show the importance of discovering groups (i.e., new approaches and structures) from the bottom-up based on the relationships among stickies, rather than sticking to [[top-down]] cutouts ([[Existing classification]]) such as "male/female," which were prepared in advance.
        - [[Draft addition to "Group Formation Requires a Change of Mindset"]]
- Existing cutoffs can help us organize our thinking, but if we get caught up in them, we risk missing [[unknown patterns]] or [[unknown structures]] that the data itself speaks to us.
- Rather, it is the [[post hoc insights]] that are discovered in the face of data that provide the deepest [[insights]].

## 3. "Useful" outcomes in intellectual production
.
- The "cut" is both the process itself and the product of intellectual production.
- When you find [[a useful angle]], it means you have a new tool to understand the world better and to solve problems.
        - [[Coined words are not intellectual production.]]
    - If the cut is truly useful, a word (sometimes coined) will be needed to point to it, and it will be shared and used by others.
- What is important is not so much the [[novelty]] of the cut itself, but the [accumulation of thoughts and practices based on that cut.
        - [[I've accumulated more than anyone else.]]
        - > The cut does not have to be new, but it can be recognized after the fact by accumulating more than anyone else based on that cut.
- Even if a particular angle seems novel, its value is determined after the fact by how deeply it [[delving into]] and [[piling up]] concrete knowledge and results from that perspective.

## 4. Deepening through diversity and dialogue
.
- There is a limit to capturing the world from only one angle.
        - [[The majority becomes the minority.]]
- By combining multiple approaches, a more multifaceted and realistic understanding is possible.
        - [[From a 360-degree viewing angle]]
- Also, through dialogue with others, sometimes with an AI like LLM, you may notice [[a different point of view]] or [[a different angle]] that you would not have thought of on your own.
        - [[Forkwell Library#55 Questions]]
- Exposure to, examination of, and mastery of a variety of approaches leads to deeper thinking and richer intellectual production.

# In conclusion, a "cut" is
* ### "[[point of view]]" and "[[question]]" to [[segment]] the world and increase [resolution of understanding
.
* ### "[[catalyst]]" to go beyond [[existing frameworks]] and encourage new discoveries and structuring
.
* ### "[[a]] useful tool" that aids in thinking and [[problem-solving]], [[found as a result of]] [intellectual production
.
* ### [something that exists [[in plurality, not singular]] and is [[enriched]] through [[diverse perspectives]] and [dialogue
.

and is an indispensable fundamental element in our perception of the world and in the creation of knowledge.
Which "cut" we choose, how we use it, and how we discover new "cuts" will greatly affect the quality of our intellectual activities.
