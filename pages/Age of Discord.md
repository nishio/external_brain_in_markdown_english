<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Ages of Discord by Peter Turchin is a book that analyzes American history from the perspective of Structural-Demographic Theory. This theory shows that social instability and conflict are closely related to factors such as economic inequality and political fragmentation (Peter Turchin ).

Turchin argues that periods of equality and prosperity in American history are followed by periods of growing inequality and social and political tension. This pattern has repeated itself from the "era of good feelings" in the early 19th century through the Civil War, and from the period of prosperity after World War II through the current "second era of discord" (Peter Turchin) (Peter Turchin).

Specifically, Turchin notes that real wages for workers in the United States have declined over the past 40 years, and the gap between the rich and the poor has widened. This economic inequality has been linked to political fragmentation and increased social violence, which he attributes to the instability of contemporary America (Peter Turchin) (Peter Turchin).

The Age of Discord uses historical data and theory to provide a new perspective for understanding contemporary social problems. Turchin's analysis concludes that American society is once again facing a crisis according to past patterns, and that this is due to structural factors, not mere coincidence (Peter Turchin) ( Peter Turchin).

I think it's a very good proxy for "elite overproductivity".

It's just the opposite of what you'd expect. Well, I guess it's a sign that we are starting to hear about this kind of toxicity now.
