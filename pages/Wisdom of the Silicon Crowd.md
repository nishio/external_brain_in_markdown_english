Wisdom of the Silicon Crowd: LLM Ensemble Prediction Capabilities Rival Human Crowd Accuracy
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19379](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19379)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This paper describes a study that compared the predictive ability of [[an ensemble approach]] to large-scale language models (LLMs) with the accuracy of human crowd prediction.

Study 1 used a crowd of 12 LLMs whose forecasts were aggregated and compared to the crowd forecasts of a 3-month forecasting tournament consisting of 925 human forecasters. The results showed that the LLM crowd outperformed the simple benchmark and was not statistically different from the human crowd.

Study 2 found that GPT-4 and Claude 2 improved the accuracy of their predictions by 17% to 28% when informed by the median human crowd forecast. However, the accuracy was lower than simply averaging the human and machine forecasts.

These results suggest that LLM can achieve prediction accuracy comparable to human crowd prediction tournaments through the simple and practical technique of prediction aggregation. This replicates the "[[wisdom of crowds]]" effect for LLM and opens up the possibility of using LLM for a variety of applications in society.

- There are two ways in which LLM can make humans smarter: by enabling them to listen to more human voices [[broad listening]] and by thinking while conversing with AI assistants rather than thinking alone.
- Studies have shown that instead of a "one-to-one human-assistant" approach with respect to this latter, the assistant can be a better thinker by becoming 12 LLMs instead of "one-to-one human-assistant".
- I did [[Plural Viewpoints]] that I'm deepening my thinking by conversing with three different prompting virtual personalities, same direction.
