title: "Psychology of Boredom"

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1460620511440879618) I've been thinking about "how not to become old" and I thought that "old" might not be appropriate because there are cases where people are young and yet old, but I hadn't found a substitute. But I couldn't find anything to replace it. Today I realized that "leisure time" may be the answer.

> [kentarofukuchi](https://twitter.com/kentarofukuchi/status/1462566325042106373) Chapter 5 of Dankert & Eastwood's "[[Psychology of Boredom]]" may be relevant. In my opinion, I am more interested in the feeling of wanting to be connected to people and society, but not being able to, or not feeling connected to them. The discussion in the same book is also helpful.
