title: 'Not "senile people," but "senile behavior."'

There is merit in limiting the use of the phrase "[[problems caused by the elderly (esp. gerontocracy, and elderly people's control over the young)]]" to "[[person who is an old-timer]]" rather than "Acting like an old man" has merit.
When we focus on people, it is easy to drift into thinking "which is the old man" or "I am not the old man".
Focusing on the behavior, we can honestly conclude that "each of them had old-age behavior.

Given this, the choice of the term [[aging population combined with the elderly]] is also not appropriate.
This is based on the premise that people become old.
