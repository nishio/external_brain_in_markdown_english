As a new non-existent scientific phenomenon becomes more widespread, it becomes common sense without language, but with physicality.

Here, humans and [[LLMs]] (Large Language Models) are viewed as "[[phenomenological machines]]," with special emphasis on human capabilities.

- Man and Phenomena: Humans have been described as "[[the]] most superior machine to manipulate phenomena. From this perspective, humans have a unique ability to understand and manipulate phenomena through their consciousness, experience, and physicality. This human capacity is rooted in direct experience and physical sensation, independent of language.

- [[non-existent scientific phenomena]]: This seems to refer to phenomena beyond the traditional framework of physical reality, such as quantum phenomena, Bitcoin, and smart contracts. Although these phenomena do not have a direct physical existence, they have a significant impact on society and technology, shaping new realities.

- COMMON SENSE AND ROUGH CONSENSUS: The process by which non-existential scientific phenomena "become common sense in corporeality without language" is sometimes referred to as "[[rough consensus]]. This refers to an implicit consensus based on practical understandings and shared experiences rather than explicit agreements or laws. In other words, people intuitively understand these phenomena beyond words and accept them as common knowledge in society.

- Relationship to Law: Non-existential scientific phenomena, because of their immaterial nature and rapid development, are considered to be easily behind the curve for laws to respond to. In other words, these phenomena are difficult to describe by statute law, posing the problem that laws have difficulty keeping up with social changes created by new technologies and theories.
