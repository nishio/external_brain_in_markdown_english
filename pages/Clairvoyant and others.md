This text describes events related to the "[[clairvoyant]]" phenomenon and its impact in Japan during the Meiji era. The main points are as follows
1. around 1908, a "clairvoyant" who could clairvoyantly and telekinetically see appeared and became a big topic of conversation throughout Japan.
2. even prominent scholars and experts believed in this phenomenon and attempted to scientifically verify it.
3. physicists were skeptical, but the public criticized it.
4. in the end, the case closed with the revelation that clairvoyance is a phenomenon with fraudulent elements.
5. the author sees this event as a kind of "epidemic fever" and points out that such a phenomenon can occur regardless of the degree of scientific progress.
6. referring to a similar incident during World War II, the "[[Japanese]] Iron Manufacturing Act," he points out the danger that "inventions" with no scientific basis were believed, even by government officials.
7. the author stresses the importance of basic science education and the need for calm, critical thinking in response to these unscientific phenomena.
