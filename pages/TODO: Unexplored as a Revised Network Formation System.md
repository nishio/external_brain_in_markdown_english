title: "TODO: Unexplored as a Revised Network Formation System"
---

The [[Unexplored as a network formation system]] I wrote in 2011 was difficult to read because of the limitation of only one page and because after I wrote it I was asked to include my introduction and other information, so I abbreviated "network" to "NW" and so on to fit it into one page. So how about making a revised version here?
