[[Amartya Sen]] (1999) Development as Freedom
He presents a capability approach in which "[[F]]reedom is both an end and the most efficient means."

Michele Grillo (2023) “Market competition, efficiency and economic liberty”
He argues that freedom and efficiency are likely to clash under imperfect competition, but that ensuring decentralization (market thickness) is the key to achieving both.

James E. Meade (1993) Liberty, Equality, and Efficiency
- Propose an institutional package to avoid "[[three strokes]]" of [[freedom]], [[efficiency]], and [[equality]].
