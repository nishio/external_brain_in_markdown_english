title: "page-level DF"
---

    - [[DF]] that regards [[page]] as a unit of a document.
    - How much is appropriate as [[particle size]]?
    - For example, if you search for a keyword and you get, "You can find that keyword in this book," you have to open the book and then search again.
    - double effort
    - Then when you jump from the search results screen, it should be the search screen in the book, and the page of its first appearance should be opened.
    - In that light, shouldn't the page have been a hoot in the search results in the first place, instead of a book?
