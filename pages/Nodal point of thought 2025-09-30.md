Context: [[thought-node 2025-09-25]].
- True that "[[volunteer organizations]] tend to be iffy," but still, overall, there are "organizations that create positive value" and "organizations that suck the resources out of the people involved and make them negative," what is the difference?
    - The former became compactly called [[productive communities]].
        - [[Volunteer Organizations]]
            - [[volunteer]]
            - [[organization]]
- I think "[[O]]rganizations that let in permissionless people get weird people" is true to some extent.

[[Ability to make culture fit]].

[[You can't call it a culture difference even if you get along well.]]

[[Culture that emphasizes culture fit]].

- [[brilliant jerk]]

[[Selection alone is not enough to be a productive community]].

[[Remind them that the opinions of those outside the project are implicitly assumed by those inside]].

[[A company is a mechanism for creating value from a group of people who are not willing to pay their own way]].

[[I think we have a narrow view of each other.]]

[[East India Company and personal expenses.]]

[[Unified organizational culture lowers transaction costs in the intra-organizational market]].

Collaboration and culture fit with people with different perspectives
    - [There is value in working with people who have Different Perspectives.
    - There are differences in thinking and focus depending on the differences in what we have seen.
    - This is beneficial
- Is there a trade-off between this and [[culture fit]]?

- I'm not sure the culture is the same as someone who is interesting to talk to and discuss with.
- On the other hand, the culture should be the same with the people you want to work with.
    - There seems to be some confusion in this discussion due to the ambiguity of the term "culture" and the fact that different layers of culture are referred to by the same term "culture.
- So it is better to get involved in an outsourced way.
    - This "outsourcing" is an expression derived from "[[even if you get along well, you can't call it a different culture]]".
- The cultures don't have to be the same, but isn't it important to be willing to [[bounce ideas, opinions, etc. off each other to obtain a fine-tuned integrated whole]]?
    - [Whether or not there is an attitude of compromise
- I think we need to be willing to observe first.
    - The bushes are moving, there might be a bear, let's fire the shotgun.
        - No, no, no, don't do that. There are humans out there."

- I get the sense that Mr. Nishio is acquiring a "human emulator" where he can think about how people who are told such things would feel.
    - I've been in the business for 20 years.
    - I feel like it's a skill acquired through learning and not something I have in the raw.

[[Sales heal all.]]
- I don't think "[[sales heal all]]" is true.
- Crisis when sales are short.
- Sales don't heal everything, but rather [[big business disease]] is created by steady sales.

[[Emulator of culture]]

- [[Cybozu Newcomer Ruins VP's SNS Profile]]
- It's a cultural understanding that makes me think I won't be fired or made to stay after doing this.
    - You are a newcomer, but you have an amazing level of understanding.
    - Conversely, a solid understanding is a prerequisite for employment?
- Not being at social risk [[psychological safety]].
    - [[Shared Beliefs]]

I learned at MOT that there is more than one correctness.
- This may be a requirement for having multiple emulators
- Even if the results don't match your natural calculations, it doesn't mean "I'm right, they're wrong".
- Can have an emulator of the opponent's thoughts
