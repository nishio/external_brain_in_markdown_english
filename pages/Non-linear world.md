I thought it was about the nonlinear world, but it was about [[phenomenology]] to change from an object-centered viewpoint [[of physics]] to a phenomenon-centered viewpoint.
- > The world is full of nonlinear phenomena. How do we find laws and understand the world? This book explains [[conceptual analysis]] as the basis of description, [[phenomenology]] as the framework of understanding, [[kurikomi]] as the method of understanding, and [[modelling (e.g. a system, etc.)]] as the final step in understanding phenomena, finally leading to the search for complex phenomena for clear description and understanding of the world.

    - The kind of thing that's common in math books, where you read it before you understand it and you don't realize it's written correctly.
