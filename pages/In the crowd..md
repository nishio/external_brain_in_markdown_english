Philosopher [[Byung-Chul Han]] also criticizes that communication in the digital age has lost its true public nature and has fallen into "[[an]] uprising of the crowd. In his book, "In the Swarm," he argues that the seemingly enormous voice of the Internet masses is transient and unable to generate unified will or sustained power. The online "swarm" does not have the same [[purposeful will-formation]] as the traditional public sphere, but only instantaneous reactions ("schutzstorms") that generate personal attacks and fail to change the power structure. In other words, the harsh view is that the Internet is no longer a platform for meaningful dialogue, let alone consensus building, and that what emerges is nothing more than pseudo-noise, or pseudo-consensus. Han's point is somewhat pessimistic, but at least it illustrates the danger that the traditional deliberative democratic process does not work in the digital space, and that shortcuts such as the number of "likes" and trends are taken as indicators that represent public opinion. There, [[quantified support]] is misinterpreted as instant consensus, which is an illusion if it is not backed by deep deliberation and [[mutual understanding]].
