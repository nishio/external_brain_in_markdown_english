title: "Proposal to make unexplored junior a two-term system"

> [shoya140](https://twitter.com/shoya140/status/1519315705388220416): The dilemma is that "I want to [[support proposal capabilities]] such as commenting on proposals before they are submitted," but "proposals I commented on cannot be evaluated fairly. If we divide the proposals into "Unexplored Junior Red/Green", we may be able to support each other without getting involved in the selection process...?
- relevance
        - [[Need support for proposal capacity.]]
        - [[Mentors who have reviewed proposals in advance cannot be involved in the review process.]]

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1519346789450907648): if we stagger it by half a year [[two-term system]], we can support the proposal without worrying about review. Three-phase AC is also acceptable.

> [shoya140](https://twitter.com/shoya140/status/1519355784819322880): I would like to think about what would happen if we had a two term system. I was also thinking of splitting the mentors into two groups only at the time of recruitment, so that applicants can get comments instead of waiving adoption from one of them.
