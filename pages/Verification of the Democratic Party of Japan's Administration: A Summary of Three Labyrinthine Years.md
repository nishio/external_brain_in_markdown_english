title: "Verification of the Democratic Party of Japan's Administration: A Summary of Three Labyrinthine Years"
---

Report released by the LDP in the House of Councillors in 2012.
[We must never again allow the birth of a "pariah Democratic Party of Japan" administration! Liberal Democratic Party](https://www.jimin.jp/news/policy/129533.html)
- [PDF](https://www.jimin.jp/policy/policy_topics/pdf/067_01.pdf)

I saw it spread on social media before the 2024 House of Representatives election.
It was interesting stuff.
The tone of the language is so strong that when I saw the PDF first, I doubted that it was really from the LDP.

[[Liberal Democratic Party]] / [[Democratic Party of Japan]]
