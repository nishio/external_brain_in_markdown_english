>  Because "[[adult society]]" didn't originally value [[effort]]. The majority of people would have said, "Well, you couldn't get the results you wanted, so it's OK," in their resentment toward those who tried but couldn't get the results they wanted.

>  I wonder if [[Generative AI]] has visualized the fact that there were many people who "were actually praisers of effort, but were kicking effort to the curb because they happened to be on the side that could produce results".

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1770958014172037201) I don't think it "was an effort-rewarding system"? If you really value effort, you would do [[effort to acquire something that will increase in value in the future]]. Instead, you are "unhappy about [[the loss of value of what you already have]], but dissatisfied because you can't find a way around it".
