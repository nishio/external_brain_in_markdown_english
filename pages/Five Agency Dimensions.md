Summary (published 2025-09-10)
Jigsaw (an incubator within Google) has organized how people's "agency" can be strengthened in the age of AI, based on a joint ethnographic study with Gemic (60 people in the US, Germany, and Singapore, totaling over 100 hours). In conclusion, we suggest that special emphasis should be placed on "structural agency." ([Medium](https://medium.com/jigsaw/a-new-perspective-on-human-agency-for-the-ai-era-cd785faab026))

Five Agency Dimensions
- Instrumental: the power to accomplish tasks and improve efficiency (e.g., drafting emails floats time). ([Medium](https://medium.com/jigsaw/a-new-perspective-on-human-agency-for-the-ai-era-cd785faab026))
- Cognitive: the ability to organize one's thoughts and be confident in one's judgments (discussions with AI structure one's thinking). ([Medium](https://medium.com/jigsaw/a-new-perspective-on-human-agency-for-the-ai-era-cd785faab026))
- Affective (Affective): ability to verbalize and regulate emotions such as anxiety (contributes to self-stabilization during physical anxiety). ([Medium](https://medium.com/jigsaw/a-new-perspective-on-human-agency-for-the-ai-era-cd785faab026))
- Relational: the power of relationship and community participation with others (participating in interactions with friends in generated images). ([Medium](https://medium.com/jigsaw/a-new-perspective-on-human-agency-for-the-ai-era-cd785faab026))
- Structural: The ability to "work with and shape" institutions, norms, and decision-making (e.g., understanding the health care system, improving negotiation skills). ([Medium](https://medium.com/jigsaw/a-new-perspective-on-human-agency-for-the-ai-era-cd785faab026))
The industry tends to focus on instrumental enhancements, but it is the structural agency enhancements that are important and positioned as being compatible with Jigsaw's mission. ([Medium](https://medium.com/jigsaw/a-new-perspective-on-human-agency-for-the-ai-era-cd785faab026))

Key Insights
- AI can be strengthened or weakened: the same email assistance, when used well, increased free time, while others wasted time coordinating prompts. ([Medium](https://medium.com/jigsaw/a-new-perspective-on-human-agency-for-the-ai-era-cd785faab026))
- Individual and social context works: those with learning support and institutional boosts can get away with instrumental boosts, but those with less support tend to expect "all 5 dimensions" from AI. ([Medium](https://medium.com/jigsaw/a-new-perspective-on-human-agency-for-the-ai-era-cd785faab026))
- "[[Agency Gap]]" at risk of widening: AI comes on top of a backdrop of political mistrust, low participation confidence, low economic mobility, and a lack of a sense of technology control, which can both fill and widen the gap. ([Medium](https://medium.com/jigsaw/a-new-perspective-on-human-agency-for-the-ai-era-cd785faab026))

Suggestions and future issues
1. design AI that works for structural agency (UI/features that help understand institutions, negotiate, and engage in decision making). ([Medium](https://medium.com/jigsaw/a-new-perspective-on-human-agency-for-the-ai-era-cd785faab026))
- Establish a method to measure agency (how to quantify "increased agency" during dialogue is still an open question). ([Medium](https://medium.com/jigsaw/a-new-perspective-on-human-agency-for-the-ai-era-cd785faab026))
3. continue and open sociotechnical (sociotechnical) research (intention to publish research and open source technology in the near future). ([Medium](https://medium.com/jigsaw/a-new-perspective-on-human-agency-for-the-ai-era-cd785faab026))

What's new (practical perspective)
- The framework suggests that the focus should shift from "AI that increases what it can do" to AI that directly increases "the ability to influence institutional and collective decision-making.
- Consistent with the previously reported contexts of "Reimagining Polling" and "National Dialogue ([[We The People]])," it can be used as a core concept in the flow of visualizing collective voices, forming intentions, and connecting to institutions. ([Medium](https://medium.com/jigsaw/a-new-perspective-on-human-agency-for-the-ai-era-cd785faab026))

Suggestion for Mr. Nishio (short)
- In the design of workshops and public hearing AIs, reexamine the question design, UI, and feedback lines based on "structural agency" criteria (e.g., presenting "next negotiation actions" in administrative procedures, leading to a consensus-building hub).
- Add "sustained self-efficacy" and "increased institutional and group outreach behavior" to the evaluation indicators (moving away from mere short-time KPIs).
If necessary, create a **lightweight survey (10-question version that can be compared before and after)** that indexes these 5 dimensions.
