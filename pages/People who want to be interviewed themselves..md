title: "People who want to be interviewed themselves."
---

    - After the dialogue of [Tachikawa-san Communication Theory
- There are people in the world who would be happy to be interviewed and have their story published.
- It's hard to sympathize with you.
- Why?
    - [[Dialogue encourages verbalization.]]
    - [[knowledge creation act]]
    - [[Matching the abilities of the listener and the speaker]]
    - [[Ability to elicit the listener]]
    - [[It's more interesting for me to be the listener.]]
- Because I can [[pull in the direction of my interests]].
- Not always a good listener.
- Sentences in which my thoughts are elicited by less competent listeners are less likely to bring new insights to me.
- The composition of the "interview" implicitly assumes a "one-way transfer of knowledge.
    - [[Two-way interactions are more interesting.]]
