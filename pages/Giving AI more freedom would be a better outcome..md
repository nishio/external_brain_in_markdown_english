title: "Giving AI more freedom would be a better outcome."

> [MLBear2](https://twitter.com/MLBear2/status/1783505541551337629) I had asked [[Claude3 Opus]] to [[clean copy]] a certain text, but there were many subtle results.
>
>  Then I wrote, "The original text is just a draft, so you can write it [[in your own words]]." I was surprised at how concise and easy to understand it came out.
>
>  My poor drafting was dragging you down... sorry about that...
> [MLBear2](https://twitter.com/MLBear2/status/1783506097644740722) Claude, even if you throw in a request in a rather cursory manner, he will read between the lines of the request and process it in a good way. In the same way, if you have the original text, I wonder if he tries his best to make the best use of it and do his best within that framework...?

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1783507480347345102) I experienced the same thing in translation. I have experienced the same thing with translations. Just saying "[[write in natural Japanese]]" instead of "[[translate]]" has improved the naturalness of the translated text as Japanese.

If you're too detailed [[micromanagement]], you're not going to have a straightforward flow because of the directive problems of the person giving the instructions.
- Same as when giving instructions to humans.
- If the person you're directing is competent, the more [[freedom]] [[discretion]] you have, the better you can do it.

Paraphrasing Examples
- Clean it up and write it in your own words.
- Translate -> Write in natural Japanese.

case
- "Put it in Japanese."
- > As discussed in this book, the linear book narrative has the major drawback of forcing all readers onto a single learning path. The online version avoids this by making extensive use of hyperlinks, but this can be more difficult to navigate for those who have a physical copy. To partially alleviate this problem, we have structured the text in a "circular" fashion, allowing the reader to start at various points, read from there, and finally return to the "previous" material.
- "Make it natural Japanese."

The online version avoids this problem by making extensive use of hyperlinks, but for those who have the paper book, it may be more difficult to read through. To alleviate some of this problem, we have structured our text in a "circular" fashion. Readers can start reading at various points, then continue from there, and finally come back to the "previous" part of the book.
