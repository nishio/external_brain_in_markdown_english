[[Satoshi Nakajima]]

00:00 Special Talk: Takahiro Yasuno & Satoshi Nakajima
- It is unusual that neither PCs nor iPads are allowed in the Diet. Is there a chance for an eyeglass-shaped XR?
- I want to update my Q&A with real-time AI references
- Culture shock at the "digital backwardness of the Diet."

08:57 Ambition of "[[Team Mirai]]".
- Objective: Implement a technology-based democracy by revamping the 300-400 year old voting model.
- Strategy: Station a 10-member elite engineering unit in Nagatacho → Publish all results in OSS.
- Effect: "Real 100 person" development capacity was gained by involving the outside community.

14:33 The era is [[small team]].
- AI x development support tools will increase productivity per worker by 3 to 4 times.
- [[Devin]]/Cursor and other examples of companies with 10-20 employees and enterprise values in excess of 300 billion yen continue to emerge.
- Nakajima "CEO and code-writer" almost completed "MarumoCast" which replaces PowerPoint + Final Cut entirely with native AI in one month.

18:39 Is a society coming in which no one will be left behind?
- AI is a technology that also lowers the hurdles for the "digitally weak.
- ChatGPT = Common interface of natural language.
- Example of automated driving: "just talking about where you're going" enables travel without the need for a driver's license.

23:07 What is "[[digital democracy]]"?
- The amount of information in the election is 2-3 bits per year: it does not fully convey the intention.
        - [[Elections are slow communications, sending 5 bits every four years.]]
- solution
    - The full bill generation process is available on GitHub (commit logs are the minutes of the meeting).
    - Anyone can submit PR...Automatic PR creation with "chat UI with AI" for inexperienced programmers.
    - A Taiwanese Example (vTaiwan/JOIN)--High school girls propose law reform.

28:58 How to Cure the Democracy Bug
- Political structure closed to vested interests ≈ "local optimums".
- A breakthrough: "outsiders" change the game with startup logic.
- Example: "Broad listening" advocated in the Tokyo gubernatorial election spread to major political parties within a year.
    - [[Broad Listening Becomes Standard Strategy in One Year]].

Tools published (all OSS)
- Manifesto that can talk (AI assisted PR)
        - [[initiative taken by the government in the formulation of a policy or bill (rather than by bureaucrats) to promote good governance]]
- AI Fact Checker
- Real-time Political Funding Disclosure Dashboard

33:43 The True Meaning of the "1% Revolution"
- National party requirements = 1.2 million votes (about 1% of the electorate).
- The "turn the tide without taking the majority" - even with a minimal number of seats in the House of Representatives, the party can "force" other parties to adopt the technology.

36:27 Reasons for the decision to challenge national politics
- 2023 After the Tokyo gubernatorial election, consider all options → Formation of a new party with the most leverage.
- Final decisions are made by both the right brain (jumps in ideas) x left brain (logical elimination).

Overall Summary & Insights
- Congress is the best legacy system.
- Areas that can be cloud-enabled at once with "transparent Git operations" + "AI orchestration" are still untapped.
- "10 People x AI" model works well in the public sector
- OSS + Scales with the community, so it can reverse the closed nature of the parliament.
- 1.2 million votes is actually a low hurdle.
- A simple KPI was presented: "1% to promote the shift to APIs in industry and government in one fell swoop.
