*1262104861* Things I wish I had at the camp and things I wish I hadn't.
Thank goodness there was a **.
- Garbage bag 45L
- packing tape
- A lot of disposable chopsticks

Wish I had **.
- Magic marker (I put a garbage bag on my desk for sorting, but I wanted to write what to put in it)
- Measuring cup (without it, you can't measure rice!)
- Knee cover (cold)
