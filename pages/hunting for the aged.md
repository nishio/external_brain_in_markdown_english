1. introduction
Japan has the fastest aging population in the world: 29.3 % of the total population will be 65 or older by 2024, while the working-age population (15-64) will be less than 60%.

The combination of increasing pension and healthcare burdens and stagnant wages for the younger generation has created the soil in which the short-circuit picture of "elderly = cost" can easily spread online.

2. what is the "Mere Old Man Hunting"?
Underlining the term "[[hunting for]] old men" (assault and extortion targeting middle-aged men), which became a popular term in the late 1990s, in recent years the term "hunting for the elderly" has been used to refer to robbery and extortion targeting [[elderly people living alone]], who are difficult to resist. Media reports began using the term sporadically around 2018.

4. recent trends (2024-2025)

Although these are only individual cases, some experts see them as signs of an increase in direct acts of violence in addition to the traditional "special fraud.

Comparative Perspectives for International Readers
- Although there have been demonstrations in Europe over pension reform, crimes that physically target the elderly are still limited.
- Although Japan has strict gun control and the fatality rate is relatively low, it is worth noting that "bare-knuckle" tactics such as beatings, knives, and pushing down are used.

Measures and Prospects
- Community reconnection: municipalities establish mixed-generational exchange centers to restore feelings of reciprocity.
- Curb online hatred: work with platforms to slow the spread of discriminatory hashtags.
- Redesign of livelihood security: We will present a financial design that shifts the pension and medical care systems from a "zero-sum" approach to a "generational collaboration" approach.
- Inclusion of young people: policy intervention in poverty and educational disparity to contain criminal incentives.

8. summary
The "Mere Old Man Hunting" has not yet become a statistically significant wave. However, a "quiet critical point" where demographics, economic environment, and online discourse converge is near. If we fail to restore trust between generations, the dots may spread to lines, and lines may spread to planes.
