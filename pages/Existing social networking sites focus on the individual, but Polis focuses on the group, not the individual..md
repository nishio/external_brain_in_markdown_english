[[Existing SNSs]] focus on the individual, but Polis focuses on the group, not the individual.
- Then "those who want personal attention" would avoid using Polis
- Because their activities there do not satisfy their need for attention.
- There are people who find value in a place where people like that don't congregate.
    - [[people shouting for attention at train stations and on the street]] and try to avoid them.
