    - > For example, surprisingly, Tokyo's past long-term strategies did not include a category for tourism. This time, a large number of tourism-related opinions were gathered in the adjacent area of "Culture & Entertainment," including suggestions for enhancing Tokyo's appeal and concerns about insufficient infrastructure investment. As a result, a new category was created.

> In order to fully leverage the benefits of digital technology to improve services for Tokyo residents, it is essential to take DX in Tokyo Metropolitan Government to the next stage. We will formulate a strategy for the widespread use of AI, while listening to cutting-edge knowledge at the newly established expert panel, and create tools to streamline operations with AI generated by GovTech Tokyo's technological capabilities, as well as introduce "broad listening," a method to visualize diverse opinions, to various aspects of metropolitan government administration. We would also like to introduce "broad listening," a method of visualizing diverse opinions, to various aspects of metropolitan government. The touchstone of this effort is "Thin Tokyo 2050 (tentative name)," a vision for the 2050s, which will reflect the opinions of a broad range of Tokyo residents by utilizing broad listening under the advice of AI expert Takahiro Yasuno.
