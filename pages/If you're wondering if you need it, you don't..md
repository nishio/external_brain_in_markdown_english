Those who wonder if it is necessary do not need it. Those who actually need it are convinced that it is necessary and need no explanation as to why. (Nishio Translation)

A term that came up in a discussion about [[metaclass]] in [[Python]] and was later referred to as a saying

- [[Not necessary.]]
- [[necessary]]
