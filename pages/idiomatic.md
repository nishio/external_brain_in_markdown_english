idiomatic
- > I have attached your Preface, which I edited. Please look at it and tell me if this is the way you would like me to continue. By making the language more idiomatic, I will also be able to pick up other issues. Please note that this is just a first edit.

If you looks something interesting but the auto-translated English is not good enough to understand it, feel free to let me know at [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en). I'm very happy to spread my thought to non-Japanese readers.
