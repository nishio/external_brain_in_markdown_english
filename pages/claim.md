claim
- I used to think, "Credits? Something to do with debt, right?" I used to think
- I wasn't familiar with the term "Claims Act" and wondered why you recommended the [[Starting Line Claims Act]], but I see, the Claims Act is indeed recommended.
- Explanation of default values to be used if not specified in the contract, like default arguments in a library.
    - An optional provision in civil law is, in essence, a default value
    - It can be overridden by an agreement between the parties.
    - Claims may be overridden by agreement between the parties by [the principle of freedom of contract

Classification of rights
- right
    - (legal) real rights
        - A person's direct control over "things"
        - Example: Ownership
        - My ownership over "my phone" means that I can claim "this is mine" to everyone else.
        - It is a very strong right and cannot be created without permission.
            - (doctrine of) the legal right to own property
    - claim
        - The right of a specific person to claim certain acts, etc., against a specific person.
        - Four causes of occurrence
            - contract
            - tort
            - And then there's office management and unjust enrichment.
        - Weak rights because they are only effective between the parties
            - Can only affect (oppose) third parties that are not between the parties when the requirements are met.
            - [Countervailing requirement - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%AF%BE%E6%8A%97%E8%A6%81%E4%BB%B6)
            - For example, suppose Mr. A, the owner of the patent, made a contract with Mr. B saying "You can use my patent" (a non-exclusive license), and then Mr. A's company was about to go bankrupt and he sold the patent right to Mr. C. Mr. C can claim against Mr. B, "Hey, don't use my patent without my permission. Mr. B may argue, "Well, Mr. A said you can use it," but Mr. C says, "I don't know about that," because the contract is only between the parties.
            - This is too pitiful, so the patent law has been patched.
            - >  (Countervailing power of non-exclusive license)
            - > Article 99 A non-exclusive license shall also be effective against any person who has acquired the patent right or exclusive license or an exclusive license to the patent right after its accrual.
        - They can make it on their own.
            - principle of freedom of contract
            - free creation of claims
