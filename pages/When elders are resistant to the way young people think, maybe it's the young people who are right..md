When elders are resistant to the way young people think, it may be the young people who are right
- Often the elders are more outspoken and the statement is often made, "I'm troubled by the idea that young people think X
- This phenomenon is nothing more than "one person's A and another person's B have different [[world views]]" from a bird's eye view.
- The elders basically die first, which leaves B in the long run.

I read it again after a while and thought
- It's not "[[right]]" or incorrect.
- One person A and another person B have different worldviews, and A dies first, so B's worldview remains.

- [[Long-term perspective]]
