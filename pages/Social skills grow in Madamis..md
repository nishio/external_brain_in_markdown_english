title: "Social skills grow in Madamis."
---

- T: I'm catching a glimpse of N's [[sociality]].

- N: [[Madamis (Japanese brand of haloperidol)]] ([[Murder Mysteries]]) I've been doing it for about 6 months now? It's possible my social skills are growing fast.

- T: That's interesting! Because [[you're]] playing someone you're not?

- N: Because [[guess what's inside others]] is usually off but only on during madamis?
    - Related: [[Air reading function is normally off...]].

- T: Is Madamis effective as a training to turn that switch on...!
    - This is about the most interesting fact of the year for me personally.
    - A realization that Madamis' play might be useful for something. The faint ones that seem to disappear if you don't highlight them...
    - I'm not good at reading the air" - "Then do madamis" might be a possibility...

- N: How is it from your point of view, T? Are you growing up?

- T: That's right, I do.

- N: Which areas did you feel you have grown in?

- T: The apparent increase in references such as "I heard that Fatty did that.
    - If you're doing madamis, it's probably something you do naturally as a game, but maybe it's good training for those who don't usually do it.

    - [[Air-reading is not a zero-factor.]]
    - [[Air reading function is normally off.]]

It may also be important to [[play someone you're not]].
- Not by itself, but by the experience of "playing someone who is not you" in a wide variety of ways to get food for thought?
- The typification of a character's thinking is sometimes referred to as "[[meta-reasoning]]" or other images in the Madamisian sense.
    - Typically, there is A "someone carrying out a murder and trying to cover it up" and B "someone trying to find the killer".
    - But there are also C "people who think they carried out the murder but didn't actually kill the person", D "people who are not aware that they carried out the murder but directly caused the death", E "people who are not the murderer but are trying to defend the murderer", and F "people who are trying to defend the murderer but the other person is not the murderer
    - G. There are "people who are not interested in identifying the culprit, but have other goals.
    - G is a guess of intent.
        - Is "trying to protect the culprit" also an inference of intent?
    - As I was writing C-F, I kept coming up with more and more, but this is [[false belief issue]].
