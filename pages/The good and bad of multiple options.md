title: "The good and bad of multiple options"
---

There are multiple options A and B.
Often the debate is "which option is better".

If A is definitely better than B, then no one would choose B. Option B would disappear and there would be no room for debate.
The existence of choice B means that good or bad is uncertain. For example, good or bad depends on the circumstances, or there is uncertainty about the outcome of the choice.

Yet the reason why it is repeatedly discussed is because those who chose Option A think [[anxiety]] about that choice and insist that "choosing Option A is right" or are happy to read articles that insist so.
