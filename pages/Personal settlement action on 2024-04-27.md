Personal settlement action on 2024-04-27

I was writing about [[Buy Me a Coffee]] and realized I hadn't written about Apple Pay when I wrote "easy with Apple Pay," so I wrote

As of 2024-04-27 [[Lawson.]] purchases paid for with [[Apple Pay]] on Apple Watch or iPhone
- I also have a [[Ponta card]] registered.
    - I originally started it to give my wife points for things I bought.
    - When the physical card was abolished? My wife couldn't get the app to work, so it became my loyalty card.
        - Maybe the physical card and app were not designed to be used by others to share points.
        - (That's right, it would mess up user tracking.)
- 100% of purchases [[self-service cash register]].

Other Convenience Stores
    - [[Suica in iPhone]], so you can use it anywhere in major cities.
    - Until I did this, I was 100% "carry my wallet when I go out."
    - At this point in time, I was like, "I forgot my wallet, I need to take the train, and I don't have Suica," so I tried to borrow some money and was like, "You don't have Suica in your iPhone?" And it turned out to be.

I also include [[LINE Pay]] and [[PayPay]].
- Difficult to find various means of remittance.
    - Read the QR code on the other person's phone, read the printed QR code, or open the URL sent to the chat.
    - I don't think the mental model is formed here yet.


[[Worldcoin]]
- I got about 60,000 in [[UBI]].
- I guess in some countries you can pay directly with this app (it has the ability to read QR codes).
