title: "Duplication bans will fail."

- I'd say "[[May be duplicated]]", or rather, "If we make it a rule that says "no duplicates allowed", the cost of adding new ones will go up and up and up and up, and soon we'll go broke, so it's not a good idea to make such a rule."
        - [[duplication]] か・・？と思いつつ とにかく書き始めると意外と違う内容になることとかもありそう<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Sometimes when I write on a page that already exists, I get pulled into the original content in a strange way.
        - oh, yes!<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - It's a waste of a potential new sprout to be crushed by seeing existing similarities.
            - So I often write down my current brain first and then link to it.
            - I wrote today [[People who feel guilty about not]] is quite similar to [[Looking for reasons not to]], but still there are many differences
