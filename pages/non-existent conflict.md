title: "non-existent conflict"
---

from [/villagepump/existent nonexistent type conflict](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/existent nonexistent type conflict).
I found a common pattern and gave it a name.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

Case 1
- [/villagepump/ isn't that Japanese enough? #62748c677838e300007e2688](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/ isn't that Japanese enough? #62748c677838e300007e2688)
>  [[factor]] : Factors
> When I use the word "factor", I recognize it as a word strongly associated with refactoring, so when it is rewritten as "factor", that link is severed and I feel uncomfortable.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
I don't associate refactoring with the >factor.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/増井俊之/icon' alt='/villagepump/増井俊之.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/Mijinko_SD/icon' alt='/villagepump/Mijinko_SD.icon' height="19.5"/>
> [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/refactor](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/refactor)
> >re- +‎ factor
> It may be difficult to understand when written in katakana, but the stem is "factor" and "ing" is added after it.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
> I've never seen the word factor used to mean anything other than element or factor.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/増井俊之/icon' alt='/villagepump/増井俊之.icon' height="19.5"/>
> I have never seen the word refactor (in English or Japanese)<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/増井俊之/icon' alt='/villagepump/増井俊之.icon' height="19.5"/>

Case 2
> TV Drama.[[Koumon Mito]] で「殺陣の前にさっさと印籠を出して控えさせればよいのでは？」というようなことがよく聞かれる。<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/mgn901/icon' alt='/villagepump/mgn901.icon' height="19.5"/>
> No, I don't think there are many people who would ask such a question nowadays.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/suto3/icon' alt='/villagepump/suto3.icon' height="19.5"/>
> I'm asked when I mention Mito Komon as a topic.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/mgn901/icon' alt='/villagepump/mgn901.icon' height="19.5"/>
>  Is there a special environment around <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/mgn901/icon' alt='/villagepump/mgn901.icon' height="19.5"/>?
> I think the "well" is ambiguous, so there's a difference of opinion, but if "there are people who listen," then it's an observed fact.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

common pattern
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/a3e3e84d386ed573961bf9155cf1745a/thumb/1000)
- Mr. A sees that X is included in his observation range and says "X exists".
- Mr. B says "X does not exist" because his observation range does not include X
consideration
- This has nothing to do with the overall size of each [[Observation range]] (so it is best to avoid using the expression "[[Narrow observation range]]").
    - Reverse pattern of "[Learn from those with little knowledge.
- If both parties express "X exists/not exists in my observation range" without omission, then [[Both claims can be True.]].
    - but [[Humans are often short on words.]]

- [[The bug that confuses the subjective with the objective.]]
#Discussion Patterns
- [[A series of pictures of two people saying different things]]
