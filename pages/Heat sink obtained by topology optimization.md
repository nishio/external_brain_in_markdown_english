[[Heat sink]] obtained by [[Topology Optimization]].
> [yajikenotter](https://twitter.com/yajikenotter/status/1776096949403541922/photo/1) Heat sink obtained by topology optimization with [[overhang]] and [[minimum dimension constraints]] imposed. The result is beautifully finished since no support material is needed.
