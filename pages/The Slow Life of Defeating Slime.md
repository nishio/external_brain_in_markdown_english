title: "The Slow Life of Defeating Slime"

> [kumagi](https://twitter.com/kumagi/status/1783513497994735800) I don't lie about my love of programming, but I don't think it's the right career path for me. I'm [[adapting]] to the [[slow life]] where everyone praises me for defeating [[slime]] around the castle, I get money, and slimes spring up endlessly, but all I need for [[promotion]] is to defeat [[dragons]] and bring back Princess Laura.

> [kumagi](https://twitter.com/kumagi/status/1783519403658891591) The point of the problem is not that there is not enough [[strength]] to slay the dragon, but rather that the stronger a person is and the more he likes to fight, the more he optimizes for [[the immediate benefit]]. The point is not that they don't have the [[strength]] to slay the dragon, but rather that the stronger and more battle-hungry they are, the less likely they are to take the [[shortest route]] to [[career advancement]].
    - [[Premature optimization]]
    - [[The fastest course is not the fastest]]
