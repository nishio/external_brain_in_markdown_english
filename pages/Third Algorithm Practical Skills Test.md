title: "Third Algorithm Practical Skills Test"
---

First time I tried [[Algorithm Practical Skill Test]].
AC'd A~K.

[[atcoder]] [3rd Algorithm Practical Skills Test - AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/contests/past202005-open) [[PAST3]] [[PAST202005]]

- [[PAST3D]]
- [[PAST3E]]
- [[PAST3F]]
- [[PAST3G]]
- [[PAST3H]]
- [[PAST3I]]
- [[PAST3J]]
- [[PAST3K]]

At this point, the remaining time was running low, so we called it a day.
The result was 76 points, intermediate level. 80 points to advanced level, so I guess I needed to solve one more question.
