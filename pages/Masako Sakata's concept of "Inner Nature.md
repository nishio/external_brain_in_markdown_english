Masako Sakata's concept of "Inner Nature
[on Masako Sakata's concept of "inner nature" to connect soil environment and biodiversity](https://etupirka.studio.site/blog/sakata_commons)
> Instead of doing it ourselves, we are nowadays "getting the government to do it" for everything. In the past, public was about us. Now they think it is the government.

> Nature is not suited for [[private ownership]].

> We can't allow even trees to come into our land. Something like that is happening. People are creating boundaries on their own, and nature has nothing to do with it. It is impossible to draw a boundary line forcibly.

> When picking taranome, you can pick the first bud, but if you pick the second bud, it will not appear the next year... I am not interested in the "cod" plant because I want to eat it, and I don't have the knowledge of how it lives. You have to have the knowledge of "how the cod plant lives" and the interest of "because I want to eat it" in one set to understand.

> As soon as people stop drinking the river water, they throw garbage into the river with impunity. In other words, when we were drinking river water, we could not throw garbage into the river as a commons. When water comes out of a closed space inside a house by turning on the tap, we lose the imagination of what is going on beyond the tap. Then the river and the water supply are not connected, so we can litter the river with impunity no matter where we are.

> "If you create a commons where there is no inner nature, [[the tragedy of the commons]] will happen.

> Unless you have a relationship with nature, there is no way that "[[inner nature]]" can be born.

> How capitalism has dismantled the commons
>  Enclosures were started by English lords in the 15th century (~17th century).

> The dismantling of the Japanese commons began with the dismantling of the [[chinju no mori]].
> Minakata Kumagusu] Desperately Resists
> Various types of common lands, forests, and common lands are broken up in the form of private ownership. Or they become the property of the state, and people are not allowed to enter them or take them without permission.

> The means of production by nature are all taken away from them, and they enter the cities as the proletariat.

>  Knowledge is inherently commons-like in nature.

> Increasing capital has become labor, but this is unlimited.
    - [[know one has enough]]
> I will work for capital, not to satisfy my own needs or the needs of others.

> We've become so disconnected from nature that we internalize capitalism.

> [[Toyooka City, Hyogo Prefecture]], [[storks]] are back. At first, opposition prevailed.


> Insane people who are constantly complaining about nature. Know that all your misery stems from yourselves.
>  Jean-Jacques [[Rousseau.]] "Confessions"

> The vulnerability of urban people makes them say, "I want to be a part of this group! But I'll be called a [[yosomono]]..." Because you are a yosomono. But because I am an outsider, I am allowed to say so. This is very important. After all, the local people have had their commons dismantled. You can be confident that what you are doing now is more important.
