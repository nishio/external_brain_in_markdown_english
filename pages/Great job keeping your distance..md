title: "Great job keeping your distance."
---

> I have been thinking since I was a little girl that it would be nice to have a value like "You are great at keeping a good [[distance]] with your friends" instead of just "You are great at making lots of [[friends]]". I've been thinking about this since I was a little girl.
>  I wonder why education teaches "[[everyone gets along]]" when that is more important in some societies.
>  The importance of [[keep one's distance]] to [[protect "me"]].
>  I started the [[School of Destruction]] to create a place where people can learn how to [[let go of]] what is already there and how to successfully destroy relationships.
