- 1) It's a waste of time to have prototypes but no images or videos.
- (2) Overuse of bold and text color is a waste of time.
- (iii) No priorities are attached, which is a waste of time.
- 4) "oo is great! So xx is great too!" is a waste!
- (5) It would be a waste if some of the use cases are unclear.
- (6) It's a waste of time to have no sample code even though it's a proposal for a system system.
- (vii) It's a waste of a proposal that emphasizes low prices, but without concrete figures.
- (8) I haven't looked into similar services and it's a waste of time.
- (ix) "How do you make it happen?" part is abstract and a waste of time.

- [Adoption is, frankly, luck.
