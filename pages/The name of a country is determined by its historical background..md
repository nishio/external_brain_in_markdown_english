The name of the country is determined by [historical background
    - [[foundation]] in [[historical truth]] is incompatible with [corroborative explanation
    - Not compatible with [[mathematics]], which is also incompatible with the evidential theory.
    - It is not determined by rational thinking, but as a result of a person's actions
- The sun is not being produced from Japan.
- America is not a country ruled by Amerigo Vespucci.
- [[Quadratic Lands]], the country-ish name from which "Quadratic" derives, is no longer mathematically related to the "quadratic function", which is not strange!
    - One of the usual "historical truth development processes"
    - The same goes for calling yourself "Japan, the Land of the Rising Sun," even though you don't make the sun.
