title: "How to Create Social Relationship Capital"
---

    - In my inaugural address to the board of directors of [[unexplored association]], I wrote
    - > "Gathering is the first step, staying together is progress, working together is success," says Ford. Of course it is important to gather people at events, but it should not be a one-off event where people have fun for a day and that is the end of it. There needs to be a place where the gathered people "stay together". We believe it is important to create such a place both physically and electronically.

- One way to bring people in is to say, "I have a specific project that sounds fun, and I'm going to participate in it."
    - Creating [[specific fun projects]]" requires "[[conceptual ability to create something out of nothing]]" that cannot be outsourced to part-time workers, etc.

- I wonder if the driving force is "the desire to realize a system that I think would be good to have" or something like that.
    - When a graduate wants to do something and it involves more than one graduate, that in itself is an opportunity for [[cooperation]] to create social relational capital among graduates
    - The "system I think would be good to have" I want to create is a feedback loop in which intangible capital accumulates with unexplored foundations as its core, and the gravitational pull of that capital attracts more capital.
    - So you're inclined to support a project that involves multiple alumni because it contributes to it.
