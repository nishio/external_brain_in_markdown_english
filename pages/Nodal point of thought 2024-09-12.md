- [[The dilemma of acquiring knowledge from outside the company]]
- [[There are two channels for information to flow into the organization]]

- [[Broad Listening "That Figure" Study Group]], I've drawn a picture of [[multiple organizations and broad listening]] for the first time, and I think something is going to come out of it.

Company's internal resources
- I don't know if this is relevant to this story, but it reminded me of a topic I tried to write about before but never got around to it.
- That "the company has internal resources."
- People who have never belonged to a company have never observed
- Might it take a while to understand if you belong?
- By having some internal resources, a company can maintain a competitive advantage and survive because it can produce more efficiently than with an unspecified division of labor in the marketplace.
    - [[Resource in Membrane]]

Sometimes I'm happy to be the hub of information and sometimes I'm not.
- gather information
- Paying more for communication costs
        - [[Two types of notifications: "may see" and "want to see."]]
    - When capacity overflows, well, first of all, "I can see it" is discarded.
    - Next, reactions to "see me" notifications are cost-saving.
        - Reacting with Slack stamps is an example of such an operation.

Both are their own information hubs.
Maybe we should draw a distinction between IN and OUT.

I only painted this IN.

and when the cost of the output is 10, it is easier to put it out in the open field at 10 and transfer it at 1 to each (2) than to do it in two places and get 20 (1)

- and you wrote it as if public disclosure was rational, but that logic doesn't make sense.

- A separate reason not to do this is needed.
    - for example
        - If the 10 output is in a format that is difficult to transfer, such as audio, it cannot be transferred to B later.
        - If the output in A is treated as an internal document, etc., it cannot be transferred to B/there is a cost of obtaining permission when doing so.
        - (2) and (3) have the same written costs, but there are unanticipated returns from keeping the information in the public forum.
    - for example
            - At the time of [[KJ Method Study Session @ Loftwork]], I asked in advance if I could make the materials public.
            - I asked in advance if I could put the manuscript in Scrapbox during [[ChatGPT Articles @ Information Processing]].
        - Regarding the use of TTTC for internal use, I'm planning to write about that know-how in a public forum.

This is just a combination of [[The dilemma of acquiring knowledge from outside the company]] and [There are two channels for information to flow into the organization
- We should take advantage of the realization in [[Multiple Organizations and Broad Listening]] that "maybe we should draw a distinction between IN and OUT".
- Abstracting and distributing" is a way to get something IN and OUT without permission.
- I'm rather explicit in asking, "Can I publish this?" or "How about this way of writing?
    - [I've cut some of what I've written and published it.
