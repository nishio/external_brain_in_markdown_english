<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3/icon' alt='o3.icon' height="19.5"/>In his book "The Ghost in the Machine" (1967), Arthur Koestler coined the term holon to express the view that "every being is both a whole and a part of a greater whole. The Greek word holos (holon) is a word that is used in the Machine (1967). The term was coined by combining the Greek word holos (whole) and the suffix -on (part), which indicates a subatomic particle.

The Three Core of Holon
- Duality (Janus Principle)
    - Every holon has two opposing orientations at the same time: self-assertion = self-preservation and integration = cooperation.
    - The tension between independence and dependency creates system stability and evolution.
- [[holarchy]] ([[holarchy]])
    - An "open hierarchy" of nested holons
    - Multi-layered structure of atoms, molecules, cells, organs, individuals, society...
- [[Self-regulating open system]] (SOHO)
    - At each tier, holons use feedback to self-regulate while also contributing to the upper tier.
        - Adopted the allegory of "[[Two watchmakers]]" by [Herbert Simon.


Why it matters
- [Perspectives beyond the "part-whole dichotomy
    - The traditional "[[elemental reductionism]] vs. holism" conflict can be integrated and complex systems can be reimagined as a dynamic hierarchy.
        - [[False dichotomy]] <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Common principles of biology, organization, and cognition
    - Provides a framework for comparing life phenomena, social organization, language, customs, etc. as "the same structure.
- Wide range of applications
    - Organizational theory - flat governance design such as [[holacracy]] or [sociocracy
    - System Design - Design guidelines for microservices and distributed systems
    - Consciousness research - developed into the Integration Theory (AQAL) by [[Ken Wilber]] et al.
