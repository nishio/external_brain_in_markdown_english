title: "People who are angry at not being understood have never been on the cutting edge."

Is this true?
    - People who run [[cutting-edge]] have experiences that are not [understood
    - Taking it as "common" or "just a fact" that many people don't understand your ideas.
        - Don't get angry at someone who doesn't understand when "[They don't understand.
- From this, we can derive that "a person who gets angry at someone who doesn't understand his/her point of view when it is not understood is a person who has never been on the cutting edge".

- [[lack of understanding or sympathy]]
- [[Understanding of others]]

When someone else expresses an opinion about something, many people are going to be angry if you say, "Wow, so that's your opinion. I don't understand it and I may not devote the resources to understand it." a lot of people are going to get angry.
- But isn't that what many of them do to other people's opinions? [[boomerang-like structure]]

- [[Resignation to not being understood]] is not fully developed?
- Understanding belongs to the inner life of others [[not get one's way]], so it's natural
    - Are [[Desire to be understood]] and [[sense of important people]] the same?
- Scrapbox suggested: [[The desire to be understood correctly is a power desire]].
