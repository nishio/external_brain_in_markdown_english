[[Obstacles]](岡) are avoided, leading to [[congestion]].
- [[Competition]] intensifies
- [[Bottleneck]]
    - If this point collapses, everything passing through here is doomed
- [[Flowing to the Low]]

Avoiding [[competition]] is sometimes used with a negative nuance as [[escape]], but isn't taking a position that avoids [[difficulty]] and leads to competition also a form of [[escape]]?
- Incidentally, <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> believes that the premise of "escape is negative" is flawed.
