Full [[fatigue]].
> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1666077838351671299): very tired. This "[[worn-out (as opposed to sleepy)]]" means "I've been fully occupied with an interesting subject". Almost synonymous with "[[enrichment]]".
> I know in my head that the fastest way to get to sleep is to write a little script before going to bed, start it up, and go to sleep, but I don't have the strength to do that!
