- A paper examining whether noninvasive stimulation (GENUS; [[Gamma Entrainment Using Sensory stimuli]]), which entrains the brain's [[gamma waves]] with 40 Hz light and sound, can reduce chemo brain-induced "chemobrain" (chemotherapy-induced cognitive decline) in mice (Sci. Transl. Med., 2024). Med. 2024), which entrain the [[gamma waves]] of the brain with 40 Hz light and sound.)
- Improved pathology
    - 40 Hz stimulation reduced DNA damage and neuroinflammation, promoted oligodendroglial cell survival and neogenesis, and protected the myelin sheath.
- Improved cognitive function
    - Improved performance on behavioral tasks corresponding to memory, attention, and executive functions.
- Timing is critical.
    - It is more pronounced when started at the same time as chemotherapy, and the effect lasts up to 105 days. On the other hand, improvement is limited when started 90 days after completion.
- Generality across drugs
    - Effective in methotrexate models as well as cisplatin.
- Molecular clues
    - Single cell RNA-seq confirmed transcriptional changes in a protective direction, including decreased expression of inflammatory and apoptotic pathways, especially in oligodendroglial cells.
- Implications for humans (but with caveats)
    - Mouse studies at this time. In humans, clinical trials are underway to demonstrate safety and preliminary efficacy in Alzheimer's disease, but clinical trials in chemobrain patients have not yet been conducted and need to be validated.
    - Window of treatment (when to start) may have a significant impact on efficacy. Prophylactic/adjunctive use is promising as a hypothesis.
    - Oncological safety considerations: It has been pointed out that neural activity may affect tumor progression in part, and careful consideration is required depending on the cancer type and metastatic status.
