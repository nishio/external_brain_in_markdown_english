> [[Mapping Philanthropic Support of Science]]
> While philanthropic support for science has increased in the past decade, there is limited quantitative knowledge about the patterns that characterize it and the mechanisms that drive its distribution. Here, we map philanthropic funding to universities and research institutions based on IRS tax forms from 685,397 non-profit organizations. We identify nearly one million grants supporting institutions involved in science and higher education, finding that in volume and scope, philanthropic funding has grown to become comparable to federal research funding. Yet, distinct from government support, philanthropic funders tend to focus locally, indicating that criteria beyond research excellence play an important role in funding decisions. We also show evidence of persistence, i.e., once a grant-giving relationship begins, it tends to continue in time. Finally, we leverage the bipartite network of supporters and recipients to help us demonstrate the predictive power of the underlying network in foreseeing future funder-recipient relationships. The developed toolset could offer funding recommendations to organizations and help funders diversify their portfolio. We discuss the policy implications of our findings for philanthropic funders, individual researchers, and quantitative understanding of philanthropy.
Although [[donor]] support for science has increased over the past decade, quantitative knowledge of its distinctive patterns and distributional mechanisms is limited. Here we map donor funding to universities and research institutions based on IRS tax returns from 685,397 nonprofit organizations. We found that nearly 1 million grants supporting research institutions involved in science and higher education were identified, and that philanthropic funding has grown to rival federal research funding in volume and scope. However, unlike government support, philanthropic funders tend to focus on [[region]], indicating that criteria other than research excellence play an important role in funding decisions. In addition, once a grant award relationship begins, it tends to be a long-term relationship. Finally, the bilateral network of supporters and recipients can be used to demonstrate the predictive power of the underlying network in predicting future funder-recipient relationships. The toolset developed could help organizations make funding recommendations and help funders diversify their portfolios. This paper discusses the policy implications of our findings for funders, researchers, and the quantitative understanding of philanthropy.
