This page considers whether AI can participate in collaborative editing projects and whether AI can ask questions and answer them. It also discusses the English account on Twitter and why the content you want to post on Bluesky is not showing up, as well as conversations with AI. It also considers why we can do a lot of things technically but not get excited about them.

An interesting point is the question of whether an AI can participate in a co-editing project. There is a suggestion that one person could start with an AI if one of them is an AI; if the AI asks questions and can answer them, it may be possible to co-edit with the AI.

It also gives us an idea as to why we are not getting the content we want to post on Twitter's English account or Bluesky. Having a conversation with a specific individual, rather than talking to an unspecified person, might might make the question possible.
- Maybe I'll be inspired to make a post.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

In my opinion, there is a possibility for AI to participate in collaborative editing projects.
- Whoa, opinion.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

Co-editing with an AI might be feasible if the AI asks questions and can answer them. It might also be possible to have a conversation with a specific individual to enable questions.

However, the reasons for the lack of tension need further consideration, as specific factors have not been identified.

    - Why don't I post on my English account?"
    - When my overseas friends send me chats, I communicate with them in English, so it's not that I can't do it.
    - This case is also talking to a specific person, not to an unspecified many people.

Q: What approach do you think would be effective in identifying specific factors that would make it possible for an AI to participate in a collaborative editing project and what technical challenges might exist?
- Communicate in English to an English-speaking AI account?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I don't know if Mr. Qualia saw my post and asked me a question.
    - No, let's start with a neutral GPT4.
        - Having your own index can be complicated.
