*1263804399*Ebios
I found 2,000 tablets of Ebios at a drugstore for 1,490 yen. On Amazon it is 1924 yen, so it is a relatively good deal. I still have a lot left because I bought 3 cases for 1680 yen last November to float the shipping cost. So I won't buy them.

Maybe I should start getting them at the drugstore when my rhythm of life improves and I go shopping more regularly!
