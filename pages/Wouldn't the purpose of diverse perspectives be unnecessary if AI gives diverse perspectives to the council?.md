- Wouldn't [[conferencing]], whose purpose is [[Diverse perspectives]], become unnecessary if AI gives diverse perspectives?

Wouldn't the role of people be to "give the AI a perspective that [[the AI]] doesn't yet have"?

[[AI-assisted human autocracy]].
- If we have a system that only produces a margin of error no matter what kind of person does it, isn't that enough?
- [[puppet government]].
        - One of the means to realize [AI Dictatorship
    - [[Follow your heart's desire, but don't overstep the bounds of the system]]
