title: "The axis is not one-dimensional."
---

When drawing a graph and thinking about things, suppose that the y-axis is casually represented by an arrow. At that point, the assumption is made that "the axis can be expressed as a one-dimensional real number. Is this assumption correct?
    - [[Implicit Assumptions of Singularity]]

To assume that it is a one-dimensional real number is also to assume that there is a non-trivial greater-than or less-than relationship between its values. Is that assumption correct? #whole order #order #order scale #scale level

Here's a diagram.
