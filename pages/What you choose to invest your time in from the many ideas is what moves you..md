I think that the people involved should express their thoughts here. I think it would be a good idea to have some kind of event like IPA Unexplored or Unexplored Junior at the timing of this GPT4.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1640884345908113410) I think it is unknown whether "a proposal text that uses GPT to the fullest" is a good proposal or not, but I think the latter is definitely better than "a proposal that is just an idea" and "a proposal that is improved based on the findings from a prototype that was built and tested. However, I think the latter is definitely better than "a proposal that is just an idea" and "a proposal that has been improved based on the findings of trying out a prototype".

> [ukkaripon](https://twitter.com/ukkaripon/status/1640886816453832704) Indeed, it would have been better to use GPT and make a prototype.

> [drinami](https://twitter.com/drinami/status/1640893866109988865) Indeed, I think that the fact that the [[prototype]] was created by selecting [[Investing one's own time]] among many ideas from [[excellence]] of the [[idea]] itself is what guarantees [[rarity]] and [[move one's heart]]. s own time] and created a [[prototype]], it will ensure [[rarity]] and [[move one's heart]].
- [[Investing one's own time]] = [[take a position]].
