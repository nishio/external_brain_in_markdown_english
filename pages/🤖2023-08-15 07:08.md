How should we understand the relationship between "felt meaning" and "symbols?" And how do these elements influence the organization and interpretation of information and the creation of meaning?
- > Kozaneba tools fragment information and relate it from multiple angles to create new structures.
    - It has to do with this "multifaceted association."
    - Symbols are associated with labels and faceplates in the KJ method.
    - The nameplate has an "[[associative mood]]" separate from the label under it.
        - It may be important to keep this separate from explicit links to subordinates.
        - In other words, chunks have rows as the underlying data structure, but the "row vector" is not equal to the chunk vector.
        - It feels like a tree [[but it is wrong to take higher dimensional space as a metaphor for 3 dimensional space]].
    - This behaves like the [[Vague borders]] of [[Felt Meaning]] in [[Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning]].
        - This contributes to the organization and interpretation of information and the creation of meaning.


Explore the possibilities of leveraging online platforms and AI to gather diverse perspectives and feedback to generate new ideas.
AI serves to "converge" discussions and thought processes and deepen understanding of issues.
Facilitate discussion using the KJ method to deepen human-AI interaction.


The fragment from Study 2 is relevant to our study because it contains a discussion of the fragmentation and multifaceted association of information and the creation of meaning. The fragment from [[Kozaneba:IOFI]] is also relevant to our study as it contains a discussion of felt meaning and symbolization.

### Digest
Explore the potential of online platforms and AI to generate new ideas by gathering diverse perspectives and feedback; AI serves to "converge" discussions and thought processes and deepen problem understanding; facilitate discussions using the KJ method to deepen human-AI interaction; and create a new structure for the discussion. Fragment and relate information from multiple perspectives with the Kozaneba tool to create new structures. Spaced Repetition learning method to organize information along a time axis.

[* New Idea (Japanese)
The use of an online platform and AI to aggregate multiple perspectives and feedback to explore the potential for generating new ideas; AI serves to "converge" discussions and thought processes, deepening understanding of issues; the KJ method is used to facilitate discussions and deepen human-AI interactions; and the use of a "KJ" method is used to facilitate discussions and deepen human-AI interactions. KJ method is used to facilitate discussion and deepen the interaction between humans and AI. It also uses a tool called Kozaneba to fragment information and relate it from multiple perspectives to create new structures. This will deepen the organization and interpretation of information and contribute to the creation of meaning. Furthermore, we use a learning method called Spaced Repetition to organize information along a time axis.
