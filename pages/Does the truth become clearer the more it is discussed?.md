- Many issues and imaginings about network governance were discussed at the Taipei [[multiverse]] ・ symposium held on August 15. Minister of Digital Affairs Tang Feng and Ethernet proponent Vitalik Buterin discussed how to avoid excessive centralization and how decentralized governance can be collaborative and cooperative.
- After the meeting, Vitalik Buterin presented "[[What I Think About Community Notes]]" on 8/16, arguing that it is possible to preserve useful and diverse opinions and create a forum for discussion through crowd collaboration complemented by an algorithm that eliminates extreme content.
- Since [[READr]] has experimented with the opinion-gathering platform Pol.is as an online discussion platform many times in the past, we will continue this trend with a series of related discussion articles.
