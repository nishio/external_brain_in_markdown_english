The [[knowledge accumulation model]] is not always correct.
    - [[The Parable of the Pyramids]]

- He wrote, "You can't put boxes in the air, they have to be stacked sequentially from the base."
- There are some types of people who don't have this "need".

However, I recognized one person in the "case that cannot be established" that I am thinking of now after I turned 40, following the path of "Nada Junior High School → Nada High School → Kyoto University" with a high concentration of weirdos, and after a while, I think there was another one in the past, so I think there is no more than one in 10,000 people in the population ratio.
- A few more, depending on where you put the boundaries.

They X can put boxes in the air.
- We need to ask what exactly "[[ground]]" means.
    - The [[ground]] is just a [[shared belief]] that "it is OK to [[delving into]] this far" held by the majority of people.
- X is not in on this.

Those who have not participated are not that rare.
    - [[philosophers]] and [[mathematicians]] who doubt [[assumption]] and dig around.
    - [[frivolous]] A person who says a lot of [[fluffy]] things.
    - I recognize this as "someone who tries to put a box in the air and it falls down."
- X is different from both.
    - Can put boxes in the air and still assemble things without falling off

Why is this possible?
- Thinking of this in terms of the gravity and box metaphor seems impossible, so a different model is needed
    - Maybe "net."
        - [[knowledge consistency]]

        - In "Knowledge, Capitalism and the Technologist Condition," which I wrote in 2012, I used the metaphor of a net instead of the metaphor of stacking boxes

The "stacking of boxes" is a metaphor for "gravity" and "the box below is the support."
- In fact, there is no gravity, but "[[the more connected things are, the more stable they are]]."

        - [[Ideas inspired by a single stimulus]]
- Not connected to other things, connected to one thing, or connected to several things, the latter being more reliable.

If you can build a body of knowledge that is interconnected, there is not much difference between doing something that is conventionally considered "basic" and something that is not.

- The psychological cost to many people of doing things the "right way" when the adults, teachers, and classmates closest to them believe that they should do things the way they are shown on the left is high.
- Need "[[My Values]]" such as strong [[curiosity]] and "[[ability]] not to sympathize" with existing values
- Rationally, the left is [[commodity knowledge]], so it makes sense to do the right.
    - but whether or not that [[risk-taking]] can be

Perhaps the lower cost of sharing information via the Internet has had an impact.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/475aba19b0cb26ac506280501d297598/thumb/1000)
- Before the Internet, information sharing through paper books became less and less specialized.
    - This is because specialized content is less profitable for publishers from a business standpoint.
    - It was necessary to follow one of the few footholds in this era
    - It usually became something to be traced in order from the bottom up.
- The Internet has lowered the cost of information sharing, allowing countless pieces of information to be shared.
    - Countless footholds have been created, making it possible to explore as one's curiosity dictates.
    - It is now possible to create a "densely connected knowledge network" even when learning in a way that is not on the "rails of existing learning methods".

- [[Knowledge Distribution Chart]]
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/f078e18ddf4cfadb5a2acf044d29d97a/thumb/1000)
- Mr. B certainly doesn't know X, which is a fundamental part of Mr. A's knowledge.
- But since Mr. A has knowledge that Mr. B does not have, [[knowledge trade]] is established.
        - [[Exchange knowledge and learn from each other]]
- From A's perspective, X is [[commodity knowledge]], so "I'll give you this stuff if you want it, but I think what you have is worth far more, don't you?" (i.e., "I think what you have is worth much more than what I have")
    - Well, there are those who will and those who won't and will say, "You don't know this stuff.

            - [[People without knowledge]]

By demonstrating value as a member of this "human network of knowledge exchange," they are acquiring another kind of [[shared belief]] after the fact
- In other words, there is a conflict between "the worldview created by education over the past few decades" and "the worldview created by practice since the Internet".
- That makes me think the latter is the better stuff.
- Being able to [[switch worldviews]] is going to be related to [[lightness of footwork]] or the ability to [[risk-taking]] or something like that.
- attributed to "[[movement]]".

Loose association
    - [[Good knowledge is not given to consumers of knowledge.]]
    - Conversely, by being on the production side, you're acquiring quality knowledge.
    - [[People who made things communicate with each other even if what they made is different.]]
    - At first, I thought that this might be knowledge of the foundation, but as I thought about it, I changed my mind, saying that the idea that the foundation is necessary in the first place is wrong, and that what we think is the foundation is just a [[shared belief]].

- > [[Thinking in terms of the gravity and box metaphor]] seems impossible, so another model is needed
- What I was thinking at the time led to [[two interpretations of the pyramid notation of knowledge]] over time.
