- [[Perplexity billed.]] Story Continued
Good solution to the problem of not being able to read English down the sink.
I can't pour over a number of hits from my searches because I'm not a fluent reader of English.
You can't even [[read in the sink]] and find more appropriate keywords.
Perplexity would be a good tool for such a situation.
