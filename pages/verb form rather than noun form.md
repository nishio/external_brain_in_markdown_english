title: "verb form rather than noun form"
---

Instead of writing "production equipment goes into service," it would be better to write "production equipment goes into service."
It is not yet clear what the sense of this goodness is or when it is best to do this.

- Avoid [obsession with the nominative form
- Noun forms tend to be abstract
    - [[one should drink alcoholic beverages]]

- [[Explain with verbs]]
    - [[Active bracketing of verbs]]
    - [[Focusing on verbs reveals strengths.]]
    - [[Experience = verb]]

- [[Sentences rot from adjectives.]]
