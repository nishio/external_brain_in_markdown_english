title: 'Not "0 to 1" but "undefined to 0."'
---

- The expressions "[[0→1]]" and "[[1→100]]" are on the same number line, which is strange.
- I find "undefined to 0" more satisfying.
- If it reaches 0, it can be incrementally improved "+1".
- If you do "+1" with undefined, it becomes NaN and you are stuck in a ditch you can't get out of.
