> Turing Pattern is a spontaneously occurring spatial pattern whose theoretical existence was shown by the British mathematician [[Alan Turing]] in 1952.
> Turing's interest in using this system of equations to explain the morphogenesis of organisms has long had no impact on biology. However, it has been re-evaluated in recent years, as in 1995 when Shigeru Kondo experimentally confirmed that the pattern on the surface of the body of the striped anemone is Turing's pattern.
