title: "Trade-off between productivity and creativity"
---

Outcomes may be measured on a quantitative scale and referred to as [[productivity]] the amount of outcomes per unit of time
- I use the term "intellectual productivity" differently, but it is often used this way in the world.

Let's call [[creativity]] the amount of value created in a unit of time by creating something that does not yet exist in the world.
- Newer items are difficult to estimate value in advance
- Value becomes apparent in [[posterior]] after it is produced.

There is a [[trade-off]] relationship between this productivity and creativity.
- If you want to increase productivity
    - It is more efficient to focus on what is already of obvious value rather than on what is of unclear value
    - If you can achieve the same one unit of results, it's better to focus on something less labor intensive.
    - In other words, "it is better to repeat at high speed the easy tasks that are obvious to produce results."
    - This mindset lowers creativity.
    - Because they don't create anything new.

This is exactly what [[trade-offs between use and exploration]] looks like.
The undermining of creativity by the introduction of quantitative measures is also related to [No numerical criteria should be used to evaluate researchers.
