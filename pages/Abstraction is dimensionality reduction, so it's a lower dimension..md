title: "Abstraction is dimensionality reduction, so it's a lower dimension."
---

- [[Abstraction is dimensionality reduction]] So it's going to be low dimensional.

This was a blind spot.
- Somehow there is a belief that it will be a higher order.
- But if abstraction is dimensionality reduction, then of course the more you abstract, the lower the dimension of the vector.
- Extreme abstraction becomes "good and evil" or "pleasant and unpleasant" or "friends and foes."
    - These dichotomies are reduced in dimensionality to one dimension

Complex raw reality" is the highest dimension.
- When humans abstract it and interpret it, it loses dimension.
- Dimensional reduction is not a one-size-fits-all phenomenon, so different people will interpret the phenomenon differently.

On the assumption that abstraction is "higher order"
- When you question why you think it's "higher", you realize there's not much evidence to support it.
- Influenced by metaphors based on primitive bodily sensations, such as "I'm doing something noble with my head, so I'm in a high position."
    - Let's discard the "Homo sapiens body with its head held high."
- Being "higher-order" and "higher-dimensional" and "being in a higher position" are not equal at all, yet they have been placed somehow close together in the brain.
