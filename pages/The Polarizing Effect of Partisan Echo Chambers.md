<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>Through a large-scale experiment conducted in the United Kingdom, this paper shows that partisan echo chambers (environments surrounded by people of the same opinion) have the effect of promoting partisan polarization.

The main contents are as follows
1. brought together supporters of the Labour and Conservative parties and asked them to discuss immigration policy either exclusively with people of the same party or in mixed groups with supporters of both parties.
2. the result was a greater [[polarization (light, radio waves)]] of opinion on policy in the group that discussed only people of the same party compared to the mixed group.
3. In addition, there was an effect of emotional polarization, i.e., increased favorability toward one's own party and increased hostility toward the other party. This was particularly true among supporters of the opposition and labor parties.
4. this suggests that a partisan homogeneous environment creates polarization not only in terms of policy but also in terms of sentiment.
5. on the other hand, discussions with people of different party affiliation were also shown to have a moderating effect on polarization.

In sum, this is an important paper that empirically demonstrates that [[echo chambers]] can contribute to partisan polarization. [* It also suggests that creating a forum for cross-party discussion may help alleviate polarization.
