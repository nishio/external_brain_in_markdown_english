title: "Case law on posting screenshots"
---

> A case in which the court ruled that a tweet that posted a scanned image of another person's tweet did not meet the requirements for quotation as stipulated in Article 32(1) of the Copyright Act because it violated Twitter's terms and did not conform to fair practice (Tokyo District Court, December 10, 2021, court website).

> "Since it can be said that the screenshot image clearly constitutes the main part, both quantitatively and qualitatively, it cannot also be found that citing it is within the legitimate scope for the purpose of citation."
