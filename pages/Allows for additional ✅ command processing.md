title: "Allows for additional ✅ command processing"

Enables modification of 🤔 command processing

- The commands that are generic now can stay as they are until a case arises where you want to remove them.
    - No more abstraction than necessary.
- You want to make it possible to add something about empathic writing, so you should do so directly.
- We don't want the code about empathic writing to be scattered all over the place.
- Add a hook and let the empathy_witing module handle it
    - Chain of Responsibility
