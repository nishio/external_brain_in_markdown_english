>  The sum of the first n cubes is the square of the sum of the first n numbers.

> [TrueCrimeNFT](https://x.com/TrueCrimeNFT/status/1820428323803034027) A square whose side length is a triangular number can be partitioned into squares and half-squares whose areas add to cubes. The nth colored region shows n squares of dimension n by n (the rectangle is 1 evenly divided square), hence the area of the nth region is n times n x n.
>  A square with triangular length on one side divides into a square and a half-square, and the area is a cube; the nth colored area shows n squares of dimension n x n (a rectangle is a square divided into 1 equal parts), so the area of the nth area is n x n.
