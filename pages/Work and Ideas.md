Work and Ideas
> [@GDLab_Hama](https://twitter.com/GDLab_Hama/status/1675642213156655104): an old story. I was a young kid who came in as a newbie.
> "Ideas come to me at the drop of a hat. Like when you take a bath, go to the bathroom, go for a walk, or get under the covers. So instead of groaning at your desk, you should think about them when you are relaxed like that."
> I once advised him to do so.
> Then a co-worker next to me said.
>  "No, that's not work time, so don't even think about it. Do your work during business hours."
>  and corrected my story.
>  I really froze and couldn't say anything because I didn't expect a side word.
>  I'm just saying that as "idea generation" it was correct, but as "work advice" it was illegal advice. Abnakatta... ü´¢.
>
>  Just. It's also true that the kids who think up ideas in the bath are the ones who go on to achieve more and more ‚ú®.
>  Don't get me wrong here, the kids who think up ideas even when they are off the clock are never doing it for "business", they just "like to think" üôÇ.
>
>  After all, people who "love" what they do are strong!

When the percentage of "ideas" among the outcomes evaluated as results increases, the "coming up with ideas while taking a bath is work outside of business hours" talk can be a loss for individuals.
- From [You can't control the germination of ideas.

- [[What is work?]]
- If you define it as "performing a given task," then of course you don't have to do it outside of work hours.
- It's about what you define as your job.
- Some people think that's for others to decide.
