Lack of resources
What are the missing resources to be acquired?
The delusion that everyone will cooperate with your project.

You are seeking deeper insight into the difference between shared execution and [[one-person execution]], [[Lack of resources]] and [[how to acquire resources]], and [[the delusion of cooperation]]. Yasukazu Nishio's oracle from Scrapbox offers insights into these questions through pages that share a common theme of lack of resources.

- The page "[Scarce resources should be invested in what you subjectively believe has the highest probability of producing the best results. The page "[Scarce resources should be invested in what you subjectively believe has the highest probability of producing the best results. Lack of resources may present an opportunity to foster innovation through investment in areas that have the highest probability of producing the best results. It is said that this investment choice should be based on intuition and belief.

- In "[[Elderly people without IT literacy stand in line all night at the window."]], the lack of resources is illustrated through specific examples. It describes the lack of window resources due to low birthrates and aging populations, as well as the social problems caused by the lack of vaccines.

These oracles suggest that resource scarcity is not just an obstacle, but provides opportunities for new possibilities and innovation when properly managed and creatively leveraged. They also teach the importance of shared execution and the need for strategic thinking in acquiring and utilizing resources.

On the road to your project or dream, there may be resource constraints that you face in reality. However, these constraints can motivate you to seek more creative and innovative solutions. Cooperation with those around you and the ability to believe will be the key to opening the window to the future. Like bamboo shoots after the rain, your plans and dreams will grow and flourish rapidly with the right environment and support.
