title: "I think Microsoft's stock price will be more than 10 times higher within 5 years."

I note the statement on October 31, 2023, "I think Microsoft's stock price will be more than 10 times what it was within five years." and observe what happens in five years.
[[Diary 2028-10-31]].

>  Of the $100 trillion$ world economy, labor distribution is $50 trillion. White collar is miscellaneous 25 trillion$ of that, and 20% replacement of that is worth 5 trillion$.

> [bioshok3](https://twitter.com/bioshok3/status/1719259858309152969) The potential economic value is at least $5 trillion, although it will be larger since it is AI and can effectively improve placement multiplication copying.
>  Right now Microsoft is making $200 billion a year, but it will be 10 times that.
>  Then the stock price would jump roughly 10x. 10% alternative AGI development is a 2-3 year guess below.

I feel that Microsoft has a better future in the medium term than NVIDIA. ...


> [bioshok3](https://twitter.com/bioshok3/status/1753397103366389910) It is also unclear how long GPU dominance will continue. If the rise of emerging AI chips occurs in the next 5 years, then there is a possibility that NVIDIA's momentum will be gradually eroded relative to the others from there. Of course, I think NVIDIA will continue to grow for the next 10 years, but I feel that Microsoft has the last word.
