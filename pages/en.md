- "Written in English" icon

The page containing the toplevel icon <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/en/icon' alt='en.icon' height="19.5"/> is written in English by NISHIO Hirokazu.
This page is also written in English.

If a page was written in Japanese and then translated into English by machine translation, it will be represented by a different icon [[jaen]].
After the "jaen" contents was reviewed and refined by human (usually me, NISHIO Hirokazu), it changes into "en" contents.
