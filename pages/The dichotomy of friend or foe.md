title: "The dichotomy of friend or foe"

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/> [[Carl Schmidt's]] [[friend-enemy theory]] is a central concept in his political philosophy and is used to define the essence of "[[the]] political." Schmitt argued that the essence of the political is the distinction between [[friend]] ([[comrade]]) and [[enemy]]. This theory is developed in detail in his book "[[The concept of the political]]" (1932).

## Basics of Friend/Enemy Theory
According to Schmitt, political identity is ultimately defined by the existence of an "enemy. The "enemy" here is not merely a competitor or someone with whom one disagrees, but rather an other who fundamentally denies the existence and value of the community and whose very existence is a threat as a result. Schmitt understands an "enemy" as an entity that has the potential to cause physical warfare, and thus the distinction between friend and foe entails the most important decision over [[the survival of the political community]].

## "the dichotomy of friend or foe"
The "friend or foe" dichotomy in Schmitt's theory is the basis for political decisions. For him, this ultimate distinction forms the core of the political and provides a guide to action for building and maintaining community. This distinction plays a central role in [[the formation of]] political identity, as it is necessary for a political community to define and protect itself.

## Criticisms and Influences of Schmidt's Theory
.
Carl Schmitt's friend-enemy theory has had widespread influence in [[political philosophy]] and [[international relations theory]], but it has also been subject to a number of criticisms. The main criticism is that extreme [[dualism]] may eliminate room for dialogue and compromise and escalate [[political conflict]] into inevitable conflict. His theories are also associated with his own actions under the [[Nazi]] regime, and his political decisions and ethical positions are sometimes called into question.

Schmitt's friend-enemy theory remains controversial in the understanding of political community and the justification of political action. His ideas provide an important perspective from which to examine political identity formation, [[collective self-understanding]], and [[the process of]] political decision-making, but their application requires caution.
