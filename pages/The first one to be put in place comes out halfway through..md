### Digest of Research Notes
.

My previous research note began with the sentence, "What should be put in the beginning comes out in the middle." This is a reflection on the beginning and end of things and the process in between. However, this one sentence alone does not convey the specifics.

Therefore, referring to Nishio's research note "[[KJ Method Study Session @ Loftwork_Lecture Material v1]]" embodies the idea that what should be placed first in the progression of things should come out in the middle. Specifically, he states that in order to gain new insights, it is important to allow what should be placed first to come out in the middle.

Also, "How to get what you need quickly and easily! Organizing to get what you need!" notes, there is a discussion of organizing things. This is a helpful methodology for organizing the beginning, the end, and the process in between.

In addition, the note "Who puts things back where they belong and who puts them where they can be seen" provides a discussion of the positioning of things. This is a helpful perspective for positioning the beginning of things, the end of things, and the processes in between.

From the above, it can be said that my digest of research notes should consider the beginning and the end of things, and the processes in between, and it is important to organize and situate them.
