![image](https://gyazo.com/a9ece3120a67eec59fd026e97d715d77/thumb/1000)

in the world
- Help the disadvantaged minority.
- Let's help everyone.
    - However, "everyone" often means "the majority" and the minority is left out of the "help."
        - Cases due to unawareness that a minority is not in sight.
        - Cases where a minority is recognized but limited resources are allocated to benefit as many people as possible, thus saving only the majority.
There are two types of resource allocation discussions
The two are often thought to be in conflict
- Allocating limited resources to help a minority undermines the interests of the greater majority.
But this is [[false dichotomy]].
- Assumptions are made that the resources to be distributed are constant.
- Increasing the number of resources available for distribution.
    - Thereby helping more minorities without harming the interests of the majority.


relevance
- This figure represents the human condition in terms of one-dimensional values, but in reality it is multidimensional
    - So a person who thinks he is a weak man may be a strong man in the eyes of another.
            - [[There is more than one strong and weak axis]]
            - [[They'd rather talk about someone else's latrine than my employment.]]
