title: "non-homo sapiens"
---

Expressions that do not distinguish whether an intelligent body is a [[Silicon Intelligent Body]] created on Earth by [[Homo sapiens]] or a [[space alien]] from another planet.

Almost the same concept
    - [[Intelligent bodies that are not homo sapiens.]]

It is possible that [[Silicon Intelligent Bodies]] (civilizations of [[silicon biota]]) born on other planets will come to Earth.
