- [[Umehara]] pointed out that the [[narrow community]] of the [[arcade]] supported the popularity and continuity of fighting games, and that in today's [[wide platform]], the illusion of "[[being]] the best in the world" is difficult, making it tough for [[beginners]] to continue.
- Some say that the entry barrier for [[doujinshi]] is getting higher, and [[beginners]] tend to aim too much for a "good book" from the beginning, but the reality is that [[sensitive people]] have a hard time because they can see the results directly when they publish on [[SNS]].
- The importance of forming "Small Communities" and "intrinsic motivation" are considered to be keys to success. The importance of [[intrinsic motivation]] and the formation of [[Small Communities]] are considered to be keys to success.

- Umehara compares game arcades of the past to a "frog in a well," and says that the environment in which it was easy for people to perceive that they were the best in the world contributed to the popularity of fighting games. He points out that this illusion motivated newcomers to continue. However, today, with the proliferation of social networking sites and online platforms, everyone is in an environment where they can be compared to talent from all over the world, making it difficult for newcomers to gain confidence.

- Some say that high printing costs, event participation fees, and rising quality standards are barriers to new entrants in the doujinshi world. The tendency for beginners to immediately demand high quality work has been pointed out as a problem, causing discerning readers to become discerning before they even get their hands on it.

- Creators sometimes doubt their self-worth when they see people who are younger and better at their craft than they are. This leads to a syndrome in which they feel that their skills and creations do not make sense, and many become frustrated.

- SNS and online platforms are a double-edged sword, especially for sensitive people, and are a harsh environment for those in the middle stage of their career, as the number of works they publish is a direct result of their work. Therefore, aspiring illustrators need to recognize the importance of not [[raising the bar too high for themselves]] and to first draw what they want to draw honestly.
    - [[Make what you want to make, honestly]].

- As a countermeasure to this, it is recommended to form small communities and make friends at the same or slightly higher levels. This encourages mutual support and learning rather than competition and facilitates ongoing activity. It is also important not to compare oneself too much with others and to maintain motivation through small successes.

>  [@DividedSelf_94](https://twitter.com/dividedself_94/status/1601456905221996544): Umehara said, "At that time, the arcade was [[a frog in a well]], so it was easy to think that I was the best in the world. That's why I could keep playing gaming. And everyone else thought they were the best in the world, too, so that's why gaming became popular. Now there is no place for such illusion, so it is tough for beginners to continue.

>  [@kuro_oneone](https://twitter.com/kuro_oneone/status/1469225244359786501): I heard that young people today can't enter the doujinshi market because of the printing cost and the event participation fee. Of course, they have to pay for printing and event participation, but they tend to aim too much for "good books from the beginning" because no one wants a copy of a magazine, and they can't get consignment.
> Personally, I think it is a double-edged sword for young people to present their works on social networking sites.

> I have always thought that the number of people who participate in the event is visible, for better or worse, and that this may be a poison for people in the process of developing their art, especially those who are sensitive.

> It's tough to suddenly compete in [[the SNS World Championships]], isn't it?

As the population using [[social networking sites]] and platforms grows, it's harder to be confident because the work being submitted has become more sophisticated and [[red ocean]].
- No one can look at the [[pixiv]] rankings and think they are better at drawing than me.
    - [learning the same things as everyone else does not exchange knowledge.
