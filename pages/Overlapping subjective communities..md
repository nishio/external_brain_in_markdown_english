prev  [[There are two societies.]]

1: There is a group of people like this
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/b59dbc606cc558f567767a036fb1a762/thumb/1000)
- Mr. A. thinks, "We're all part of a community!" he thinks.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/219069cf66402fee3cd3ef817b748b37/thumb/1000)
- Mr. B sees "A, B, and C are the regular core members and the rest are guests".

- Mr. C thinks, "Mr. F must be one of us."

- Mr. D thinks he is a "regular core member like A, B, and C" (but neither B nor C think so).

- Mr. E. thinks "I only attended an event once, I don't belong to the community."
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/b99dd61345d211526585ad91fa7d8a10/thumb/1000)
- Mr. F thinks "I just attended the event with my friend Mr. C. I didn't join Mr. A's community."

- 2: These various individual feelings of belonging to different communities overlap to form a "somewhat colorful, boundary-blurring group".

    - "[[There are two societies.]]" "[[Communities do not objectively exist]]" is "Communities do not objectively exist, but rather there are what each person subjectively believes to be a community, which overlap to form a group with blurred boundaries." I think we can agree on that if we bite the bullet.
    - Each is an individual belief
        - It is easier to develop [[shared beliefs]] when people perceive the same scope as a community, for example, if you create a group chat and plug into it, or if there are [[initiation]] rituals of community participation.
                - [[legitimate participation]].

- [[initiation]]
