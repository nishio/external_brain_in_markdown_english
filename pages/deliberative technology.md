# Overview
.
In June 2024, [[Toda Peace Institute]] and the [[Kroc Institute at the University of Notre Dame]] jointly hosted a workshop for 45 peacebuilding professionals from around the world to explore the use of "Deliberative Technologies" . This report presents the content and main issues discussed.

## What is deliberative technology?
- Digital tools that leverage AI and algorithms to enable large-scale citizen participation and dialogue
- Discover commonalities and points of agreement by inputting participants' own opinions and tabulating and visualizing their agreement or disagreement with others' comments.
- Visualize" complex opinion spaces that are difficult to grasp with traditional polls and polling, and mitigate potential conflicts

## Aims and Objectives
- Strengthening democracy with the help of AI and computational social science in today's severely socially and politically divided society.
- Supporting a process in which people with diverse backgrounds engage in dialogue to build mutual understanding and consensus
- Policy makers and civil society use these technologies to promote peace building and social consensus building

## Main content of workshop
.
- Usage and examples of various platforms such as [[Pol.is]], [[Remesh]], [Talk to the City
- A method for discovering "common ground" using a bridging algorithm
    - [[Bridging Systems]]
- Design and operational considerations for online dialogue (e.g., how to formulate questions, participant recruitment, anonymity and safety, etc.)

## Future issues/research
 ## Future issues/research
 [** Future issues/research
- Availability and risks in multicultural and multilingual environments
- Ongoing support for trust building, information provision, and consensus building before and after the process
- How policy makers and local communities incorporate results and translate them into real change
- Collaboration and demonstration for the creation of an open source guide

This report demonstrates the significance of using computational social science and AI technology as a means of overcoming the divisions and conflicts that democracy faces. In particular, the core theme of this workshop is how to implement deliberative technologies in society and link them to actual consensus building and peacebuilding.
