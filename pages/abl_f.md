- Thoughts.
    - [[superfluous event]] for "none of the pairs are the same height"
    - It is a combination of "one pair of..." and "two pairs of..."
        - [[principle of inclusion]]
    - I guess I'd make a [[frequency table]] of heights first.
    - The way the pair is taken is the target, so the state can be compressed.
    - How many "combinations with one pair" are there when there are two, three, four, and so on pairs?
    - Maybe this is not an equation transformation, but a DP to get it?
    - The order is not relevant to how the pairs are taken, so you can introduce the order here
    - Maybe DP in the number of cases where j pairs are made with the first i of a given frequency table X.
    - If there are more than 4 people, there is a possibility of having 2 pairs at a time.
        - 4C2ร2C2รท2!
    - N will be almost 100,000...

    - It's the principle of inclusion and exclusion." OK.
    - Create a frequency table" OK
    - Number of cases where k pairs are taken from a set of size 4 or larger" OK
    - Is it DP?" No, it's [[convolution]].
        - When doing [[repetitive fold]], you need to be creative with the order.
        - Attach the shortest first.
