### Summary of notes
.
The senses are an important means of knowing one's own internal state, and can sense malfunctions in daily life and in the intellectual production process. If we neglect our senses, our ability to sense them will diminish and we will become poor at using them to make decisions. We need to pay attention to our senses and learn to use them as a source of information.

This illustrates the idea that the senses offer infinite possibilities for our perception and understanding.
