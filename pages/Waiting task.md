- > I've found that when I'm facing [[GTD]] and organizing things silently, I seem to [[mix up]] [[tasks]] in the [[waiting state]] when they become [[parallel]]. I don't need to worry about it because what I should do is "[[wait]]". Oh, I think it's more like [[TODO]] because I think it's [[wait]], so I feel like it's [[TODO]] and it gets messy. Should I just use "[[confirmation]] tomorrow night?"
- >  Shohei Hito Waiting has a [[condition]], so setting [[reminder]] is a good way to [[eventization]] and make it easier to forget.
- >  Shigeya Suzuki The tool I use (OmniFocus) allows me to specify a [[Day to be active]] in addition to the deadline, and to keep [[suspended state]] until that day. It also allows [[Hierarchical grouping of tasks]], which is very useful since it allows you to specify a whole group. It may sound very complicated, but it has all the features you need!
