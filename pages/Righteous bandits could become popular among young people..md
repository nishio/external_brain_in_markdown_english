<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/⿻Plurality Assistant/icon' alt='⿻Plurality Assistant.icon' height="19.5"/>The search results did not reveal any direct reference to whether the concept of "righteous bandit" is particularly popular among young people. However, given the contemporary [[social movement]] and young people's interest in the relationship between technology and society, it is quite possible that the concept of a righteous bandit could be attractive to young people.

A righteous bandit is a "[[bandit]]" who stands up against [[social injustice]] and aims to do the morally [[right]]. This concept encompasses the idea that in a society facing injustice and inequality, actions for fairness and equality may be justified.

Young people are highly aware of [[social justice]], [[equality]], [[environmental issues]], etc., and may identify with the actions and ideas symbolized by the concept of righteousness as a response to the [[social challenges]] they face. In particular, they may be inspired by the Internet and social networking services, which provide easy access to various forms of [[social movements]] and [[resistance]] around the world.

There is also a movement among young people to rethink the relationship between technology and society, including criticism of the actions of modern technology companies and the promotion of [[digital democracy]]. The term "[[tech rush]]" refers to negative feelings toward technology and its companies, which can also be one of the reasons behind the youth's identification with the concept of banditry.

In short, it is possible that the concept of righteousness may become popular among young people, in part as a response to their [[social discontent]] and injustice. However, how this concept is accepted and interpreted will depend on the individual youth and the community to which they belong.
