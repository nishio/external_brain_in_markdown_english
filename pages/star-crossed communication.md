title: "star-crossed communication"
---

- One central person X is in [[communication]] with others A, B, C and there is no communication between A, B, C
- X can figure out who knows what and what they don't know
- So, with malicious intent, you can mislead one of A, B, or C, get them on the wrong side of each other, or put the blame for their failures on them.

- is often the case
    - 'Talking about them individually is confusing, so let's centralize the information!' etc.

- If it's done by a well-intentioned and competent person, well, it's beneficial.
- If someone is incompetent with good intentions, there will be a communication omission with no ill intent on his/her part, which will cause trouble.
    - Well, in that case, A~C know that X is bad, so they naturally switch hubs.
    - If roles are fixed by external factors, such as "X is an employee and A~C are part-timers," this is a problem.

- In case of malicious intent
    - Don't talk to strangers" is a dangerous sign.
    - When people say these things to me, I'll immediately create a non-star type communication channel.
    - Gather evidence such as X says different things about different people.
