AI support for iterative KJ method
    - [[iterative KJ method]]
    - Jiro Kawakita himself does very little because it takes time, but he thinks it is beneficial in the long run.
        - This should be assisted by AI.
- The KJ method has come in handy, but many of its use cases are lecture materials, presentation materials, etc.
    - [[temporarily scattered]], from which [[what is in order is harvested]], and the scattered desks are put away as they are.
        - Associated with: [[Harvesting the Framework]].
        - The original incentive for creating [[the Electronic KJ method tool]] was to make it [[easier to reuse]] by making it electronic.
        - The current [[Kozaneba]] has not yet achieved that ideal.
