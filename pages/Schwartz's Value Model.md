<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/SGE/icon' alt='SGE.icon' height="19.5"/>According to [[Schwartz]] (2005), there are ten values that govern human behavior: [[self-determination]], [[impetus]], [[pleasure]], [[achievement]], [[authority]], [[safety]], [[harmony]], [[tradition]], [[mercy]], and [[benevolence]]. These ten values are further classified into four higher values: [[self-promotion]], [[receptivity to change]], [[maintenance]], and [[self-transcendence]].
