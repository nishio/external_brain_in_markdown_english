However, the cultural connotations and traditional depictions of Oni can differ significantly from Western concepts of demons or ogres.

Traditionally, Oni are depicted as large, fearsome beings with sharp claws, wild hair, and two long horns growing from their heads. They are often portrayed in a variety of colors, most commonly blue or red. They typically wear tiger-skin loincloths and carry iron clubs, further adding to their menacing appearance.

Oni are typically seen as malevolent beings, capable of causing harm, death, and disaster. However, their role can vary in different stories. In some tales, they are pure evil, tormenting humans and causing destruction. In others, they can serve as protective spirits or punishers of the wicked.

One of the most famous events associated with Oni is the [[Setsubun]] festival in Japan
