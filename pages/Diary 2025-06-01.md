Recent Desktop Configurations
- Minimize multiple desktops on the VR side, as it can easily become very confusing.
- If you have Slack on the VR side in a single window, you lose it or get tired because you have to move your desktop to interact with it.
    - The VR side desktop only puts what is relevant to the task because it can be a separate window per thread.
    - You can place them side by side, like a thread with a request flying in from a human, a thread talking with Devin, and so on.
    - Slack is full screen on the hand side.
- I still think two or three tasks to do in stiff parallel is my limit in the flesh.
    - Make it correspond to a virtual desktop.
    - Keep it empty as much as possible, and put away what you've finished with immediately.
    - Otherwise, you'll have an area where you don't know if there's something to check or not, and that will be a burden.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1928801150289190999) When I heard that the organizational structure in a world where AI is working like gangbusters could change, I asked myself, "Is [[Corporation]] enough in the first place?" I thought, "Is it right to be a [[Corporation]] in the first place? I think the concept of a "start-up political party" is a pretty interesting model.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1928803911420264506) [[political party subsidy]] Create a team of 10 engineers with [[political party subsidy]], scale it with AI to produce results for 100 people, and release it all as OSS for free because there is no need to monetize it directly, Target users are the entire population; if the public continues to support the model, the political party will be maintained and the party subsidy will continue.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1928804686162755815) Given the dramatic growth in engineering productivity over the next few years, I think we're inventing a form of organization that will grow in a way that has never been done before, where the number of physical humans remains small and the number of virtual employees scales rapidly. I think it's the invention of an organizational form that grows in a way that has never been done before.

> [N_Taisho](https://x.com/N_Taisho/status/1928982514955092204) I think this would be seriously interesting as a "public OSS factory" if we can get beyond the 5 seats or 2% vote barrier. It will be more sustainable if we foster a strong conservative community within the OSS and promote non-party contributions as well.

- What is a DAO?
    - Smart contracts on the blockchain to automate cash management and decision making
    - Authority is distributed by token holdings and membership, with no central administrator
    - Voting results are on-chain, unalterable, and verifiable by anyone
    - In Japan, guidelines such as "limited liability company-type DAO" have been discussed, but all of them assume an organization that satisfies the above three points.
- Comparison with the model described in the post
    - The only overlap is in terms of "open source" and "assuming decentralized collaborators," and unless the flow of funds and governance are on-chain, it is hard to call it a DAO.
- summary
    - Status quo: It is not a DAO because neither blockchain nor smart contracts are used and it remains a centralized party framework.
    - Reason for misunderstanding: because "non-traditional organizations" that utilize OSS, AI, and scale with small numbers of people sound similar to DAOs.
    - If you want to call it a DAO: funds, governance, and execution need to be on-chain and legally reinforced in the form of a limited liability company-type DAO, etc.
- Therefore, the commenter's "it's a DAO" is understandable as a figurative expression, but not a technically or legally strict DAO.

- [[new form of organization]] does not necessarily mean that it fits into the traditional concept of a "DAO" (of course).

You succeeded in getting a good rest today.
