title: "Parable of the Bicycle"

- All participants could probably ride a bike.
- Now please explain in words "how to ride a bicycle"?
    - Very difficult.

- First, learn to "turn the pedals to go forward" on a bicycle with auxiliary wheels.
- Practice "balancing and advancing alone" without auxiliary wheels
    - I might fall a few times.
    - Do it in a safe park so that if you fall, it won't be life-threatening.
- Then we'll take to the public streets and run together.
    - More traffic lights, cars, and various other "environments to be concerned about".
