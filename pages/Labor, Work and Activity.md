>  [[toil]] is the active force that sustains life, the labor of the body closely linked to metabolism and consumption, leaving nothing behind as a product.
>
>  [[work]] is an active force that leaves behind as an outcome an object of relative durability, as indicated by the fact that work is both a verb meaning to do work and a noun meaning a work.
>
>  [[activity]] is speech and action between people, an active force that absolutely needs others, a response to the fact that humans are plural.
