- More in-depth research is needed on specific ways to invest in public goods and how to leverage digital innovation.
    - You should look into [[Public Digital Innovation Space]].

Government should function as a platform and support private sector activities. Public digital innovation spaces should enable data sharing and analysis through public data and public API platforms to create good governance systems; Next Commons Lab and Ethereum Foundation should invest in public goods projects and human resources to improve governing technologies. It is important that we act on our own and invest in public goods when we cannot make rational decisions to prevent market failures. Also, if we have doubts about government governance, we should create better governance systems ourselves.

From Nishio's research notes, I see ideas about designing philanthropy to provide a decentralized, self-organizing ecosystem of public goods. This has similarities with my research and could lead to improved public goods investment and governance systems. I also share Audrey Tang's thoughts on public digital innovation spaces.

This information suggests that investing in public goods and improving governance systems through digital innovation are important means of preventing market failure and creating a better society. However, specific ways to invest and use digital innovation need to be studied in more depth.

The role of government is to serve as a platform and should help the private sector to operate effectively, and the Next Commons Lab and the Ethereum Foundation (EF) are fulfilling this role, investing in public goods projects and human resources, researching grant distribution methods, and funding projects that improve governance technology. The EF funds projects that aim to If the entities that prevent market failures cannot make rational decisions, it is important that they act on their own, create economic zones, and invest in public goods.

### new idea
The idea that "the role of government is to serve as a platform and should help the private sector to operate effectively" shares with Audrey Tang's thinking on public digital innovation spaces. The work of the Ethereum Foundation is also relevant to the design of philanthropy to provide a decentralized and self-organizing ecosystem of public goods. It is important to think deeply about the design of new governance systems from these perspectives.

The government should play an important role as a platform and should support the private sector in what it can do well." It is also important to think deeply about how to design public digital innovation spaces and invest in public goods from the perspective that "if we do not feel the rationality and legitimacy of current government governance, we should create better governance systems ourselves.

We feel that government should be a platform, not a size, and should support what the private sector can do well Next Commons Lab is playing such a role The Ethereum Foundation (EF) invests in public goods projects and human resources, and supports organizations that study how to distribute grants The EF has a structure for funding projects that seek to improve governing technology. We believe that if the entities that prevent market failure cannot make rational decisions, they have no choice but to act on their own. Therefore, they believe it is important to create their own economic sphere and invest in public goods. However, if they do not feel the rationality and legitimacy of the current government governance, they believe that they should create a better governance system on their own.

[* New Idea (Japanese)
From Nishio's research notes, I draw the concept of a public digital innovation space, which would function as an internal startup within the national government. This is related to my concept of "government as a platform". Also, the idea that anyone can freely share and analyze data through public data and public API platforms is consistent with my idea of support for what the private sector can do well. Combined, these ideas provide a new perspective on how the public administration can function as a platform, and how the private sector can create a better system of governance through the activities of the private sector through public data and public API platforms.

Public administration as 🤖 platform
> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1691446051507773444) After talking with Aya and Noah, I was reminded of the following points: "Government as a platform, not big government or small government," and "Lowering the hurdles for the private sector to get involved in things that could be done better. I think it is about "lowering the hurdle to get the private sector to do what they can do better, and supporting them in doing so". How to invest in public goods as a strategic downsizing.
- [[Public administration as a platform]]
[[Big government/small government" is a false dichotomy.]]
[[Strategic downsizing]]

> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1691446569512673280) In that context, I think [[Next Commons Lab]] is doing what it needs to do while keeping its feet on the ground. Personally, I am connected to Mr. Hayashi, but I would like people around me in Plurality Tokyo and Civictech to know more about it. I'm foolishly trying to say, "We can make a better governing system ourselves."
- I'll check it out later.

> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1691447201099329536) Aside from whether it reaches the people in Japanese government offices who are the main reason I am thinking about it, EF is able and meticulous about behaving that way. I feel that they are doing so.
>
>  (As a concept) I think there are areas where actual government and local governments can also be helpful as entities to fill in the gaps between government, rulers, and market failures.
- [[Ethereum Foundation]]

> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1691448283775000576) In addition to investing in research, public goods projects, and human resources, EF also supports meta-public goods, "organizations that study how to distribute grants [[0xtkgshn]]. In other words, it supports organizations like Code for Japan (which at first glance seems to be an overlap). Personally, I think this is a great idea.

> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1691448676168974336) At least from what I've seen, we can fund "projects that may improve the governing technology itself because it's OK to fail". I think the system is such that it can fund "projects that may improve the governing technology itself, even if they are allowed to fail. Then I feel that if we could at least support related non-profit organizations, the ecosystem could grow a lot.

> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1691449341737873410) The reason why I say that tax collection is the end game is because the entities that were originally constituted to prevent market failure, as I mentioned above, are not going to make rational decisions. If they can't, they're on their own.
>
>  That would be a pseudo founding, though Public Chain's foundation is able to do that while printing money,

> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1691450144187953152) Code for Japan is obvious, but we can't do that. Then how can we create our own economic zone, tax congestion and invest in public goods? This is the key point.
>
>  This statement is consistent, if you do not feel the rationality and legitimacy of > governance by the current government,

> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1691450533700354048) It is based on the position that we have to think of a mechanism to do better on our own, but having said that, the Japanese Digital Agency I ended up communicating more with the Digital Agency in Taiwan than with the Digital Agency in Japan. That is exactly what I felt keenly when I came to Taiwan this time.

> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1691450719336116224) To be honest, I am disappointed in them, but have yet to shrug my shoulders. I guess this is only because I can respect the seniors around me.
>
>  Conclusion, I have to do it as one entrepreneur in the Ethereum ecosystem, while giving up and acknowledging my character that I still have to move my hand.
