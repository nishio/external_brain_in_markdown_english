The subject of this issue is "What is [[enjoyable]]?" This time, we will discuss "What is [[enjoyable]]?
- When you are immersed in something enjoyable, don't you feel that it is not "enjoyable" in real time, but it becomes "enjoyable" after the fact?
- Isn't the feeling of "fun" that occurs beforehand something else?

- What is Fun?
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>What did you see that made you think he was having fun?
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/立川 智也/icon' alt='立川 智也.icon' height="19.5"/>Over the past week or two, there has been an overwhelming increase in "I want to do this kind of thing" from Mr. Nishio, "[[interest]].
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>A third party infers that the other party's inner life is "[[enjoyable]]" by observing [[interest]].
            - [[active]] and "looks like fun."
        - When "fun" is important, it is not important whether it looks "fun" to others, it is important that the person himself/herself is "fun".
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/立川 智也/icon' alt='立川 智也.icon' height="19.5"/>Nishio, did you find the past two weeks "fun"?
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I never thought it would be "fun."
        - Subjectively, I'm just chatting about an idea that came to me.
        - Not even subjectively "on board".
            - I'm thinking about it while I'm not conscious of it and throwing it into the chat because a new idea came to me.
            - [[immersing oneself]]."
                - When you are immersed in a theme, you are in unity with that theme ([[the unity of master and guest]]), so when you look at it from the outside ([[separation of religious ritual and government administration]]), you don't think, "This is fun. ) you don't think, "This is fun.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/立川 智也/icon' alt='立川 智也.icon' height="19.5"/>Fun, interesting, getting on, cannot be observed by the person in real time.
        - And "what he thinks is important" is not wrong either, two seemingly contradictory stories mixed together.
        - You don't know it's "fun" until someone else points it out.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Not that others are.
        - You don't observe yourself while you're in the heat of the moment, so you don't realize that you're in a state of enjoyment, and after you're done, you look back and go "[[posterior]]" to "[[It was fun.]]"
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/立川 智也/icon' alt='立川 智也.icon' height="19.5"/>I plan to [[enjoyment]]" and "I am looking forward to it" are subjective.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The future.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/立川 智也/icon' alt='立川 智也.icon' height="19.5"/>They look forward to the day before the excursion, but leave once the day of the excursion.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>More concrete "There's a flower like that! Butterflies are flying!" occupy my mind.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/立川 智也/icon' alt='立川 智也.icon' height="19.5"/>Solving the Osaka riddle, while I was doing it, I thought, "Wow, this is fun.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>What made you think that?
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/立川 智也/icon' alt='立川 智也.icon' height="19.5"/>There were some well thought out craft puzzles that I thought were fun when I was doing them.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>A counterexample of how sometimes you find the fun in the midst of doing it.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/立川 智也/icon' alt='立川 智也.icon' height="19.5"/>It was a long time. I wonder if it has to do with time.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>You mentioned that you weren't aware of the fun all the time for a long time, but that there were moments when you suddenly felt like you were having fun, though I suspect there were triggers that he wasn't aware of.
        - You can have fun while you're playing a game, but you can't afford to have fun while you're fighting hard in a real-time strategy game.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/立川 智也/icon' alt='立川 智也.icon' height="19.5"/>You need room to have fun.
        - Athletic club activities, I think I had fun after I retired.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The basic premise is that "life should be fun," but if "fun" is observed only after the action is over, how to make life fun is a very difficult question.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/立川 智也/icon' alt='立川 智也.icon' height="19.5"/>Having plans to look forward to in the future is not fun now. Fun is not observable in advance, and can be depressing. An appointment to look forward to is also "fun" in advance, not depressing.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Will it really be "fun" after the fun schedule is over?
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/立川 智也/icon' alt='立川 智也.icon' height="19.5"/>It would be "fun," but of a slightly different quality.

The story after this.
- Aren't "fun" and "enjoyable" two different things?
- What about "interesting" and "fun?"


Preliminary Considerations and Policies
- This time the policy:.
    - The Concept of Interesting
    - Do not care for third parties who are not there,
    - Start the rally as soon as possible
- Last time, the verbal commentary to a third party who was not present prevented the transition to "[[Table Tennis Rally]]" status, which is explicitly prohibited.
- Share the theme at the start point in advance.
    - This smoothes the transition to the rally.
    - When the video is published, you can write "This is a 10-minute conversation about this topic.
        - The viewer can understand what will be discussed in advance, rather than being shown something he or she doesn't understand.
            - Improves the viewer's receptivity
    - The theme was supposed to be "interesting," but due to a conversation we had in the hours leading up to the start of the event about how much fun we've been having lately, I mistakenly chose "fun" as the theme.
        - Well, no harm done.
- Derivative Subjects
        - [[Decisiveness is cultivated through training to focus on one's emotions.]]
        - It explicitly says at this point that "interesting" is included in the "emotion" of "focus on emotion" in this. So there is synergy with the "let's dig into what is interesting" idea.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/立川 智也/icon' alt='立川 智也.icon' height="19.5"/>I think you're using "focus on the emotion" and "properly subjective" almost interchangeably.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I feel there is a difference.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/立川 智也/icon' alt='立川 智也.icon' height="19.5"/>What is lying?"
        - Nishio still hasn't pieced together how this is connected.
