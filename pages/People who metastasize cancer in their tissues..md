Who [[metastasize]] [[cancer of tissue]].
> [masanydayo](https://x.com/masanydayo/status/1821123973670728083) [[people who talk bad]] and [[people who do the bad word dove pigeon]], [[people who don't say what they really mean in meetings]] and [[people who don't try to follow through after a decision]], [[people who justify themselves for not being able to do something]]. and [[who speaks kindly to those who justify]], [[who is grumpy]] and [[who puts grumpy people in a good mood]]. The former is the cancer of the tissue and the latter is the person who metastasizes the cancer of the tissue. It is the management team that makes the body healthy and cancer-free.
