title: 'Can" is not "should."'
---

- In [[Maximize life's happiness]], it is not optimal to think that you "[[should do]]" what you "[[are made]]" to do simply because you can.

- I saw a statement on Twitter that "I'm not interested in it because of its high deviation, but I have to go on to the University of Tokyo's third class of science," and I thought my future life would be hard to live.

- The difficulty is that this statement itself is often mixed with other intentions
    - I think the proposition itself is True...
    - People who "can't do it" think "I can do it, I just haven't done it."
    - The "can't" person [[contempt]] the "can" person to maintain their self-esteem.

Can there be a series of "True but often misguided propositions"?
- Let's see what else we can find.
