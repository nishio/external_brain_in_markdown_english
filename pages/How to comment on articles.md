- 1995: NCSA's [[HyperNews]] provided a mechanism to add a "follow-up response/tree view" at the end of any web page. This is quite similar to today's comment sections, where form submissions are converted to threads. ([W3C](https://www.w3.org/Collaboration/Workshop/Proceedings/P6.html))
    - I don't know about this one, it's "the end of any web page".<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - > gpt5.icon] "Any page": The URL specified in the body can be an external site (provided that it can be read publicly from the server). In other words, you can create a "wrapped display" with any web page URL. The original page itself will not be altered.
        - I think I first experienced something similar to this with [[Hatena Bookmarking]], a type of [[social bookmarking]], because it allowed me to write one-line comments as well as bookmarks.
        - There were other foreign social bookmarks in use at the time, but I can't remember their names offhand, so I don't think I personally use them all that much.
- 1995: CGI [[Guestbook]] became popular, and "comment pages" were set up on each site for visitors to write their impressions. ([scriptarchive.com](https://www.scriptarchive.com/guestbook.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    - I think the metaphor was that it was like a notebook in a physical store or something.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - It doesn't sound like something you'd write in an individual article.
        - I think I experienced something similar with the Perl web bulletin board below, and a rental bulletin board [teacup. - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teacup.).
- 1996: "[[Web bulletin boards]]" such as WWWBoard made by Perl spread, and it became common practice to respond to each topic (article) with a thread. ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/boardwatch-1996-04/boardwatch-1996-04_djvu.txt?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- 1997: [[Slashdot]] establishes threaded comments per news article + user moderation. Direct ancestor of later news/blog comment culture. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [WIRED [https://www.wired.com/2000/04/slashdot?utm_source=](https://www.wired.com/2000/04/slashdot?utm_source=) chatgpt.com])
At the same time, ZDNet AnchorDesk's TalkBack (reader replies) also went live, using an editorial approval and publication system for article-by-article reader submissions. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TalkBack_Reader_Response_System?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [patent image storage [https://patentimages.](https://patentimages.) storage.googleapis.com/8a/d9/79/dd1fef8da13b14/US9529769.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com])
- Blog Context:
    - Open Diary in 1998 is a prime example of an early implementation of the "readers can comment on the diary" feature. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Diary?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    - In the early 2000s, Greymatter (2000)/[[Movable Type]] (2001) and others included comment functions as standard features.
    - [[Blogger]] introduced native comments in a major overhaul in 2004 (prior to that, it used external services such as Haloscan). ([826valencia.org](https://www.826valencia.org/extras/mt-static/docs/mtmanual_about.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Wikipedia [https://en.](https://en.) wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_%28service%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com])
In short: The Web has had a system of "adding a response at the end of an article" since around 1995, and blogs have popularized and popularized this system (especially since 1998).
