title: "Link Suggestions are a good value mess."
---

In wiki systems that do not [[ambiguous search]] by link title when creating a link, you need to know where you are linking to when you create the link.
- In this case, the act of linking is "working with the knowledge you know" for the actor, and you lose money for the time and effort of the work.

Scrapbox has ambiguous search by link title.
    - [[Scrapbox's link suggestions are useful]]
- So the act of trying to create a link is "[[search]]".
    - The actor of the link feels pleasure when the "[[connection]]" is [detected
    - This is the fundamental joy of knowledge being [structuring
- When Scrapbox grows up enough, the expected value of this mess of "trying to make links" and "probabilistic discovery of connections" exceeds zero.
    - Scrapbox is a rather easy "bang for the buck" due to its lightweight link notation, which makes the cost of creating links low to begin with.

Calling both a wiki system with and without this feature a "wiki" [[It's like calling both a Chihuahua and a Doberman "dogs."]]
