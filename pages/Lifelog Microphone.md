title: "Lifelog Microphone"
---

    - Concept of [Lifelog camera
- But when I think about it, I have a strong interest in information being [[converted to electronics]] and later becoming [[searchable]].
- Isn't what we need a lifelogging microphone, not a lifelogging camera?
- A system that automatically [[transcribes]] what is said verbally and makes it searchable.
- Should [[Recoco]] be running all the time?
