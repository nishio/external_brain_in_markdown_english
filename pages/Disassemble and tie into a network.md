I've been observing how he does it, and he [[disassembles]] them into radicals. My son and I don't know most of the radical names like hen and kanmuri, but he loves those parts and explains them to me like "this is this for tsukuri and hen is this".
> [@ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1594110313619935232?s=20&t=ICfk4u9xece1AVOswMAdHg): I guessed the reading from the radical, remembered a word I heard on TV, and thought, "That's the kanji for that? Then they recall the scene in which the word was used and guess that it is used in this kind of situation.
> [@ShinShinohara](https://twitter.com/ShinShinohara/status/1594111137083428864?s=20&t=ICfk4u9xece1AVOswMAdHg): I just have to apply the new kanji in my son's "[[Experience Network]]" and "[[language network]]". Network]" and "[[language network]]". He seems to be able to memorize them almost at once because he works out where they are located in the network and to which they are connected for a while in his mind, instead of memorizing them as if they were just floating in the air.

If you position the new kanji in the network and check which one it is connected to, it is easier to remember it because the knowledge is connected in a network-like way, apparently.
- [[knowledge network]]
- [[Connect to the network]]
- [[location]]
