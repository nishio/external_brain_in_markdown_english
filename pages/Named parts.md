[[Continuity of Democracy]]

- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I heard in an MOT class or something that "Japan's [[well-established]] is a unique and long-lasting organization in the world".
- Personally, I think that "long-lasting" depends on the scale of observation, and what is long-lasting at a certain scale is generated and extinguished at a smaller scale. The same is true of the [[metabolism]] of a biological cell, or the [[construction of a new shrine]] at Ise Jingu shrine.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/blu3mo/icon' alt='blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>There certainly seems to be a bias that tends to focus on the permanence of [[named unit]].


- [[Modular and Integral]]
    - Improvements to [[integral]] systems are not the addition of "named parts".
    - [[unnamed improvement]].
    - [[many improvements in details]] from [/blu3mo-public/XREAL One#67e11fa91286260000982f4c](https://scrapbox.io/blu3mo-public/XREAL One#67e11fa91286260000982f4c).
    - [[Disruptive innovation can occur even when technology develops incrementally]]
    - A series of unnamed minute improvements, which at some point cause a rapid market change.
