- [[the need to establish reference]] in communication also influences [[category coherence]]
    - This proposal was tested in 2 studies involving a
    - referential communication task
    - consistency was promoted between individuals by communication
    - which synchronized the category structures of different people
- Further, people were focused on the commonalities of objects and on the differences related to the commonalities by communication--a pattern that is compatible with what has been observed in existing categories.
