The teacher laughed and said, "I don't think I can answer that now. The teacher laughed and said, "I don't think I can answer that question now. But if you can't answer that question when you are 50 years old, you have wasted your life.
> I continue to ask myself, "What do I want to be remembered by? This is [[a question that promotes personal growth]] because it forces us to see ourselves as different people, people who could be.

It is not just a question, but a mirror of the self, revealing [[the gap between our current and ideal selves]] and showing [[the direction of growth]].
In other words, this question is [[a guide to life]], a guide to understanding ourselves and growing.
