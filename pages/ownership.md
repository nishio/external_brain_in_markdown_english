> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1821487627465609463) I'm not sure about [[human rights]], so I'd like to know if anyone can help me understand it, but that people have the right to PROPERTY and that, I'd like to know if there is anyone who understands what I'm talking about, but I'm not sure if the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] defines that people have the right to property and that property should not be taken away from them, but it does not define what is property, so if this definition is rewritten, the declaration will be meaningless.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1821493301348106432) Examples of reduced definitions of property rights under the GPT include: cultural property designations that deprive people of the freedom to remodel; restrictions on how land can be used under landscape laws, agricultural land laws, and building codes; copyright restrictions regulations, prohibition of circumvention of technical protection measures, restrictions on the use of data under the Personal Data Protection Law, GPL, recall, gun control, animal welfare laws, and trade restrictions under the Secondhand Dealers Act.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1821494289026982397) There are all kinds of restrictions. There are many things that I think "that can't be helped," but what I think can't be helped are restrictions on property rights based on culture or ideology. From a Japanese point of view, I wouldn't like it if my neighbor had a gun, but here in the U.S., it's a constitutional right ([[people's right to bear arms]]).

A low-resolution perception would be, "[[private property rights]] are there!" But if you look at the details, there are many examples of property rights being reduced in order to emphasize [[public interest (e.g., public good)]] or [[social value]].
