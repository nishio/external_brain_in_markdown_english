title: "Obsolescence and Catch-Up"
---

- [[anxiety]] about not knowing the latest
    - [[catch-up]] Leads to an effort to do so.
- On the flip side, the newest ones [[obsolescence]] are faster
    - [[moderation]]
    - Not all the latest, not all the [[classic]], but a balance is important
    - Devote time to the classics [[courage]].
            - [[Time is finite.]] And to devote time to something is to not devote time to something.
            - [[Urgent/Important Matrix]]
            - New things jump in, but you have to go for the classics [[spontaneously]].
            - Chasing new things can actually be done without [[independence]].
