title: "Reading with hands"
---

In Japanese: [[手を動かしながら読む]]. Direct translation: Read while moving hands

What I want to describe:

- While reading books
    - not only by chasing a sentence with eyes
    - but also by using hands
    - concrete examples:
        - by typing the source code,
        - by taking notes of things that you thought important,
        - by developing mathematical expressions.

- suggestion from a reviewer: "[[to learn by writing]]"
    - It is not restricted to "writing", but it looks better than "with hands"
