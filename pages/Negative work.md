title: "Negative work"
---

People who do negative work don't realize they are doing negative work.
- I'm sure they're screening [[mid-career hires]] in a normal company to see if they're people who can do a positive job.
    - What is "[[positive work]]" depends on the [corporate culture
        - There are some companies where coming to work every day and working overtime until later than your seniors is perceived as a positive job.
        - So this is all in the direction of what you think is "positive," or [[matching values]].
- Communities without vetting selection are a problem because people who do negative work get in.
- I guess you could call being able to observe what the community considers positive work and behave accordingly, miscellaneous "[[social skills]]" or "[[collective behaviour]]".
