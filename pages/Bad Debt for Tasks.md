title: "Bad Debt for Tasks"
---

- [[A "super" introduction to task management to end "To-Do Hell]]  p.202
When a task is postponed for no clear reason, it is postponed again the next day because the situation has not changed.
It's harder to get at it because it's not in your hands, and it's harder to get at it because it's not in your hands.
When this vicious cycle turns, you don't want to even see it, and it will collapse, involving that entire task list.

([[black hole]] rather than [[bad debt]])

solution
- Renaming a task ( [[renaming method]] )
- Try it for five minutes ([[Five-minute dash method]])
- Reflect on what you have done about it in the past
- Find out why you decided to do it.
- throw away
