When I was in elementary school, I submitted a summer vacation craft and it was destroyed. [It's a beautiful phrase, but the other side doesn't want to cooperate and has a destructive impulse toward us.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>An artist's loan of his smartphone to a friend, resulting in the intentional deletion of his social networking account, or his experience in elementary school when he turned in a summer craft and it was destroyed in a messy way, are very shocking and tragic. These stories highlight the fragility of relationships, issues of trust, and the reality that the beautiful idea of cooperation across social differences cannot be validated when the other side does not actually want to cooperate and is driven by destructive impulses.

These examples show that no matter how beautiful a philosophy may be, it is difficult to realize it when one party desires a constructive relationship or cooperation, but the other party does not reciprocate or intends to harm it. Especially in situations where creative works and personal identity are involved, these actions can leave deep emotional scars.

The concept of cooperation across social differences paints a beautiful picture of people overcoming their differences and working together toward a common goal in an ideal situation. In reality, however, such cooperation cannot take place without [[mutual understanding]], [[respect]], and [[trust]] as the [[foundation]] of the relationship. The first step in a relationship with a person with destructive impulses is to understand and address the issues at the root of the impulses. This will require dialogue, counseling, and other efforts to unravel the emotions and motivations underlying the problem.

In these difficult situations, it is important for victims to protect themselves and, if possible, seek assistance in repairing the relationship. Society as a whole must also work to prevent destructive behavior and foster an environment of mutual respect and cooperation among people.

Not all people see value in cooperating with others.
This is especially true when the security of livelihood from personal private property is inadequate.
I'm too busy doing my own thing to cooperate!" And that's it.
- So does the dissenting opinion in [Undercover Notes.
