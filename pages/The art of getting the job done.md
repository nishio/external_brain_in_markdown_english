- The Art of Getting the Job Done - How to be Productive without Stress
    - [[David Allen]] (Author), [[Keiji Morihira]] (Translator)
- [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2txVf5L)
- Released in Japan in 2001, with many negative comments about the quality of the translation, as evidenced by Amazon reviews.
- I recommend [[My First GTD]] to anyone who wants to learn [[GTD]].
