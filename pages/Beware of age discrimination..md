title: "Beware of age discrimination."
---

It is discriminatory to treat them differently when their age is not revealed and after it is revealed.
Regarding the statement "[Amazing for such a young man.
- If they are amazing without age, they should simply say "amazing" without any unnecessary reference to age.
- If you are not great in general, but you are great for your age, the condescension that "it's normal for someone your age not to be able to do it" is discriminatory.

It seems that some of you don't get the idea that I'm talking about age, but do you get it when you consider that the statement "You're a woman and you're amazing" is not a compliment, it's a very rude statement? Does anyone even know that this statement is rude?
