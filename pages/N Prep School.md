[N Prep School](https://www.nnn.ed.nico/)
- I am interested in what [[N High School]] is doing as [[A New Form of Education]], but I thought it would be a good idea to enter high school again... but it seems that there is also a prep school.
I would assume that a prep school is for college entrance exams, but it looks like it still includes video editing courses and a monthly fee.
