When people feel that some of their opinions are being ignored by the other party in a discussion, they assume that the other party is consciously ignoring their inconvenient opinions, which is not correct.

Do you have any reason to believe that they are "consciously ignoring it?"
Is the other party "unconsciously ignoring" them?

- [[Communication is symmetrical]], so what you feel is likely to be felt by the other person as well.
Are you "unconsciously ignoring" something yourself? In that case, since it is unconscious, you would not be aware that you have ignored it.

The following is sufficient for a symmetrical composition.
- There is a discrepancy between their areas of focus.
- Unconsciously ignoring things outside of your area of focus
There is no need to assume intent.

- [[communication]]
