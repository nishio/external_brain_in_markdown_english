title: "scheduler"
---

People seem to have an image of a scheduler as something that people use to schedule an hour-long meeting or something like that.
Not so.
- Prioritize tasks
- Decide what to do next.
- Suspend a task
- Switch to other tasks
I am thinking of a program that processes

Shouldn't the scheduler also manage human actions?
- [[pomodoro]] is a preemptive multitasking with a quantum of 25 minutes

But first, you need "[[Clarification of actions]]".
