Scale of Democracy in Classical Athens
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3-mini-high/icon' alt='o3-mini-high.icon' height="19.5"/>In Classical Athenian democracy, political participation was limited to free adult male Athenian citizens. The following are the main features

- Eligibility: adult males with citizenship by birth. Women, slaves, and aliens (metics) were excluded.
- Size: Approximately 10-20% of the total population is covered, and it is estimated that there were roughly 30,000-60,000 citizens in Athens in the 5th century BC.

Thus, while direct democracy was adopted, participation was restricted to a very limited segment of the population.

    - No [[voting rights for foreign residents]] or [women's suffrage
- When there was a distinction between [[free citizens]] and [[slaves]] in the first place.

In particular, the period under Pericles (ca. 461-429 B.C.) is considered the most representative. The overall period of activity is also considered to be between 480 and 404 B.C.
