title: "Teaching materials or games?"
---

I've been wondering if we could create a game that would be beneficial for teaching business administration and how to innovate with the #ManagementGame #ManagementGameProposal.
A realization in the process.
Is it a teaching tool or a game?

- Games must be fun. To be fun, you must be able to influence the situation through your own ingenuity.
- If you use it as a teaching tool, you need to be able to control its development according to what you want to talk about.
    - Binding parameters, determining initial values, disabling some choices, etc.
    - As a game installment, the development of the game is controlled without the introduction of rules, and it is good to add additional rules to diversify the development of the game
