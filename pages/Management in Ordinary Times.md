Contingency management and peacetime management are two different things.
- What is the difference between [[emergency]] management and [[normal times]] management?
- Emergency ([[Contingency Management]])
    - The axis of value is less clear.
        - Like "survive."
        - Catching up with and surpassing the West" is also a state of diminishing axes of value.
            - It is important to know if there are few axes of value.
            - An "emergency" is an example of a situation that arises.
    - Fewer axes, so you can discard what is not relevant to your axis from a lot of information.
        - One or a few people can make a decision.
            - Become an [Achievement-oriented organization
    - The word "[[leadership]]" conjures up images of one person leading many.
        - This is contingency management
    - [[Management in Ordinary Times]]
    - There are plenty of axes to grind in peacetime.
        - Reality is complex to begin with and cannot be expressed on a few axes.
            - I had no choice but to focus on some of them in an emergency.
        - It's cognitively painful for one person to make decisions on multiple scales.
            - When one person tries to make a decision, it exceeds that person's cognitive capacity.
        - I can't make a choice between the two.
            - Difficult to determine "this information is not necessary."
            - Makes it difficult for one person to grasp the whole picture.
            - Tend to get dragged down by [[Quantitative KPIs]].
            - It's hard to recognize a state with a variety of axes, so we jump to a simple scale.
            - We have abandoned a proper understanding of reality with its diverse axes, so the problem is usually a mismatch between simple KPIs and complex reality.
        - The cost of communicating information is greater.
            - Due to the difficulty of discarding
            - Both of the following increase the burden
                - To be transmitted in words.
                - Receiving and understanding words.
        - Best practices in this state are "transfers."
            - Delegate decision-making to those who are positioned closer to specific information
            - Reduce the amount of information transfer required
            - The style of communicating a large amount of complex information from the person who has the information to the person who makes the decision, and then making a decision, is time-consuming & often leads to wrong decisions due to insufficient information communication.
            - Peacetime leadership does not try to centralize everything to itself.
                - Because that's where the bottleneck is.
                - The role of repeatedly transmitting distant goals and guidelines for decision making becomes stronger.
                - Because information dissemination is easily scaled by software.
        - The scale will vary.
                - [[multidimensional organization]].
            - Mixed results are useful in expanding the scope of search
                - [[Trade-offs between use and exploration]]

    - I saw a discussion about the reforms that [[Elon Musk]] is making after acquiring Twitter that are undermining "[[psychological safety]]".
    - Psychological safety is management in peacetime, and contingency management would be appropriate in Twitter's current situation, where bankruptcy is a possibility.
> [@tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1592474413337018369): I feel like you don't know the difference between [[Wartime Management]] and [[Peace Time Management]]!
> We're talking about management in times of war, and you're side-stepping the standards of management in times of peace, so the conversation is getting a bit muddled.
