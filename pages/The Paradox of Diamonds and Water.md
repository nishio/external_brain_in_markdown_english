title: "The Paradox of Diamonds and Water"
---

Why are diamonds more valuable on the market when water is more useful for life?
- [Paradox of value - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_value)

- [[Adam Smith]]
- There are two meanings to the word "value."
    - utility value ( [[utility value]] )
    - Exchange value ( [[exchange value]] )
- Adam Smith believed that exchange value is "determined by the effort required to obtain it" ([[labor value]] theory).
    - Therefore, it has nothing to do with the utility (use value) of goods.

marginal utility
- The value of an object to some people depends on how much they have of it.
    - The more you have, the less it's worth.
        - [[law of diminishing marginal utility]]

    - Water is worth more (A>B), but if a lot of it is supplied, its value goes down (B>C)
    - People dying of thirst in the desert would offer diamonds to get water.
    - Leads to talk of [[rarity]] and [scarcity value
    - The value of a good is not universally determined, but rather the less supply of the good a person wants, the more valuable the good becomes.
    - Rarity alone does not create universal value.
        - If I create a new programming language FooBar now, it is very rare because there is only one user of that language in the world, but it is worthless because no one wants a FooBar programmer.
