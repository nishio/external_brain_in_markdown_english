[empathy gap - looking at a variety of data](https://shioshio3.hatenablog.com/entry/2022/09/03/191426)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This text discusses the following

    - [[Empathy]] is a [[political resource]] and [[social resource]], and the [[distribution of empathy]] varies by [[identity]]. The distribution of empathy is mainly done by [[mass media]].
- An examination of major media tweets from 2010-2015 shows that there were 60 references to [[working class]] and 9664 references to [[LGBT]], a 161-fold gap. In other words, there is an [[empathy gap]] between the working class and LGBT.  #Empathy Gap
- If you leave gaps in empathy, that's where the [[populists]] will take advantage of you. Populists can gain a lot of support with little effort if they target people who have some population and real difficulties but are ignored by the mass media.
- [[Trump]] was able to become president by targeting the [[political blue ocean]] of the [[white working class]], which had been ignored by the mass media.
- Among the vulnerable, there are those who can give a lot of sympathy and those who can't, and by targeting those who can't give sympathy, we can gain political resources without competing with existing politicians. #Attractive Vulnerable.
- If the mass media had covered the white working class more, Trump would not have become president.

In short, the argument is made that the unequal distribution of sympathy by the mass media is a breeding ground for populists.
