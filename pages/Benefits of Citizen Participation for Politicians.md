As a result, the legitimacy of the policy itself is enhanced, and it can also serve as material to persuade opposing opinions.
    - Visualization of consensus building process
        - When it becomes clear "what kind of citizens expressed their opinions and for what reasons," it becomes easier to demonstrate the transparency and fairness of the policy-making process, and politicians are evaluated as "leaders who are close to the citizens.
2. increased evaluation of leadership
    - Appeal for open political stance
        - A posture of dialogue with citizens, rather than one-sided and top-down, gives an image of "not dictatorial. In particular, by utilizing public forums such as social networking sites, it is easier to be perceived as exercising democratic leadership.
    - Mitigation of Conflicts and Presentation of Adjustment Capabilities
        - Politicians who work to facilitate dialogue and collaboration among citizens are seen as "highly competent coordinators. As a result, their reputation as leaders is enhanced, and they are more likely to be reelected or take the next step in a positive direction.
3. cost reduction and efficiency of policy realization
    - Early issue identification and idea gathering
        - By providing a forum for citizens to directly express their opinions, issues and concrete solutions based on on-the-ground sensitivities can be obtained at an early stage. Research and analysis costs can be reduced and more effective ideas may be gathered than relying solely on bureaucrats and experts.
    - Decrease in backsliding
        - Involving citizens in advance reduces the risk of strong opposition later on that could derail the plan. As a result, the time and cost of revisions can be reduced, and policy implementation will be smoother.
4. enhancement of brand image
    - Recognition as a progressive leader
        - Politicians who incorporate "citizen-participatory policymaking," which has been used successfully in foreign cities and elsewhere, are more likely to be seen as progressive and innovative, and may attract attention both domestically and internationally.
    - Appeal to younger generations
        - The younger generation in particular is becoming increasingly willing to participate in politics. By creating a system that makes it easier for them to voice their opinions, it will be easier to attract a new base of supporters and improve the image of "future-oriented politicians.
5. ensuring long-term stability and continuity of policy
    - Citizen-driven policies are resistant to regime change.
        - Policies that are consensus-building through citizen participation are less dependent on partisan or individual leaders and tend to be more likely to be continued even after a change of government. For politicians, this leads to opportunities to build legacy (long-term achievements).
    - Improved investment returns
        - When residents begin to engage in policy as if it were their own, cooperation becomes stronger. As a result, budgetary and time-consuming efforts are more likely to be carried out with a high degree of execution and to generate long-term benefits.
6. strengthening trust with citizens
    - Avoiding Trouble and Scandal
        - Politicians who communicate carefully with citizens on a regular basis give the impression that they will "explain things properly" when uncertain decisions or allegations are made. As a result, they are more likely to avoid major flare-ups.
    - Cooperation in case of emergency
        - In situations where disaster or crisis management is required, the dialogue channels with citizens that have already been established will come into play. Politicians will be recognized as having a system in place that allows them to quickly collaborate with citizens and demonstrate their ability to execute, further increasing their credibility.

3. summary
Despite concerns that "citizen participation risks dispersing power," there are, in fact, tremendous benefits for politicians. From improving policy legitimacy and leadership reputation, to cost savings and brand strength, to long-term policy continuity and trust building, the benefits of citizen participation are many and varied.

If these benefits and rationale are presented in concrete terms, it will be easier to persuade politicians that citizen participation is "beneficial" to them, and consequently, it will be easier for them to positively consider the introduction of such a system.
