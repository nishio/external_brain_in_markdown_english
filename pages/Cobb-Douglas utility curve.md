- Figure shows $u(x, y) = x^{0.5} y^{0.5}$ when a=0.5
- This is just a weighted average if we take the logarithm of x and y, respectively
    - That is, the [[effect]] of one good is proportional to the logarithm of its quantity
            - [[law of diminishing marginal utility]]
- On the other hand, [[budget constraint]] is a straight line on this space that does not take logarithms

Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) utility function
- $u(x, y) = (a x ^ r + b y ^ r) ^ {1/r}$

quadratic
- $u(x, y) = 2 a x - (b - y)^2$
