title: "Leveling up is a fool remedy mechanism."

- [[leveling up]] is a fool [[relief]] mechanism
- If you're smart, you can clear it without leveling up.
    - But releasing the game as it is would make it impossible for anyone who isn't smart enough to complete it.
    - So, I put in a mechanism that allows them to gradually become stronger and clearer by having them repeatedly perform light tasks that they can understand and perform without being smart.
