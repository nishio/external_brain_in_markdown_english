- A: Low quality and high quantity at first
    - Really? Why is that so?
    - So placed in reverse from B.
- B: As quality increases, quantity begins to decrease
    - Improvement in quality is causally related to decrease in quantity.
        - Why?
            - Because they start using it for things they can't disclose.
            - When the total amount of action is constant, some of it moves into unobservable areas, making the observable appear to have decreased
