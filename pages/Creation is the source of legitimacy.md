[Questioning the "Original Conditions of Politics" Hannah Arendt, "On Revolution" | Good Book, Good Day](https://book.asahi.com/article/11581239)
- How did the new constitution gain [[legitimacy]]?
- In America, which has cut itself off from the European [[tradition]], it cannot rely on external [[absolutes]] (God, church, etc.) in politics
- The act of "[[founding]]" a new one that lasts is a source of legitimacy.
- Japanese people do not have a sense of accomplishment that they founded [[the postwar system]] by themselves.
    - The authority created by the act of creation did not dwell in the postwar system.
