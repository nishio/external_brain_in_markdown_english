> When I first started coming to Ghibli (right around the time of Poppy Hill), Mr. [[Hayao Miyazaki]] said that getting older means that the 24 hours in a day become shorter. Specifically, in the case of Hayao Miyazaki at that time, he said it would be 21 hours. When I was young, I could work as soon as I got up in the morning. But now, I get up at 4:00 a.m., take a shower, do dry rub, take a walk, and have a cup of coffee. That takes three hours. Without that, I can't get up and get to work.
>  The time needed for such preparations was gradually extended from one hour to three hours. But as long as you take that time, you can work the rest of the day as you did when you were younger. So getting older means a shorter day. He said such things rather often, and as I recall, they are still in the interview article in Hot Air at that time.
>  I see, very persuasive.
>  At the time, Hayao Miyazaki had just turned 70, and I remember thinking that even at 70, people can still work. In fact, at 70 years old, Hayao Miyazaki was working much longer than I was at that time, when I was over 40. Come to think of it, even Toshio Suzuki, who was over 60 at the time, would usually have meetings and chats at the brick-and-mortar shop after midnight every day. Even so, I heard from the staff around me that he was able to go home much earlier than in the past.
>  Regarding your story about the day getting shorter, how many hours have you had recently? I asked Mr. Hayao Miyazaki when I met him last year. When I explained that he had said this about 10 years ago, he replied a bit negatively, saying that it was a story from the days when people lived only with efficiency in mind. I was encouraged to see that even at 80 years old, Hayao Miyazaki is still changing.
