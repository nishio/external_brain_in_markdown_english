> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1892928895189492043) I heard that "you should plan your play time exactly. I tend to work even on my days off, and I used to think "[[I must rest on my days off]]", but recently I am too tired and "I want to be free from the [[sense of duty (obligation)]] of all "[[I must]]", including "[[I must]] rest"". It became.
- Talk about this: [[Freedom from a sense of social obligation]].

- Thinking that you "have to plan" a vacation can create another sense of obligation, and you may end up feeling tied down. The following are some possible ways to deal with this problem.
    - Decide on only a rough frame of reference.
        - Only decide how you will spend your time, such as "get up slowly before noon" or "do whatever you want in the evening," and do not set too many detailed tasks. This way, you can maintain the framework of a vacation while avoiding a strong sense of obligation.
    - "Focus on [[want to do]].
        - Instead of "I have to rest," be aware of positive reasons for fulfilling your needs, such as "I need to rest because I want to rest," or "I want to play games, so I'll take time off." This will reduce the number of "I have to" and make it easier to be convinced to take action.
    - Keep your schedule "tentative
        - Even if you have made plans in advance, feel free to change them if you feel like doing something else on the day of the event. If you give yourself permission to be flexible and change your plans according to your mood and physical condition, you can lighten your mental load.

The key is to respect the loose framework and your own desire to do things, because the vacation itself can easily turn into a sense of obligation if you think, "I have to plan."
