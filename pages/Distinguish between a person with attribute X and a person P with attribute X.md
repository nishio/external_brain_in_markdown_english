title: "Distinguish between a person with attribute X and a person P with attribute X"
---

Need to distinguish between "person with attribute X" or "person P with attribute X."
- The former concept includes "person Q with attribute X".
- Concepts that do not include the latter.

The latter is the essence of "people p
- It is the individual's interpretation that ties in with "attribute X."
- Could also be "person P with attribute Y."
