    - Related: [[Man is a component of civilization]].
- 2: When I see only people in the [[growth period]], I feel like, "Wow, they're [[growing]]!
- 3: When I look at people I used to know with that feeling, I feel like, "Oh, you're [[deteriorating]].
- 4: But this is like looking at a glass of water that is 80% full and saying, "It's 20% short.
    - It's better to look where you are, not where you aren't
            - [[There's a glass half full of water.]]
    - Also, there's not much value in pointing out that [[decline]] is declining because it's obvious.
            - [[Negative criticism is easy]]
