title: "square block"
---

> Boxes can collapse while being stacked. Math knowledge is a square block. In mathematics, knowledge is square blocks, whereas blocks in other fields are a bit awkward. In mathematics, the blocks are stacked so precisely that you can build very tall towers. You get to a very high level of abstraction. But in other fields, if you try to stack them in the same way as in mathematics, they collapse. So you have to collect a lot of information and stack it in a pyramid, with many boxes supporting it.

> [@hrjn](https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1599544243076616192): it's not limited to [[ChatGPT]], but [[machine learning]] just returns random answers based on a nice biased probability distribution. So, there is no concept of right and wrong. So there is no concept of right/wrong in the first place.
> In principle, I doubt that the concept of [[logic]] exists there. It's just the result of a chain of probabilities that results in a somewhat logical answer.

    - > [@hrjn](https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1599608563407917056?s=20&t=pLigfiQU7yagD4NtDwGBfA): 90% correct [[block (lump of something)]] stacking is an odd thing to say. and by the time you have 5 piles, the percentage of correct answers is roughly 60%.

> In the case of mathematical logic, the chain of logical steps is very long, and the validity of the inference "does not diminish in the slightest. In contrast, the chain of logical steps in the logic of the world is short, and the validity of inferences always decreases at each step. The validity of logic is a function of the situation. Due to the indeterminacy of the situation, the validity of inferences rapidly decreases as the chain of logical steps gets longer.
