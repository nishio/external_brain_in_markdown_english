- [[concrete]] / [[abstract]] is [[false dichotomy]]
- 1: The image of the dichotomous "↔" creates a mental landscape in which the abstract implicitly corresponds to the concrete ([[one-to-one correspondence]]).
- 2: But in practice, there are myriad responses

- [[Concrete experience has myriad aspects.]]
In the first place, "one" is not established in concrete experience.
    - [[innumerable feature (e.g. in a programming language)]]
- Which part is cut out as a chunk is subjective and depends on the context.
