- (Diary of observation of other projects) I see... I guess we could structure it so that the main work is done through private Slack communication, and Scrapbox can be done as a byproduct.
    - It might be hard without someone to summarize.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Maybe it's psychologically safer for the "I'm not comfortable writing in a public forum" or "I'm not comfortable writing a page of thoughts I haven't yet cohered into a shared Scrapbox" type of person.
    - There's a Slack group that I use as a note-taking place.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Not [/villagepump/wells are the strongest because there are no rules](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/wells are the strongest because there are no rules), but only the type of people who don't mind the harsh environment where there are no rules (i.e., no basic reassurance that "you are following the rules and you are good") and all of their actions are publicly available.
    - Those who are not okay with it are in the majority in the entire human race.
    - Sociopaths who feel constricted by rules.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/kuuote/icon' alt='/villagepump/kuuote.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I didn't understand "[[Peace of mind to follow the rules]]" in such a space in the first place, but I guess I was in the minority at that point.
        - I'm inclined to think that such a sense of security would exist in a space where psychological safety is non-existent.
            - I have a feeling this is it.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/yosider/icon' alt='/villagepump/yosider.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Is it more rare for someone to be able to do something when they are told they can do anything?
