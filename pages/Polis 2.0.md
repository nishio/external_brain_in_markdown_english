- This system combines the conventional Polis with a Language Model.
- There are two main functions: 1.
    - a) Use the language model to summarize the opinions gathered in Polis and create a virtual avatar with a comprehensive view.
    - b) The language model understands voting patterns and finds "bridging opinions" that lead the discussion in a constructive direction.
- It aims to go beyond tools for [[moderation]], such as the [[Perspective API]], and allow AI to actively participate in discussions and play a role in facilitating dialogue.
- Polis 2.0 is a state-of-the-art system being developed as part of an experimental effort in Taiwan.
- It aims to support democratic decision-making by aggregating the diverse opinions of citizens and using AI to guide constructive dialogue.

In short, Polis 2.0 is a tool that combines collective intelligence and AI technology to refine online discussions and facilitate consensus building, which Tang believes will play an important role in strengthening Taiwan's democracy.

- > Audrey Tang: And what we call Polis 2.0, which is language modeling and evaluation works on top of this simple base and does two things: Synthesize a summary, including a synthetic avatar; and second, to steer conversation toward bridge-making statements the way your API does.
- Audrey Tang noted that Polis 2.0 is a system based on traditional Polis combined with a language model and has two main features.
    - The first is to summarize the collected opinions and create a virtual avatar with a comprehensive view.
    - The second is to find "bridge-making statements" ([[bridge-making statements]]) that can lead the discussion in a constructive direction, as in the Perspective API
