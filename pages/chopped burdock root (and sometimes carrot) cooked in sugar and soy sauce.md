- I think [[abandoning fairness]] is an important concept.
- The reason why it is important to abandon fairness is that in the process of moving from "no one is doing it" to "many people are doing it," there will always be a situation where "only one person is doing it," and if you say "it's not fair that only he is doing it," then [[the change stops]].
    - see  [[special treatment]]
- Insisting on fairness is seemingly the "right thing to do," but it is harmful because it has a "[[stop the change]] effect" at a time when we are trying to make a [[change]] for the better!
- The word "fairness" has a nice nuance attached to it, but in essence it's "[[homogenizing pressure]]" and "[[peer pressure]]."
- 「 [[hit the bull's-eye]] 」
