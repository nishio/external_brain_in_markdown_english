title: "Assumptive = Hypothetical"

> A person with high [[assumption]] is a person with high [[hypothetical ability]] but low [[Verification Power]].
>  Instead of "You are assuming too much," it would be better to give feedback such as "You have a great ability to create hypotheses, so let's get into the habit of [[verifying]] them with facts.

This is a good paraphrase
- Some people ask questions like, "[[How to create a hypothesis]]?" or "[How do we generate ideas?
    - The process of creating a [[hypothesis]] or [[idea]] is a temporary state of "[[Assumptions with little basis in fact]]".
- If you don't like this "[[Baselessness.]]" or don't feel secure that it could be so, or don't have the [[self-assurance]] to trust your own ideas, or are insecure, you avoid
    - [The rationale is an afterthought.
    - If you ask for [[basis]] early on, the idea breaks down.
- I really like your comment about taking a positive and further extending a trait that is often perceived negatively as "assuming too much."
    - [[mentoring]]
