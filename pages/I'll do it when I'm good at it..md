Because people [Become good at what you repeat,
Someone who says, "I'll do it when I get good at it," and doesn't do it, will never get good at it.
People who say, "I'm not good at this, but I'll do it because I [[want to do it]]," and then do it, become good at it.


Do we need "because we want to?"
Those who say, "I'm not good at this, but [[should do]] so I'll do it," are likely to lose heart before they repeat themselves enough.
