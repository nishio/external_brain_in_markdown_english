- Today's ceiling

Challenging to work in the park as a stress reduction measure
- Related: [[Relax under a big tree]].
- The temperature isn't much of a problem today, as the high is 25 degrees.
- I did have insect repellent.
- Tethering while charging your phone with a mobile battery
- Writing out my mind on my iPad without Wifi connected is, well, as you can imagine, not particularly problematic.
- Test how useful PC + phone tethering + XReal one is.
    - I thought it was hard to see at first, but if I raise the monitor about 3 levels, I can work on it without any problems (I'm writing this in XReal).
        - Work: [[Glen+TBS CROSS DIG]].
- I can normally git clone and talk to Devin even when I'm tethered.
- The problem is that I have to put it away when I need to go to the bathroom.
    - 1:15 p.m. We've cleaned up and will have lunch as is.
- There's a lot of different problems than you'd expect when you're actually trying to do it.
    - If I sit on a bench and put my PC on my lap, it slips because I'm leaning forward a bit.
        - I'm unconsciously standing on my toes or crossing my legs to elevate them, but it doesn't look good for me.
    - It wasn't the heat that was the problem, but rather the wind, which made it chilly for the temperature.
        - I should have brought a long-sleeved shirt, I could only do a T-shirt.
    - I brought 2 liters of barley tea to drink and work on it to guard against heat stroke, which is fine, but when I need to go to the bathroom, unlike at home, I have to put my PC and XREAL away, which is a lot of work.
