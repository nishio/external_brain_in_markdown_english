[[ChatGPT API]]
- 2023-03-01 [Introducing ChatGPT and Whisper APIs](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis)
    - Officials also call it [[ChatGPT API]].
- but can actually migrate from text-davinci-003 to gpt-3.5-turbo
    - > By optimizing the entire system, ChatGPT has achieved a 90% cost reduction since December and is now passing the savings on to API users....
    - > The ChatGPT model family "gpt-3.5-turbo" released today is the same model used in the ChatGPT product. Priced at $0.002 per 1k token, it is 10x cheaper than the existing GPT-3.5 model. The model is also ideal for many use cases other than chat. Early testers are moving from text-davinci-003 to gpt-3.5-turbo with just a few tweaks to the prompts.
- It's not chat-only, but it can do everything that text-davinci-003 was able to do ([doc](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat)).
    - > Although the chat format is designed to make multi-turn conversations easy, itâ€™s just as useful for single-turn tasks without any conversations (such as those previously served by instruction following models like text-davinci-003).
- I think the big industrial impact is that the price of everything will drop to 1/10th of what it was before. I think it's a little too subtle to be taken as a "chat API has grown up, we can chat now!
