Created a landing page for broadlistening on Code for Japan's Notion and a Slack channel `proj-broadlistening`.
[Broad Listening](https://code4japan-community.notion.site/b018bcee86cb4e03829cade5cb62cee6)
> Project Summary
>  This is a place for those interested in using broad listening tools such as Talk to the City and Polis to communicate, ask questions and discuss using Code for Japan's Slack. We also maintain a list of frequently asked questions.
>  Talk to the City" is a waste of time and effort, as it is impossible to communicate in Japanese and to get to know each other. It is a waste of time. It is better to have a place where people who are interested in broad listening can get together in Japan. This is the reason why I created this site.

Made with the intention of announcing on [[2024-09-08-Technology to Support Democracy]] on 8/27 or so.
2024-09-17 It took me a while to get it out in conversation, so I made this page so I can get it out [[quickly]].

I'm very happy to spread my thought to non-Japanese readers.
