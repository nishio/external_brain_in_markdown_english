0:37 I don't know what it is, but my neck and head are stiff and I have a headache. Ugh. Anyway, tomorrow is garbage day.


When I threw away a magazine, I happened to pass by the landlord and he told me to put out the burnable ones in the morning, so I had to bring them back. Bad luck. As I recall, I was stopped by a policeman on my way back to the house and checked my security registration. He thought that I made a big turn to avoid pedestrians, but I did not see the policeman and made a U-turn, so he chased after me.
