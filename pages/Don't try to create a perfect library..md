- We want to eliminate or reduce to 0% the writing of code for the same purpose (A) and
    - Different input types and so on.
        - It could be an array, std::vector, etc.
    - Requires slightly different codes and lots of options.
    - It is necessary to remember that there is an implemented code
    - Needs to be properly documented.
- Costs are inflated by such factors as
    - Cost-effective
        - [[Bad Perfectionism]]
- The idea of A is not beneficial.
- If you don't create a library, you are 100% "writing code for the same purpose".
    - Creating a library will cut down on that a bit.
    - It's important to think B.

I had a conversation with [[Mr. Kawai.]] about this, so here's my note

relevance
