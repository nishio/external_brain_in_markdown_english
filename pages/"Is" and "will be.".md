    - I saw [[The "is" and the "does."]] and thought that there is also a "is" and "becomes" composition, so I let it generate

The ideas of "being" and "becoming" have been important themes in philosophy and linguistics. Each of these concepts represents a fundamental idea of "being" and "change (generation)," and many philosophers have examined them.



## 1. Ancient Greek philosophy
.
### ◉ [[Parmenides]] (ontological approach)
- He stated that "what is is, and what is not is not," and asserted that existence (being) is absolute and change (becoming) is only an illusion.
- For him, the world of truth is unchanging and eternal.

### ◉ [[Heraclitus]] (philosophy of generative change)
- Known for the phrase "[[all things move in and out]] (πάντα ῥεῖ)," he believed that the world always consists of "becoming" (changing).
- He held that "being" is only a momentary state of being, and that reality is in a series of changes.



## 2. Aristotle and [[form and material]]
- Aristotle took "being (existence)" as "[[energeia]] ([[actuality]])" and "becoming (generative change)" as "[[dunamis]] ([[possible state]])".
- He explained that things have "dunamis" (potential) and change when they "energize" (actualize).



## 3. Buddhist "Enki" and "Emptiness"
.
- Buddhism does not recognize a fixed "being (entity)," but rather that all things "become" by "[[karma]] (arising through dependency)".
- In [[hollow]] (ku) thought, there is no independent entity (is), and everything is considered to be continuously changing according to conditions.



## 4. Modern Philosophy
.
### ◉ [[Hegel]] ([[dialectics]])
- He explained "being" and "becoming" as the development of the absolute spirit, based on the dialectic of "positive," "negative," and "congruence.
- Existence (being) shifts to nothingness (not being) through self-denial, and the conflict between the two is integrated into generation (becoming).

### ◉ [[Nietzsche]] (affirmation of generation)
- He criticized the stereotype of "being" and affirmed the process of "generation (becoming)."
- In the concept of "[[eternal recurrence]]," he explained that change is the essence, and that it is important to actively embrace "becoming.



## 5. Philosophy since the 20th century
.
### ◉ [[Heidegger]] (Being and Time)
- The "being (existence)" is considered as temporal and inseparable from the "becoming (generation).
- The term "inherent being" was defined as one that forms itself with an eye toward change and the future.

### ◉ [[Deleuze]] ([[Difference and Generation]])
- He criticizes the fixed concept of "being (entity)" and argues that "[[difference]]" is the essence of reality.
- He emphasized the importance of the process of "becoming" and considered the world to be a "[[place of]] generative change" where new things are always being created.



- Summary
- "is" is treated as a concept indicating a fixed existence or entity.
- "become" is treated as a concept that emphasizes change, generation, and process.
- In the history of philosophy, Parmenides and Aristotle emphasized "being," while Heraclitus, Buddhism, Nietzsche, and Deleuze emphasized "becoming.

Perhaps these two concepts should be considered as complementary rather than simply opposing.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>summary
- The word "nature" traces its origin to the Greek word physis ([[φύσις]]), which was derived from the verb phyō (φύω) (to grow or produce). The ancient Greeks viewed nature as a dynamic process of generation and change, and Heraclitus and Aristotle made it a central concept in their philosophy.
- On the other hand, the Latin word "natura" is derived from "nascor" (born) and from the past participle form "natus" (born). In other words, "nature" has a strong nuance of "that which is born (that which is produced). This is where the English word "nature" was born, and the idea of "giving birth" was inherited as an important element of the Latin side.
- In short,
    - The Greek word "physis" emphasizes "growth/change" and refers to the dynamic generative nature of all things
    - The Latin "natura" emphasizes "born" and "born thing," and its relationship to the concept of "giving birth" is clearly evident.
These overlapped to form the English word "nature.

The Greek word for "nature" is "φύσις (physis)," from the verb φύω (phyo), which means "to grow," "to arise," or "to develop. The word was an important concept, especially in ancient Greek philosophy, where it was taken to mean not only "nature" but also "the inherent nature of things" and "the principle of growth and change.
- φύσις" originally meant "to be born," "to grow," and "to change," and the concept of "nature" itself was not static but dynamic.
    - ◉ Heraclitus (The Flux of All Things)
        - He considered φύσις to be the principle of fundamental change in the world.
        - He taught that everything is constantly changing and exists not as a "fixed entity (is)" but as a fluid "becoming (generative change).
    - ◉ Aristotle (Foundations of Natural Science)
        - He viewed φύσις as "the inherent nature of things and their objectivistic movement."
            - The later Physics([[物理学]])である<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - For example, a tree seed grows by "nature" (φύσις) and eventually develops into a tree.
        - For him, "nature" was "an immanent principle moving toward an end (τέλος, telos).
    - ◉ Sophisto-Stoic (in relation to human nature)
        - The Sophists contrasted φύσις with νόμος (nomos, man-made law) and discussed the relationship between "human nature (φύσις)" and "social norms (law).
        - The Stoics preached "a way of life according to φύσις (τὸ κατὰ φύσιν ζῆν, to kata physin zen)" and believed that a rational man should follow the laws of nature.

2. transition from "φύσις" to "nature
- The Latin word "natura" ("innate nature" or "nature") is the successor to the concept of φύσις, which later became "nature.
- In Latin, however, Aristotle's objectivist meaning became stronger, and Christian philosophy added the perspective of "[[God-created nature]]."
- In modern times, under the influence of Descartes and Newton, "nature" came to be understood as "a world subject to mechanical laws.

Derived from "nascor."
- nation → "a group of people born in the same land"
- native → "of the land of one's birth"
- nascent → "occurring", "initial"
    - 「[[In statu nascendi]]」もこれ系だね<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
