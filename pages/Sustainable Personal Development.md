Sustainable development is an [[unachievable task]].
- The moment development stops, it becomes unattainable.
    - → [[Studying for an hour every day" is unattainable.]]

[[insert other's point of view]].

Let's change the language

I'll make an issue for now, and when I feel like it, I'll break it down into smaller tasks and destroy them one by one.
