- [[Sharing of experiences through SF cannot be summarized]]

No matter what kind of righteous argument you unravel to a panicked person, it won't reach them, so you have to leave them alone.
"I lost tens of millions because of NISA!" are simply liars.
It's a bad idea to eliminate the "mechanism to avoid taxation when there is a profit" when there is a loss.
I don't share the feeling that it's something to put spare funds into in the first place, so I feel like I don't have a choice.
