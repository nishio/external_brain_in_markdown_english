1) Percentage of work that can be digitized (institutional and possibility-based)
- Japan as a whole (based on type of national and local government procedures)
    - About 50-55% of the documents can be put online (all-inclusive survey in FY2024: 51.6% of 75,071 types online). ([Digital Agency [https://www.digital.go.jp/assets/contents/node/basic_page/field_ref_resources/578b4dd0-db54-44da-9850-d76a6248c27f/628232ad](https://www.digital.go.jp/assets/contents/node/basic_page/field_ref_resources/578b4dd0-db54-44da-9850-d76a6248c27f/628232ad) /20250804_private-business-dx_outline_02.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com])
- Tokyo Metropolitan Government (per procedural process)
    - 78.9% have already been digitized (end of 2024/3). ([Shin Tosei - Portal Site for Structural Reform of the Metropolitan Government](https://shintosei.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/post_dashboard_20240530/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [note](https://note.com/kouzoukaikaku/n/n2189bc98755b?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Advanced example: Minato Ward
    - 100% of ward reception procedures are online (2,427/3,425) except for legal restrictions, etc. ([Minato-ku official website](https://www.city.minato.tokyo.jp/houdou/kuse/koho/press/202403/20240327_press02.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Estimated summary: Even in an average city hall, "the majority of work (around 50%)" can be systematically done online. Advanced municipalities are realistic up to around 80%. ([Digital Agency [https://www.digital.go.jp/assets/contents/node/basic_page/field_ref_resources/578b4dd0-db54-44da-9850-d76a6248c27f/628232ad](https://www.digital.go.jp/assets/contents/node/basic_page/field_ref_resources/578b4dd0-db54-44da-9850-d76a6248c27f/628232ad) /20250804_private-business-dx_outline_02.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com], [Shin Tosei - Portal site for structural reform of the metropolitan government [https://shintosei.metro.](https://shintosei.metro.) tokyo.lg.jp/post_dashboard_20240530/?utm_source=chatgpt.com])

2) Percentage of actual online implementation (use)
- According to a nationwide all-inclusive survey, the utilization rate based on the "annual number of cases" of procedures available online rose to about 80% (in FY2024). However, there is a large variation by procedure. ([Digital Agency [https://www.digital.go.jp/assets/contents/node/basic_page/field_ref_resources/578b4dd0-db54-44da-9850-d76a6248c27f/628232ad](https://www.digital.go.jp/assets/contents/node/basic_page/field_ref_resources/578b4dd0-db54-44da-9850-d76a6248c27f/628232ad) /20250804_private-business-dx_outline_02.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com])
- For example, in Setagaya Ward**, the facility reservation rate is 100%, while the child allowance certification rate is 0.4% and the pregnancy notification rate is 0.6%***, which are low in some areas. ([Administrative Information Portal [https://ai-government-portal.com/%E4%BD%8F%E6%B0%91%E5%90%91%E3%81%91%E3%82%AA%E3%83%B3%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E7%94](https://ai-government-portal.com/%E4%BD%8F%E6%B0%91%E5%90%91%E3%81%91%E3%82%AA%E3%83%B3%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E7%94) %B3%E8%AB%8B%E3%81%AE%E6%8B%A1%E5%85%85%E3%81%A8%E5%88%A9%E7%94%A8%E4%BF%83%E9%80%B2/])

Estimated summary: The actual utilization rate based on the number of cases ranges from 3 to over 80%, depending on the field. The rate is high for "document submission, appointment, and certificate issuance" services, and low for consultation and examination services. ([Administrative Information Portal [https://ai-government-portal.com/%E4%BD%8F%E6%B0%91%E5%90%91%E3%81%91%E3%82%AA%E3%83%B3%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E7%94](https://ai-government-portal.com/%E4%BD%8F%E6%B0%91%E5%90%91%E3%81%91%E3%82%AA%E3%83%B3%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E7%94) %B3%E8%AB%8B%E3%81%AE%E6%8B%A1%E5%85%85%E3%81%A8%E5%88%A9%E7%94%A8%E4%BF%83%E9%80%B2/])

3) Is "30% more waiting time" reasonable?
- A small increase in the utilization rate (ρ) at the counter causes a nonlinear increase in waiting time. This sensitivity is also assumed in studies of queue optimization at ward office counters. ([The Operations Research Society of Japan](https://orsj.org/wp-content/corsj/or62-2/or62_2_75.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- With a simplified M/M/s model, assuming a standard: utilization rate of 0.6-0.7 and a 5% reduction in window capacity (= assuming understaffing, increased turnover, and hiring difficulties), the average wait time deteriorates to + about 25-40% (Erlang C approximation).
→ In other words, "30% increase" is a conservatively "possible" level.

Background: Municipalities are experiencing apparent recruitment difficulties and an increase in the number of young employees leaving the workforce. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications' release of the Local Government Capacity Management Survey and various other surveys show continued difficulty in securing human resources. ([e-Stat [https://www.e-stat.go.jp/stat-search/files?cycle=0&layout=dataset&month=12040604&stat_infid=000040248903&toukei=00200216&](https://www.e-stat.go.jp/stat-search/files?cycle=0&layout=dataset&month=12040604&stat_infid=000040248903&toukei=00200216&) tstat=000001226021&year=20240&utm_source=chatgpt.com], [Maniken - New Manifesto Institute for Regional Management - [https://maniken.jp/blog/2745/?utm_source=](https://maniken.jp/blog/2745/?utm_source=) chatgpt.com], [Jichitai Works](https://jichitai.works/article/details/2660?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

4) How realistic is "hassle reduced to 10%"?
- Self-issuance of certificate issuance: Convenience store issuance has recently been in the low 2%-5% of the population per month (30-60% per year) processed outside the counter = almost no staff labor for the relevant portion. ([Japan Library and Information Society [https://www.j-lis.go.jp/file/%E3%83%9E%E3%82%A4%E3%83%8A%E3%83%B3%E3%83%90%E3%83%BC%E3%82%AB%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E5%88](https://www.j-lis.go.jp/file/%E3%83%9E%E3%82%A4%E3%83%8A%E3%83%B3%E3%83%90%E3%83%BC%E3%82%AB%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E5%88) %A9%E6%B4%BB%E7%94%A8%E3%81%AE%E6%8B%A1%E5%A4%A7%E3%81%AB%E5%90%91%E3%81%91%E3%81%9F%E3%82%B3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%93%E3%83%8B%E4%BA%A4 E4%BB%98%E7%AD%89%E8%AA%AC%E6%98%8E%E4%BC%9A.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com])

([Digital Agency](https://www.digital.go.jp/policies/administrative_procedures_online))

Estimated Summary:
- If the target work is "application input, certificates, and reservations," the man-hours per case for staff can be reduced to **10-30%** in practice, and **around 10%** is also within reach if optimization is advanced. ([Administrative Information Portal [https://ai-government-portal.com/ai%E3%83%BBrpa%E7%AD%89%E3%81%AB%E3%82%88%E3%82%8B%E6%A5%AD%E5%8B%99%E5%8A%B9%E7%8E%87%](https://ai-government-portal.com/ai%E3%83%BBrpa%E7%AD%89%E3%81%AB%E3%82%88%E3%82%8B%E6%A5%AD%E5%8B%99%E5%8A%B9%E7%8E%87%) E5%8C%96/?utm_source=chatgpt.com], [Japan Library and Information Society [https://www.j-lis.go.jp/file/%E3%83%9E%E3%82%A4%E3%83%8A%E3%83%B3%E3%83%90%E3%83%BC](https://www.j-lis.go.jp/file/%E3%83%9E%E3%82%A4%E3%83%8A%E3%83%B3%E3%83%90%E3%83%BC) %E3%82%AB%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E5%88%A9%E6%B4%BB%E7%94%A8%E3%81%AE%E6%8B%A1%E5%A4%A7%E3%81%AB%E5%90%91%E3%81%91%E3%81%9F%E3%82%B3%E3 83%B3%E3%83%93%E3%83%8B%E4%BA%A4%E4%BB%98%E7%AD%89%E8%AA%AC%E6%98%8E%E4%BC%9A.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com], [Digital Agency [https://www.](https://www.) digital.go.jp/policies/administrative_procedures_online])
- A 30-70% reduction in procedures involving consultation, review, and on-site verification is a realistic range. ([Digital Agency](https://www.digital.go.jp/policies/administrative_procedures_online))
- On the overall average (mixed window portfolio), **first, "40-70% reduction" (= 30-60% remaining for labor)** is a primary target in line with Japan's current situation. **An advanced municipal design could aim for up to "20-30% remaining "**. ([Shin-Tosei - Tokyo Metropolitan Government's Structural Reform Portal Site](https://shintosei.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/post_dashboard_20240530/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Minato City Official Website](https://www.city.minato.tokyo.jp/houdou/kuse/koho/press/202403/20240327_press02.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

5) Digital divide (the size of the "unusable" population)
- Personal smartphone ownership reaches over 80% (R6 survey). ([Current Awareness Portal](https://current.ndl.go.jp/car/253615?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- However, Internet use among 70-79 year olds is about 67%, and 36% among 80+ year olds (R5).
⇒ Since approximately 30 to 60% of the elderly remain "non-users" of online services, it is essential to design a system based on the premise of mixed contact points. ([National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT)](https://www.nict.go.jp/info-barrierfree/relate/statistics/elder_net.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Rough Conclusion (Estimation based on the Japanese situation)
- "30% more waiting time": can be established (+25-40% with a 5% reduction in capacity). Without countermeasures, it could be **+70-100%** locally. ([Operations Research Society of Japan](https://orsj.org/wp-content/corsj/or62-2/or62_2_75.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- "10% of the hassle:
    - Limited scope (certificate, reservation, simple application) is reasonable.
    - The current average for the agency as a whole** "30-60% remaining" is a realistic first landing point. Advanced design will bring it to "20-30% remaining "**.

How do you deal with a generation that does not have access to smart phones or computers?

kuboon
I would like to come up with a system that allows these people to benefit indirectly as well.

Tanaka Isamu
Instead of giving away 100,000 yen gift certificates and 20,000 yen before the election to every citizen, they give away smartphones.


NISHIO Hirokazu
You don't have to do anything in particular to those people.
If digitization is not promoted as it is now, the waiting time in the city hall queue will increase by 30% due to the lack of manpower, but if smartphones and PCs are used, the time required for both the applicant and administrative staff will decrease by about 10%. This reduction in time and effort will also reduce the waiting time for those who cannot use smartphones and PCs.

We haven't cut down, because we can still follow the same procedures as before.
