title: "Not A to B or B to A, but A⇄B"

- Is the direction of causality A to B or B to A?
- There is a situation of "[[Rolling Snowball]]" and "[[Positive feedback]]" that strengthens each other in both directions of A⇄B instead of either one.

- Depending on whether you observed A or B first, the other one appears to be the cause.
    - So different people have different opinions.
- The initial reason for the seriousness of the situation caused by this positive feedback could be very trivial or just luck
    - So it's hard to think of it as a "cause".

Specifics.
- When I teach things to people who are not very smart, they argue with me like, "No, I don't think so.
    - You're "too dumb to understand and accept explanations that contradict your preconceived notions."
    - 'I lost the opportunity to train myself to think because I couldn't accept explanations that contradicted my preconceived notions, so I became dumb?'
    - →Which is it? may be [choosing the wrong two options
