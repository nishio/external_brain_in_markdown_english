title: "The theory that the less planning skills people have, the more they contribute to society."
---

When the feasibility and sustainability of the project is pointed out, the response is, "[[Are you]] not going to make a contribution to society?
- In other words, the situation is that it is necessary to "recognize the problems of the project and improve it," but those who are unable to do so mistakenly believe that they can push through under the brocade flag of "this is a contribution to society.
- He himself doesn't realize that he is stopping his thinking with "this is a contribution to society".

If you want to do that, you need to have the appropriate resources or a business model that will allow you to operate autonomously, otherwise, even if your project is approved, it will just end up being a flop and cause trouble for the people involved.

But I tell them that if they want to do it that badly, they can do it privately with their own money and I won't stop them, but then they go back to talking about the company's contribution to society.
    - [[use one's own money]]

> [AntiBayesian](https://x.com/AntiBayesian/status/1407851449665478657) I put aside the fact that a company is not there to contribute to society, but if you are going to contribute to society, you have to realize and maintain it, so you have to plan for it even more. It is not that I don't want to contribute to society, but I have learned that it is very difficult to get people to understand the distinction between the two.

> AntiBayesian []](https://x.com/AntiBayesian/status/1407857331623190530) I have learned that people who have no planning skills, no passion, no planning, but when the word "social contribution" is attached to an event, they have a "sense of versatility" that they are talking about something of a higher level, and they think that the smallest details can be taken care of for the sake of the "right". I've been to some events where I could see that the projects that come out are biased towards social contribution projects because people have no planning skills and no passion, but they have a [[sense of versatility]] that they are talking about a high level of things when they talk about social contribution and [[neglect]] to take care of the details because they are [[right]]... (I just realized that the event was poorly designed...)

> [AntiBayesian](https://x.com/AntiBayesian/status/1407858106755813376) To be honest, I was thinking, "Well, why are you planning this...?" I was thinking "Why are you doing this?" until a while ago, but I guess I haven't done enough prep work to prepare a template or something to convey the intention of the event. I know that I can't get around to that, but if that's the case, I guess I should just put in a phase like the qualifying rounds to shake things out....
>  No, it was a matter of my design skills...

> [AntiBayesian](https://x.com/AntiBayesian/status/1407860347420037121) I was in a bad mood because my reply first thing in the morning was painful, but after 2 minutes of hatred, I finally found a lot of things to improve the event. I'm not going to go on with the story if I blame others.
>  Let's all read [[1984]], let's do it [[2 minutes of hatred]].
    - [[two-minute hatred]]
