title: "Offsetting Mean Regression"
---

Suppose that some measure is applied to the top 10% of the grade distribution. If the distribution is random, [[mean reversion]] will cause a "drop in the performance of the target for which the measure was taken". How effective must the measures be in order to prevent the decline? This can be expressed by a mathematical model.
