I see...
- Confronting the curse with the purchase of gold coins does not buy the genus state.
    - This claim could be verified with an average purchasing power calculator.
- Trying to discard curses with compression cards is also futile.
    - Unless you're in a position where the compression is working before you hit the curse and you can hit the card for compression every time.
- Buy a province with 5 gold. One more mountain when the province and the curse withers.
