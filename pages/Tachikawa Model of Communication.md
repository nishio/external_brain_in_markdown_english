title: "Tachikawa Model of Communication"
---

On 2018-11-07, Tomoya Tachikawa gave a lecture on "Entrepreneurship and Omnidirectional Communication" at [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]]'s Tamachi campus. The mental model of [[communication]] introduced in the lecture was interesting, so I wrote it down.

Mr. Tachikawa's Yosuga Co. runs a marriage agency. I have never used a marriage agency, so I had no idea what it was like, but it seems that a person in the role of coordinator communicates with clients and helps them to make things go in the right direction. As the president of a coordinator himself, Mr. Tachikawa has a business need to verbalize and teach other employees how to promote good communication.

On the other hand, I have the feeling that [[communication is not good]]. What is the difference between our mental models?

Tachikawa-san suggested that "communication" should be broken down into its various components, rather than being considered as a single, vague entity, and drew a diagram of [[event]], [[representation]], [[verbalizing]], and [[interpretation]]. At first glance, this model seemed to be the same as Nishio's original model that "[[fact]] and [[interpretation]] should be distinguished," but upon closer listening, there was a big difference.

In Mr. Tachikawa's model, there is an event in the mind of the other party, that event is verbalized and becomes an expression, and then I interpret that expression. In my "[[Distinction between fact and interpretation]]" model, on the other hand, the other party's verbalized expression is the fact, which I interpret. I ignore the other party's inner world because it is unobservable.

For example, one person may want to "start some conversation" and ask, "Did you change your glasses?" I might say, "When was the last time we met? To which I reply, "When was the last time we met? (true story) "Did you change your glasses? (true story) I took "Did you change your glasses?" literally as a question, "Did you change your glasses between the last time we met? I took "Did you change your glasses between the time we met before and now? Did you change your glasses?" I don't think there is a different intention behind the expression "Did you change your glasses?

In other words, there were two points of distinction in "distinguishing between events and expressions," and I was distinguishing the latter point. I called it "the distinction between fact and interpretation. On the other hand, I did not distinguish the first half at all. This may be the reason for my difficulty.

According to Mr. Tachikawa on this page
- > This story about the glasses as an example, it's not a normal problem for communication, or as a result, you get what they are trying to do lol.
- > I don't think you're responding to the other person's intent if you cut off the conversation with "Yes, I changed my glasses.
- So I unearthed the actual statement.

    - In fact, "Did you change your glasses?" to which he replied, "I don't know," and after returning home he looked them up and reported that he had changed them on March 2 of last year.
    - > www, it's pretty hard for them to answer "I don't know".
