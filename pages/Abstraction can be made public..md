- The questioner believes that "[[knowledge gained while working]] is confidential information and cannot be output to the world."
- There are two types of outputs.
    - Put it out where only you can see it.
        - If you write in text format, you will receive "[[three advantages of writing]]".
        - Stock and make use of past knowledge
        - Write first for your own reuse.
        - I'll leave it so you don't erase it.
    - put on the market
        - As you [[abstraction]] to make it easier for you to [[reuse]], the specific [[context]] can be detached and made public.
        - Examples to be abstracted and published:.[[The fastest course is not the fastest." birth process]] <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Accumulate first, rather than suddenly output to the world.
- This area of discussion is related to tokoroten's "Increased abstraction ability allows us to avoid NDAs."<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
