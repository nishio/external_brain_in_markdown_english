title: 'Both "Web3 is wacky" and "Web3 is AI" are clunky expressions.'

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1647506503941910528) "[[Web3 is wacky.]]" and "[[Web3 is AI]]" are both clunky expressions. Web3 looks like wacky because we are looking at the peak of a fad, and Web3 looks like AI because we are looking at a future in which both are connected.

    - [[The only reason it looks like it's over is because all you see is an upswing in the trend.]]

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1647506967945166849) The overhyped part of Web3 is going to face a period of disillusionment in the future, and since AI is also overhyped at the moment, it will face a period of disillusionment a little further down the road. And in the future, a better future will be realized by connecting the good half of each technology.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1647509313597112320) I think it's troublesome that people who emotionally pump their fists in the air at this point in time could curse themselves by their actions and 10 years from now [[The Elderly Resist Social Change]], there's a fair chance that they will become so-so and troublesome. Well, maybe then they'll rename it so people won't know it's a Web3-derived technology.
