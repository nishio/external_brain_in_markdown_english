title: "Community design that allows newcomers to create a community."

[[Newcomers]] can create a community [[community design]].

> [realNuun](https://x.com/realNuun/status/1830508300129202547) We've been working hard to grow our [[Community]] service and it's going well, but I wonder if [[Number of Dunbars]] constraints make it impossible to scale around a single community when you want to scale indefinitely. However, I suddenly realized that it might be unreasonable to focus on a single community when we want to scale it infinitely because of the [[Number of Dunbars]] constraint. It seems to me that we need a structure that allows users to create multiple communities on their own.

> [gdvonly](https://x.com/gdvonly/status/1830635915917881699) There are a number of dampers, but to begin with, communities are basically [[newcomers can't speak]].
>  So if you only have one community, the number of people you can talk to won't increase all the time.
>  Well, but the existing members are enjoying themselves, and they don't want to bother with newcomers.
>  So, rather than having existing members start a new community when they become aware of it, it might be better if the person can start their own community at the same time as new members join.

> [realNuun](https://x.com/realNuun/status/1830637380778578358) I see...!
>  The "newcomers can't speak up" problem is exactly what I'm feeling right now.
>  We need to make it so that "newcomers can create a community" (in our service, it would be good to have influencers and their fans come together to create a community).

> [gdvonly](https://x.com/gdvonly/status/1830638704622539226) Yes. That's how all social services are designed in the first place!
>  In an influencer-centered community, as is basically the case with the Liver app and others, there's a crazy incentive for distributors to give a shit about new viewers.
    - [[side of well]] associated with a culture of greeting newcomers all over the place.

> [gdvonly](https://x.com/gdvonly/status/1830640261116105183) > The person can start their own community as soon as they enter a new one.
>  Oh, here's the thing, it may be a hurdle unless you can "easily bring in your existing network of real or other media"!
>  In the first place, it's more advantageous to have a social like that, but with something like 2chan, you start with ROM. So I hear that the experience of the reader is very important.

> [realNuun](https://x.com/realNuun/status/1830645072096031166) I see what you mean.
>  I'm sure you spend most of your time on the "[[welcome first-timers]]" section of [[Iliam]]'s distribution.
>  With our service, it will be like having X's network as it is.
>  A mechanism to gather potential serious users like [[ROM-only]], certainly seems important.

> [gdvonly](https://x.com/gdvonly/status/1830645957463269486) Yes, that's right. I'm going to be ROMing over 90% of the time to begin with.
