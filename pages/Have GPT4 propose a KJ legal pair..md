###
Breaking the chronological structure by chopping
Scattered topics
Destroying the structure of the time series
Cannot create new topic-oriented structures
Gradual value in time frame as well.
associative retrieval
draw a line
Relieve the pain of destruction
### SAMPLE
A: destroy the structure of time series, B: cannot create a new topic-oriented structure, C: cannot create a new topic-oriented structure without destroying the structure of time series, score: 95
A: moderate value over time, B: softens the pain of destruction, score: 5
A: topics are scattered, B: draw a line, C: topics are scattered, draw a line to connect them, score: 80
A: topics are scattered, B: ease the pain of destruction, score: 5
```

return

```
Of course, below are a few examples of pairs that can be created from a given text:

A: chop and break the structure of the time series, B: break the structure of the time series, C: chop and break the structure of the time series at the same time, score: 100
A: topic scattered, B: unable to create new topic-oriented structure, C: topic scattered, unable to create new topic-oriented structure, score: 90
A: associative search, B: draw a line, C: draw a line based on associative search, score: 75
A: chop to break the structure of the time series, B: draw a line, C: chop to break the structure of the time series and then draw a line, score: 65
A: time-based value, B: associative search, C: associative search with time-based value, score: 50
A: scattered topics, B: associative search, C: associative search due to scattered topics, score: 70
These pairs are based on the relationships between lines of a given text. The score reflects how logically connected those lines are and how easy they are to put together.

It's difficult to give instructions with just a prompt, but if you let [[fewshot]] in a case study, you can do it rather well.
