- Mr. B observes X and Y
- Sharing Y information is prohibited for some reason.
- So even though both A and B behave rationally, they disagree.
- These things happen, don't they?
    - I know there is, unless you're in B's position to know that in and of itself.
    - Therefore, A judges B to be an irrational person who makes a different judgment for unknown reasons compared to a rational judgment based on the information in his observation range.
    - This judgment itself is an erroneous judgment due to the narrow scope of observation

- Cannot [[information sharing]] to [People with a narrow range of observation
