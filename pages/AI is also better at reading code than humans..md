> [mizchi](https://x.com/mizchi/status/1829741084081328220) In a few years, the code written by AI will be the core of the business and the business has grown, but nobody can [[reading comprehension]] the core code. I'm sure there will be companies like that.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1830117614430863868) In addition, AI is better at reading code than humans.
- [[code reading]].

I'm sure there are plenty of them.

> [masanork](https://x.com/masanork/status/1830226201077780697) It happens so often with humans that I feel we have no choice but to cry [[reverse engineering]] or rewrite, but I think it is likely to happen that code intended for completely different business purposes will get into the training data or prompts and do something bad. I think it is likely to happen that code with a completely different intention from the business purpose will do something bad by being mixed in with learning data or prompts. I'm especially concerned about content moderation.
