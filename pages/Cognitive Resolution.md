title: "Cognitive Resolution"
---

Even when looking at the same object, a person's [[recognition]] resolution is different if the person has a high resolution or a low resolution.

    - Based on the discussion in [[Difference between resolution and resolving power]]:.
    - The title of this page should be [[Cognitive Resolving Power]] or simply [Resolving Power
- On the other hand, in places it is clearly explained by comparing it to a display
    - This is used indistinguishably because I recognized the camera process and the display process as one process.
        - This is itself a case of low resolving power.
- It doesn't look like it can be fixed by replacing it all at once.
    - Let's write it like this and then gradually fix it.

I used to paint two-dimensional pictures, but I thought a one-dimensional version would be better.
    - [[A series of pictures of two people saying different things]] I realized that I could put it in the "A series of pictures of two people saying different things" section, so I redrew it.
- After drawing it, I noticed a diagram similar to [The "resemblance" is not true.
- In the previous figures, the boundary itself was out of alignment, but this also caused the meaning to be different from the "difference in resolution"; this time, the boundary is aligned.
        - [Even if the resolution is the same, there are individual differences in the way they are delimited.

- I found the following on the page [[One-dimensional version of cognitive resolution]].
>  I added the diagram I wrote in [The "resemblance" is not true.
>  [[Cognitive Resolution]] drew in two dimensions, but this is drawn in one dimension. What is being represented is the same.

- The [[visibility]] of the same object taken with a high camera resolution is different from that taken with a low camera resolution
- Even when looking at the same thing in the same way, a person's [[recognition]] resolution will look different if his/her [[recognition]] resolution is high or low.
    - [[Interpretive sway of proximity of meaning]] also due to difference in [resolution (e.g., display, dpi)

- Example of low resolution
    - A big bug flew in!"
- Example of high resolution
    - A [[oriental skylark]] flew over, no harm done."
    - A wasp flew in, and it's making a ticking warning sound, oh no!
    - [Oscillatoria - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%AA%E3%82%AA%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AB%E3%82%B7%E3%83%90)
        - Large insects you see in urban plantings, etc.
        - Some people are afraid of them because they mistake them for bees, but they are harmless.
    - [Wasp - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%BA%E3%83%A1%E3%83%90%E3%83%81)
        - > M wasps have a strong defensive behavior of their nests and territories, so when approaching within 10 meters of a nest or territory, they will fly around the approaching person in an alarming behavior.... When wasps approach a nest or engage in a standoff with a bee, they will engage their left and right mandibles and strike each other, making a warning "ticking" sound, which is the final warning stage. In reality, most of the time, they attack in groups without warning. ) If you hear this sound, you should leave immediately as instructed.

There was also a related page called [[Resolution of reality]].

- On 2019-04-22, I wrote an example of [[Ooskasiba]] in the family Sparidae.
- Below is the Ooskashiba

- I didn't know the difference between the two.
    - When I saw the following video, I almost answered "What's this?" I was about to answer "a toucan" to the person asking "what is this?", but someone answered "a robin" first.
    - I looked them up and found that they are both in the family [[tinned plants]].
        - In other words, I would have recognized all creatures with the characteristics of the tinhorn moth collectively as the "giant skylark."
        - Typical example of low resolution
