> [hmikitani](https://x.com/hmikitani/status/1945682436563812500) Urgent bulletin I just wanted to inform you that Rakuten Group will be taking a "special leave of absence" tomorrow morning, Friday the 18th, so that employees can "vote in advance" for the House of Councillors election, which is in the middle of a three-day weekend. We will have a special holiday tomorrow morning, Friday the 18th, so that our employees can go to the polls to vote in advance. Let's all think seriously about the future of Japan and vote.


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1945719065303265553) @tsuda's assertion that because supporters are making these claims, the key members of the party must be making the same claims is ridiculous.
>  Supporters can be anyone who wants to become one, and at this point there are more than 15,000 of them, so it is too strange to consider their individual claims to be the party's claims.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1945721823427223836) I think this is an absurd claim on the same level as "Tsuda-san's followers were making radical claims, so Tsuda-san must have the same ideology".
>  Since, moreover, Team Mirai's vision is "not to incite division," I think the proper interpretation of this case is "supporters who don't properly understand the vision are saying strange things.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1945544130890969286) Supporters of Team Mirai also said, "Other parties did this! Why don't we do it too?" We often get suggestions like this.
>  Team Mirai is learning a lot because legal checks are running and returning "OK!" or "It's completely illegal" or "It's gray, so Team Mirai has a policy not to do it".
>  >km55ep: When you're running an election, some of the political insiders (including incumbent politicians)
>  "I did it in another election and didn't get caught, so I'm fine."
>  > Sometimes people say things like that, but you should never trust them.
>  By analogy, just because you ignored a stop but the police weren't there, a violation is still a violation. Public election law, read it properly.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1945545716346359882) The public election law is too strict to do many things I want to do (like showing a real-time transcription of a street speech for people who are hard of hearing would be an illegal graphic display). ), but even if it is a bad law, the current law is the rule, so breaking the rule is not a good idea.
>  I want to "AI anon in an ad truck" in the next election!
> [km55ep](https://x.com/km55ep/status/1945544749546705315) Excellent.
> [munimo](https://x.com/munimo/status/1945624016993358159) This area is important because if legal is not functioning, compliance checks cannot be done and even individual statements can get a leg up. It's just a quintessential team.
> [hi_saki2813](https://x.com/hi_saki2813/status/1945647296596906197) I see that Team Mirai is circulating an email to supporters with the title "Voting Day Reminders".
>  "We follow the rules exactly. We are really shrewd and very disciplined in terms of "making sure our supporters know about it".
> [okanetsukai](https://x.com/okanetsukai/status/1945626887373689019) This is the way things are supposed to be done in a company's business, and I think it is a reliable point to do such a natural thing in a natural and neat way.
> [nonam_umei](https://x.com/nonam_umei/status/1945654616714362978) important.
>  It's amazing that you're creating an environment where this can be taken for granted.
> [anne_des_anne](https://x.com/anne_des_anne/status/1945770782254330190) Legal checks are a strong feature of governance. It is the basis of risk management, but it is still often neglected.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1945523323456356787) I like simulation-type games, but I've been so busy with the election that I haven't been able to play any of them, and then after the election, do I play games? I've been thinking about it a bit, and I'm feeling that I'm tired of processing information digitally, so I'd rather be climbing a mountain or something. Maybe I'll climb Mt. Takao. w

- Grok, you're being too harsh.


> [shuzonarita](https://x.com/shuzonarita/status/1945845918844277102) Miscellaneous thoughts on the House of Councillors election
>  ・It is still a strong issue to abolish the consumption tax, benefits, and how to make a living in the immediate future.
>  Whenever a foreigner issue becomes a hot topic with a prominent keyword such as "Fat First," other political parties try their best to counter it, and the trend is amazing.
>  ・Those short-term coping strategies and right-left policy implementation are not what made "Japan today" and the "lost 30 years".
>  ・But it's also true that taking a prominent position, such as a short-term viewpoint rather than a long-term viewpoint, or a confrontation or division of the pie rather than an expansion of the pie, will get more votes.
>  In the wake of this trend, the Liberal Democratic Party and the New Komeito are likely to be very tough this time around.
>  ・Are we going to have a regime change? I guess the whole nation is suffering and angry at that time or even more (well, wages are not going up, taxes and social security are going up, prices are high, and life is really tough...).
>  ・However, even if you accumulate those short-term measures, won't that essentially change things, or rather, make them worse?
>  ・If we don't lighten taxes, spend more money, and invest in growth, our finances will naturally suffer more in the future!
>  ・ Won't the people of the future be the ones to bear the brunt of this? (No, the current generation, too...?)
>  ・ I think "Team Mirai" or "Path of Revival" is saying let's face that problem head on and make the right investments in the long term for the country, but I wonder if we can get the "2% support" in that...?
>  ・ "Don't lick the Japanese voters," Mr. Anno said, but I wonder if there are many people who can think from such a long-term perspective...?
>  -This will be a touchstone Upper House election that will test Japan as a whole

> [Dokondodo](https://x.com/Dokondodo/status/1945875335603696125) Are we who vote also being tested...

> [VgHmaeqEqo53048](https://x.com/VgHmaeqEqo53048/status/1945857978349002907) I voted for Team Mirai because I believe we can be that 2%. I believed what Masaru Sato said about us being "[[not]] powerless."
