title: "Effect of backlinks"
---

- I wrote about the effectiveness of [[backlink]] because Nishio-san, who usually uses [[Scrapbox]] with backlinks, asked me for my opinion.

For example, if you look at the [[Abstract Page]] called "Social Proof
[https://scrapbox.io/nishio/社会的証明](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/社会的証明)

There you will see a page that records the use of that keyword in a specific conversation.
[https://scrapbox.io/nishio/高速道路のたとえ](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/高速道路のたとえ)

- The [[abstract concept]] page is supplemented with [[concrete]] examples to clarify the meaning, and the [[Specific Usage Examples Page]] provides explanations for abstract concepts that are used without explanation.
The beauty of Scrapbox is that this can be achieved by "drawing a marker on important keywords in specific conversations.

bad example
- All "concrete conversations" and very few abstractions of them.
    - Example: Chat conversations and then "what was that?" after a year because no one keeps them organized.
- All "abstractions" and no concrete conversations.
    - Example: There is a work procedure document in the company wiki, but it is wrong, and the first time user has to have a conversation with others to solve the problem, but the same thing is repeated because the conversation takes place in a place that is disconnected from the document.

Ideally, the operation of Scrapbox would support the process of [[crystallization]] of abstract concepts.
- Scrapbox takes [[2 hop link]] one step further than backlinks. This is very useful.
    - [[Scrapbox reminds me of what I've forgotten.]]
    - [[It is not enough to have pages of concrete facts and pages of abstract concepts]]
