I feel that the development of AI will increase the threshold between "those who try to learn" and "those who don't." I think that the development of AI will increase the threshold between "those who try to learn" and "those who don't.

I don't think it is a good idea to widen the gap in both goods and knowledge. The educational gap should not be self-imposed.

- [[disparity]]

I believe that once the gap widens, it's inevitable.
    - [[Widening of the Good Gap]]
- Once [[the age of 100 million middle class]] is over and the lives of "those who don't try to learn" are in shambles, and after seeing that, "[[encouragement of learning]]" agaain will be

I think it is not a matter of "education" but of "willingness" that people who are not willing to learn cannot learn. In order for motivation to arise, we need to see and hear about situations where "it's a loss if you don't learn", so I think we need to go through a period where "people without motivation to learn" are ripped to shreds by AI once they get there.

Let's install a system in which public libraries are equipped with broadband Internet access and AI librarians can suggest appropriate online class videos for students to watch after consulting with them.
