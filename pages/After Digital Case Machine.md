>  [[Yasufumi Fujii]] AI shadow alter ego in production can normally be used for English and Chinese operations. I'm not proficient in translating coined words, but I can handle it if I only decide on the English and Chinese translations of technical terms and create a translation definition document.

>  Overseas deployment of Beebits' UX methodology is going to be so much easier. Amazing. The creation of #[[AI shadow alter ego]].

> [numeroFujii](https://twitter.com/numeroFujii/status/1723697668361212045) I spent the day today trying out the miibo version I've been making and the GPTs version, and it was by far the miibo version.

>  With miibo, if you load a book, it will follow the theory and look up examples from around the world, and even provide examples that the author does not know about, but with GPTs, it pulls information from the basic Knowledge that you load.

> [numeroFujii](https://twitter.com/numeroFujii/status/1723697986906275875) There may be many ways to do this, but at least I've tried various "extract only the theory and pick up examples from the net" type instructions. I have tried various instructions, but they didn't work.

>  GPTs are sufficient if you want to do the "only speak from the data you have loaded" thing, but no new emergence has been generated.

If it's a case study in a book, it'll give you a bang for your buck, and for those who haven't read the whole thing, including the new book "Journey Shift", it might teach you a lot. chat.openai.com

>  This AI will pick up and explain good UX case studies and DX success stories based on the methodology and books ([[After Digital]], [[Journey Shift]], [[UX Growth Model]], etc.) of the UX firm "[[bbit]]".
