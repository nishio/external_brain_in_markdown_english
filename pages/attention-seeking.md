title: "attention-seeking"
---

o3 generated the term "attention seeking."
- This is not something I've heard much about, but I saw meaningful potential in distinguishing it from the need for approval.

The "desire for attention" and "[[desire for approval]]" are similar in some respects, but the object and purpose are different.

- Attention-seeking
    - This is the desire to be [[stand out]] and to be noticed itself. For example, they tend to value being "seen" by actively promoting themselves, and may not necessarily assume positive evaluations from others.

- Approval Needed
    - This is the desire to be recognized by others for one's existence and abilities, and to receive recognition and praise. Positive reactions from others are needed to enhance self-affirmation, and it occupies an important position in Maslow's five-step theory of needs.


In other words, it can be said that the need for attention is different in that the need for attention focuses on "being seen" itself, while the need for approval seeks to confirm one's self-worth by "being recognized.

When one does not receive enough positive strokes, one tends to accept strokes, even negative ones, in order to satisfy one's own [[need for recognition of one's existence]], and as a result, one tends to collect negative strokes.

    - Feeling that "[[one's]] existence" is not approved when [[attention]] is not given and [[ignore]] is given.
    - So you want approval for your existence.
        - →[[Existence Approval]].
- Approving it as good goes beyond that."
    - You'll want to approve "[[self-worth]]"
    - Some people have no idea what to do with this.
    - That's why I say radical things.
        - Even if 99% of people think "wow", 1% of people like it, so the hungry become addicted.
        - People taking selfies in ice cream containers at convenience stores.
