title: "A wise man's children are not wise, but they are protected."
---

Child Y of smart person X is not as smart as X at a high rate.
- Especially if X is well educated.
    - It's hard to make a difference based on education.

But most person X feels child Y is an extension of himself.
- Biological
- So use your smarts to "[[protect]]" your children.

according to this principle
- Smart X founds a company.
    - Design systems that create value.
- The company's second generation Y is not good.
    - But X feels compelled to protect Y for the rest of his life, even after his own death.
    - As a result, X uses its system design capabilities to design a "composition that benefits incompetent Y".

Somehow a long-lasting [[EVIL]] mechanism is created by smart people that will last for a long time.
- Why did you make such an EVIL one? that would be
- This is just EVIL to most of the "others" in the world, but sometimes it's a gain when you calculate the loss of a stupid child.
- Optimizing the valuation function to include the interests of the children makes it negative in a zero-sum distribution, since most people are not "children", so it looks EVIL!
- Stupid child Y alone cannot design such a large composition, the problem is magnified by the fact that parent X is very smart.

If the company founded by X makes a profit and Y sucks up the profit, it is still healthy.
- It's a private company's decision on how to distribute its profits.
    - If that decision-making is bad, the company will go under in the long run.
