- [[Max Weber.]] (Max Weber) analyzed in detail the concept of rationality in the social sciences, distinguishing between "[[formal rationality]]" and "[[substantive rationality]]" in his work. These concepts are described in detail in his book "[[Economy and Society]]" (English translation, 1978) and elsewhere.

- Substantive Rationality ([[Substantive Rationality]]) refers to the rationality with which the choice of ends or means is evaluated based on particular values or ethical criteria. In other words, it is judged by how well an act or institution conforms to intrinsic values or purposes or how well it realizes those values.

- Formal Rationality] ([[Formal Rationality]]), on the other hand, is rationality evaluated based on formal criteria such as procedures, computability, and consistency of rules. It focuses on whether the relationship between means and ends is logically and computationally consistent.

- Weber pointed out that while formal rationality prevails in modern society, tensions and contradictions arise between it and substantive rationality. For example, in [[bureaucratic organizations]], the emphasis on formal rationality of rules and procedures results in a tendency to neglect individual situations and values (substantive rationality). While this situation increases the efficiency of the organization, it also carries with it the risk of a lack of human dimension and ethical considerations.

- Weber's discussion of rationality provides an important perspective on the operation of institutions and organizations in today's society, as well as in individual decision making. It reminds us of the importance of considering not only formal procedures and efficiency, but also intrinsic values and ethical standards.

Max Weber emphasized "rationalization" as a major principle that drives society. According to him, when people and groups differ in the "rationality" with which they justify their actions, conflicts are likely to occur because each group takes its own worldview and values for granted. In other words, conflicts arise when people and groups differ in what they justify their actions with different goals and logics, even with regard to the same event or system. Weber pointed out that such "differences in rationality" could be the root cause of conflicts and conflicts between groups.

Imagine, for example, that one group believes that maximizing efficiency in achieving objectives is rational, while another group believes that adherence to morality and faith is rational. Since the two groups have different standards of evaluation of the same event, they are less likely to accept each other's arguments as correct, and this can easily lead to conflict. This is a concrete example of conflict due to what Weber calls "differences in rationality.
