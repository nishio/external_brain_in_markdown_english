title: "Social triggers in Scrapbox"
---

- [[Social Triggers]] was, until rather recently, specifically imagined as a form of "ego-searching Twitter to find mentions of my blog or Scrapbox," etc.
Lately, however, I've been feeling that mentions in Scrapbox are by far more useful as triggers than short-form Twitter because they keep contextual information.
Then shouldn't Scrapbox be ego-searched on a regular basis?
- → [[Should we ego-search Scrapbox?]]

Type 1
- Find from an unspecified project
    - Google Search
Type 2
- Find from a specific project
    - Search in Scrapbox projects
        - [[Interesting projects]]
