title: "Difference between Blog and Wiki"
---

The difference between a blog and a wiki (Scrapbox) is that a blog has an established custom of not revising what has been written at a certain point in time (and when it is revised, the revised part is made clear), and as a result, blog posts with old technical information continue to exist; a wiki has a custom of repeating improvements as needed.
Human resources are finite, so old articles exist either way, but the psychological cost of trying to improve them is totally different.
