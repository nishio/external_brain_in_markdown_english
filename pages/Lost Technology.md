Lost Technology
> [@piro_or](https://twitter.com/piro_or/status/1646929968428097536?s=46&t=gkSZtjGEtUZPO0JCzBxCBw): it's impossible to keep all technology indefinitely, so what about the technology that gets lost I'm annoyed when people say "they were lost because they didn't have [[value]]".
> I think it's actually a matter of "being displaced by [[lower-priced]] products that meet about 80% of the needs,
>  I am very sad that future generations will deny the value of the product, even the value of "the product fulfilled the needs of the remaining 20%, needs that were fulfilled only because of that product.
