> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1829821179630403855) The day before yesterday, I was talking to high school students at a livestream for N High students, and I realized that N High is pretty much the forefront of digital democracy. I think the trial and error of the N-High student council will be worthwhile.

    - Yasuno stated that AI is likely to be viewed as a partner.
- Potential use of AI in learning support, tutoring, mentoring, etc.
    - AI use in learning support:
        - Individual tutors available to answer questions 24 hours a day

    - Yasuno noted that it is important to properly divide the roles of AI and humans and utilize them in a complementary manner.
- Expectations for closing the learning gap and personalized learning experiences
    - Expectations for closing the learning gap:
        - Education tailored to individual learning styles and [cognitive characteristics
        - Provide learning opportunities that transcend time and location constraints
        - Support for learners who have had difficulty adapting to the traditional education system

Considerations on how to deal with AI and how to become a human resource that will not be replaced by AI:.
- Importance of gaining experience through personal contact
    - Importance of self-experience:
        - To actually use AI services and understand their characteristics and limitations
        - Develop the ability to make your own decisions without being misled by advertisements and promotions.
    - Yasuno recommends trying out new AI services for yourself as they emerge.
- Importance of unique human abilities (e.g., problem finding, decision making, communication)
    - The importance of unique human capacities:
        - Problem finding: Ability to recognize what the problem is before giving the task to the AI
        - Decision-making: Ability to make appropriate decisions from multiple alternatives
        - Communication: the ability to focus on human interaction and emotional connection
    - These capabilities are unlikely to be replaced by AI in the foreseeable future.

Discussion on the arrival of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) and its impact on society
- The arrival and impact of AGI:
    - Experts are divided on the timing of the arrival (predictions range from 1 year to 50 years)
    - In the short term, AI may emerge that can perform tasks autonomously within software
    - It has been suggested that in the long term, it may exceed human capabilities
- Yasuno emphasizes the importance of preparing for that scenario, taking into account the possibility of AGI's arrival.

Introduction of AI and VR applications at N High School and S High School

Throughout the lecture, multifaceted discussions were held on the relationship between AI and humans and the future possibilities that AI will bring.
