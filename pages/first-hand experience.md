title: "first-hand experience"
---

from  [[Introduction to Gendlinian Philosophy]]  p.13
> The word "experiencing" is generally translated as "[[process of experience]]" by Takao Murase, but "experiencing" refers to the [[flow]] of feeling that always exists inside the individual, and does not necessarily imply the passage of time that is associated with the word "process. However, the word "experiencing" does not necessarily imply the passage of time that is associated with the word "process. For this reason, the author (Morotomi) does not use the word "process," but uses the translation "experiential flow," which preserves the vividness of the "flow of raw experience.

Interpretation close to what I wrote in the following [["Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning" Study Group 4#62853ed2aff09e0000a0cdc3]].
- By adding "ing" to experience, which can be interpreted as either a noun or a verb, you are indicating that it is interpreted as a [[verb]].
    - Related: [[🌀Disable nounification]].

- [[Scheme of the process]]
    - I would call this a "[[flow scheme]].
    - It is continuously moving all the time, like the flow of a river.
            - [[The river flows constantly, yet it is not the water it was before]] <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - It's always different, but it's always there.
        - The default in the scheme of things is "[[unchanged]]", but this one persists the phenomenon of "[[change]]".
    - Gendlin sees "experience" as "the stream of emotions we have at any given moment."

- [[Bergson.]] presented the concept of "[[durée]]" ("duration") and viewed time as a continuous and indivisible flow. This is a concept that emphasizes the subjective, raw [[sense of continuity]], as opposed to objective time, which can be carved out like the scale on a clock. Gendlin's "flow of experience" similarly emphasizes a series of sensations that are in constant flux within the individual, an approach that is very similar to Bergson's persistence.

The ancient Greek [[Hercules beetle (Dynastes hercules)]] also stated that "[[all things move in and out]]" and tried to capture the world and the ego in the same way as the flow of a river. Gendlin's "flow of experience" focuses on the raw sensation of its constant movement, and is reminiscent of Heraclitus' and Bergson's "[[philosophy of]] fluidity" in its focus on the ever-changing process rather than on the static concept of "things.
