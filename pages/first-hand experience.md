title: "first-hand experience"
---

from  [[Introduction to Gendlinian Philosophy]]  p.13
> The word "experiencing" is generally translated as "[[process of experience]]" by Takao Murase, but "experiencing" refers to the [[flow]] of feeling that always exists inside the individual, and does not necessarily imply the passage of time that is associated with the word "process. However, the word "experiencing" does not necessarily imply the passage of time that is associated with the word "process. For this reason, the author (Morotomi) does not use the word "process," but uses the translation "experiential flow," which preserves the vividness of the "flow of raw experience.

Interpretation similar to what I wrote below
- By adding "ing" to experience, which can be interpreted as either a noun or a verb, you are indicating that it is interpreted as a [[verb]].
    - Related: [[üåÄDisable nounification]].

from [["Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning" Study Group 4#62853ed2aff09e0000a0cdc3]]
- [[Scheme of the process]]
    - I would call this a "[[flow scheme]].
    - It is continuously moving all the time, like the flow of a river.
            - [[The river flows constantly, yet it is not the water it was before]] <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - It's always different, but it's always there.
        - The default in the scheme of things is "unchanged," but here the phenomenon "[[change]]" persists.
    - Gendlin sees "experience" as "the stream of emotions we have at any given moment."
