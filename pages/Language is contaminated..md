title: "Language is contaminated."

- [[term]] is [[pollution]].
- There's a good word for it.
- There will be people who ABUSE the word.
- People who ABUSE are more prominent, so ABUSE becomes the majority.
- That would be a bad word.

The bad guys are the ones who ABUSE, [[crime against civilization]].
