Managers were initially concerned about the loss of productivity due to telecommuting, but after the experiment they changed their minds, believing it to be a slight positive rather than a negative. These results suggest that telecommuting two days a week does not impair organizational performance and is effective in retaining talent and improving employee satisfaction.

This study shows that hybrid work arrangements (2 days at home and 3 days in the office) that combine home and in the office a few days a week have lower turnover rates than full office work and no problems with maintaining productivity. On the other hand, the conditions are reversed in the case under discussion, which is the transition from fully remote to coming to work one to three days a week. In other words, if employees who originally had a high degree of freedom by staying at home all day are asked to come to work, they may experience increased commuting burdens and dissatisfaction due to reduced freedom. While the research results suggest that hybrid work does not necessarily lead to lower productivity, it is difficult to say what impact the "change from [[full remote]] to hybrid" will have on employee satisfaction and turnover, and rather a cautious approach is required.
