What we did last week
- Deploy broadband AI to Cybozu's Azure environment and include Cybozu's internal data.
    - This was a rather laborious process.
    - Just when you think it's working, it corrupts the data and you have to fix it, etc.
    - I'm at the meeting on 3/31 to report on this.
- [[Presentation of the 14th Cybozu Labo Youth Achievement Meeting]].
    - First time in a long time to come to work
    - The degree to which we want to operate [[the IIDOBATA system]] within the company has increased.
- And then [[OSS Weekly Reporter]] was born.
    - We thought it was important to be able to understand what the state of digital democracy 2030 is as we move forward.
    - [[Diary 2025-03-26]]
    - > I used Devin's ACU extinction deadline was coming up, so I used it in a big way, but still, using a lot of Devin in parallel efficiently punctures your head.
    - Devin 2.0 was released, so the next time you'll have to meet the token consumption deadline is the last time you'll be able to do so.
        - That's 64/250 ACUs in 9 days, so at this rate we'll have a slight surplus again.
        - 250 ACUs was too much for a single person like me, who doesn't do software engineering type work every day.
        - I'm guessing that's why the "[[Let AI do the research]]" attempt hasn't worked out so well.
            - There are many experiments I would like to do but haven't.


Not much to write about in retrospect.
    - [[stock taking]] was hard work [[Diary 2025-04-05]].

It says what I'm doing next week.
- From the long-term tasks, there's "handling multi-column survey data," but it's not very urgent.
