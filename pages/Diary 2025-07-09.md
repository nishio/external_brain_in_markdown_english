>  >hasemaru01: Some say "Team Mirai is too young.

>  The three most prominent figures of the Meiji Restoration were Saigo, 40, Okubo, 38, and Kido, 35, in the first year of Meiji.
>
>  Ryoma Sakamoto was 33 years old.
>  The age of Oskar François of Belle Rose is also 33 years old.
>
>  Takahiro Yasuno is 34 years old.
>
>  Rather, the right age to change Japan.
> [rrr_kgknk](https://x.com/rrr_kgknk/status/1942959117921853461) too young, too educated, too idealistic, I see things as they are.
> [Q98VtSimoK41741](https://x.com/Q98VtSimoK41741/status/1943079802140803110) So that's about the only criticism you have.
> [tanktopperZ](https://x.com/tanktopperZ/status/1943147012699890061) Japan is too old in every field.


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1942610517631328381) "I know I should avoid [[revolving payments]], is there anything else I should avoid?" I once had a Q&A with someone who said, "No, [[cheaters]] are always creating new methods to cheat you, so people who think that 'if you avoid some things to avoid, [[you'll be fine]]' are [[duck]]."
>  >MAMAAAAU: It may be tactless to be serious about internet memes, but "just study science so you won't be fooled by phonies" or "read mu so you won't be fooled by phonies" are more oriented toward those who fall for them.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1942641449788682258) I fixed the missing data in Slack, I identified and fixed the bug that causes missing data every week, so it shouldn't be missing from now on. But 200 people are talking to each other every day, Team Mirai's Slack is amazing. I think it probably exceeds the time of the Tokyo gubernatorial election.

Too many things I wanted to do exploded.
- You can hit the broadband AI via API, so if you have Devin hit the broadband AI, you can use Slack to go from a large DB to filtering by criteria and then visualizing!
- If you plug the conversations on Team Mirai's legal consultation channel into [[Theanine (memory system)]] or something like that, the FAQ would be self-explanatory.
- thankyou-helper: Streamlines the process of updating PRs by suggesting "you should refer to this, it is related to this" from a large amount of PRs.
- AI Anne's to be used as short video material.


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1942777332210806846) I'm not sure what I'm doing anymore, so I drew a picture of myself, I'm working to connect something to something else. w

- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1942931358097252457) I like [[Factorio]] and [[Satisfactory]] and [[Oxygen Not Included]], but I just saw this diagram and thought "This [[pipeline Construction]]".

I finished putting up the first 20 posters I got.
- I hadn't yet written here about the story of
- [[LUUP]] convenient

- [[stretch]] is when you focus on standing up in the pelvis.
Surprisingly, there was a sensation of the left gluteus medius getting in the way instead of the right gluteus medius that had been bothering me all this time.

It's been a long time since I sat on the [[triangular cushion]], and it was really nice.
Maybe my pelvic area used to be too rigid to change my posture effectively.


Development turns into optimization in a world of continuous gradients instead of stacking blocks of logic


Letting the AI do the security checks is a totally misguided halcyonation.
- When you command them to "get out" what they can't get, they create it, a common behavior in LLM.
- Confidently and convincingly claim that the information is leaked.
    - Seemingly persuasive, but complete horseshit.

7-Eleven's lemongrass tea was very original.
