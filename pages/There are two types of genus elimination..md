A situation in which a task can only be performed by one person is a situation that should be eliminated for the survival of the organization, given the possibility that that person may become unable to work due to illness or job change.

This is shown in the [[Knowledge Distribution Chart]], where there are three people, but the tasks marked with a cross can only be done by one person.

There are two ways to resolve this situation. The first is to change the side of the task, "Do it in a way that anyone can do it," to suit the person. In the case of these three people, "anyone can do it" is the shaded area, so the task is to be done in a way that can be done with that range of knowledge.

The other method is to change the person's side to match the task, "increase the number of people who can do that method. In cases where the way to do a task is not verbalized, for example, knowledge can be transferred through [[collaboration]] such as working in pairs, and if the person to whom knowledge is transferred can do the task, the problem of "only one person can do it" can be solved.
