>  "Yes, I like people who are open to things. I think that ningen who are closed to the human world (society) are perverted. So it is good to have a place where you can quit being a ningen and become a human being. Art is a place to do that. Human beings are interesting because we don't know what they are."

Human beings, as creatures, think and do things that humans don't understand. There are so many wonders. That is neither good nor bad. It just appears as "something like that. Even if we don't understand the meaning or necessity for ningen, it is inevitable for humans.

The conceptual labels [[humans open to things]] and [[ningen closed to society]] are interesting.
- Tend to perceive those who are connected to society as "[[open]]" and those who are not as "[[closed]]"
- Close to Society."
    - "We only focus on society," or "[[the evaluation function is]] society."
    - [[SOCIAL NEEDS]]
        - Ningen optimized for getting "likes" on social networking sites.
        - I'm more concerned about [[what others think of me]].
