    - I was looking at an article on [[hot bread]] and I was like, "Can I pinch that much?" I had a realization.
- Challenge.

        - [Ham and pork cutlet with [[pastrami beef]] and cheese.

    - If this is a bad place, you might be worried that if you put too much pressure on it, it might go bang.
    - but this is a very solid thing.

- I have extra bacon.
    - Hypothesis that if bacon were on the outside, it would be crispy bacon.

    - Bacon, bread, cheese, pepper, pastrami beef, cheese, bread, bacon
- I was in a hurry to get the smoke out after a minute, but they say it's not a problem.
    - I heated it up more and it started crackling, and they said that's fine.
- It's hard to take out because of the double-sided bacon.
    - It slipped sideways in a layer of cheese.

- Because of the thin filling, the bacon is not under pressure and not sticking to the bread.
    - difficult to eat
- Well, it tasted good.
    - Adding pepper is a good thing
