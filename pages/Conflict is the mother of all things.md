title: "Conflict is the mother of all things"

- [[KJ method Let the chaos speak for itself]]  p.448 「 [[fog of avidity]] 」
> The fog of obscurity hangs deep in the air. ...
> Stagnant water rots. In order to live creatively, you must first have a sense of urgency at the starting point of your life. In order to have a sense of urgency, you must drive yourself upstairs and remove the ladder. In this way, a conflict must arise within you. In this way, [[conflict is the mother of all things]]. That being said, there are productive conflicts and sterile conflicts. [When the KJ method is used, the conflict is productive. In this way, a light appears in the distance from the struggle. In this way, the drama of "[[a terrible situation]] → conflict → light]" occurs.

The reason why the KJ method is so productive is that it accumulates small sparks and leads to big sparks.
