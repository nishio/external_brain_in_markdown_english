>  Essentially, it seems that the person is bothered, unforgiving, or hating in a place that has not a single millimeter to do with their life.

>  As a result, they consume more extra resources than the average person and often clash, become acrimonious, isolated, and estranged... which is observed to eventually converge into "unlivability".
- [[extra resource consumption]] → [[resource shortage]]
    - Possible problem with ability to [[select]] resource consumption targets
        - [[resource allocation]]
