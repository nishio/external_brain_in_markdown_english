A set of understandable U
- A is in, so "I get it."
- B is not in, so "I don't know."
- Delving into B will result in C1 and C2, which I also don't understand.
- Digging into C2 led to D1 and D2, I know this.
- This gives us a new understanding of C2.
- I still don't know B because I still don't know C1.
- To be able to understand B, you have to dig down and get to the point where you can understand all the unknowns that come up as a result of your digging.
    - This comes at a significant cost, but no workaround has been found at this time.

relevance
    - [[I can only accept knowledge that is one step ahead of what I have now.]]
        - [[One step forward question.]]
    - [[Smart people can explain things clearly.]]" means "People who understand can dig deeper.
    - In-depth explanations tailored to the needs of the recipient of the information are usually not done for free because of the large cost involved.
    - Experiencing early in life that teachers hired by the public taxpayers come to give education, mistakenly believing that education is free.

formative experience (from one's youth)
- As my original experience as a child, I was given [[encyclopaedia]], found a word I didn't understand, looked it up, and repeated the cycle to build what is now called a "[[knowledge network]].
        - [[consult a dictionary]]
    - The birth of the online encyclopedia [[Wikipedia]] has made it widely accessible
        - There's a sense of [[intelligentsia]] reproduction that these children are raised by parents who would think to give their children an encyclopedia.
        - Before Wikipedia, [[library]] would have had the role of providing access.
- If this is your original experience, you tend to say, "If you don't know a word, just look it up.
    - I can't relate to the majority of people who seem to reject words they don't understand just because they see them.

- With respect to keeping track of C1.
    - I think it should be left as a process to improve my understanding, of course.
        - C1 is "not yet delved into" and "may delve into in the future".
            - It's not good to turn it off.
    - Disturbing to readers who want an understandable text.
        - Concepts not understood by the author are described because "AI has output
    - This is the difference between being a [[producer of information]] and a [consumer of information
        - The body of the cow growing the beef and the restaurant customer who wants it cut into bite-size pieces or pounded and tenderized for eating.
            - [[He's still alive, so there's no way I could cut him into bite-size pieces.]]
