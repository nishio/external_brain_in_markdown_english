- Interesting: [How to handle ideas in WorkFlowy and Scrapbox - R-style](https://rashita.net/blog/?p=26040)
- Forcing a [[tree structure]] on a [[relationship]] that is essentially a [[network]] leads to [[detachment of relationships]]. #Tree coercion
- Forcing [[The finiteness of the page]] on content that is inherently unlimitedly connected leads to [[Decrease in listability]]. #Finiteness enforcement #Listability #Unlimited #Connectedness
    - I wonder if the [[page-by-page]] unit of relation description (even though there are line permalinks) is based on [[page-by-page]], which is a continuation of the [[Wiki]] convention.
- The existence of the relationship being [[Boolean]] is another kind of [[restriction]], right?
- On the other hand, [[KJ method]] has a limitation that [[Fusen size]] is not suitable for long content #Content size limitation
    - For [[disconnection]] problems caused by [[triangulation]], we can introduce [[inter-node link]].
    - To solve the [[making finite]] problem caused by [[page]], we can introduce [[link to expansion]].
    - As for the [[Quantity Limitations]] issue, just introduce a link to an unrestricted source.
