title: "Large and small comparison with many things → Fennic tree"
---

I want to know the number of items that satisfy the condition by comparing the size of N items and the number of items that satisfy the condition.

O(N) when large and small comparisons are made for each one.
However, O(NQ) is sometimes too slow, especially in cases where many queries are issued.

If we put N things in the [[Fennic tree]], we can get the number of things that satisfy the condition in logarithmic order by taking the range sum
- [[Make a value range a definite range]]

- [[Lots of queries matter.]]
