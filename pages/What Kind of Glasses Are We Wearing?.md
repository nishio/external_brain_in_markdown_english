[[Broad Listening]] is the [[glasses]] for better seeing people's opinions  
- [[Wearing Glasses Doesn't Make Eyes Unnecessary]] by Audrey Tang

What does "[[better seeing]]" mean?  
- Often, people ask, "Aren't online opinions biased?"  
    - This implicitly assumes that "obtaining data in the correct ratio is ideal."  
    - I felt differently about this assumption, but couldn't articulate how.  
- When looking at opinions vaguely, it seems like "prominent large opinions" are everything.  
    - It appears as a dichotomy between large opinion A and opposing large opinion B.  
    - However, upon closer inspection, both A and B are not monolithic; there are many slightly different opinions.  
    - There are also opinions C, D, E, ... that are neither A nor B.  
    - The key to productively developing the conflict between A and B lies in these nuanced opinions.

        - On 2025-08-22, this article became a topic in the context of [[Broad Listening is Qualitative Analysis]], so I added an illustration.  
- In this regard, being in the "correct ratio" is not very meaningful.  
    - Information like A being 60% and B being 30% is meaningless.  
        - The distribution of people's opinions is not clearly separated; only prominent voices are separated.  
        - Therefore, the way boundaries are drawn changes the ratio: [[Division and the Silent Majority]]  
    - Whether C is 1% or 2% is also meaningless.  
        - It fluctuates due to noise.  
        - The important realization is that "C exists."

Since the concept of "[[Broad Listening and Brainstorming]]" was articulated, this has been retroactively articulated.
