<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3-mini-high/icon' alt='o3-mini-high.icon' height="19.5"/>This story is about an actual incident that occurred at a major convenience store chain in Japan: around 2013, a young employee at a Lawson store (actually the son of the store owner) posted a photo on Facebook of himself lying down in a refrigerated case containing ice cream in the store. The photo went viral on the Internet, and the store was inundated with criticism for being "inappropriate" and "unsanitary." As a result, the store was forced to close, the employee was fired, and the franchise agreement was terminated. This incident was the first of many "byte-terrorism" incidents that occurred at a time when social networking services were rapidly becoming popular, and it triggered a major change in corporate awareness of crisis management.
