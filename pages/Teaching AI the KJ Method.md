title: "Teaching AI the KJ Method"

2024-09-18
Teaching [[KJ method]] to AI" is what I should do as the next development of [[broad listening]]. This is what I should do as the next development of [[broad listening]].

Try to instruct in natural language first before implementing as code
- The verbalization of those instructions may be beneficial for humans to learn the KJ method.
We know not only the early KJ method, but also the later "thinking fireworks".
- I used the term "teaching the KJ method" because it is easy, but more strictly speaking, it could be called "teaching a non-physical partner how to do thinking fireworks.
    - Whether we can go so far as to say "no vision" is open to consideration.

succession
- I was talking to ChatGPT on the train ride and it seemed to work out better than I thought it would.
    - Later, when I'm back in front of the PC, I'll make a version that I did myself, organizing the logs as I go, and compare them.
    - It's also related to [TTTC how you learned about your life choices.
    - That's just too much stuff, and it's hard to compare.

Summary of experiment 2024-09-18
- Can be paired with related ones.
    - Sometimes I get creative with Halcynation.
- I can title the pair.
    - Sometimes it's like "A and B," but sometimes it's a nice blend.
- If all the past prompts are piled up in a context in ChatGPT, the attention will be hit by the pre-compressed prompts after compressing them with the KJ method's naming convention.
    - There is positive value in emulating "[[bundling and making invisible]]."
    - Aggressive [[erasure from context]] would be beneficial
- If you leave it solely to the LLMs, you're missing out on input.
    - I think it's the same as [[the monkey away]].
        - LLMs (and humans) unintentionally ignore
    - I guess it's KJ legal to check this in the program and poke at it over and over until it's taken in.
- This time I did the initial bundling KJ method with 25 fewer sheets.
    - Maybe we could do fireworks to think alongside each other in Kozaneba.
    - I'm imagining in my brain that LLM may not be good at "[[think specifically]]"
            - [[Specific examples are low frequency]] So

The following is a partial pickup of the log, which was later paralleled in Kozaneba

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I want to make 25 short sentences of the findings so far. First, make 5 of them as a sample to clarify the nuances of the "short sentences."
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Sony's focus is on providing value to customers rather than what they want.
- The Omi merchants had a business philosophy of "Sell what is good for the customer," and valued insight into the essential needs of their customers.
- ...
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Overall length. Sample shown.
- Sony
- What Customers Want
- Providing Customer Value
- Sell what works for your customers.
- Omi merchant
- Essential Needs
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>... In this way, each phrase is expressed in a shorter, to-the-point form. The next step is to create 25 short sentences based on this.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Yes, please make 25.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>... This completes the 25 short sentences.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The second half tends to be more of an abstract concept. Please pick up 25 "leave the scent of the earth" as concretely as possible from the logs.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>... We have compiled a list of 25 cases based on specific examples and past experience.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Yes, now we will work on "pairing things that seem to be closely related". Finally, for each of 1 to 25, pair it with the one that seems most closely related to it, but first, as an exercise, pair 1 to 5 with the one that seems most closely related to 1 to 25. Please state clearly what number you are pairing with.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>...
- 4: Sell what works for the customer and Proposals that look to the customer's future (18)
    - Proposing what works for the customer is strongly associated with proposing what will work for the future needs of the customer.
...

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It is good. Give each pair a short title as well.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>...
- 4: Sell what works for the customer and future-oriented proposals
    - The importance of proposing products with the customer's future in mind."
...
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>They tend to be a little long, but that's okay.
Now, for 6-15, think of the number and title of the most relevant short sentence.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>This completes the 6-15 pairs and titles.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>There are some places where you see the same thing in the opposite direction, like 12 to 2. You can omit those. Continue processing on 16 to 25.


![image](https://gyazo.com/3c36163071a970b9ab739c0113f4599d/thumb/1000)
Hmmm, let's see if we can sort out a set of titles.

- Craftsman-like organization was put on hold and organized mechanically.

There are several new stickies being born in Halcynation, w
- Q: Are you sure?
- A: That's fine. You just thought of something and you added it.
Maybe you could programmatically run a check to see if it's included in the input set, and mark it as a new addition, or prompt for something that's been missed.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Now let's look back at the above list and extract only the newly-added short sentences. Number them consecutively A1-. As before, only one of the duplicates, such as 2→12 and 12→2, should be used!
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's odd that there are 7 pairs when there were originally 25. Please get them all out.

It would be easier to implement here in Python instead of the prompt.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>That's down from 25 to 16. That's good. Now let's repeat the same steps to find the bears from A1 to A16, give them a title, and number them from B1 to

B1. attitude as a symbol of Sony and innovation
"The synergy between Sony's development of the Walkman and the creation of a market through technological innovation."
Pair: A1 (Sony and Walkman development) + A13 (synergy between innovation and market creation)

B2. future needs and essential problem solving
"Proposals that look to the customer's future and solve their essential needs."
Pair: A6 (essential needs and problem solving) + A11 (future-oriented proposals and projected needs)

B3. providing customer value and professional challenge
"Build trust professionally through value delivery and challenge."
Pair: A3 (Delivering Customer Value and Providing Professional Value) + A10 (Challenges for Sustainable Growth)

B4. a willingness to respond to the hidden needs of customers
"A commitment to earning the trust of customers by responding to their unacknowledged needs."
Pair: A2 (needs customers don't realize they want) + A12 (make customers aware of hidden value and gain their trust)

B5. efforts to create markets and spread value
Attitude to "create markets and promote products of value."
Pair: A8 (attitude toward creating markets and new markets) + A15 (efforts to promote valuable products)

B6. business philosophy based on trust
'A sales and customer partnering attitude that builds trust.'
Pair: A5 (Omi Merchants and Trust-Building Sales) + A9 (Customer Orientation Difficulties and Invisible Value)

B7. future-oriented challenges and innovations
"Market changes through technological innovation and a willingness to continue to take on challenges."
Pair: A7 (future needs and market changes due to technological innovation) + A16 (the company's attitude to constantly create new markets)

Now we have seven pairs from A1 to A16, numbered B1 to B7, and titled them.

- There's a lot of extra w<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Somehow they've created an abstract front page and a front page shorthand.
    - I've gone to the trouble of putting a nameplate on it and compressing the information, but with ChatGPT, I'm seeing all the logs, so I'm getting something other than the nameplate again.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Excellent. Now, in the same way, using B1 to B7 as input, find a pair, give it a title, and give it a sequential number from C1 to
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>
C1. sony's innovation and solutions to future challenges
Sony's innovation and technological innovation to create markets, future-focused needs and problem-solving."
Pair: B1 (Sony and its attitude as a symbol of innovation) + B2 (future needs and solving essential problems)

C2. challenge to provide value and build trust
"Challenge ourselves by providing customer value and an attitude that builds trust."
Pair: B3 (Provide customer value and professional challenge) + B4 (Respond to customers' hidden needs)

C3. business philosophy of market creation and trust
A business philosophy based on market creation efforts and trust."
Pair: B5 (market creation and efforts to spread value) + B6 (business philosophy based on trust)

C4. future-oriented challenge and innovation chain
"The company's attitude and innovation to continue challenging market changes."
Pair: B7 (Challenges and Innovations for the Future) + no other pairs left

Four pairs are now formed from B1 to B7 and numbered consecutively as C1 to C4.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Please connect these four short sentences from C1 to C4 to create a sentence
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>
Sony's innovation is driven by the collaboration between market creation through technological innovation and future-oriented needs and issue resolution. Identifying hidden needs that customers are unaware of and continuing to provide value is a professional challenge and an important factor in building customer trust. In addition, our efforts to create markets and promote valuable products are rooted in a business philosophy based on trust. Furthermore, future-oriented challenges and technological innovations demonstrate a chain of innovation attitudes that allow companies to continue to respond to market changes.

This text is a comprehensive view of the importance of value creation and challenge, including the philosophies of Sony and the Omi merchants.
