SIGGRAPH ASIA 2021, I will be supporting the creators of Unexplored Junior with tickets and transportation expenses, and I will also be leading them (although I won't be doing anything like leading them, since they will be completely free to do whatever they want since they will be indoors in Japan, so it should be safe).

Offline conference where I'm keenly aware that my strength and eyesight are declining due to working from home in Corona.

Offline conference that increased the number of depleted Pikmin seedlings to 12 at once.

- [[Fog of the World]]
The road to the Keiyo line wasn't tracked, so it's like we're at warp speed.

I had no idea what the road was even though I looked at the map! but I finally understood when I saw it in person.

- But this is not so clear after all from this picture, I still need a 3D access map.

What I thought when I saw the animation works at SIGGRAPH ASIA
- [[Original experiences that changed the world]]

- [[I thought about chit-chat at SIGGRAPH ASIA 2021.]]

I had an experience with the beard extension, it's true that we don't usually use the sense of touch on the cheeks. The servo is located in front of the ear and is very loud, so how about moving it behind the ear and having the arm move when you pull on it with a string? We had a discussion about this, but maybe we could also put a string-like object on the face, like a real beard?

When I put on the VR goggles and push the wall, the room turns 90 degrees and I experience that the direction of gravity is sideways. I wondered if human cognition corrects the half-way tilt to the 90-degree direction, a tendency that does not depend on culture, and if this sensation occurs even when growing up in zero gravity. We discussed this.

I took miscellaneous notes.
- [[Computer graphics, media art, tea culture, and Zen.]]

BoF was a very dense place.
