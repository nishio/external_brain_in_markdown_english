from  [[Toward Relative Art & Technology]]
Algorithms are not recipes.
The idea that "an algorithm is not a recipe" offers important insight into understanding the characteristics of each while highlighting the essential difference between an algorithm and a recipe (a recipe or procedure). This section breaks down and explains the key points contained in this phrase.

1. recipe and linearity
A recipe is a set of instructions to be followed to achieve a specific result, such as cooking. Typically, a recipe is designed as a linear process.
It has a one-way flow of Procedure A → Procedure B → Procedure C....
There is no return to a step once completed, and all steps move toward the final result.
Example: A recipe for baking a cake involves the sequential steps of mixing the ingredients, baking, and finishing. There is usually no recursion or repetition in this process.
2. algorithm and recursion
An algorithm is a logical sequence of steps or rules for solving a problem. Algorithms contain many characteristics that are not found in recipes.

Recursion: An algorithm can include a process that calls itself (recursion).
Recursive algorithms have the structure of decomposing a problem into smaller subproblems and solving those parts with the same algorithm.
Example: Recursive algorithm to compute the Fibonacci sequence.
Branching and selection: flexibility to choose different procedures depending on conditions.
Iteration: The same procedure is repeated over and over again in a loop structure.
Example: The

The merge sort algorithm divides the array into smaller parts and merges them together, sorting recursively.
Thus, the algorithm can represent a flexible and dynamic process.
Linearity vs. recursion
Whereas recipes are linear and proceed in a predetermined order, algorithms involve branching, iteration, and recursion to represent more complex and adaptive processes.
Important differences: 1.
Recipes are not supposed to return to a procedure once performed.
In algorithms, steps may be repeated until the problem is solved, using recursion or loops.
4. significance of algorithm recursion
Issue Segmentation and Integration:.
Recursive algorithms divide a problem into smaller parts and solve each part to solve the whole.
Self-referential structure:.
The algorithm repeats the same process based on certain rules by referring to self.
Flexibility and versatility:.
Recursivity provides adaptable solutions to dynamic and changing problems.
5. philosophical perspective
The proposition that "an algorithm is not a recipe" contains the following philosophical implication:

Fixity vs. dynamicity: recipes produce fixed and predictable results, while algorithms involve processes that change in response to circumstances.
Difference between human and machine thinking: a recipe is a simple procedure based on human understanding, while an algorithm corresponds to a complex computational process by a computer.
6. conclusion
A recipe is a fixed process with linear steps and guidelines for achieving a predetermined result.
Algorithms have flexible structures such as recursion, branching, and iteration, and represent dynamic and adaptive problem-solving processes.
Understanding this distinction will give you a deeper appreciation for the flexibility of algorithms and their potential. This also reaffirms the importance of algorithms in technology and programming.
