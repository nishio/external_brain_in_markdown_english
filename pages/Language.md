title: "Language"
---

- In the world in general, "language" might mean "Japanese," "English," etc.
- In my case, I limit myself to "[[natural language]]" when referring to such things.
- So if you simply go with "language," it's that higher level concept.
- What is Language:.
- $L\subset \Sigma ^{*}=\{\langle \sigma _{1},\sigma _{2},...\rangle |\sigma _{i}\in \Sigma \}$
- It is a set of alphabetic columns
- I wonder if this "alphabet" can be misunderstood like A-Z.
- Whatever, I should be a little more careful with my language.
