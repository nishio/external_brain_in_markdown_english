- Remesh's web-based platform allows institutions to engage in a back-and-forth conversation with their audiences. Responses are collected by an algorithm with similar meanings, and participants can choose to agree or disagree with the results generated. The algorithm has been fine-tuned for use in situations where the UN speaks a unique dialect. International organizations worked with local conflict area organizations to encourage the participation of diverse populations.

People speak unique dialects is important

Below is the official help page on "Generative AI & LLM Features" provided by Remesh.ai
([Remesh's Generative AI & LLM Features](https://help.remesh.ai/remeshs-generative-ai-llm-features)), summarizing what inputs (user actions and The following is a summary of what outputs (system behavior) are obtained for what inputs (user actions/operations) and what value the user receives. The quoted parts are shown in the original English language text, with brief supplements added later.

# 1. Upload and Generate Discussion Guide
.

>  “From uploading your discussion guide to summarizing your conversation, our generative AI will help you more effectively and efficiently get deep insights from your audience.”
("From uploading discussion guides to summarizing conversations, our generative AI helps you get deeper insights from your audience more effectively and efficiently.")

## User behavior
.
- Upload discussion guides in Word or text format
- Or use AI to generate a new guide (*enter a few questions and AI will automatically suggest them)

## system outputs
.
- Automatic suggestion of optimal question format and time required
- Suggested restructuring and revision of questions included in the guide

## value gained
.
- High-quality discussion guides can be created in less time than previously possible
- Clarifies what you want to ask and eliminates unnecessary questions

# 2. [[Simulated Conversation]]

>  “Use our AI-powered Simulated Conversation to preview how your discussion will flow before you go live.”
（Preview how the discussion will proceed using the AI-powered "Simulated Conversation" before going live.)

## User behavior
.
- Run a test session based on the discussion guide created and proposed

## system outputs
.
- Generates simulation results as if virtual participants had answered the questions
- Visualize the flow of questions and identify content and structure issues in advance

## value gained
.
- Function as a "rehearsal" before the show, correcting redundant or ambiguous questions and sequencing errors before they occur
- Better anticipation of the user experience and less rework due to lack of preparation

--

# 3. Real-time analysis and voting during the session
.

>  “Gather live feedback and use AI to identify key themes and trends in real time.”
("Collects live participant feedback and uses AI to identify key themes and trends in real time.")

## User behavior
.
- Collected text-based responses from a large number of participants
- Prioritize opinions through a combination of polling functions, Q&A, etc.

## system outputs
.
- Automatic clustering (thematization) of responses
- Visualization of importance and popularity of answers

## value gained
.
- Instantly extracts noteworthy opinions and keywords from a large number of responses
- Analysis processes that previously took days or weeks can now be performed in real time

--

# 4. auto-coding and summarizing

>  “Our auto-coding feature uses AI to tag and organize open-ended responses, helping you spot patterns quickly.”
("Our automated coding feature uses AI to tag and organize responses in an open-ended format to help you find patterns quickly.")

>  “Summaries can instantly highlight the core insights from your conversation, saving you time on manual analysis.”
("The summary feature instantly extracts key insights from conversations, saving time that would otherwise be spent on manual analysis.")

## User behavior
.
- Perform summary and tagging of responses at the end of the session

## system outputs
.
- Categorization of huge number of responses by theme, keyword extraction
- Short summary reports and visualized dashboards

## value gained
.
- Significantly reduces the burden on analysts
- A bird's-eye view of the participants' voices and speedy reporting process.

--

# 5. Data security/privacy
.

>  “We do not use your data for training our AI models, and data ownership remains with you.”
("Your data will not be used to train our AI models and you retain ownership of your data.")

## User behavior
.
- Conduct discussions involving confidential information with peace of mind
- Optional settings such as anonymous responses in some cases

## system outputs
.
- Secure data management in compliance with security standards such as SOC 2 Type II
- Insights and reports that users obtain independently are retained for their own use only.

## value gained
.
- Safe to use even for surveys containing sensitive information
- Ensure compliance regarding the handling of company information

# Summary
.

Remesh.ai's generative AI and LLM utilization features enable "rapid insight capture" through a series of processes ranging from discussion guide creation, simulation, real-time analysis during the session, and automatic coding and summarization. When users perform specific operations (inputs) as described above, the system returns a variety of outputs (automatic clustering, real-time aggregation, summary reports, etc.) based on advanced NLP and polling analysis, dramatically increasing the productivity of marketing research and opinion gathering.

>  “Remesh’s Generative AI & LLM Features streamline your research process, reduce manual workload, and help you get to insights faster.”
("Remesh's generative AI & LLM capabilities help streamline the research process, reduce manual work, and gain insights faster.")
