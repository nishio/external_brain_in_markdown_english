title: "Clean Language as a Board Game"
---


I've been using the ChatGPT version of Keichobot for a while now, so I haven't used the original version in a while.
- Result: The idea of "Clean Language as a Board Game" was born.

summary
- I'm interested in chatbots with clean language.
    - At first I saw the value in clean language.
    - I saw the value in digitizing it and making it available at any time, so I created Keichobot.
    - Tried to port Keichobot because I saw value in ChatGPT's language capabilities, but currently I don't see much value in it.
    - I see value in the summary function.
- The varied behavior of ChatGPT has the disadvantage of making it difficult to enforce the rules.
- Clean language is a conversation with limited options, which is different from free conversation
    - More like a board game than a free conversation.
- Need to prototype and test play "Clean Language as a Board Game."
- Once "Clean Language as a Board Game" is complete, the potential for good use of Keichobot could expand.
Next action: prototype and test play "Clean Language as a Board Game".

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Question variations. To begin with, Clean Language uses "20 questions" or "5 basic questions", so variations in question wording may not be so important

- What do these "variations" look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I thought it sounded like a chat statement, but I may have actually been mistaken. This doesn't sound like a conversation, but a "limited choice" like a hand of cards in a card game or a worker placement in a board game.

- Is there anything else you can tell us about this "clean language"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>One of the good things that the ChatGPT version explored by not being able to do clean language well was the ability to summarize, especially the key points in the Next Action, which seems to have produced a different and better effect than clean language.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>At first I saw value in clean language, and I saw value in making it electronic and always available, so I created Keichobot; I saw value in ChatGPT's language capabilities, so I tried to port Keichobot, but currently I don't see much value in it; I see value in the ability to summarize, but I don't see much value in the ability to summarize. I feel the summary function is valuable.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between this "ChatGPT" and "Clean Language"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Summary.

- What does this "clean language" look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>The relationship between ChatGPT and Clean Language, the two are incompatible. This is because Clean Language is like a cooperative board game, not a natural conversation.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is that "ChatGPT" the same as "Clean Language"? Is it different?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It would be more beneficial to think of them as completely different.
