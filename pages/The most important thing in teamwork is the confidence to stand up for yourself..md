title: "The most important thing in teamwork is the confidence to stand up for yourself."

I may have said it before, but the most important thing in [[teamwork]] is [[arrogance]], I agree with you. Without [[confidence (in oneself)]], one becomes afraid that one's abilities will be seen as low and becomes poor at relying on others, or conversely, one refuses to think because one is not a specialist and throws the responsibility to others.

It is an awareness that a person who already has the ability to objectively understand his/her own incompetence has grown through acquiring skills and so on to the point where he/she does not need to be afraid.
