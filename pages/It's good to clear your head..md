<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It's good to clear your head.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "refreshing" is that "refreshing"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>My head is kind of fuzzy, and I'm not feeling clear and uncomfortable at the monitor, so I'm hoping I can get out of it, so I'm taking a walk and asking for advice.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that "refreshing"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I don't want to make progress when I'm working properly in an uncluttered state, I want to be crisp.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is that "refreshing"?

- Where is this "refreshing"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Based on the relationship with the Texan, I'd say it's around the forehead.

- >  I don't want to make progress working properly in an uncluttered state, I want to be crisp and clear.
- What does this "refreshing" look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>An uncluttered state is like a fog, and when it clears up, it clears up.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>How do you know its "refreshing"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It's obvious when it's clear.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "clear" is that "clear"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Once I'm clear, I can pick a task and say, "Okay, I'll do this next," and then I can focus on that.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "next time I do this" is that "next time I do this"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I have a list of tasks, from which I choose what to do next. What I choose is what's important, and what I'm going to do now that the urgent tasks that need to be done quickly have been taken care of.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "next step" is that "next step"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>In that sense, choosing to take a walk and consult was the right choice for the next thing to do.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "consult" is this "consult"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>The process of putting something that is bothering you into words for the time being, and then being asked questions about it, clarifies your thoughts.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "clarification" is that "clarification"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>(It occurred to me that we could switch sessions and discuss "what is important from a long-term perspective to do now," but let's move forward with this for once.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>The difference between clear and blurred, the state of being blurred is unpleasant, and the state of being free from it is clear. The state of being bewildered is not seeing well, and the state of seeing well is clear.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "liberated" is this "liberated"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>The state of not being able to see the future is like a prison, you're trapped.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "confinement" is this "confinement"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>No one is trapped, no one is trapped. They're not trapped, but they feel trapped and uncomfortable. The door to the cage is open, and it's up to each individual to get out.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about this "confinement"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>You're confined by your own beliefs.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "confinement" is this "confinement"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>(What's with all the verbs being selected?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>(Oh, I have an urgent task to check if there is any trouble in the keyword extraction part.
