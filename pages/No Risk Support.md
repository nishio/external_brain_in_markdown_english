title: "No Risk Support"

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1863035484991263197) I like the "no-risk cheerleading" language. The cheerleaders think they are doing a good thing, but in reality they are just imposing irresponsible value judgments from a good height without taking any risks.

It's easy to go bankrupt from something like "I'll support you"... from infinite poker... and so on. It's easy for all the money to be sucked into the casino, riding on the no-risk approval and no-risk support.

Even if the actor is acting with 100% good intentions, it is no guarantee that it will be beneficial to him or her. People often do harmful acts with good intentions, hence the saying "[The road to hell is paved with good intentions.

[[No risk]] / [[Support]].
