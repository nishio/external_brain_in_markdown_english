Summary
## 8-step model
.
- Subordinate:
    1. manipulation
    - Therapy
- → A situation in which citizens are only formally involved and do not influence actual decision-making.

- Medium:
    - Informing
    4. consultation
    5. minor facilitation (Placation)
- → Citizens are asked for input, but still do not have the final say.

- Top:
    6. partnership
    - Delegated Power
    8. citizen control
- → A state in which citizens are involved in substantive decision-making and share or retain power.

Significance
- Provides a perspective to evaluate forms of [[citizen participation]] by their quality and effectiveness, rather than simply "participating" or "not participating.
- It is an indicator of true democratic participation in policy making and community development.

This model is an important framework for asking how much participation is actually realized in terms of impact, rather than just formal participation.
