title: "Innovation Theatre"
---

The term "innovation theater" refers to a situation in which a project appears on the surface to be promoting innovation, but in reality the project ends up in the pilot phase and does not produce essential results.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT-4/icon' alt='GPT-4.icon' height="19.5"/>
- The "implementation" step, which is an important part of design thinking education and instruction, is often omitted from textbooks.
- Consultants and experts have the attitude that they know everything, which leads to the misconception that the knowledge and ideas they offer are more valuable than their implementation.

[Where did "design thinking" go wrong that was supposed to change the world｜Hiroshi Maruyama](https://note.com/hiroshi_maruyama/n/n729a89c2e1ab)

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT-4/icon' alt='GPT-4.icon' height="19.5"/>Below is a bulleted list of the main points of this article:
- This article is a commentary on an article by Rebecca Ackermann in the MIT Technology Review.
- The "[[design thinking]]" was considered a groundbreaking methodology that changed creative work from being the work of one genius to the collaborative work of many.
- Design thinking, promoted by IDEO, a Silicon Valley company, and the Stanford University dSchool, recommends a six-step process for design.
- However, an "innovation theater" situation has become the norm, with many projects ending up in the pilot stage.
- In many cases, as well as in design thinking, outsourcing the upstream processes of a project leads to "[[PoC]] poverty," a phenomenon in which the project ends in a Proof of Concept (PoC).
- There is a widely shared perception that the real difficulty of a project is not the idea, but the implementation and operational part of securing the necessary budget and staffing, convincing relevant stakeholders, and considering complex impact relationships.
- The sixth step in design thinking is implementation, which is often omitted from textbooks.
- As a result of the popularity of design thinking, there is a possibility that only designers will be highlighted and a new hierarchy will be created.
- Consultants often adopt the attitude that they know everything, which can lead to the misconception that the knowledge and ideas they offer are more valuable than their implementation.
- George Aye, a former designer at IDEO, helps clients improve on ideas they already have and then quietly walks away after seeing the project succeed.
- Aye argues that if people in the field are not at the center, it is only "profit-centered design."
- This concept may be applicable not only to design thinking, but also to businesses in general that support expertise, e.g., consulting firms.
