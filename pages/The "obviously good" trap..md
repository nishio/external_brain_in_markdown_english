title: 'The "obviously good" trap.'
---

- If something is obviously good, let's suspect an oversight.
- If it is so obviously good for everyone, why untouched?
    - A lucrative opportunity that was clearly lucrative for everyone was brought to you. Why did it come to me instead of being taken by someone else?
    - There are clearly some improvements that could be made that would be better this way. Why is no one leaving it undone?

The note and fragment "obviously good" trap share the question of when something seems obviously good. Both raise questions about why something seems good, why it remains unexecuted, why it came to you instead of being taken by someone else, and why no one has left it undone.

### deep thinking
The question of why something "obviously good" remains unexecuted broadens the perspective from which we evaluate things. If it is obviously good for everyone, the question of why it is untouched, why it came to you instead of being taken by someone else, and why no one has left it undone, broadens the perspective from which we evaluate things. This illustrates the importance of not simply evaluating things as "good" but also considering the factors and circumstances behind them.

### Summary of notes
.
If something seems obviously good, one should question why it is still untouched. Even when there is a proposal that would clearly benefit, one should consider why it has not been implemented.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The note and the fragment "Whether means Y is useful for some objective X can be known only by comparing the results of using and not using means Y for objective X" are related. The note asks why something is not being done, even when it is clearly good. This is consistent with the fragment's assertion, stating that even if something appears to be beneficial, one must compare the results of doing it and not doing it to see if it is in fact beneficial.

- I see, a fragment buried in the diary.
- I cut it out.

### deep thinking
From this connection we can see the importance of asking why something is still untouched or why it is not being done, even when it seems obvious that it is good. This is an important step in helping us evaluate our own actions and decisions to see if they are in fact beneficial.

Asking why something that seems so obviously good is not being done is an important step in ascertaining its usefulness."
