- It is more cost-effective overall for someone to acquire and distribute [[knowledge acquisition]] than for individuals to acquire it separately, achieving [[global optimization]].
- However, the cost is concentrated on "the person acquiring it," making it not the optimal strategy for individuals.
- If each person chooses "not to acquire knowledge from outside the organization" as their optimal strategy, the organization suffers significant losses as no one acquires external knowledge.
- This situation is similar to the [[Prisoner's Dilemma]].
