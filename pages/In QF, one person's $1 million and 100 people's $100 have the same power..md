    - 1,000,000 yen goes to the treasury and will be redistributed in the future, 10,000 yen per person if divided among 100 people.
    - People who think plan A is good are paying 10,000 yen each to people who think plan B is good (they can pay up to 100 yen).
    - Even those who think Plan B is better are paying 10,000 yen for one person who prefers Plan A, divided among 100 people.
    - For irreconcilable decision options, "pay more for everyone who makes you drink" is chosen.
