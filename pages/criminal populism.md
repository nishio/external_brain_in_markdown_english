From [[On the line, public discussion on new possibilities and challenges：數位宅公共參與血淚史]].
> The term "criminal law populism" has been used a lot in recent years in my experience with "[[judicial reform]].
>  When a crime occurs, people are outraged. The media then report such news in a big way to gain PV. Therefore, such news is more likely to attract attention.
>  And people pay attention to such news and immediately seek solutions. But often, people focus only on tangible solutions, such as "arresting" criminals, "jailing" them, or "executing" them... Despite the fact that there are effective ways to prevent crime, people focus only on tangible, easy-to-understand solutions...
>  "Criminal law populism" is a good agenda item for online discussion, if there is an appropriate forum for discussion.
>  because there are clear opposing views on this agenda, and people need to be supplemented with more knowledge in order to make the right decision.
>  If we can give people the opportunity to stop, supplement their knowledge, and listen to different opinions, they may be able to break free from conventional thinking.
