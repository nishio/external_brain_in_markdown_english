title: "Technically possible"
---

I feel like the word has become even more confusing and unintelligible because it's become a meme and many engineers use it in weird situations.

For example, the idea of "building a spaceship that travels at twice the speed of light" is "[[physically impossible]].
The idea of "building a spaceship that travels at 90% of the speed of light" is "[[physically possible]]" but "[[technologically impossible]]" at today's level of human science and technology.
So the idea of "let's make something like Excel that runs in a browser" is "technically feasible".

This "technically possible" has come to have a paradoxical meaning because it is often impossible in non-technical ways, and the problems are so numerous that we are stuck in a linguistic bind, wondering where to begin to explain them!

Maybe you're resistant to claiming that it's impossible because it's hard to prove that it's "[[impossible]]" and often leads to personal attacks on those who claim it.
