N: "[[Focus on Emotions]]" may involve "[[Emotional objectification]]"
T: I imagine focusing first, then objectifying.
N: Objectification is the image of peeling off something that has been stuck to you, and then moving away from it.
T: I see. What exactly do you do to objectify emotions?
N: It's like objectifying opinions, specifically writing them down on paper.
T: Simple, just write down what you're thinking.
T: Hmmm... KJ method of emotions now...?
