> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1935690627821506597) A social experiment is underway to gamify politics on a scale never seen before. There is only about a month left to participate in this first experiment, so I urge you to experience it. This development itself is open-source and is being done with a lot of gusto on a daily basis.
