title: "People being equal is not equal to giving time."
---

Let's say there are 100 movies here and they are all equally great.
If you don't have time to look at all 100, look at only some of them.
At this point, the choice of which film to select is a matter of personal subjective preference.

Similarly, let's say there are 100 million humans here and they are equal.
Even if all 24 hours are used for communication with others, each person can use only 0.8 milliseconds.
So I communicate with only some of them, and who I communicate with is determined by my personal subjective preferences.

Some people feel "disrespected" when others don't have time for them.

Assumption that communication is an equal amount of time consumption
