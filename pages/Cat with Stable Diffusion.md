Since we often have several images of the same query with different random number seeds, we will use a quiz format where we first give multiple images of the same query and then write a description of it!

The first one is interesting, although the one in the foreground doesn't have ears.
The second one has no fine writing, but it's cat-like.
The fourth is creepy.

The former is a rhythmic rectangular composition with a cat's face-like motif
The latter uses colorful colors and black lines of a certain thickness, while the shape of the lines expresses the cat's tail and body shape.
I think both are good solutions with some advantages.

![image](https://gyazo.com/2ac4197b2ccfc69ccbe3c8e6931a40da/thumb/1000)
This is not good because the advantages are gone.

Overlaid with "Cats, cats and cats" to make cats stronger.
Compared to the previous three pictures, it looks like some kind of four-legged creature.
Wife: "This is the most cat-like."

- It's interesting to see the Egyptian murals come out.
- I never thought of Keith Haring in connection with the Egyptian murals."

These two are the ones that were left to increase the CATS earlier

One CATS made one.

But personally, I think the first one looks the most like it.
From a distance, it looks like a group of lively cats frolicking...but when you zoom in, it's just tentacles connected to each other in a wiggly pattern.

A: Jackson pollock

Pollock tried to leave a rhythmic mark by moving rhythmically.

This is a Paul Klee style painting of a scene called "Blue cat" that does not appear to exist in the photograph.

Forgot to deactivate this setting.

Q9: Only the first one is designated as a blue cat, the rest are normal cats

The second one, where did the cat go...
The third one, on the contrary, explicitly depicts a cat.
The first one "has a fragment painted on it that reminds me of a cat" is about as good as it gets.
The second one is pretty close in terms of the picture. the third one seems too blatant to me.
Wife: "Maybe there's a hand nuance here."
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/0293ba09c13e53236b4d5d380ca7fc09/thumb/1000)
- Wife: "The third one looks like it could be on the wall of a café or something, and if I had to give it a title, I'd say 'Music'."
- I said, "Well, I paint pictures of violins and other musical motifs."

Q11: This is too difficult, or not very distinctive.

Both the first and second pictures have an Asian feel to them.
The third one makes me wonder if it's Japanese, but I've outlined it so clearly that I don't feel like I know it at all.

A: Yokoyama Taikan
Yokoyama Taikan is famous for not outlining [fuzzy body - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9C%A6%E6%9C%A7%E4%BD%93)

Q12: I don't think it's possible to understand this

I thought maybe the subject was too difficult, so I used a different keyword, but we seem to have roughly the same perception.

I was actually going for this style earlier, but the designation was vague.
I said, "Well drawn."
Wife: "Well drawn, but not interesting."
I said, "Well, it's not very interesting artistically."

A: pointillism
![image](https://gyazo.com/8e0e7985a0da69a27eacdfb9aa78c8f9/thumb/1000)
Should I have specified Georges Seurat?
If you specify:.
![image](https://gyazo.com/f29bb1dc7f3e49eb8af615b8185b588e/thumb/1000)
No, that's too much influenced by Georges Seurat's A Sunday on La Grande Jatte.

As for the strong stylistic characteristics, fixing the seed doesn't resemble it at all.
