title: "Crockian period"
---

- The days of using a croquis book for [[mind-map]]. Started in [[2011]].

Since it is inconvenient to carry them around, they are placed both at home and at work, causing the problem of "I thought it was written here, but it was there" (violation of the [[One pocket principle]]).
I discussed this issue with my wife, and the result is [[Moleskin period]]. I decided to use a large A4 size Moleskin because it will have an A3 spread.
