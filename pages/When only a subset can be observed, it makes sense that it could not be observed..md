### digest of notes
.
The note from "Blind Spot Cards Without Pictures Yet" discusses the problem of inferring the whole from partial observations. In particular, it emphasizes the viewpoint that the parts that could not be observed are meaningful. Also included is a discussion of the "returned plane hit and areas that need to be reinforced".

### Relation between note and fragment X
.
Fragment X, "The Bombing of the Returning Plane and the Areas to be Reinforced," is directly related to the note. The note addresses the problem of inferring the whole from partial observations, and Fragment X is a specific example of this, describing the areas of returned planes that were hit and that should be reinforced. This illustrates the problem that only returned planes can be observed, and information about planes that did not return cannot be observed.

### deep thinking
This note and fragment X highlight the problems and difficulties in inferring the whole from partial observations. In particular, the viewpoint that the unobserved portions may contain important information is an important consideration as we interpret the information and find meaning.

### summary of thoughts and title

Attempts to understand the whole from partial observations may overlook the importance of the parts that were not observed."
