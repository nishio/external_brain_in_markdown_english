Reuse of fragments not used in the final product
- When this system was not in place, information that was once written in draft form but not ultimately used was volatile and lost.
- This system allows it to be [[reused]] in future projects.
    - This should be a major point of appeal to customers
- I would like to use it at appropriate times in the future, too.
- In my slides.
    - Paper information is difficult to reuse.
    - Going digital makes it easier to reuse.
- That's the story.
- The key point in this discussion is that what cannot be found cannot be reused.
    - Ease of finding is important.
