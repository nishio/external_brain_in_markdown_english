- Mr. A: "I'm interested in X, like Y!"
- Mr. B: "No, Y is pretty far away."

When [[density of knowledge]] is low, distant things appear close.
    - [[segmentation]]

I was on Mr. B's side this time, but be aware that you may be unknowingly on Mr. A's side.
- How should we behave?
- This time, Mr. A was expressing "[[interest]]" in the way
    - So from Mr. B, he appears to be "interested but not very knowledgeable".
    - If there is an opportunity, "Are you interested in this kind of thing?" and there is a possibility of suggesting
- Bad example: if Mr. A says, "I know a lot about X, do you know Y or something?"
    - They perceive you as "someone who thinks they know a lot about something when they don't, but they don't realize it."
    - If I tell these types of people details, they get angry and it's a pain in the ass, so I quietly let them go.
