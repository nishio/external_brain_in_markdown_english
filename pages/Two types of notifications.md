title: "Two types of notifications"
---

There are two types of notifications [I don't mind seeing it." and "I want you to see it."
- You don't have to see it, but you can." Mixing "see it" notices with information sharing forces recipients to see everything they don't have to see.

It is the sender of the information who decides between "may see" and "want to see.
As of 2019, this is commonly expressed by "[[Mention.]]" such as `@nishio`.
- Those with mentions are "want to see" and those without are "don't want to see" or "don't want to see".
- Twitter, Cybozu kintone, and Slack all have this feature.

In Twitter and kintone, this notification is split into different tabs
- Twitter: "All" and "@Tweet
    - Notification that "@Tweet" wants to be seen

- kintone: "To Myself" and "Read Later" and "All
    - Notification "to be seen" by "addressed to me

In Slack, each channel is represented by bold and badges
- If the channel name is in bold, "may watch" notification
- A "watch me" notification when a badge is attached to the channel name.

Twitter and kintone allow the following actions
- Only "see me" notices are read together first.
- Read "no need to see" notices when you can afford to.

In Slack.
- Although not shown in the screenshot of the smartphone version above, the PC version has a view called "All Unreads" that shows all the notifications you want to see and those you don't need to see.
- There is a view called Thread that only contains "subsequent posts when someone creates a thread in response to your post" and "subsequent posts when you make a post in a thread created by someone else".
    - The notification system around Thread is a little harder to understand: [[Misunderstanding Slack's threading feature and notification coverage]].
- I think if there was an "all mentions" view it would read like Twitter or kintone, but there isn't?
    - Mentions and reactions are mixed in "Show Activity" but can be close.

- DMs and Mentions and the ability to fly keyword matches to mobile devices.

- In other words, the idea is that if you send notifications to mobile devices, you will first see the "notifications you want to see" on mobile devices.
- If you are unable to reply immediately to a notification:.
    - Tell the sender "I read it" with a reaction üëÄ.
    - Add a star and see the "Starred List" later.
    - Set a reminder
        - If you're on a phone, you can long press to Remind me later.
    - Start a thread and see the thread list later.

[[There are two types of notices.]]
- [[notice]] includes [[Two types.]].
