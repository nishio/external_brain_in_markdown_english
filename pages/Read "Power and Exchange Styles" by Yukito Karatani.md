p.45~ Short Keynote Speech by Hon.
- Structure of World History" has received support, but is misunderstood.
- Many people received the exchange style D as if it were something that could be achieved by human will.
- Example: [[Audrey Tan]].
    - D is thought of as if it is something that can be performed by humans if they know and intend to do so.
    - That's not what I intended.
- A force that seems to work beyond human will may emerge as D
- I wrote "[[Introduction to Exchange Styles]]" in 2017 to supplement
    - [PDF](http://www.kojinkaratani.com/jp/pdf/20171207_jp.pdf)
    - I tried to clarify this idea.
    - See the power that arises from the modes of exchange as the spiritual power that each brings to the table.
    - That is "[[power and modes of exchange]]" (2022).
- Spiritual power is not just a metaphor, but a real "force" derived from different modes of exchange
    - Marx presented in his capital theory the "[[earthly deities]]" created by [[Mode of Exchange C]].
    - I follow [[Hobbes.]], who compared the nation to a monster "[[leviathan]]" that arose from [[interchange format B]].
    - The same could be said for A and D.
