title: "link title suggestion"
---

I want to separate and realize only the link title suggestion part of Scrapbox.
- It is possible to get a list of linked titles of other people's projects with the [[titles API]].
- There is a publicly available implementation of [[asearch]], which can be used to prototype
- Create a prototype that writes out a list of link titles locally and uses them as the target of asearch to suggest text as it is being typed.

I'm very happy to spread my thought to non-Japanese readers.
