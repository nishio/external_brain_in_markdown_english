title: "Find value in it while others think it's worthless."

AI expanded link from "[Get rid of critics who don't take positions.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>There is a phrase, "[[flood of tsunamis]]. When a tsunami hits, you are expected to run away to higher ground as quickly as possible. Run away, even if it's just one of you. It is enough to sound an emergency announcement and notify those within earshot, but do not let [[people who don't listen to what others have to say]] or [[people who don't move]] delay your escape.

- In the case of [[tsunami]], you know immediately that you should flee to higher ground. However, there are situations where it is not clear where to flee.

Where do I run to?" One analogy for that question is "[[Nomadic Parable]]. If you ask someone where the grass is greener, by the time you get the answer, the grass is already gone. Even when the direction in which to go is unclear, it is sometimes possible to know where not to stay. For example, do not stay where the grass will be gone. Instead of waiting for information to arrive about where the grass is, we must move on our own and find where the grass is. That means "[[you]] must see with your own eyes.

Similarly, the idea of "[[finding]] value while others think it is worthless]" is also important. We should find its value while others do not yet recognize it, do work that will be recognized for its value a decade from now, and ride that wave forward. That means taking the long haul to secure a position and weed out critics who don't recognize the value.

- [[flood of tsunamis]]
- When the tsunami hits, you must all run to high ground, one by one, as quickly as possible.
    - [Run away, even if it's just one of you.
It is enough that you have sounded a disaster announcement, or called out to those within earshot, and you should not delay your own escape by getting involved in [[people who don't listen to what others have to say]] or [[people who don't move]].
discussion
    - [[tsunami]], it is known that you can escape to "high ground".
- However, there is also a type of variation where [Where should I run to?

- [[Where should I run to?]]
    - [[Nomadic Parable]]
    - Where is the [[grass]] overgrown?" but by the time you get there, the grass is gone.
    - Even when we don't know where we should be going, sometimes we know where we shouldn't stay.
    - [[Don't stay.]]
    - run out of grass
- Wait for information to come in on where the grass is, then move on, there is no grass.
    - You have to run and find the grassy area yourself.
        - [[one must see with one's own eyes]]

Find value in it while others think it's worthless.
- There [[Find the value.]] while others think there is no value.
- If you can, set up [[attacking in waves]] with work that will be said to have been worthwhile in about 10 years, and don't take a position [[Destroying the Critics]] over a long period of time.
