title: "Partial Differential Equations for Matching Apps"

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1652532894915756032) People who put partial differential equations on [[matching apps]], they perceive partial differential equations as "[[something]] to make them look cool," which means they are not [[the extraordinary]], so I don't think it's [[someone who uses it as a tool on a daily basis]]. Just like people who get [[kanji tattoos]] often cannot read [[kanji]].
>  >UsanekoBlack: There was a guy on my matching app that I really liked, but (unfortunately) he had a high income and seemed popular, so I sent him a message about the textbook he was putting up? I sent him a message about it, my matching app is wrong!
