<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3-mini-high/icon' alt='o3-mini-high.icon' height="19.5"/> The [[diversity]] principle is the idea that the [[world]] or [[system]] is not a [[single]] entity, but a [[coexistence]] of [[different elements]] or [[different perspectives]]. The [[interaction]] of [[diverse]] elements promotes [[flexibility]], [[development]], and [[evolution]] of the whole.

The term "diversity principle" has not been systematized by any particular scholar, but rather, diversity-oriented ideas can be found in various fields. For example:
- [[Charles Darwin]]
        - In [[theory of evolution]], biological diversity is the driving force behind [[natural selection]] and [[evolution]].
- [[Isaiah Berlin]]
    - He advocated [[pluralism of values]] in political philosophy and insisted on [[the coexistence of multiple values]].
    - [[Gilles Deleuze.]]
    - In philosophy, I discussed [[the diversity underlying existence]] through such works as [[Difference and Repetition]].
    - [[William James]]
    - From the standpoint of pragmatism, we affirmed [[diversity of experience]] or [[diversity of perception]].
