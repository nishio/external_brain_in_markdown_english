First experience of [[store-based Murder Mystery]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1755246969562468537/quick_promote_web/intro) I attended the store-based Murder Mystery on short notice! It was very interesting! There is a professional GM who will ask you a lot of questions and cast you in the beginning, and he does time and scene progress management, so even inexperienced people can feel comfortable, I highly recommend it!

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1755248538550940083) At first I thought 6,000 yen was expensive, but when I thought of it as a 5-hour "movie in which I am a character", it was rather inexpensive. It is a form of entertainment that is only possible in a certain densely populated city, and in order to enjoy it, you need to understand the majority language of that city at a native level, so I decided to experience it more while I am still living in Tokyo.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1755248577088291103) I'm reading the $2500 pamphlet (it's like a movie where they have that too).
>  I was reading on how nice it was to be able to take the time to read the secret information about each player, but the second half of the book, the part about the secret story of the production, is super interesting.
>  The afterword at the end is also interesting.
