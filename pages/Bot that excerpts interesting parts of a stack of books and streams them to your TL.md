title: "Bot that excerpts interesting parts of a stack of books and streams them to your TL"

>  [blu3mo (@Bluemo)](https://twitter.com/blu3mo/status/1667487681280892928) I want a bot that excerpts interesting parts from my stack of books and streams them to my TL.
- Now [[Vector Search in Nishio]] has "Public Scrapbox -> Chunking -> Embedded Vector -> Search".
- If we create a predictor here of "embedding vector -> whether I find it interesting or not", we can find "chunks that I might find interesting".
- Change "Public Scrapbox" to "Books" to complete the Tweet proposal.
- If you can "crawl other people's Scrapboxes periodically and process update differences", you can "inform yourself of chunks you might find interesting from other people's recent updates".
