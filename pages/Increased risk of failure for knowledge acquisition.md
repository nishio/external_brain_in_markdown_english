---

    - [[knowledge acquisition]] for [[failure]] increase risk # risk taking
    - The method also discussed in [[Toyota Kata]].
    - Dare to remove [[buffer]] etc. to reduce risk of failure

- Systems are becoming more complex and humans can't grasp the whole and optimize # Cognitive limitations
- Try to reduce the throughput of each individual system, see if it causes overload in other systems, and turn the system understanding and improvement.
- It's like solving the TOC locally, not analytically.
- #experiments #validation through experimentation

- [[Learning from Failure]]   [[Failing to learn]]
