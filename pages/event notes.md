The following is an "abstract version for anyone to read" (proper names and media are omitted).

What happened (abstraction)
1. in an open communal space, a participant posts a lengthy, professional proposal and commentary.
2. another participant shares procedural information to the effect that "proposals are no longer being accepted".
3. further operational advice (threading, volume considerations, etc.) will be provided.
4. the first participant took it as a **point from above (relational frame)** and reacted with strong language.
5. the management publicly cautions and requests compliance with the Code.
6. the parties argue unfairness in terms of undue consideration of context and reasonable care.
7. a third party adds empathy, supplementation, and another point of view, and the issue shifts from **"pros and cons of the content" to "operation and consideration of the place "**.
8. the operational decision was ultimately upheld and the norms were confirmed, but the friction in the relationship remained.

General principles that worked behind the scenes
- Common ground of attention: readability of public space is a common resource. Long and individual repartee leads to wear and tear, and norms are triggered.
- Lack of explicit norms: If the rules are unclear, procedural unfairness is likely to occur.
- Intent ≠ Impact: Even well-intentioned advice can create a backlash if taken as a relational message.
- Sensitivity mismatch: If sensitivity to rejection or provocation is high, ambiguous pointers are over-detected as aggression/rejection, leading to reactive aggression.
- Legitimacy of sanctions depends on procedures: public attention has high face costs, and proportionality, sequence, and clarity of explanation determine acceptability.

Summary in one line
The clash between "freedom of individual expression" and "legibility of the place and procedural fairness" turned into a public escalation due to the meshing of relational frames and sensitivities - an event.

1) [Attention Commons
- Readability and tracking costs of public channels are resources shared by participants.
- Long sentences, digressions, and individual repartee are perceived as excessive consumption of attentional resources, and norms (threading and shortening) are invoked.
→ Distributive justice tradeoff of "[[individual freedom of expression]]" vs.

2) [[Conflict between explicit and implicit norms]].
- When the rules are unclear (the extent of "chit-chat, etc."), parties are more likely to perceive procedural unfairness.
- Management refers to implicit norms as "overall optimal practices"; parties demand explicit statements.
→ Lack of visualization of rules amplifies unfair perception.

3) Estimation of [[relationship frame]] (status/solidarity)
- The same content can cause a backlash as a threat to self-esteem and autonomy if the expression is read in a higher -> lower frame (e.g., "supplement for ~").
→ Speech has a dual message of "content (what)" and "relationship (how/standing)" (theory of [[face]]).

4) Susceptibility dynamics (RS x provocation sensitivity x JS)
- The side with higher [[rejection sensitivity]] (RS) is more likely to overdetect ambiguous attention as a rejection signal.
- If the recipient has a sensitivity to provocation, it is easy to take a deviation from the norm as a provocation and choose a stronger reciprocation.
- When the perception of unfairness stands on both sides, reactive attacks and justifications are looped.
→ The meshing of "susceptibility vectors" creates an escalation circuit.

5) Discrepancy between Intent and Impact (Intent ≠ Impact)
- Even a well-intentioned supplement or general caution will be evaluated according to how it is received by the recipient.
- Load estimates and tones are hypersensitive in public spaces.
→ Misread rate is approximately Misread ∝ (Ambiguity x Sensitivity x Openness) / Norm Clarity

6) Legitimacy of sanctions = Procedural Justice
- The proportionality and accountability of the ladder of intervention (private letter -> thread guidance -> public attention) determines the level of acceptance.
- Direct public warnings have a high [[face cost]] and can easily turn into a backlash -> legitimacy dispute.
→ Even the same conclusion can be convinced by "order and transparency".

7) Reputation games in public space
- Mutual criticism in public can easily turn into a [[reputation game]] that assumes a third-party audience.
- When one side goes into character evaluation, the other side responds with rules and rights discourse (consideration and law), splitting the issue into "procedure vs. character.
→ Hierarchy shifted from agenda to meta agenda (operational justification).

8) Binomial tension between inclusion and discipline
- Inclusion (reasonable accommodation) and field discipline (uniform operation) cannot be maximized simultaneously.
- Principle: **Designs that align "same participation opportunities "** rather than "same outcomes".
→ The formulation that "individual adjustment is not an "exemption" but a "change of method" reduces conflicts.

Typical causal patterns (abstract causal diagram, text version)
1. ambiguity of norms x tight attention-sharing land
2. → Third party relationship frame stronger point
3. → Receiver's RS activated (over-detection of rejection)
4. → Reactive aggression (shift from content to critique of the relationship)
5. → Public sanction by management (proportionality/sequencing in dispute)
6. → Amplified perceptions of procedural unfairness/inequity on both sides
7. → Expand to meta agenda (legitimacy, consideration, rights)

Abstract rule (the smallest set reducible to operation)
- R1: Write content and relationships separately (I-message + concrete action suggestions).
- R2: Intervention is private communication priority -> minimally publicized as necessary (proportionality, clear reasons).
- R3: Preliminary "Norms for Attention Sharing Places" fixed display with short text (assumed post/thread criteria).
- R4: Institutionalize consideration as an adjustment of means, not an exemption of results (application window and SLA).
- **R5: Avoid personality assessment and limit feedback to actions, procedures, and locations.
If we drop to this 8 principles + 5 rules, frictions like this one can be easily reproduced and verified as where the cognition was misaligned/which procedures were missing before "who is right".
