    - [[wabi and sabi]] by [[digital nature]] [[Panentheistic calculator for ecosystems]]

PrefaceNote 4
> After a phase of ubiquitous use in society, highly developed computers will cover the earth as a new ecosystem that integrates with nature. This vision is called "[[Countable Nature]]" or "computational nature" or "digital nature" in this book.
- Example: In a car driving in fog, it is impossible to know the road ahead by sight. They rely on the car navigation system. The map on the car navigation system is a "countable nature.

- [[Coverage of the senses]]
- For example, as of 2021, when using a smartphone, part of the field of vision is digital, but when wearing an HMD, the entire field of vision becomes digital. This is visual covering.
- Similarly, if all five senses were coated digitally, the world that humans perceive would not be the physical world of today, but something else.
    - He describes this state of affairs as "mankind's descent into digital nature.

- [[Pantheonized calculator]]

- [[Avatamska sutra]]   [[Kegon (sect of Buddhism)]]
- The way the world is perceived ([[being jealous of others who are in love with each other]]) is divided into four levels.
- [[circumstance]]" which is the general human world.
- [[realm of thought]]" that captures the principle (sky) behind it.
- [[free from obstacles]]" in which principles and events are freely connected.
- [[free from obstacles in the way of one's daily life]]" consisting of a direct relationship between events.
    - [[end to end]]

- [[Butterfly Dreams]]
