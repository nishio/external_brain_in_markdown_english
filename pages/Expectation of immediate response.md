title: "Expectation of immediate response"
---

Some people have the expectation that others will respond immediately" to their output.
If the type of output is, for example, voice, it will disappear over time, and you will want an immediate response.
Without an immediate response, you are immediately confronted with the fact that the effort expended for the output has been wasted.
This spoils the "enthusiasm" to put in the effort for the output.
    - [[Enthusiasm is a valuable resource]]

On the other hand, if the type of output is indelible, evidence remains that "this is how the output was done at this point" at the time of output, and at that point, the user feels that "certain results were obtained.
I don't care if other people react to that at this point in time.
A response is of course preferable, but that's not the "most important thing".

This could have something to do with [[Stockdale's Paradox]].
