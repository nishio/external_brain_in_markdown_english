Advance, Hit a Wall, and Change Direction  
- There is a divergence of opinions between those who see "before hitting the [[wall]]" and those who see "after hitting the wall."

- It becomes easier to advance in a certain direction
- Proceed in that direction
- Advance to the point where you touch a [[constraint]] that is not currently affecting you
- The direction of advancement changes

For example, programming becomes easier with LLM
- The barrier to entry lowers, the customer value produced per person increases, and the number of programmers grows
    - This is because there are currently too many "problems to solve" and not enough programmers
    - The "supply of problems to solve" is the "constraint"
- Once the number of programmers increases sufficiently, the "supply of problems to solve" becomes the bottleneck
    - Before this point, even if problems to solve were identified, there weren't enough people to actually code them, so they didn't hold much value
        - As programmers start to become surplus, prices begin to drop, and the value of "identifying problems to solve" rises
    - With a shortage in the supply of problems, programmer personnel become surplus
        - The lower-skilled are cut first

> [thksngy](https://x.com/thksngy/status/1647086818226208768) Since programming is already mandatory in compulsory education, young people with basic skills will increasingly enter society.  
> However, the majority still don't understand high school-level physics.  
> As you mentioned, IT combined with physics is extremely applicable.  
> That's why I think the value of basic physics skills is rising.  
- After hitting the wall, the value of understanding physical phenomena will likely soar, [[common sense suggests]].
