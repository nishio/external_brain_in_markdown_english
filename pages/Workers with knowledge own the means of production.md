title: "Workers with knowledge own the means of production"
---

- Summary of [postcapitalist society

- In the past, workers owned the means of production, the labor force.
- Inventions such as the steam engine created costly but overwhelmingly productive machines.
    - The time has come for capitalists who can afford to buy the machines to own the means of production.
    - This was the result of knowledge application to the tools of the trade.
- Taylor devised scientific management methods and increased productivity by educating and training workers.
    - This was the result of the application of knowledge to the physical workers' job descriptions.
- Just as in the past, capitalists who owned machines were considered to own the means of production because "labor power < < labor power + machines," so in the future, workers who possess knowledge will be considered to own the means of production because "labor power + machines < < labor power + machines + knowledge.
