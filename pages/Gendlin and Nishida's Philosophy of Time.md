Nishida believed that the truly [[direct experience-giving "time"]] is not formal time, as in Kant, but rather the "[[ternary]]" of [Bergson. According to him, underlying the phenomenon of consciousness is the consciousness that envelops and limits it, that is, the intuition of subject-object unity or consciousness of pure activity. Truly in the [[intuitional standpoint]] of [[the unity of master and guest]], [[everything is]] present, and "time" disappears into it.

Gendlin, on the other hand, sees time not as a linear progression, but as something that arises from the intersection of the future and the past. In his [[process model]], time is thought to be created by arising into "[[implicit implication]]. In other words, time does not move linearly from the past to the future, but rather it arises as it moves back and forth between the past and the future, changing them as it goes.

What they have in common is that they see time not as linear or formal, but as something that is lived [[dynamically generated in experience]]. Time in Nishida's "pure duration" and "[[the intuition of]] subject-object congruence" seem to overlap with Gendlin's "[[time that arises in]] implicit implication.

Just as Nishida emphasizes "[[the superconscious underlying conscious phenomena]]," Gendlin also focuses on "[[what has not yet been verbalized]]. This is an indication that both are trying to find the essence of time in a more fundamental layer before it is conscious or verbalized.

Thus, Nishida's philosophy and Gendlin's psychology share a similar view of time as a dynamic process of lived experience and a similar attitude toward finding the essence of time in layers before consciousness and language. However, they differ in that Gendlin's approach is geared toward application to [[psychotherapy]], whereas Nishida's is purely philosophical in its speculation. Beyond these differences, however, there is a richly suggestive connection between their theories of time.
