The page has no title.
- But [[Link hub]] so a useful sign
    - [[Titling after the fact]]
    - [[Dare to be untitled page]]

- When you think about something, if keyword A and keyword B come to mind, there must be some kind of connection between the two.
- If this connection is obvious, it will be written, "There is this connection between A and B."
- But there are times when it is not clear, and it would be a shame to throw information away because it is not clear.
- So use "I can't think of a useful title, but I'll put it on one page anyway to record that it came to mind together".
