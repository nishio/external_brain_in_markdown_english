title: "Too much focus on not letting go of advantageous positions and lost opportunities"
---

from  [[Diary 2025-04-21]]
Too much focus on [[not letting go]] of [[advantageous position]] [[lost opportunity]].
We need to be careful not to get into this composition.
Because when the situation changes significantly, the "[[advantageousness]]" of the existing "advantageous position" changes.
[[not letting go]]" overweighs the thoughts and [[loses]] the opportunity to gain something greater."
