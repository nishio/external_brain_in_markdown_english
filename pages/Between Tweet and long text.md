    - Tweet is also [output
        - Create [Opportunity to get feedback
    - But Tweet is not a very useful accumulation in the long run.
    - It costs money to [[clean copy]] [[idea]] and turn it into a blog post.
    - It's like, "Leave it in [[draft]] status.
        - The more [[leave as is]], the more [[enthusiasm]] goes down.
    - Writing with the [[sense of duty (obligation)]] that it would be a waste if I don't complete it is damaging to my mental health.
    - Create negative feelings about writing
- You can tweet to [[Scrapbox]] as a better form than Tweeting.
    - I chatted with [[Tomoya Tachikawa]] the other day.
        - I'm left thinking and not writing -> it disappears.

    - In the long run, the network becomes progressively denser.
