[mashbean](https://x.com/mashbean/status/1808726131899838654) Aged just 33 years, Japanese AI scientist and science fiction author Takahiro Anno @takahiroanno is running for Governor of Tokyo this July as an independent, quickly He has quickly created a new whirlwind of excitement. He demonstrated the potential of future digital democracy with a variety of tools, including a 24-hour live-streaming AI VTuber, mobile collective opinion aggregation, and AI-assisted policy deliberation.
Today their team will show you how they use AI to conduct citizen deliberations!

[mashbean](https://x.com/mashbean/status/1808726603129901296) Most interesting of all was the distribution of public opinion on the policies shown in the figure. Using the "Talk to the City" @AIObjectives tool, his team members combined a large number of Twitter `#TOKYOAI`, anonymous surveys, and even mobile questions to create a deliberative distribution map, which the team then used to tailor their election opinion based on that opinion content. (More details can be found in the very comprehensive presentation of the "Declaration").

[mashbean](https://x.com/mashbean/status/1808726788467798191) Discussion and implementation has been attempted in various settings in Taiwan recently. The article I wrote earlier, "初探 Polis 2.0:邁向関鍵評論網絡" is a summary of my thoughts after a discussion with @degerturann, the developer of this non-profit open source tool, and the term Polis 2.0 was named by @audreyt Tang Feng (Audrey Tang).

[mashbean](https://x.com/mashbean/status/1808726987680403717) I had no idea that the most successful case of implementation was the Tokyo gubernatorial election. Very impressive. So after talking with team member @nishio, I translated his text "Broad-listening: Be a Shotoku Taishi with this technology". I made it so that our Taiwanese friends could enjoy reading it.

Now let's see how Anno used AI tools to "rock" this election!

The members of the group will be using twitter #TOKYOAI, anonymous questions, and even hand-pulled questions to create a comprehensive deliberation and deliberation diagram, and the group will be re-negotiating the content of the opinions (detailed content can be found in the brief "Declaration").

> [mashbean](https://x.com/mashbean/status/1808726788467798191) The previous session was held in various places in Taiwan to discuss and introduce Polis 2.0, and the first written text was "Polis 2.0: Forging ahead with a critical review network". degerturann after the discussion, Polis 2.0 is a word taken by @audreyt Tang Feng.

> [mashbean](https://x.com/mashbean/status/1808726987680403717) 沒到導入最熟的案例竟然是東京知事選舉，實在是太帥了。 I'm going to write a new article about the "Broad-listening: Leaning on this art form to achieve St. Teresa of Taiwan" after @nishio's comment. Please enjoy reading it and let your Taiwanese friends know how much you enjoyed it.
>  I'd like to see how Dr. Yasuno uses the AI tool "擾動" for the selection of this site!
