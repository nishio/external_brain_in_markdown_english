title: "Venture's positive arguments are manifold."

- [[Metaphor Examples]]
> A positive argument for a venture is a manifold. Locally, a good argument can be made. For example, "culture matters".
>  However, since the company is rapidly scaling, culture and correctness are constantly changing, so there is no such thing as a "long-lived" correct theory.
