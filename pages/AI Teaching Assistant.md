> [@dokeitaDev](https://twitter.com/dokeitaDev/status/1651901348844273664?s=20): interesting that you can collect questions you had to Google to improve your lectures!

    - This is where it seems important.
        - [[Agile Development]]-ish.
        - In the case of web service development, it's like looking at analytics to see where users are getting stuck and making improvements.
        - â†” Mental model of creating a product and then selling it.
