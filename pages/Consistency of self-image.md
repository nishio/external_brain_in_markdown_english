>  These extremes of behavior have been repeatedly cited as characteristics of extremely creative people. Why is this?
>
>  The point is indifference to self-image.
>
>  Everyone naturally acquires a self-image of what kind of person they think they are, and it is constantly being updated. A person who has been kind to everyone thinks he/she is a kind person and will be kind the next time.
>
>  The more consistent your self-image is, the more comfortable you and others will be.
>
>  However, this self-image simultaneously limits one's actions. It means, "I don't do anything that doesn't fit my character."
>
>  People at both extremes have a weak awareness of this self-image. What they are conscious of is their immediate goal and their feelings at the time. Therefore, they do things that are inconsistent with their image to others as a matter of course.
>
>  Both extremes of behavior have several advantages.
>
>  The first thing that is easy to understand is that we can achieve our goals without resorting to means. By focusing only on what is in front of us, rather than on our self-image, we can act in ways that sometimes appear to be the extremes, making it easier to achieve our goals.
>
>  Furthermore, it is important to note that being at both ends of the spectrum increases the diversity of experience and sharpens creativity and taste.
>
>  Diversity of experience is how many different inputs, thoughts, feelings, > one experiences. As your actions change, the reactions of others change, the information you see and hear changes, and even your emotions change. This results in a completely different experience.
>
>  The idea is that one person can experience what a completely different type of person would experience if they had > multiple personalities.
>
>  Increased diversity of experience allows us to combine information that would not normally be combined, which increases creativity. Better hypotheses can be formulated because more diverse information can be integrated.
>
>  Incidentally, it has been demonstrated, albeit in a limited context, that one person's experience is more likely to be a great success than a diverse group of people. (For more information, search the paper "Superman or the fantastic four?")
>
>  The diversity of one's experience is so important.
>
>  Being at both ends of the spectrum can lead to disappointing others, ruining relationships, and sometimes making it hard to know who you are in the first place. But it is also true that we can achieve extraordinary results.
>
>  When you come across a situation where you do something that does not fit your image, it is good to consider from many angles whether or not to be consistent with your image.
