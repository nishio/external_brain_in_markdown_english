### Digest of Research Notes
.

The following key points are summarized regarding personal productivity improvement.

1. new ideas are generated by combining knowledge. 2. new combinations are created by incorporating the different knowledge of others, rather than one's own knowledge ("consultation").

2. it is important to increase the number of people with whom one can easily consult in order to improve productivity ("increase the number of people with whom one can easily consult").

3. when consulting, it is important to know the other party's interests and areas of expertise ("knowing the other party's interests and areas of expertise").

4. also, by taking the initiative to help yourself, you will help your future self ("taking the initiative to help").

5. productivity can be increased by reducing working hours, increasing earnings, or stopping doing low-productivity work ("labor productivity improvement").

6. the ability to tell people what you want to do and what you think is good for you to become is important ("Passing on the intellectual production techniques of engineers to younger people").

7. the most important objective is to "create a state of high intellectual productivity" ("When to change the faceplate of the KJ method?").

8. Drucker's conditions for improving the productivity of knowledge workers include the importance of "clarity of purpose," "taking responsibility for one's own productivity," and "continuously learning and teaching others" ("The Theory of Knowledge and Capital and the Conditions of Technologists").

In light of the above, self-development, communication with others, and the search for more efficient work methods are considered important for increasing individual productivity.
