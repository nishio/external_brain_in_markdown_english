title: "Scrapbox and Project Management"

- False for "Scrapbox cannot be used for project management".
    - Scrapbox itself, because the development project is done in Scrapbox.

- Scrapbox is suitable for project management" is unclear definition of project management
        - If we follow [[PMBOK]], a popular textbook on [[Project Management]], project management is
        - Manage projects to completion in a given amount of time
        - Management to complete the project within the approved budget
        - Management to identify and acquire the resources needed for the project
    - Concepts including
    - Scrapbox development projects appear to be executed by a small group of people and without clear deadlines
        - Hardly an actual example of project management in the PMBOK sense.

So, whether or not Scrapbox is suited for PMBOK-style project management, let's put aside the question of whether or not Scrapbox is suited for PMBOK-style project management,
In a "Scrapbox development" type of in-house development project with a small number of people working on it for a long period of time with no clear deadline,
I have a feeling that perhaps I am very well suited to manage with Scrapbox.

Scrapbox-type management is a possible third force.
- PMBOK has a strong [[waterfall]] element.
    - (PS: I wrote this in 2018, after which there was a major reform in [[PMBOK7]] in 2021)
- If you look at it from a "waterfall ⇔ [[agile]]" perspective, Scrapbox's development project is agile because it is not waterfall, but it is also different from the so-called agile methodology #False dichotomy
- Seems to take a negative position on time pressure such as iteration, velocity, etc.

    - According to Drucker, "[[Productivity of knowledge workers cannot be measured...]]" Agile methods attempt to measure and manage it.

「 [[What to make]] 」
- There is no point in efficiently implementing something that should not be created.

- Software development management using Scrapbox could be very useful in determining "[[what to make]]"
- do something this way
