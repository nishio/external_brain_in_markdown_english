work at home is easy
- Can we generalize that "inside work is hard work?"
- What exactly is an "inside job?"
- What tasks can be completed?

I get a lot of work done that doesn't require a lot of cognitive resources while playing a broadcast that doesn't require a lot of cognitive resources while playing a broadcast that doesn't require a lot of cognitive resources.

concrete example
- They were playing the entrance of each country to the Olympics, but it's not something you'd want to watch closely.
- Check to see if the book page is in Scrapbox, and if not, work on making it.
- facilitated

Why do you subjectively feel "accomplished" when you're reducing resources?
    - [[flow theory]] in [[flow theory]] moved from a state of "boredom" to a state of flow?
- Boring to do shallow processing on a lot of things without digging deeper
    - I tend to dig deeper, and the processing time for each one increases, so I don't make progress for the time I have.
