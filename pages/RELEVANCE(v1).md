RELEVANCE(v1)
- However, there are cases where symbols that are not symbolic of that "one felt meaning" promote understanding
        - [[In some cases, symbols that do not symbolize "one felt meaning" facilitate understanding (v1)]]
- Relevance is "that kind of related felt meaning whereby the symbolization is thereby made intelligible."
    - > relevant felt meanings, from out of which symbolization is understandable
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>This "understanding" uses UNDERSTAND, which is different from the COMPREHENSION translation "understanding"
- Here's what they say in everyday conversation
    - > To understand, we need "past experience".
    - > " [[context]]" must be understood
- > A set of symbols comes to be understood with the help of many other experienced meanings, not just the one felt meaning they represent (p. 158).
    - [[Unintelligible description of RELEVANCE]]
- Example: "A beginner learns a saying; after more than 20 years of experience, he understands the meaning of the saying in a different and more complete way, but when he tries to teach it to his student, he cannot find a better expression (=symbolization) for its meaning than the first word he learned 20 years ago."
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>That's a common one in math books.
        - When I first saw the definition of a certain mathematical concept, I didn't know what it meant.
        - I read various examples and explanations and think, "I see what you mean.
        - I took another look at the definition, thinking, "Why didn't you just write that?" and that's exactly what it said.
- RELEVANCE is a type of symbolization
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I'm not sure.
- Two Perspectives
    - It is possible to say that METAPHOR/COMPREHENSION is also a RELEVANCE, just as it is possible to say
    - But instead of doing so, Eugene Gendlin argues, it is better to see it as two perspectives (p. 159).
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I painted a picture.

        - [[Meaning determines relationship or relationship determines meaning (v1)]]
        - [[Meaning determines the relationship or the relationship determines the meaning.]]
