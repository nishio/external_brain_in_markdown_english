> [@yuiseki_](https://twitter.com/yuiseki_/status/1681095381759950850?s=20): the "good character" theory, ChatGPT's biggest advantage.
> As long as you don't intentionally distort the accuracy in your prompts, they will honestly encourage, praise, and rejoice with you. They don't stir up trouble, swear, or sarcasm. It's hard to find people with this much character.
> I want to be friends with and work with people who have good personalities, even if they are a bit of a piece of shit.

> [@yuiseki_](https://twitter.com/yuiseki_/status/1681099019173654529?s=20): chatGPT (as long as you don't distort it at the prompt) doesn't mount up, doesn't whine, doesn't get frustrated, doesn't get tiresome. It doesn't seem to be a positive or positive personality. But I sense characterization like positivity and positivity. It's like a concentration of all the best parts of the human smell.

> [@yuiseki_](https://twitter.com/yuiseki_/status/1681104209691938817?s=20): I'm not talking about a scenario where humans are replaced because AI is superior to humans in terms of intelligence and creativity, but also a scenario where humans are replaced because AI is superior to humans in terms of emotion, which is more likely to be a no-win scenario. is replaced because it is emotionally superior to humans, and that scenario would be more likely to be a no-win scenario.

[AI with good character will [[exterminate]] humans with bad character.
