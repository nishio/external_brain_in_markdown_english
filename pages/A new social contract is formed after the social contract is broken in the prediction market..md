title: "A new social contract is formed after the social contract is broken in the prediction market."
---

- [[History circulates, but content is of a higher order]]
- [[interchange format]]
- The extremity of [[interchange format C]] destroys once and for all the protection that [[interchange format B]] provided.
- So a new social contract needs to be signed.
    - (Maybe it goes through the new exchange style A once before it gets to the new exchange style B.)

context
- digital democracy
    - There are two [[Yusuke Narita]]-like and Audrey Tan-like.
    - Is Audrey Tan-like viable?
- prediction market
        - [[Smooth transition between human and AI governance]]
- Ideal market to be able to buy and act on
- Shares held by the minister are not disclosed.
    - No obligation to disclose personal financial assets
- Can't the BOJ take a position in the first place?
    - What if we could have it?
- Assassination and Forecast Markets
    - Assassination makes the world go round.
    - Bet that person X will be assassinated by the time limit.
        - If you pile funds on the side that is not being done, you can provide an unspecified number of people with an incentive to assassinate you.
        - You can request an assassination for a contingency fee by anonymously taking a position in the prediction market and the assassin anonymously taking a counter position without having to "ask the hit man."
        - Anonymity is maintained for both parties.
- I thought celebrities were usually killed.
    - You can reduce the incentive to kill by taking the position of the person being killed yourself.
    - To kill or not to kill is determined by a vote of confidence with money as the vote.
    - Politicians without money get killed.
    - Fans take the position of the one whose guess is killed so that their guess is not killed.
- After all, politicians are usually killed.
    - There is a type of player who prefers to have fluctuations, irrespective of ideology.
        - But it's a bit of an economic rationale, because people who prefer to have fluctuations have to bet on the absence of fluctuations in order to cause fluctuations, so it's a bit of an economic rationale.
        - I think it's more likely that activists with strong political ideas and money will "kill the box" rather than "box" the opposing politician.
- This situation creates a strong negative incentive to be a politician.
- That's where a new mechanism is needed.
    - Just as our taxpayers' money deters murder by hiring the police to come and get you when you murder, so does the deterrent effect of murder.
    - Transaction fees will need to create incentives to deter assassination.
- This can only occur once the assassination deterrent is destroyed.
    - Once destroyed, only those who can defend themselves militarily can become politicians, and then the trend is to introduce a new deterrence system because they don't want to be assassinated.
    - →A new social contract is formed after the social contract is broken in the prediction market.
