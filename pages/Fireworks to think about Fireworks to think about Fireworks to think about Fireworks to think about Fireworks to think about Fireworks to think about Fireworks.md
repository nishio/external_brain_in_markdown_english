Because the subject matter was taken from books, it was not my "thinking" and it was not good.
- There are trees borrowed from books in places, which are not densely netted, so the "2 to 5 sheets for an island bird" does not work.
- The explanation of the procedure is the source of information, so the structure of the sequence of procedures gets in the way and makes it difficult to create a new structure.
