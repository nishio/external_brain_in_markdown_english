title: "Interesting projects"
---

I usually use Porter on my iPhone to view Scrapbox, so I'd like to use Porter's pinning, but the projects I'm not a part of open in my browser, so I decided to write here and pin this page

I was thinking, but I have a private project, so I should put this list in the private project.

js

```javascript
console.log("[/XXX] [stream https://scrapbox.io/stream/XXX/] [search https://scrapbox.io/XXX/search/page?q=nishio]".replaceAll("XXX", prompt()))
```
