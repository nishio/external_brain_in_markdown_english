Since I am a child in mental age, I tend to give an opinion full of [[kitchen sickness]] feeling that we should review [[social design]] itself because there will be nothing that AI can't do in the future.

Did people expect that when the iPhone 5 SE was released 10 years ago, AI would be able to tell you what you see when you take a photo of a bird or flower with your iPhone in 10 years? Maybe those people are not "[[adults]]" but "[[older generations]] who were [[the world changes slowly]]."

I think it depends on whether the world is "a predictable world where 10 years from now is an extension of the present" or not. I think not. So I think that [[advice]] is useless and rather harmful.

In fact, it is often a matter of [[Cost Structure]] rather than simple capability.
