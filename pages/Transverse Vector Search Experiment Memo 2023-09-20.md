title: "Transverse Vector Search Experiment Memo 2023-09-20"
---

We conducted an experiment to increase the number of data to be searched for in [[Extending the Red Link with AI]], which we have been running publicly on this Scrapbox.
- Searches include other people's Scrapbox data, books and papers
    - relevance
            - [[Cross-sectional Vector Search]]
                - [[Talk about putting books in Scrapbox.]]
                - [[Individual and aggregated loops]]
- Since there might be some problems with publishing the generated results as they are without review, the output destination is a private project that is not open to the public.
    - Subsequent updates changed the search hits to output directly to Scrapbox, making it clearly unpublishable.

- The page is automatically generated by AI at the destination of the red link created like this

mounting
- Load from local pickle
    - It takes about 5 seconds to read 100,000 records
- About 7 seconds to perform a local vector search
- It's slow when you think of it as a web app response, but with the recent "throw a keyword or page that comes to mind, work on something else, and look at it after a while" style, it's not a problem.
    - There's about 10-25 minutes between when you throw the query and when I come back to check the results (I don't measure it).
    - I've been updating every 10 minutes to begin with, and I haven't seen a problem.

impressions
- Do we really want to do it with "all data" or "all except this project `/nishio`"?
    - Generated using the keyword [[Combining knowledge is the source of new ideas, which in turn generates further knowledge and new combinations]], which I already did in this project in my first experiment, I excluded it because it was not interesting because it hit almost all the pages of my project.
        - titles: `["🤖🔁 successful intelligence", "🤖🔁 successful intelligence", "🤖🔁 twist", "Hatena2015-01-07", "🌀Collaboration with AI", "Increase personal productivity first", "🌀successful intelligence", "tkgshn/ Karabiner not working on macOS Monterey"]`
            - Maybe the last one is random.
    - It may be possible to find unexpected connections by not excluding my own writing, but since I am the one who makes the query, it may be true that it will be more similar to what I have written.
    - I wonder if people find value in "Letting my data-derived AI live in my wiki" because it gives them a "different perspective".
    - Not sure why I see the value of different perspectives in my own search from my own Scrapbox.
        - Is it really A?" in response to "It is A". or maybe the same individual has a sufficiently varied point of view due to the accumulation of more than 10 years of experience including Hatena Diary, or maybe I am highly sensitive to read differences by thinking "[Similarity -> What is the difference?
- If you exclude yourself, it looks like this (long story, so I cut out some unnecessary details)
    - titles: `["motoso/discussion"], "tkgshn/knowledge and wisdom"], "nishio-books/MOT knowledge creation management and innovation Ikujiro Nonaka"], "tkgshn/knowledge tightly coupled with business"], "mtane0412/suggestion through ignorance"], "nishio- books/idea generation method and cooperative work support Jun Munemori", "tkgshn/knowledge", "nishio-llm2023/Study of methods and systems to support knowledge creation process", "blu3mo_filtered/dualism of knowledge and ability", "motoso/wise company", "blu 3mo_filtered/accounting systems", "tkgshn/vaccine against false information", "motoso/Think different"]`
    - It's interesting that the sources are pretty disparate.
    - But this variance makes the current prompt less interesting to say.
        - > Notebooks and ... fragments are related in that the combination and exchange of knowledge generates new knowledge and ideas.
        - I'm mentioning three of them, not all of them, so it would be more interesting if you talked about how they relate to each other individually.
        - I've already tried an improved prompt in [[nue]]s implementation of this, so I'll be importing it back in the future.
- Later, I tried other styles, such as having multiple lines of text commented on instead of a single line of title, but the search results themselves are more interesting than the generated text
    - It's not that the generated sentences are not interesting, it's simply interesting to see the results of the vector search
    - If the interestingness of the generated results when done with my project's data is 100, the interestingness in this experiment is 90, and the vector search results are about 300
        - I'm writing a summary of today's experiment first, holding back the urge to write about each of them individually.
        - I think the individual stories are overly detailed.
            - Well, if you can just imagine the book part as "a system where books pop up and related pages open when you talk about them in front of a bookshelf," you can understand how interesting it would be.
            - In the case of Scrapbox, the other person is still alive (and books can be alive, too, of course), so there is a possibility that the connection found by the AI here could lead to more conversation with that person afterwards.
    - So, the vector search results that were only output to the console are now written to Scrapbox as well.
        - This naturally led to parts of books and such being written in Scrapbox, making it impossible to publish directly.
        - Well, if we were originally going to do something like this, it was within the realm of possibility that we wouldn't be able to do it in a public forum, so that was the default.
                - [[Eventually, you won't be able to see it.]]
    - The question of whether to include this part of the search results in the AI's search is a difficult one.
        - Effect of increasing number of fragments related to interests
        - The effect of interferences between fragments of search results for the same keywords that happen to be next to each other, creating new ones.
        - Adverse effects of miscellaneous machine-generated data returning to input
        - Include them in the list once, and make a mechanism to mechanically remove them all together when you think it's a bad idea.
            - 2023-10-05 I think it's not good, the mismatch between the title and the content is confusing

summary
- Just a casual post on a private project with a smartphone or something, and you can now see the results of vector searches across multiple people's Scrapbox projects, books and papers.
- We will improve it as we use it in the future.
- It would be interesting to take not only the explicitly triggered ones, but also the ones taken from the recent updates of your project once a day or so, and generate them on your own.
