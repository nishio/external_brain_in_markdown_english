    - First, [[raising a question]] is important.
    - Next, [[Five Principles of Exploration]] are important.
        - One of the five principles, "[[along with stepping stones]]", should be covered.
            - The natural order is to follow the stepping stones from near to far.
        - The closest you can get is yourself.

> First, we have to explore inside our own heads. This kind of exploration is called "Interior Exploration" here, and is distinguished from "External Exploration," in which the interview is conducted from outside of our own minds (p.71).

Internal exploration can also be further divided into two stages.
    - [[introspection]]
    - Our own deepest states of mind, anxieties, and desires
    - Taking this out and assembling it with the [[KJ method]] is "[[compass making]]" and "[[raising a question]]."
    - [[recollection]]
    - Shallower than introspection
    - Stock of knowledge
    - Past experience, etc.
    - I've read about it in books or heard about it from others in the past.
    - Unlike the depths of my current mind, I can look at it objectively.

Later [[brainstorming]] will be introduced as a method for reflection and recall.
Jiro Kawakita's interpretation of Osborn's brainstorming principles was added,
- [[The four principles of brainstorming are encompassed in the five principles of exploration]]," he argues.
