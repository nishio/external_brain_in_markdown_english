- silver and gold
    - [[Nobuyuki Fukumoto]]

[Manga by Fukumoto Nobuyuki, famous for Akagi and Kaiji, serialized from 1992 to 1996.
1992 is the year Akagi began serialization (until 2018)
1996 is the year Kaiji began serialization (until 1999)
It seems to me that they are trying a lot of experimental things with this piece. The stories are mixed.
Personally, I don't find the "mass murder by grudge of relatives" in the latter half of the film to be very interesting.
As for "Horse Racing," the device is interesting, but it proceeds without a protagonist, and the ending is not as satisfying as it could have been due to the censoring of the story.

- introduction
        - [[He who decides late is the one who loses his way]]
    - The world of those who kill is not expanding.
        - It is hard to imagine oneself killing others in the real world. Maybe we could generalize a bit more, and say that you are someone who crushes other people's projects, destroys other people's psychological safety, or undermines other people's motivation.

- large-scale speculative go-around
        - [[Money will run away from you if you don't have the wherewithal to hold it.]]
    - Recording Tape Tricks
        - There is an A with resource X
        - There is a B with another resource Y
        - A and B are unable to negotiate directly, and C is acting as an intermediary.
        - A wants Y, B wants A to keep X (does not want A to give it to C).
        - Taking advantage of the fractured nature of the negotiations, C
            - To A, "I give you Y in exchange for X."
            - To B, "A keeps X and gives Y to A."
        - and can negotiate on two fronts to take X before information sharing between A and B occurs.
    - Tricks of the Board
        - Staging holding secret information
        - Revealing the secret of the person who made the objection at the board meeting, making it impossible to argue for fear that if you argue, the other board members might reveal a secret that they don't know about.
- Psychopathic Confinement
    - When there's a way out, they try to escape.
- A forensic eye for painting
    - When you invest money to relieve the fear that you might fail, you can't fail even more because you're too afraid of the money you've invested.
- cheating poker
- Seikyo Mahjong
    - Rules are not absolute and can be changed through negotiation.
