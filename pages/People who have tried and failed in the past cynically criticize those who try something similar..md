title: "People who have tried and failed in the past cynically criticize those who try something similar."
---

On the phenomenon of people who [[challenge]] and [[setback]] in the past [[scorn]] those who try [[similar things]].
    - [[learned helplessness]]
- Interpretation of "similarity"
        - [[Mold thinking that had a similar thing in the past]]
        - [[The "resemblance" is not true.]]
- Things have changed from the past.
        - [[Methods change with changing circumstances.]]
        - [[Solution methods become obsolete as the status quo changes.]]
    - [[Critics who take no position]] are just not needed
- [[I want to affirm that I gave up]] and that the challenge is a "[[difficult task]]"
- [[sabotage]] because [[it hurts my pride when others accomplish what I have given up]].

Well, there are a lot of possible attributes, but I think I'll settle for "When I'm challenging something, critics who aren't taking useful action on that challenge are futile."
- It is also futile to incur the cost of trying to understand for what reason we are cynical.
