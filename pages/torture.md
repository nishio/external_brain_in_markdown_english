> [hakushi_tsu02](https://x.com/hakushi_tsu02/status/1961358654189510730) A prisoner on death row in a country complained that "[[the death penalty]] is [[inhumane]]. The monarch of the country nodded his head and said, "I see, indeed," and abolished the death penalty. Instead, he instituted the "[[torture]] penalty," in which a person is subjected to all kinds of torture until death," and laughed. It is so inhumane that the suffering of victims and their families lasts a lifetime, while that of thugs is over in an instant.
