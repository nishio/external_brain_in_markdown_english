> OriHime's most popular user is childcare [[telework]].
>  Bendable straws, lighters that can be attached with one hand, washlet toilets, etc. were also originally created as welfare devices and spread.
>  I hope that the functions and designs I've created with Banda and many other people who have difficulty getting out and about will spread as useful regardless of mental or physical disability.
