- 4: What changes the constraints?
    - This constraint line is created by the assumption that some axis s is constant.
    - That s a trade-off for another attribute Z.
    - In other words, to resolve the dichotomy between X and Y, first reduce Z so that s can be increased
        - To resolve the "X and Y are important, which one do I choose?" thought, we need to identify and reduce Z, which is unimportant, unnoticed, but connected by dependencies.
