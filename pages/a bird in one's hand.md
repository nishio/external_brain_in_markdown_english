The "bird in the hand" principle is one of the five principles of effectuation theory and refers to the entrepreneur's maximization of [[the resources on hand]]. Specifically, it means that the entrepreneur should leverage the knowledge, skills, contacts, and funds that he or she already has, and then set goals and initiate actions based on those goals.

This principle emphasizes the importance of moving forward as much as possible with what you have, rather than waiting for [[the perfect plan]] or [[a large amount of resources]].
