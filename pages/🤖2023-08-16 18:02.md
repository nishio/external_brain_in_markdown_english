Examining the relationship between "felt meaning" and "symbol" through the metaphor of gears
- Fragmentation of information
    - = Gear
- Multifaceted associations
    - = Gear meshing
    - Convergent moves when meshing with multiple existing gears
    - Rotational speeds are different, so it's not a good idea to engage them as they are.
        - Vague borders
        - Gears are hard, cannot absorb differences in speed
            - It works better when it's soft.
        - The written word is hard, the associative mood is soft.
        - Metaphor = creating new meaning with existing symbols
            - Using a symbol in a way that is different from its original meaning.
                - = Soft
                - Original meaning = hard
            - In situations where the meaning felt by the existing symbols cannot be accurately expressed, new bonds are created and expressed in symbols that are not normally connected.
                - = [[soft bite]].
        - > Because there is no overlap between the "felt meanings" RECOGNITIONED from symbols A and B presented as being related, we are finding the overlap through expansion.
            - I'm doing exactly that right now.
            - There are fragments that were in the original notes and fragments that were noted as possibly related.
            - "Can you connect these?" The question "Can this be connected?" creates a bridge between the two.
        - > There are two explanations for when to change the faceplate of the KJ method: one with "sense" and the other with "logic". You change it when you feel it is not turning out well.
            - Replace gears when they are not turning properly

### Digest

The relationship between "felt meaning" and "symbols" is examined through the metaphor of gears. Fragmentation of information and multifaceted associations streamline the creation of meaning. However, it is unclear how this metaphor describes the "fuzzy borders" of "felt meaning" and the "convergence" of discussion and thought processes in AI-human interaction.

[* New Thoughts (Japanese)

How does the "cog metaphor" describe the "fuzzy borders" of "felt meaning" and the "convergence" of discussion and thought processes in AI-human interactions? There is the ambiguous state of "they're going to mesh" and "it's not good if they mesh as they are because they're spinning at different speeds." It is unclear what this corresponds to. Also, when a gear meshes with multiple existing gears, it is a convergent move, but we need to think more deeply about whether this way of thinking is appropriate.

### Fragment
.

In the "Experiential Process and the Creation of Meaning" study group, "metaphor" refers to "creating new meaning with existing symbols," as represented by "parable" and "metaphor." Symbols are used in ways different from their original meanings. In situations where the meaning felt with existing symbols cannot be accurately expressed, new bonds are created and expressed with symbols that are not normally connected.

As for "understanding," I think it is confusing to use the same translation since we will talk about UNDERSTANDING in the next section.

What happens within the recipient of the metaphorical symbols is that there is no overlap between the "felt meaning" RECOGNITIONED from symbols A and B presented as related, so the overlap is found through expansion and interpretation.

In PRAGMATISM, there are three types of reality that the new truth must take into account. Completely independent realities are hard to find. Human contributions are everywhere and make up what is given.

There are two explanations for when to change the faceplate of the KJ method: one with "sense" and the other with "logic". You change it when you feel it is not running well.

We are becoming a society where knowledge is the most important asset. Money cannot buy knowledge, but it is becoming easier for knowledgeable people to secure money. There is talk of knowledge being a more valuable resource than cash.
