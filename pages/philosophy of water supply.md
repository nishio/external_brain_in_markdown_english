title: "philosophy of water supply"

> The mission of industrialists is to overcome poverty. To do this, he must increase his wealth through production after production of goods. Tap water is a valuable commodity, but no one can blame a beggar for drinking tap water from a park. This is because the quantity is large and the price is so low. The mission of industrialists, like tap water, is to provide an inexhaustible supply of goods at a price that is almost priceless. By doing so, we can bring happiness to people's lives and build a paradise in this world. This is also the true mission of Matsushita.
