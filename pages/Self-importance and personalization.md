title: "Self-importance and personalization"
---

- I was curious about the relationship between [[making something one's own]] and [[making something personal]], so I thought o3
    - [[personal affair]]
        - [[awareness of the parties concerned]] ・ [[independence]]
    - Responsible for the Commons
    - [[Public spirit]], [[cooperation]].
    - [[somebody else's problem]] / [[somebody else's problem]]
    - [[outsider]]/[[bystander]]/[[bystander]].
        - [[indifferent]]
    - [[Dilution of liability]].
- making something personal
    - [[Proprietary]], [[Exclusive]], [[monopolization]]
    - The [[takeover]] of public resources
    - [[Exclusivity]]
    - [[Conflict of Interest]]

- Viewed on two axes
    - [[Partyhood]] (my business/other people's business)
        - The more you shorten the [[psychological distance]], the more you make it about you.
    - Ownership and control (co-ownership/privatization)
        - The more they monopolize institutional control, the more privatized they become.

- Three-party interaction
    - Self-importance ↔ Privatization
        - Although a sense of ownership inherently encourages "participation in the commons," privatization occurs when a powerful entity mistakenly perceives it as "its own authority.
        - Example: "bus factor" problem in OSS projects - collaboration atrophies when core developers enclose authority.
    - Othering ↔ Acceptance of privatization
        - If the many are indifferent, they cannot check the few who are privatizing.
        - Example: black box of administrative procedures - some contractors become interested when citizens lose interest.
    - Personalization without Personalization
        - Optimal Solution. Proactive involvement in the commons, but not exclusivity.
        - Example: governance of Wikipedia - editors are party to the process, but the articles belong to everyone.

- How can we make it "personalized ≠ personalized"?
    - Institutionalize transparency: minutes, codes, and data are made public to create a "private = exposed" structure.
    - Distribution of authority: multiple reviewers, fork culture of source code, etc.
    - Lowering the threshold for participation: UI/UX that raises the "strangers" to "potential participants.
    - Clarify attribution: verbalize the boundary between public goods and private interests and place guardrails at the intersection.

The acquisition of partyhood (personalization) is desirable, but when combined with a monopoly of ownership (privatization), it erodes the public nature of the system.
Conversely, as indifference (stranger-orientation) spreads, privatization is less likely to be detected.
The key is to design a system in which "what belongs to everyone is managed by everyone," encouraging only initiative and decentralizing ownership.
