title: "great things are great"

> We go back to the fundamental question of "What do I have to do?" in a person who can write code.
>  Then, depending on the person, the final output may be disparate, such as making something graphical or competing on performance [Evaluation criteria are not aligned.
>  > But "great is great". The meaning of [[unexplored]] lies in the fact that it brings in a simple evaluation: "If it is great, it will be chosen as a [[supercreator]]."
>  [[authority]] brings in [[scoring criteria]], but unless you are an authority [there is no standard of evaluation other than "wow."
>  This is because the [[context]] has been [[diversified]] by the Internet and no one sees things in the same context.
>  However, only "[[amazing (e.g., of strength)]]" will come across, and I think it is interesting that the unexplored can compete with the next person on the basis of "amazing".
>  And it is very important to be able to convey that awesomeness properly, and this is what is required in the unexplored.
>  I believe that once you go through such an occasion, you will become a high-impact person.
