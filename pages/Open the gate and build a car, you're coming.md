[[open gate construction car]], [[you go, you come]].
- [[You're here.]]
    - I searched for "開門造車, 你行你来" and only Japanese was found. In Chinese, it is [[來]].

> Open the gate and make your own car. If you think you can do it too, please do it here)
> Audrey started to use the proverb "kumon wo tsukuruma wo makujiru" ("to close the gate and make a wheel, and then to close the gate and join the wheels"). [The proverb means, "One person makes a big wheel by himself, but when he leaves the gate, he finds another one just like it. It is often used as an exhortation to have a broader perspective rather than to stay in a small world and be self-absorbed. She uses the phrase "open the gate to make a car," meaning to develop a car by taking in a wide range of opinions from a large number of people.
