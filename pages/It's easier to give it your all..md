title: "It's easier to give it your all."

> [CBydbbmpg](https://x.com/CBydbbmpg/status/1855957396113522858) I've been busy but fulfilled lately, and some days I don't even remember that I have ADHD, but I've been having a hard time finding Strattera because it's so rare these days. I've been busy and fulfilled lately, and there are days when I don't remember that I have ADHD, but I've been having a hard time finding Strattera.
> [yajiusiyajirusi](https://x.com/yajiusiyajirusi/status/1856083915074875613) I think [[ADHD]] makes life better when you are busy enough to forget your traits.
>  It's easier to have ADHD if you're constantly putting out "[[whole energy]]" [[without thinking about the aftermath]].
>  Conversely, if you're living a life that "[[leaves]] extra time" to conform to the world's norms, you often suffer from ADHD traits in that extra time.

> [yajiusiyajirusi](https://x.com/yajiusiyajirusi/status/1856182314776285564) I'll hang the morning's exchange as well, since there's been something of a reaction.
>  >yajiusiyajirusi: It's true that when I'm giving it my all, it's very similar to the feeling of playing [[video games]], and I think ADHD has some characteristics that tend to make me feel that way.
>  At the same time, like the problem of excessive gaming, ADHD has the problem of getting into it too quickly.

> [yajiusiyajirusi](https://x.com/yajiusiyajirusi/status/1856308038250242368) I've been tweeting the same thing lately and was surprised this morning's suddenly buzzed.
>  Let's go back a bit. This is from yesterday.
>  >yajiusiyajirusi: I am practicing a simple ADHD life.
>  With the hunter in mind, I concentrate on one point during the hunt (work) and don't let up for a moment. I've been trying all day with [[overconcentration]]. I work during my lunch break, and my bathroom frequency has decreased dramatically.
>  And at home he sleeps most of the time.
>  Maybe this was the ADHD way of life.
>  The response each day is half-hearted and the sense of fulfillment is amazing.

> [yajiusiyajirusi](https://x.com/yajiusiyajirusi/status/1856309604680118551) Here is a tweet from last week looking back on the work.
>  >yajiusiyajirusi: ADHD is best spent doing everything I can to drive [[single task]] work. The time goes by so fast and it's so easy. After that, I just fall asleep and I don't get tired.
>  For me, it's harder to have a well-balanced job. When I have a lot of spare time, I think about unnecessary things, and that is much more tiring.

> [ochyai](https://x.com/ochyai/status/1856720149254218039) I think this is completely true. And then the means and the end switch, and soon the most important thing is "[[to]] give it your all" and "[[not to]] leave anything to spare".
>  >yajiusiyajirusi: I think ADHD makes your life better when you are busy enough to forget your traits.
>  It's easier to have ADHD if you're always giving it your "all" without thinking about the consequences.
>  Conversely, if you live a life that "leaves you with a lot of leeway" to conform to the world's norms, you often suffer from ADHD characteristics in that extra time.
