title: "random variable"
---

It is useful to recognize variables as "probability distributions" that can take on multiple values, rather than a single value.
We often observe errors in judgment due to the failure to do so.

- Humans tend to overlook higher moments
    - Forget about variance and think only in terms of averages.
            - [[50% chance of achievement even if achieved on average.]]
            - [[Not a natural occurrence of disparity.]]
    - Forgetting moments of higher order than variance.
            - [[mean value]], [[mode]], and [[median]] do not necessarily match
