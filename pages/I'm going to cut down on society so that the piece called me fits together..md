title: "I'm going to cut down on society so that the piece called me fits together."

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1863041365124497507) I like the language of "cutting society to fit the piece that is me". Ideally, it would be better for society to fit without shaving off people, but in reality, there is a clash because society cannot pay the cost. I feel like "[shave off (e.g. a budget, expenses, a salary, etc.)" transforms something hard in an irrecoverable way, but softer would be nishio
