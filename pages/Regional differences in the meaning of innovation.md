A survey conducted in Japan and India asked the question, "What is [[innovation]]?" in both Japan and India, 22.5% in Japan thought it was about technology, while 25.8% in India thought it was about creating added value.

As for how to create strengths, while R&D and flexible organizational systems were associated with Japan, strengthening [[personal creativity]] was associated with India.

Also, in order to survive, it is considered important to have [[Technical Strengths]] in Japan, whereas in India, training in the daily [[PDCA]] cycle is considered necessary.
