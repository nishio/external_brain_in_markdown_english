title: "Losses before and after the fact"
---

- I am negative about [[cutting one's losses]] in stock investments, etc.
    - Most of the world's explanations for loss control seem to be written by people who have never thought about it properly on their own.
    - But there are "good losses" too, what's the difference?
    - I realize it's either before or after.
- Losses include [[Prior Losses]] and [[ex post facto losses]].
    - An advance stop-loss is one in which you decide in advance that you will close the position if it drops 10%.
    - Ex-post loss is a position eliminated after the fact because "the stock price has fallen".

- An advance stop-loss is one in which you decide in advance that you will close the position if it drops 10%.
    - When the [[risk tolerance]] for this position is 10% of the investment, it is rational to [[limited risk]] by deciding in advance that you will exit when the risk tolerance drops to 10% of the investment amount.
- Ex-post loss is a position eliminated after the fact because "the stock price has fallen".
    - The decision to buy a good at a certain price X is a decision that the value of the good is greater than X.
    - Selling goods at a lower price y than that is not consistent with the decision.
