I didn't switch my weekly journal last week.

what to do
- Switching Weekly Journal
- Organize Tabs

The [[XREAL One]] tends to make a lot of desktops.
- There are 5 desktops
- I have nine on hand.
- Let's clean this up.
- 1Pomodoro do.
- [https://pomodorotimer.online/](https://pomodorotimer.online/)
- 5 desktops of which 5 and 4 are miscellaneous
    - 4 had Slack, etc.
    - You're forgetting to open the page in a messy way.
        - [(Organizing Information) Reducing the Burden of Trial and Error - Issue #221 - digitaldemocracy2030/kouchou-ai](https://github.com/digitaldemocracy2030/kouchou-ai/issues/221)
- 3 is a website improvement task
    - This was MERGE'd, so it looks good to be done.
- 2 is [[OSS Weekly Reporter]].
    - The old one that was tried and true is clearly marked as DEPRECATED and terminated.
        - [https://github.com/nishio/gsheet-slack-logger](https://github.com/nishio/gsheet-slack-logger)
    - I didn't see an explanation anywhere, so I'll write that.
    - Clean up brunch
    - Data is in the data branch. Code is in the main branch.
    - If you don't push it, the next time you tell Devin to do something, he'll start with the old one.
    - Merged, but I can't confirm the result, contact done.
        - FIXED✅
1 Pomodoro so far
- Close once 1 (broadband AI) is also completed.
- I'd like to see a mechanism to open various apps and restore their placement.
    - I'd like to do something like putting a VSCode with kouchou-ai open and a Chrome with GitHub kouchou-ai open side by side.
    - →[[Hammerspoon]]
- The desktop on the VR side is done except for this one I'm working on now.
- Consider the desktop at hand.
- Ninth desktop is maximized Chrome
    - gsheet-slack-logger related Devin and GitHub were open
    - Slack's OAuth token management page or something like that is open.
        - [[Digital Democracy 2030]] Slack's Log: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nRUsVD_g__jaUZzWIzZ_wvhNNr3xRqMl](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nRUsVD_g__jaUZzWIzZ_wvhNNr3xRqMl)
        - I cleaned up the experimental process by deleting trash and stuff.
        - I wonder where to put this so I can easily find it when I need it.
- 8th desktop is private VSCode
    - Oh, I see, you're using it as a place to write the work that hasn't been differentiated into a project yet, so the task is languishing in the form of a branch.
    - Delete the first branch as it has already been published as a separate repo
    - Second, yeah, I've been trying to build a prototype to test it, and I haven't been able to test it.
        - The work to try is not to be done now.
            - [[Theanine Prototype]]

2Exit because I couldn't connect to Wifi at the end of the Pomodoro

The work café I was interested in, I hadn't been there in the winter because it was cold, but when I went there after a long time, it had changed to an unmanned operation.
- Come to think of it, manga cafes also have a system where you choose your own seat, get out a piece of paper with a QR code, sit down yourself, and produce your own QR code to be read when you leave.
- The idea is spreading that "[[customer service]] is not necessary."
    - I'm sure the background is the rising cost of human
- I think this cafe used to require one drink, but they seem to have changed their business model to a manga café like 2 hour or 5 hour package.
    - What is a café?
    - Well, I guess it's similar because no one uses comic book cafes for coffee.
- Good to be fixed and facing the wall.
- I went to Komeda Coffee for lunch and found this seat.

    - I thought Mr. A might mind, but there's a partition to block his line of sight that way, so not so much.
    - I rather didn't want "Mr. C to interpret it as if he were looking at Mr. B".
    - If you try to look at the clock in the upper right corner of the monitor, you'll have to turn your head pretty firmly.

Organizing Continued
- Seventh desktop is maximized Chrome
    - Experiments with screening documents in [Google AI Studio
    - I was like, "Wow, I'm going to read 100+ book PDFs and the AI is going to talk to me..." but it takes 7 minutes to respond, so I did something else while I waited and forgot all about it.
    - "Do you have anything of this type?" I got the impression that this question didn't go over very well.
        - Maybe because "this kind of system" is vague. I guess we can determine if it's "something that deals with hardware" or something like that, but it takes advanced thinking to find the connection to intellectual productivity improvement or digital democracy, and since the attentional mechanism is only an inner product after all, it's not possible to make a connection heading that can be found without making an abstraction.
        - If it's something that could be found in a vector search, you'll find it.
        - To do this, I wonder if it is still necessary to think [[Reasoning model]] by inputting one's thought output many times.
    - The tab on the drive with the documents in it, when I close it, I'm going to say where was it?
        - Create a page in private scrapbox for screening tasks ✅.

I swipe three fingers left and right out of habit, but now the VR side world is one desktop, so it doesn't switch.
- Pomodoro timer running on screen to keep you focused
- The browser I'm writing this on right now is in the middle of my field of vision at all times.

6th desktop maximized Chrome
- It's rather miscellaneous.

    - [[Diary 2025-03-26]]
    - > I used Devin's ACU extinction deadline was coming up, so I used it in a big way, but still, using a lot of Devin in parallel efficiently punctures your head.
        - Various Considerations
        - Subsequent development: [[Time cost estimation error for context externalization]].
            - 4/3
- There was something I thought I'd Scrap associated with it, and I processed it retroactively.
    - Looked back to 3/25.
        - [/qualia-san/4o illustration period](https://scrapbox.io/qualia-san/4o illustration period)
    - I haven't made any progress in putting together the Qualia and fan art from various locations.
        - If you don't do it when you see it, you won't know where it went...

I've concentrated on working through the pomodoro.

Pomodoro IV
- 6th desktop cont.
    - Can we close the log of the ChatGPT experiment in [[OSS Weekly Reporter]] that I haven't put on gist yet?
    - Doc and Kanban for various projects
            - I've never done team development with [[kanban]], so I don't really understand the implicit process of how it's used.
            - I don't understand why someone else moves a task assigned to me to a different phase.
            - However, I don't recognize my tasks in kanban, so the idea of updating kanban never occurs to me.
- Fifth Desktop
    - [[Presentation of the 14th Cybozu Labo Youth Achievement Meeting]].
    - [[Google Calendar]], I usually use [[iCal]], so I tend to miss updates.
        - I've found it useful to use [[Google Meet]] in video conferencing to do regular meetings.
        - Alexa was able to connect both [[Google Calendar]] and [[iCal]], so there must be a technical solution
    - [[Service Account]] for writing to [[Google Drive]].
        - We can look at the [[Google Cloud]] console when we need this.
        - Yeah, this is how it works.
            - I'll open it in a tab because it's a page I need to work on now," and then I forget it exists and open it again.
                - [[Link tab information from Chrome Extension to LLM]]
- Fourth desktop is terminal full screen
    - I'm going to keep this one.
- Third desktop
    - Just two Finder open for moving files, close.
- Second Desktop
    - Chrome with tabs open at a level where only icons are visible
        - This is not good because it makes the listing worse.
        - I saw someone using tree-style tabs in the sidebar in Firefox, maybe something like that is actually better.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>Tree-style tab extensions such as "Tree Style Tab" for Firefox make full use of the dedicated sidebar UI. However, the Chrome extension API does not allow the sidebar to be displayed freely, making it difficult to handle tree-style tabs as naturally as Firefox.

    - [[AIPM2025-03-11]] Digital Democracy 2030 in the middle of development and being left out as a higher priority.
        - [https://app.devin.ai/sessions/a60380cc6a3f47008f78ac2cf9f6748b](https://app.devin.ai/sessions/a60380cc6a3f47008f78ac2cf9f6748b)
    - The tabs from when I struggled with Azure are piling up like a geological formation.
    - Attempts to get Devin to do research have not been very successful.
        - [https://app.devin.ai/sessions/44c890835493425ba79a3bacb2872eee](https://app.devin.ai/sessions/44c890835493425ba79a3bacb2872eee)
        - Many times by keeping logs from the past, you pick up something different from the current context and get confused.
            - [I made Cline (Roo Code) a runaway train and it generated months worth of code in 4 days.
            - > Basically, there is one thing that we need to keep simple or we will soon go bankrupt.
            - > LLMs are prone to various failures due to inconsistencies. This is due to the smartness of the model itself (a rule of thumb, but to some extent it is proportional to the number of parameters), which makes a big difference in its resistance to failures. This is why you need to keep it simple.
            - > I had confirmed that the code was shaky, but in the human sense, a little bit of shitty code in the code would not cause the project to fail, so I decided to go ahead with the project! So, I went ahead with the project, but it turned out to be the cause of the project's failure! Well, if you think about it properly, that's true, but AI is more dangerous than humans in the sense of the broken window theory.
        - In that light, maybe it's a good idea to have Devin do only specific tasks that are cut out of the research direction~.

I continued working during the break after the pomodoro was over and realized that I had penetrated the break.

We have a few minutes before the end of the two-hour backlog! Let's go home.
- Ukea, there is no system for customers to self-pay w
    - I operate the store staff's order management terminal for the checkout, and then I put the amount into the payment terminal, and I touch w
        - It's a completely sexualized operation.
    - This is the kind of work that shopkeepers do!
        - It was confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's not hard.
        - If it were difficult, the part-time clerks in the stores wouldn't be able to do it.

Nope, but I've spent 6 Pomodoro hours in a concentrated state and still haven't finished sorting it out.
- Clean up two weeks' worth of clutter.
- We're almost done.

1st desktop
- VSCode of repo for company deployments
- broadlistening-research VSCode
    - I'm checking out the branch Devin wrote and observing, but it looks subtle.
- aipm VSCode
- Beeper, Mattermost, Discord, iMessage
- iCal
- ActivityMonitor
- Well, let's just leave it at that.

Xreal One reduces the possibility of being distracted by your phone because you can't use FaceID to get into your iPhone and it's a bit of a hassle.

So this is what happens when you put on XREAL One and video conference.
