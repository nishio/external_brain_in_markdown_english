memo
- ✅Fix the metadata generated by the exe version at the beginning of the project, because it is repr and pretends to be JSON.
    - ✅Consolidate the placement of metadata
- 🤔Automatically post to Insta.
    - I tried, but it's hard.
- Added filter tool functionality
    - plan
        - "Move it all together to NOT GOOD."
        - Remove this prompt."
        - EDIT this prompt to add."
- Try to create a network with Scrapbox
    - Automatic submission to Gyazo
    - JSON Generation
- Mastering the art of inpaint
- A6000 to determine the difference in speed between single precision and semi-precision.
    - See what difference the output makes
- Is there a difference between "by X" and "in X style"?
- I have 9600 cat images generated by Stable Diffusion and 600 of them labeled "good" by Mr. and Mrs. Nishio, and I have a feeling that it's time to let the computer create the prompts!

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1568973539138732032): I've got a little over 10,000 output results from Stable Diffusion and a list of 600 good images to choose from, with a high success rate. I created a mechanism to automatically generate the prompt itself by combining the elements of the prompt.
>  I have modified the script to create and save a folder for each prompt, so if I merge them as they are, I will have a lot of "folders with only one image", should I put the images generated by the auto-generated prompts in one folder?
> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1568983958326771712): picture drawn by the program according to the prompt instructions generated by the program

> Oh, no, I failed to save the generated prompts and I'm in the dark about how they were created.
> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1568986169307983872): fixed and computer generated prompts are now saved.

[C3: Computer Created Cats on Instagram: "This is the first picture drawn by the AI according to a prompt created by the other AI. Unfortunately, the AI did not write the prompt to a file, so we will never know what kind of prompt it used to create the picture. Yet another AI said it is "an #artdeco painting of a cat on a hill, in #LouisWain style." #ComputerCreatedCats using #StableDiffusion"](https://www.instagram.com/p/CiX0bxYJgJZ/)
