I'll try my best to get to the point where I can explain it in one line and convey the fun v.s. I won't verbalize it poorly.

    - If something is interesting and is not the premise of the issue, let's first try to verbalize it.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/blu3mo/icon' alt='blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>I thought this was a natural with Scrapbox.
        - I'll do my best to get to the point where I can explain it in one line and tell you how interesting it is.
        - I don't know if the language is any good, but at least it can be tested.
        - Then rapid prototyping
    - That way we can get more hits.
    - Talk about summing up an idea in one word ([[claim]]).
        - Rebuttal: [/shokai/ not verbalized poorly](https://scrapbox.io/shokai/ not verbalized poorly).
- This is called "[[下手に言語化しない]]」の意味を掘り下げたほうがいい<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - > I think we should stop this strange custom of explaining the concept of a product in a few words important information is missing it's inevitable for external presentation, but
    - A "one-line description" is "something that lacks important information" and is "something you have no choice but to do for the sake of an external presentation."
    - So why do "external presentations"?
    - It is a "[[cut flower]]" with "important details cut off," not the most important part of the product.
