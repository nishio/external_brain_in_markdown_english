title: "centralization of power"
---

- Suppose the status quo is [centralized authoritarian rule
- Often people think that there are all kinds of problems with centralized things, so let's make something decentralized.
- But that centralized structure wasn't there from the beginning.
- From a decentralized state came its centralized structure.
- We'll call this "centralization."
- Since centralization happened in the past, if you create something new and decentralized now, it will also become centralized.
- We need to determine why centralization happened and stop its causes.

After listening to the presentation on creating a non-centralized platform at the Unexplored Achievement Reporting Conference 2018, I was talking with [[great river]] at the cafe and heard his point that "even if you create a non-centralized service, centralization can occur within it", which was an eye-opener for me, so I took notes.

Principle 1
    - [[network effect]] exists.
- A network that grows to a certain size grows even larger.
- An oligopoly by a single network will occur.
→This could be a pattern of "an oligopoly by a single network has occurred, but that network is operated de-centrally rather than by a specific operator". Isn't the network effect independent of centralization for the users of the network?

Principle 2
    - [[the rich get richer and richer]] There is positive feedback ([[Matthew effect]])
- Resource oligopoly occurs

Principle 3
- There is no power to balance resource bias (a natural assumption if no centralized entity is assumed to exist).
- Resource bias occurs naturally: see [[Not a natural occurrence of disparity.]].
