- The [[idea]] that looks like a [[starting point]] is usually discovered later in the work


The 783rd Design Gallery 1953 Exhibition
Atsumi Kikuchi: "Ideas that look like starting points are usually discovered later in the work."
- > I dare to use a rough expression, but I understand that there are two types of creators: those who can think for themselves and those who are influenced by the ideas of others. [[Atsumi Kikuchi]] is the former type. There is no doubt that Kikuchi's work is the result of his dedicated thought to derive the optimal solution. Kikuchi's expression shows his respect for the academism of graphic design. And as I look at the flexible and diverse expressions that "cross the boundaries" of his unique methodology, which he has created himself, I am convinced that Kikuchi is an innovator in the world of design. [[Keiko Hirano]]
