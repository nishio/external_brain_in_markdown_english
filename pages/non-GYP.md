- Most people work on a "receive 100 requirement specifications and produce 100 outputs" system.
- There is another kind of work that says, "The only specification required is the direction, so do what you want and produce as high a result as you can, whether it's 200 or 300.
        - [[discretion]]
    - Do as you please," but of course there are [[constraints]].
        - And it's not clear in advance what restrictions are in place.
        - It becomes clear after the fact as we move forward.
                - [[Examine the shape of the constraint]]
                - [[Go ahead, hit the wall and turn.]]
- These tasks can only be entrusted to "people who can do these tasks.
        - [[self-propulsion]]  /  [[self-propulsion]]  /  [[ability to move forward on one's own]]
    - The opposite type: "What do you need me to do to get this project going?" and [awaiting instructions
        - The "receive 100 requirements and produce 100 outputs" type of person doesn't move until the requirements are given.
        - If the requirements are vague, do it in the way that's easiest for you.
            - The goal is not to achieve high results, but to "produce 100% of the output for the requirement.
            - If the request is vague and it looks like 50, they'll give you an output of 50.
            - Same as prompt to LLM
                - Writing bad prompts yields bad results.
                - Writing good prompts doesn't always get good results, but, well, there's a correlation.
                - The responsibility for a good or bad prompt lies with the one giving the instructions.
        - However, there is no way to create a perfect requirement specification when the constraints are not clear in advance.
            - Micromanagement to reduce the chance of misalignment?
            - Do you take misalignment for granted?
                    - [[I don't expect others to do it.]]

People without the ability to run themselves will be out of a job in the near future as AI will destroy them.
- but whether it does or not is completely irrelevant to the blobject moving forward.
- It is the employer's responsibility to put in good prompts to make the "agents", whether AI or human, do a good job.

A person who is not self-driven can only act as a "non-self-driven agent," while a person who is self-driven can do both.
- Because [[my time resources are]] limited.
    - Decide for yourself how much of that finite resource to distribute to which projects.
    - In other words, a person's "own purpose" exists as a higher existence than "the purpose of the project," and if it is beneficial to the achievement of the purpose, the person will actively work, and if not, the person will work in moderation.
        - [[Pick up, don't pick up, hit back]]
