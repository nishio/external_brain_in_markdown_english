<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Discovering Japan/icon' alt='Discovering Japan.icon' height="19.5"/> "[[幸先詣]]" (saisaki mode) refers to the practice of visiting a [[shrine]] for the [[New Year's prayers]] before the actual New Year, typically around the end of the year. This practice became more common during the [[COVID-19]] pandemic as a way to avoid the usual crowds during the traditional "[[初詣]]" (hatsumōde), the first shrine visit in the new year.

Sakisaki mode allowed people to observe the important cultural tradition of praying for good luck, health, and prosperity in the new year, while also maintaining social distancing and safety measures due to the pandemic. It's a good example of how traditional practices can adapt to contemporary circumstances, balancing cultural significance with public health needs.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Discovering Japan/icon' alt='Discovering Japan.icon' height="19.5"/> "初詣" (hatsumōde) is a significant Japanese tradition observed during the New Year. It translates to the "first shrine visit of the New Year." This tradition involves visiting a shrine or temple for the first time in the new year, usually immediately after midnight on New Year's Eve or within the first few days of January.

During hatsumōde, people pray for good fortune, health, and success for the coming year. It's a time for making wishes or resolutions and expressing gratitude. Shrines and temples are often crowded during this period, with long queues of people waiting to pray.

People also buy [[omamori]] (amulets) for protection or good luck and return the old ones they got the previous year so they can be burned and purified. There's a festive atmosphere, with food stalls and decorations, making it a unique cultural experience.

It's often used in the context of religious or spiritual visits for prayer, reflection, or participating in religious ceremonies. In Japanese culture, such visits are considered important for showing respect to deities or ancestral spirits, seeking blessings, and expressing gratitude.

The concept of "mode" is deeply embedded in Japanese traditions, where visiting shrines and temples plays a significant role in people's lives, not just for religious reasons but also as a part of cultural and social practices.
