    - With the advent of ChatGPT in November 2022, the importance of early utilization was recognized.
        - Mr. Tsuruta of JAC Recruitment expected the regulations to come into effect early and thought it was important to use them up as soon as possible.

            - Expectation that communication in natural language will create the ultimate system.

- Status of Efforts by Both Companies
    - Both companies are in the process of implementing a search function that leverages their internal knowledge base. Feedback was incorporated and tuning of prompts proved to be important.
        - We are in the process of implementing a search function that leverages our in-house knowledge base.
        - A system was established to incorporate feedback and determine whether a response was good or bad.

        - Tsuruta: Tuning of prompts proved to be important for improving accuracy.
            - Bad answers are misinterpreted, good answers are enhanced and exceed expectations.
        - Suzuki: AI Accuracy Improvement and Feedback
            - Employees provide feedback on how good or bad the answers are, which is used to improve the system.
            - We also devised a way to provide two answers to a single question and let people decide which is more appropriate.
            - There is a gap between developers' intentions and users' expectations

- How to deal with AI
    - Tsuruta: It is important to understand that AI is not perfect like humans, and to recognize that it has its own habits and to deal with them.
        - Like human new hires, AI should be viewed as having room for growth.
    - Suzuki: By giving them names and personalizing them, such as "Exciting-kun," communication with employees will become smoother.

- JAC Recruitment's 4-step approach
    - Level 1
        - Effective use of internal information

            - Easy to experience value

        - Increased consultant time productivity
            - Consultant Assistant
            - This is because the presenter's industry is "a type of business model where the consultant's work efficiency is the bottleneck.[[ビジネスインパクト]]があるということ<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Level 4
        - Creating CX (Customer Experience) using AI

- Recruitment of human resources and formulation of guidelines
    - AI engineers are scarce, accounting for only 5-6% of the total, and securing them is a challenge.
    - Companies have begun to formulate generation AI guidelines, and the handling of information is being discussed.

- Requests to Microsoft
    - Efforts to unify guidelines and improve the reliability of information
    - [[Copilot Copyright Commitment]]
    - Review of Azure OpenAI Service pricing
    - Some call for seamless integration to avoid fragmentation of services

In general, the speakers' view was that, while not expecting too much, it is important to steadily expand the scope of utilization, share knowledge among companies, and promote the practical application of AI from Japan.
