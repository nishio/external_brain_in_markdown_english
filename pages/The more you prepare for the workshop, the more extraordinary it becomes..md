title: "The more you prepare for the workshop, the more extraordinary it becomes."
---

The more you prepare "something for [[workshop]]," the more it will feel different from [[everyday]].
The experience with sticky notes and pens, which we often see, creates an opportunity to look at the sticky notes the next day and say, "Oh, yes, let's do that. On the other hand, in a workshop where a special template is distributed and the participants fill it in, when they want to do the same thing after returning home, they first have to go back and get the template.
When a workshop becomes [[the extraordinary]], it becomes disconnected from the everyday, and away from post-workshop utilization.
