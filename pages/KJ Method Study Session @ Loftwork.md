- 2022-08-19  [[KJ Method Study Session @ Cybozu]]
    - The event was postponed, so a study session was held earlier within Cybozu using the same lecture materials.
    - Questions added.
- 2022-11-16 Meeting
    - The lecture material was to be a short 30 minute version.
        - It is inefficient to use voice, a protocol with low information density, for one-way information transfer.
        - I'll let you go read the previous version.

        - [[KJ Method Study Session @ Loftwork_Lecture Material v2]]
        - Tried speaking, 31 minutes.
        - Process: [[Create a short version of the lecture material]].
            - I'm worried about the not-so-smooth part because time is tight unlike when I spoke at the Cybozu workshop... I'll have to record it once and get the kebab out of the way.
    - A concept that began to take shape in discussions during the meeting, "Making the Loftwork way [[a means, not an end]]."
        - There was [[an uncomfortable feeling]] when I saw the question "How do you think we can create the Loftwork style?" in the post-course survey.
        - For veterans who have developed their own style in accordance with their work, the appropriate question is "How can we share this style within the organization and not keep it to ourselves?
        - Not an appropriate question for someone new to the KJ method.
            - I prefer content that I feel I have more control over.
    - They said some people thought the parable was funny.
        - The story of focusing on metaphors and developing them in the world of metaphors is described in detail in [[(6.2.4) Parables, metaphors, and analogies]] of The Engineer's Guide to Intellectual Production.

2022-12-02 Day of the event
- When I looked on the morning of the day, a surprising majority of people had started making nets.
    - The only pre-task was to make 25 labels and read the lecture material, which was very active and good!
    - Maybe it was a good thing that each individual's situation was visualized and shared on Miro.
    - Maybe the fact that the instructor and organizer each had their own nets in Miro [show what you've got
- I went around commenting on the state of affairs as of this morning, as there was no merit in procrastinating.
