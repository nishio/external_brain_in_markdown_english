They say there's a cold going around that causes a swollen throat.
- I thought I had a rough throat, but it got worse in a few days, so I'm going to the hospital.
- I'm going to Genron tomorrow at Ken Suzuki's invitation, and I don't want to have a gibbering cough, so I'll do my best to cure it.
- progress
    - Monday: My throat hurts from talking too much, let's lick the throat lozenges.
    - Tuesday: more pain.
    - Wednesday: throat swells while sleeping, fever in afternoon due to throat inflammation.
        - His throat was swollen and he snored terribly, neither of us got much sleep.
- Anyone with a sore throat may want to go to the hospital as early as Monday.
