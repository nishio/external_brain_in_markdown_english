I think that LLM is a revolutionary technology, but at the same time, it requires background knowledge of conventional natural language processing in order to use it properly, so I don't think ordinary people will be able to handle this one either.

I think that the domain of competition is to combine and re-rank sparse and dens search when increasing the usefulness of it.
