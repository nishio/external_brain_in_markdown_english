title: "elimination of conflicts"
---

When I use these words, my brain is thinking of [[sublation (philosophy)]] ([[pick up]]) and [[dialectic development]] in [[dialectics]], but if I use these words without explanation to someone who doesn't share my background, they won't understand them. I think it's fine to use "[[elimination of conflicts]] because [[cancellation]] of [[confrontation]]" because people who don't share my background can't understand me if I use these words without explanation, and it's not worth explaining.

- [Patterns of Change, where [[statement]] and [[antithesis]] are [[picked up]] to become [[synthesis (in semiconductor technology)]], are everywhere like [[natural]] for those who can see them. But there are many people who [I can't notice it.

- [[A cylinder looks like a circle or a square, but it is neither a circle nor a square]]
