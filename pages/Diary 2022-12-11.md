- End of [Scrapbox auto-generated diary period
- Automatic generation started [[Diary 2022-05-21]].

How did it end?
- 5 of the Top 30 cards are empty diary pages
    - Well, I guess I used up all my energy at the [[KJ Method Study Session @ Loftwork]] and didn't get around to writing my diary.

        - On the personal project side, the diary page is being generated as empty.
            - Do you think we could reprint the diary here?

        - I'm sure there's a lot of experimentation going on when API submissions are available.
        - On the other hand, I remember "Putting in mechanically generated content makes it look like a garbage dump.
        - I thought this was [[making a house into a garbage dump]], too.
            - > In the personal project, the diary page is being generated with an empty page.
        - Empty diary pages are "mechanically generated pages of low quality."
            - I feel like it's okay if the quality is low, as long as it doesn't get in the way.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - The top page shows an empty page, and yesterday I was thinking, "It's not good that it's empty, so I'll fill it in."[[It's used by the machine.]] 」感がある<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- I don't think you need to make one diary page every day.
    - Especially if they leave it empty.
    - I'd be able to write at least one piece a week that says, "I was busy this week with what?"
    - I think we should do it at least once a week.
