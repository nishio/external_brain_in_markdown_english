A convergent move ([[convergent move]]) is "a move with multiple [[backlinks]]" in [lincography
    - [[Interpretation in divergence and convergence lincography]]

A number of stories connect to this concept as a hub.
- Lincography's "move with multiple backlinks is a convergent move"
- The relationship lines found between unrelated groups are important.
- Unexpected blue link" and "[[Scrapbox's link suggestions are useful]]" in Scrapbox

My previous research note was about "convergent moves". According to Nishio's research note, "[[Scrapbox supports convergent moves]]," Scrapbox functions as a tool to support these convergent moves. Scrapbox functions as a tool to support these convergent moves. The fragment "[The appropriate way to cut out the need is determined after the need is identified.

Furthermore, the fragment "There are at least three models of learning" is related to the idea of convergent moves. Three models of learning are proposed: a one-way lecture model, a self-taught, trial-and-error model, and a model of learning by exchanging knowledge with each other. These learning styles influence how we understand problems and needs and find solutions in the Convergent Moves process.
- I'm not sure about this one.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

Based on the above information, we believe that convergent moves play an important role in the problem solving and learning process. In addition, the process of convergent moves can be made more efficient by using tools such as Scrapbox.

### Digest (Japanese)

My last research note was about "convergent moves". This refers to a pattern of behavior in which, after a problem or need is clarified, a specific solution or response is cut out; according to Nishio's research note, "Scrapbox Supports Convergent Moves," Scrapbox functions as a tool to support these convergent moves. Fragmentation also complements the idea of the Convergent Move: "The appropriate way to cut out is determined after the needs are identified.

Furthermore, the fragment "There are at least three models of learning" is related to the idea of convergent moves. Three models of learning are proposed: a one-way lecture model, a self-taught, trial-and-error model, and a model of learning by exchanging knowledge with each other. These learning styles influence how we understand problems and needs and find solutions in the Convergent Moves process.

Based on the above information, we believe that convergent moves play an important role in the problem solving and learning process. In addition, the process of convergent moves can be made more efficient by using tools such as Scrapbox.
