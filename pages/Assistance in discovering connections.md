title: "Assistance in discovering connections"
---

- I wonder if we can apply the Scrapbox-like "support for discovering connections" to support discovering connections between different content (e.g. different people's Scrapboxes, blogs, etc.)....
- I'm starting to think there are about 3 patterns in Scrapbox's "[[Support for Discovering Connections]]".
    - 1: Put out content that has manually selected keywords in common at the bottom of the page as related content.
        - This is the same as "[[Related Articles]]" in blogs, etc., a link between static items.
    - 2: A function that informs you that "there is an article with those keywords" by turning the link blue at the time you bracket the important keywords in the article you are writing or reading with the feeling of highlighting them.
    - 3: When you are about to write important keywords and have started writing after opening the bracket, you can apply [[ambiguous search]] to existing keywords with the keywords you are writing to absorb spelling errors and discover related keywords from a slightly different viewpoint.
- 2 and 3 are connection discovery support for "what I am editing right now.
    - This is one of the reasons why it's hard to communicate Scrapbox's features to people who don't use Scrapbox
- Given this, there is a need for a function to support the discovery of connections that would make one side of what you are currently editing.
    - For example, when you output short fragments such as tweets or chat posts, and then organize and summarize them after the fact, the initial fragment writing phase is a form of support for discovering connections.
    - If you don't want users to use a new tool, it could be a bot that sends links to tweets, or a [[chatbot]], or something like that.
    - Instead of reacting every time, I feel like I only react when I find a good connection.
            - [[bracketing]] Maybe we can explicitly trigger it when we do.

- [[connection]]
- [[Twitter Bots]]
