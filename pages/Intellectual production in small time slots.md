Intellectual production in small time slots
About methods of intellectual production that take advantage of fragmented time to write things down and allow thoughts to develop over time, generating new perspectives and ideas.

AI's comment on yesterday's diary [[Diary 2023-09-05]].
> ... In the notes, it is stated that mind maps are multi-headed and that branches can grow when reviewed over time. This indicates that multi-headed thinking develops over time and new perspectives and ideas emerge.
>  The notes take an in-depth look at the process of intellectual production and its improvement. In particular, intellectual production... [[disjunctive time]] also states that there are types of things that can be done and types of things that can't be done. This offers a new perspective on the methods and efficiencies of intellectual production.
[[Intellectual production possible in fragmented time]], first verbalized would be sticky note writing on the commute to work in the early stages of writing The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production
- I wonder if there's a story somewhere about what he actually wrote in the elevator.
- Found: [[Examples of sticky notes written in skimmer]].

The same goes for extending a branch, you can extend a branch little by little on the Scrapbox, and it will be integrated later.
How is this "integration" part done?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Regarding the "synthesis" part, in relation to the extension of branches on the Scrapbox, synthesis may refer to the process by which individual knowledge and information are integrated to create new knowledge and insights. This process may involve the conscious or unconscious combination of information and experiences gathered in daily life and emerging as new ideas and perspectives. This is similar to the process of "synthesis" that takes place in the human brain, and tools such as Scrapbox may be used to aid in this process, leading to even more effective intellectual production.
