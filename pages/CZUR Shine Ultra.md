- I'm running Gyazo's OCR right now, and I can probably OCR it with no problem at all resolution-wise.

Auto-correction of curved books failed because of sticky notes.
Automatic recognition of hand flipping allows you to scan while flipping pages rather crisply.
I think I can OCR enough on this screen that I'm scanning.
- No, but it is easy to watch for the appearance of images and upload them to Gyazo as soon as they appear, since they are scanned by automatic recognition of hand flipping and generated in a specific folder as shown below.

Whether it's better for the AI to read the image directly or to OCR it before passing it on is something that's going to change rather quickly in the future.
- Either way, having a voice conversation with an AI while reading a book, such as "What did you mean when you wrote '~' earlier?" or "You mean page 42, and I quote, '~'" is already "achievable with a little effort.
