title: "Stupid is good, but lying is not."
---

A softer, separate expression of [[fairness]] in Cybozu

[Idiots are fine, but not lies. #Badly, but not a lie.](https://note.com/tsunashi/n/n91ebed597d73)
    - [[fool]] is fine, but [[lie]] is not.

I recently saw the expression, "It's okay to be an asshole, but not to lie, [[it's everyone's responsibility to correct the asshole]]," and I thought this was taking it a step further.
If it's his responsibility to correct the asshole, he'll have an incentive to hide it and try to solve it alone.
But if it's everyone's responsibility, it's easier to share information promptly and solve the problem with everyone's help.

Because if you just fail the exam, you will be recognized as an idiot or lack of effort, but if you are caught plagiarizing, you will be labeled a "[[dishonest]]". This is a much more serious sin than being an idiot. (Although stupidity is not a sin.)
