I made a [[GPT4]] that reads and [[RAGs]] this Scrapbox data, etc.

- The [[Omoikane Embed]] system, which automatically makes [[Omoikane Project]] an embedded vector, has been introduced to this Scrapbox project/nishio.
Since omoikane-nishio is long, I decided to use omni. omni is also a word of Latin origin meaning "all." This is a postfix.

The model is GPT-4<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>, but if it is loaded with [/nishio](https://scrapbox.io/nishio)-derived chunks, we consider it a different personality and call it by a different name.

- So far, we have experimented with only this /nishio data in a public forum. We are so convinced of its usefulness that we have started a larger scale experiment, and as of 9/22, over 100,000 records have been retrieved from the segment.
- Could "omni who reads only /nishio" and "omni who reads more" be different personalities? The question arises
    - Will I continue to use the former OMNI?
        - In fact, I haven't activated the former since the latter started working...
        - If there is only the latter in the future, is the interpretation "OMNI has grown up" appropriate?
