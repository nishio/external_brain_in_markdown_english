- They take multiple people as if they were one person and get angry when they say that there is no consistency in their statements.
- They are different people, so it is not surprising that they are not consistent.
- Identifying with different people is [[human bug]].
    - Because of their limited cognitive abilities and inability to think individually
        - Same phenomenon as [Cognitive Resolution
    - I thought I was thinking of it as [[Assume a homogeneous group of people]], but I'm not sure if I even recognize them as a group in the first place. I'm starting to get the feeling that they don't even recognize them as a group in the first place.

- [[incorrect personification of a person]]
[[Bug that sees a group of people as one person]].
