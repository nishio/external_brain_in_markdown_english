I call up my 20 year old self and have him kill my current self.
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1738311199866208733) To [[kill myself]] after 20 years [[problems caused by the elderly (esp. gerontocracy, and elderly people's control over the young)]] I've collected cases and confronted them, but this is still not enough. Because the effect of killing yourself is triggered 20 years later, because you live [[at peace]] now, and you can't [[face death]] now unless you invoke yourself 20 years ago and make yourself kill yourself now.

relevance
    - [[A snake that doesn't molt dies.]]
    - [[If you don't want to die, die now.]]
    - [[uncool]]
    - Key words for my 20-something self to kill my 40-something self.
    - The same composition that my 40-something self used to kill my 60-something self was "[problems caused by the elderly (esp. gerontocracy, and elderly people's control over the young)" as the key phrase.
