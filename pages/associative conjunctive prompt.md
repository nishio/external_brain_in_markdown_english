title: "associative conjunctive prompt"
---

A kind of experiment to make AI do the intellectual production I do.
I did a sudden thought with "[I'm going to go get tied up for want of bondage.

prompt: see this discussion and make associative connections with past thinkers

Example of what we did with ChatGPT 4o:.
    - [[I'm going to go get tied up for want of bondage.]]
    - I personally had only one [[associative connection]] (Fromm's "Escape from Freedom").
    - But the AI made three associative connections.
    - [[The general will is similar to the sense of reading the air.]]
    - [[Capitalism as a deliberative elite system and the general will]]
