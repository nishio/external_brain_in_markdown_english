1. background and introduction
- Theme: "Decentralizing Research Towards Open Academia
    - Need to change research from "closed" to "open
    - New ways of research funding and collaboration using crowdfunding, etc.

2. what is [[Academist]]?
- Entrepreneurial History:
    - Feeling the closure of research as a graduate student.
    - Inspired by the way graduate students abroad are connecting with diverse stakeholders
    - Founded with the purpose of creating a mechanism to "communicate our research vision to society at large and connect with supporters.
- Service Overview:
    - Providing a platform to connect researchers and supporters, with a focus on research-specific crowdfunding

3. closed and open academia
- Closed Academies Features:
    - Reliance on public funds (taxpayers' money) to finance research
    - Distant distance between researchers and supporters (taxpayers)
    - Receivers of research results tend to be limited within the academic community
- Open Academia Features:
    - Utilize diverse funding sources (individual support, corporations, foundations, etc.)
    - Researchers share and dialogue their research vision with society
    - Research results are returned to various stakeholders

4. main initiatives of Academist
    - [[crowdfunding]] （CF）
    - [Pioneer in Japan as a "research-specific crowdfunding" company
    - Adopts an all-or-nothing method (if the target amount is not reached, the funds will not be received)
    - In many cases, CF is used in the 0 to 1 conception stage, and later connected to public funds.
    - Direct" communication with supporters is possible.
- [[Fan Club]]
    - For a small monthly support fee, the researcher's daily progress and personality are continuously communicated.
    - Build long-term relationships with supporters
    - Efforts to utilize the "corporate matching pool (price formation is a type of secondary support)" mechanism are also underway.

5. 10 years of experience
- Number of projects implemented: over 300
- Partner universities: 189
- Total number of supporters: more than 27,000
- Total support: approx. 310 million yen
- Further ripple effects: Many researchers have received large research grants (totaling approximately 270 million yen) after CF
- Industry-government-academia collaboration: About 2/3 of the researchers obtained new collaborations with companies, educational institutions, etc.

6. the importance of [[Research Relations]] (Re: Rel)
- Role:
    - Organize and disseminate the researcher's vision and research in an easy-to-understand manner
    - Create contacts with businesses and society to generate support and collaboration
- Required Skills:
    - Deep understanding of academia (ideally PhD holder, etc.)
    - Ability to bridge industry and society (connect their "stories" and create new value)
- [Re:Rel -- A new type of job that realizes the vision of researchers｜Academist Corporation](https://note.com/academist/n/nbfd39a5d0a45)

7. the concept of the Decentralized Research Institute
- Aim:
    - Research organizations with diverse funding sources that are not overly dependent on public funds
    - Operate as a "small unit" of about 50 people, and assume mutual cooperation (openness).
    - Researchers, supporters, and ReL personnel form autonomous teams to promote research
- Expected Effects:
    - Easy to create multifaceted cooperation and co-creation
    - Promote open academia and increase research freedom

8. key points for questions and answers
- Benefits of CF:
    - Increased contact with donors, companies and foundations, not just money
    - Increased likelihood of meeting unexpected partners
- Capabilities required for ReL:
    - Understanding of the culture of academia + understanding of the business side
    - Connecting the needs of both parties to create new stories and value

9. summary
- The need for open academia:
    - Connecting researchers and society to diverse funding sources and collaborators
    - Promote widespread recognition of the value of research and open the way to social implementation
- Future Outlook:
    - Continued support for young researchers through the "Thousand True Funds" project, etc.
    - Expanding new models of collaboration among research, companies, and individuals to achieve a decentralized research institute
    - Re: fostering Rel and driving open academia

Thus, crowdfunding and fan clubs were used as concrete tools in the transition from closed academia to open academia, and furthermore, a new profession, Research Relations (ReL), which connects researchers and society, was shown to play an important role. The vision of a decentralized research institute is expected to contribute to the diversification of research systems and the promotion of more flexible academic activities in the future.
