[Rikuminumin, using AI for policymaking, grows impatient with the National Democratic Party of Japan, which is ahead of them - Sankei News](https://www.sankei.com/article/20250123-VYLLX5ZHGRKQBMEP77JZV456IU/)
> The monthly fee for participation in the experiment is approximately 1 million yen, and the party must also invite its own engineers. A senior Rikumin official grumbled, "I didn't realize it would cost that much money.
> However, the Rikkyo Democrats have no money to spare. The Rikkyo Democratic Party, which is also taking part in the experiment, has a long way to go in the use of AI and is anxious to keep ahead of the National Democratic Party of Japan, which is also taking part in the experiment.
I think the monthly fee of about 1 million yen is probably talking about the X API, so I don't think it wouldn't cost you if you collected it via Google Form or something like that.

We have started working on a new project.
