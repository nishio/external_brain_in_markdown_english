title: "Protecting Democracy"
---

I saw someone make the statement, "I'm going to defend democracy," and I thought, "[[ambiguous concept]], isn't it?"

The words "[[democracy]]" and "[keep (i.e. a promise)" are ambiguous, respectively.

I'm against "democracy as it is now" as opposed to "keeping it the way it is without changing it."
Maybe that ideology doesn't achieve the "keep it the way it is without changing it" objective.
I think it is necessary to "protect [[the state of functioning]]" by "adapt[[ing]] [[democracy]] now" to the changing [[world change]] and "[[changing]] it.
