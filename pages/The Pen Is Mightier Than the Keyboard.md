A 2014 study showing that taking class notes on [[keyboard]] vs. [[handwritten]] (longhand) makes no significant difference on tests of factual recall, but does make a significant difference on tests of conceptual understanding.  #Note-taking.

A related group that took notes at the keyboard was
- Large number of words in the notebook.
- There is also a high degree of literal overlap between what was written and what was spoken.
In other words, the behavior of "writing down exactly what the speaker is saying" is taking place, and as a result of this taking up a lot of brain resources, conceptual understanding may be hindered.

The authors tested whether teaching students to "take notes in your own words" would improve their performance when taking notes at the keyboard.
However, the results were not good.

The experiment was conducted to test the hypothesis that even if memory retention during note-taking is not good, the notes taken with a keyboard contain more information, and therefore, if students review the notes, their grades will be better. However, the results of the experiment did not confirm the keyboard note-taking, and in fact, the results were overwhelmingly better when the notes were handwritten and reviewed.

This makes me wonder if we shouldn't be teaching people to take notes at the keyboard.
