[[Governor's Race 2024]].
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This video provides analysis and discussion of the results of the Tokyo gubernatorial election. The main contents are as follows
1. analysis of election results
    - The results are analyzed in detail, with Yuriko Koike winning the election, Ishimaru coming in second, and Renho in third.
2. problems with cooperation between the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and the Communist Party of Japan
    - The reason why Renho's vote count was lower than expected is that the cooperation between the two parties may not have been accepted by the voters.
3. good job by Mr. Ishimaru
    - The analysis shows that YouTube and street speeches were very effective.
4. reference to candidate Takahiro Yasuno
    - The speaker rates candidate Anno and his wife as the MVP (most valuable candidate) of this election.
    - We appreciate candidate Anno's unique electoral strategy:
        - The fact that we used AI and GitHub to create a manifesto of about 100 pages and updated it as we heard from our constituents.
            - [[broad listening]] (aggregating information from many people and reflecting it in policy), which is a [[direct democracy]] approach.
        - The fact that the AI-An (AI answers about the candidate's policies) system has been implemented.
5. a turning point in Democratic politics
    - We see the results of this election as symbolic of the end of the old Democratic style of politics.
6. future political direction
    - He emphasizes the need for politics to change with the changing times.
    - Touching on the decline in support for the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), he suggests a review of its traditional line.
7. about his/her political organization
    - He stated that four years have passed since the party was formed and he is aware of the need for constant self-renewal.

While appreciating the innovative approach of Yasuno's candidacy, the speaker finds a major turning point in Japanese politics throughout the results of this election and offers a deep reflection on the future of politics.
