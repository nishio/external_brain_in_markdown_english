<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The word "vehicle" comes from the English "[[vehicle]]", which originally referred to a vehicle or vehicle, but in everyday speech and in certain contexts it may be used with a different meaning. When a friend uses the word "vehicle" to describe his or her organization, it is taken as a "[[means]]" for the [[organization]] to achieve a certain goal or philosophy.

In this usage, the nuance is that the organization to which one belongs serves as a platform for individuals and members to move toward a particular goal or as a "vehicle" to realize a philosophy. For example, a non-profit organization aiming for social impact or an academic institution promoting progress in a particular field of research may serve as a "vehicle.

Thus, the use of the word "vehicle" in a metaphoric way not only refers to the structure and function of an organization or group, but also to a deeper understanding of its deeper purpose and mission, and the role and contribution of the individual within it.

- When you look at it as "a vehicle for transportation," you tend to feel like "it's faster to ride a bicycle alone than to ride in an organization's vehicle" because "large organizations are usually slow.
- As a metaphor, it would be better to think of it as "[[heavy equipment]]" like [[excavators]].
- It does not move fast, but it is [[strong]] and can [[break]] walls.
- The image is that if you dig up the earth and make a stream, the water will continue to flow even if you leave it unattended.
    - [[left unattended, but it keeps moving]].
