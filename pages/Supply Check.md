Supply Check

Four is easy to do a combo, three can do a combo.
1: {{c1::Village}}, {{c2::Throne}} and other {{c3::+Action}} cards
2: {{c4::draw-type}} cards
3: {{c5::+buy}} cards
4: {{c6::compression}} card

High-impact cards
* Scatter {{c7::cursed ruins}}
* {{c8::butcher}}, {{c9::masked ball}}, {{c10::bounty hunter}}

Means of obtaining victory points other than the province
* Special Victory Points
* Landmark
* Victory point tokens
It's easier to catch up later, and the combo is more favorable.

There are witches -> they get shot -> how to counter the curse
Pulled off in the village and disposed of in the chapel
If there is no chapel, then gardens, officials
