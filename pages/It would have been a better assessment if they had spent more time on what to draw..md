    - The research on which Mihai Csikszentmihai, famous for his concept of flow experience, based his dissertation.
    - An experiment in which art students were asked to combine 27 different objects and then draw a picture of it.
    - The group that spent the most time on the painting part and the group that spent the most time on finding a good combination.
    - The latter is more highly regarded by the instructors.
    - Many of the latter also continued to paint in the post-graduation follow-up survey.

Note: This correlation does not necessarily mean causation.
- You're right up until you say, "I would have rated it better if I had spent more time on what to paint."
- It would be going too far to say that "the more time you spend on what to paint, the better your evaluation will be."
- Suppose, for example, that the latter was higher in the instructor's evaluation outside of this experiment.
    - It could also be interpreted as "skilled students who tend to get good grades tend to spend more time looking for object combinations when given this assignment."

Well, but as a piece of advice for students who are trying to write a report.
It's not good to start writing about a topic you've decided on at random without spending time thinking about "what you should write a report about," and it's not good to start writing about a topic you've decided on at random.
It's not good to spend all your time thinking about what to write about and then have no time to actually write,
Proper balance is important, but, well, it's not easy.
