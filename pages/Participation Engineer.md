Participation Engineer

There are people who organize events and create "places for people to gather" separately from software engineers.
- This too requires a certain skill set.
- Participation Engineer (coined term)

It's easy to forget when you've already earned a place or are in a position where you're getting attention and appreciation just for being active in your comfort zone, but usually you're not comfortable without a place to stay.
- So we need to make a place for them.
- A place where several people can stay comfortably is a public good.

Each event has diverse and different surrounding conditions, making it difficult to "use the same thing here and there" as with software.
- Fixing the physical place is much easier.

It will be dismantled at the end of the event period.
- once-in-a-lifetime encounter (hence should be cherished as such)
- No records are kept.
    - Only a narrow bandwidth record in text format.
        - What if a subjective viewpoint recording of a number of participants could be recorded and later experienced in an immersive VR experience of the event?
