[Prefer associative ontologies to hierarchical taxonomies](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z29hLZHiVt7W2uss2uMpSZquAX5T6vaeSF6Cy)
- Prefer [[suggestive]] ontology over hierarchical taxonomy
- The structure is made to emerge organically.
    - If you impose structure from the start, you prematurely limit what can be generated and artificially compress the subtle relationships between ideas.

                - [[Do not classify.]]
    - Our file system, organizational structure, and library are,
        - It suggests that hierarchical categories are the natural structure of the world.
        - Often, however, items belong in many places.
        - Also, items are related to other items in very different hierarchical categories.
    - Worse, by placing things into distinct categories, the edges inevitably become fuzzy.
        - Things don't always fit exactly.
        - If a lot of new ideas are gathered, a new category could be created...
        - However, since everything is already classified, its shape is not visible.
        - And since it is already classified, you must undo the [[Existing Structure]] to further classify it.
            - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> [[Existing classification]] needs to be broken and redone, but many people don't want to do that, so they overlook the emergence of new categories that don't fit into the existing classification!
- More importantly, a network of related ideas,
    - It is better to let them emerge gradually without labels.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> [[Associative Networks]]
    - It allows ideas and beliefs to emerge organically.
    - Once you see the shape, you can think about its character.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It is the same as using the KJ method, where you first collect what seems relevant and then put a nameplate on it.
    - This is one of the reasons the Evergreen Notebook is a safe place to develop wild ideas.
- But beware. Tags are an inefficient associative structure.
    - One result of following this advice. The associative note system makes it difficult to navigate to unlinked "neighbors".
