> Digital Reform Co-Creation Platform
>  This is a "direct dialogue" platform between local government officials and government and public agency officials. This service can be used to provide information and exchange opinions on digital reforms, as well as to share information among users. The official version of this service utilizes the [[eMAFF]] chat tool (Slack), which has already been demonstrated and operated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. A beta version is also available on Facebook.
