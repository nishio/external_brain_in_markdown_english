<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Initiation is the process of being accepted as a [[new member]] into a [[group]], [[community]], or [[privileged position]] through a specific [[ritual]] or [[rite]]. It is used in a variety of settings, such as religious ceremonies, [[secret societies]], [[college clubs]], [[initiation ceremonies]] in the [[workplace]], etc. Initiation is often important as a [[rite of passage]] into a new phase or role.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Maybe it is negatively perceived due to the lack of a Christian baptismal ritual in Buddhism, a major religion in Japan, and the controversy related to Aum Shinrikyo?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Certainly, Buddhist rites equivalent to "initiation" such as [[baptism]] in [[Christianity]] are not very common in Japan. In Japanese Buddhism, certain rituals may be performed at the time of initiation or practice, but they are often not mandatory for the average layperson. Therefore, it is difficult to say that the concept of "initiation," like baptism, is deeply rooted in Japanese culture.

It is also possible that when the [[Aum Shinrikyou religious group]] became a social problem, its radical initiation and [[initiation rituals]] attracted attention, and the word "initiation" came to be perceived negatively by the general public. In particular, rituals performed by cult-like groups and religions are often associated with [[brainwashing]] and are often viewed with caution in Japan.
