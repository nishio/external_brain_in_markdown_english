Does it have to be one?

If there's no particular reason why it has to be one, maybe using more than one will solve the problem?

### Summary of notes
.
The notes from "Blind Spot Cards Without Pictures Yet" present the idea that a blind spot card does not necessarily have to be one. In particular, it suggests that problem solving may be possible by utilizing multiple blind spot cards.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The fragment "Stages of Resolution" is relevant to the note. The note indicates that there is no restriction that there must be one blind spot card. This is consistent with the idea, advocated in the "Stages of Resolution" fragment, that it should inherently be divided into multiple cards.

### deep thinking
By not restricting the number and format of blind spot cards, it is possible to attempt to solve problems from more diverse perspectives. This reflects the idea of respecting the diversity of knowledge and perspectives and recognizing the potential of each perspective to contribute to problem solving.
