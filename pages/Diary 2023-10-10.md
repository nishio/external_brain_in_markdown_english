- [[hairy stingray]]

I haven't been in the office in a while.
- I've been packing the con and doing LLM for a while now, so I think I've loosened up my spirit.
- When you were commuting to work, you had two mandatory sessions of this.
- Is it good or bad that it's gone?
- I thought I had more time when I first lost it...?
    - There is a theory that I stay at home too much and should take frequent walks.
    - Well, it rained yesterday and the day before.


I'm not sure if I should buy an Android Tablet to play the mystery game.
- I thought maybe I could use it as a cat's toy when I'm not using it anymore.
- I didn't end up buying it because I was at the reunion all night.
    - It looks like a few days until the iOS version comes out, so I'll wait!
