title: "Extinguishing Intermediaries"
---

> The concept was originally invented by Alain Badieu, a former philosopher of the Artuserian school (Theory of the Subject, Galillet, 1982). It describes a movement in which some actor (agent) creates the conditions for a large fluctuation or change, and then disappears from the visible scene when the process becomes stationary. The mediator between one state and the next can only be found retrospectively; this is the vanishing mediator. Fredric Jameson, in his article "The Ideologies of Theory, Vol. 2. Max Weber.] as a vanishing mediator or storyteller," he interprets and analyzes [[Protestantism]] as a "vanishing mediator" that invokes capitalism and its ethos, but disappears from the stage of history once the capitalist system is stabilized and advanced. ... Žižek points out that "new social movements" and "punk movements" played the role of "vanishing mediators" in the democratization process of the former Yugoslavia, including Slovenia. Their "Liberal Democratic Party," a kind of intellectual party, was one of them.

- In this scene, the innocent medium is discouraged by the ugliness of the social system and shuts her mouth. Aoi becomes a "vanishing medium" and acts like an artist whose existence is exaggerated by not releasing new works. In other words, it is a medium that defines the dynamics of the social system by disappearing, ultimately leaving traces of its existence both inside and outside the system.
