title: "Polis is used repeatedly."
---

One-line summary: In [[vTaiwan]], [[Polis]] is supposed to be used repeatedly, but in the famous Uber case, it is used only once.
- Background:.
    - I looked at the Uber case study after you mentioned that "vTaiwan uses Polis multiple times iteratively, we don't assume it will all be solved in one session." and I saw that they only used it once.
    - I checked to see if the information about using it more than once was incorrect, but there were cases where it was used more than once.
    - Either Uber was an early example, so it was not yet structured for multiple operations, or it was successful enough the first time that they did not do a second time.

For example, in the following case, multiple rounds of vTaiwan's "opinion gathering" (the stage in which Pol.is is used) are conducted on a monthly basis.

- Shared Economy → Platform Economy (2017)
    - 1st: 5/24-6/24/2017, followed by the 2nd: 7/5/2017-8/5/2017 "Second Opinion徵集"
    - Later, a "third staircase of opinion exchange" was also held on 9/20/2017-10/20/2017 for the draft that expanded the scope to "platform economy".
    - The shared economy series actually referred to "opinion aggregation results on Pol.is" at the meeting, indicating that opinion gathering using Pol.is was repeated.

- Registration of the English name of the company (2016)
    - It is clearly marked as "two staircase opinion 徵集," and will be carried out in two rounds of opinion gathering (1st: 8/14/2016-8/31/2016 / 2nd: 9/23/2016-10/23/2016), followed by an online meeting.

- Draft Enterprise Assets Security Law (2016-2017)
    - There are official records of two "first" and "second" online opinion 徵集 on the same topic (12/14/2016-1/13/2017 and 2/5/2017-3/5/2017).

Supplementary note: As part of vTaiwan's design, the official case study clearly states that opinion collection is a combination of Pol.is and Discourse, with a minimum of one month per round and unlimited number of rounds, and that the operation proceeds to the next round as needed.

- Explanation (main points)
    - This is an operational rule for the "opinion-gathering" phase of vTaiwan (the phase in which online participation is widely solicited), meaning that it will be open for at least one month, with as many rounds as necessary. The design is not to terminate in a short period of time, but to broaden the base of participation and then find a point of agreement.
    - The same section clearly states that Discourse (discussion) and Pol.is (opinion mapping) are used to facilitate consensus building. In other words, the premise is not "opinion gathering = Pol.is only," but rather an iterative operation combining Discourse and Pol.is.
    - Furthermore, in the next Reflection phase (reflection including face-to-face meetings), it is supposed to be determined whether to proceed or to start the opinion-gathering process all over again. Here, "again" is possible, which supports the operation that there is no upper limit to the number of rounds.
