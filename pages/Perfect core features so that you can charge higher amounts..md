> Perfect with respect to core features so that you can charge insanely high amounts. The numbers that are out there without having circled back to the billing appeals mean nothing.

important talk
    - Aim for [[perfection]] to be able to charge a higher amount with [[confidence (in oneself)]].
    - If you don't do this, you'll be plagued with [[anxiety]], "How much [[should I price]]?" because you're not confident.
    - The state of uncertainty in pricing is trying to create demand by [[discounting]] in the first place.
