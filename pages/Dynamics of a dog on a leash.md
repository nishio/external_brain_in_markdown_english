title: "Dynamics of a dog on a leash"

- [[Anno Teramoto Nishio Devin Roundtable]], and I came to see him because he said it was interesting.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1890699377544487095) Robot, you're starting to look less like a scary being that attacks humans and more like a sad being that wants human contact but is held back by chains!
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1890710946194321579) This is not "a scary robot that attacks you," but "a [[pet robot]] that tries to get close to you for your [[love]], but is blocked by [[chains]], and as it tries again and again it becomes more and more [[encumbered]] and finally [[overheats]] and stops functioning. It is a "pet robot" that tries to get close to humans for love, but as it tries again and again, it becomes more and more "encumbered" and finally stops functioning due to "overheating.

- Maybe because I saw him die from overheating first.
- Because one of them is still dead.
- I'm standing up! [Canine Robot is up! Maybe it's because I saw it from the scene where
- Maybe it's because I'm tangled up in chains and falling all over the place.
- I'm not afraid to say "scary" but "sad" first.
- > I may have seen "overheated from working too hard" first, and then came to the reopening time and saw "being started up and standing up", but I felt something like "0% fear, 80% pity, 20% sadness".

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1890721094430023948) The leash dog robot is going to have a limp next week.

>  ENCOUNTERS somehow feels like a lot of things might be broken if you don't get there early enough to see it.






> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1890577591377031329) In this exhibition "ENCOUNTERS," which presents the results of the Japan Media Arts Creator Development Support Project, there are both runaway robot dogs and deep fakes. AI safety (safety of AI) is closely intertwined with the creation of artworks, and I feel "now".

>  When I saw BostonDynamics' BigDog 15 years ago, I thought it was really scary myself. I thought it must be an unmanned weapon that goes around killing people indiscriminately. That's when I came up with the idea of putting that thing on display in chains and realizing that the only reason we can laugh at ourselves is because we are in a safe zone.
>  >otto_morgen: It's too scary to put on display something like this, which is one step ahead of a robot dog that automatically and indiscriminately goes around killing people once it has a weapon on its back. Is this supposed to be inspiring? x.com/takahiroanno/s...
> [toodooda](https://x.com/toodooda/status/1890404941006590235) Fifteen years have passed and my expressive themes have changed a lot since then. That's because I have been researching expressions to bring humanoid robots to life.
>  In this work, the intention is to evoke the human mindset of feeling sorry for the oppressed creatures by torturing the robot.
> [toodooda](https://x.com/toodooda/status/1890411124551741570) Over the past 15 years, the level of robot technology in the world has also advanced overwhelmingly. It is obvious that we are now in an era in which autonomous walking robots can be used as unmanned weapons, and no one even needs to doubt this anymore. Artistic expression itself, which is to reproduce and experience the horror of such robots in a limited way, has lost its meaning.

> [GOROman](https://x.com/GOROman/status/1890992171907428453) I came to see an exhibit where a human gently cares for a dog robot with a motor that generates heat with an ice-cream cone, which is a hot topic on social networking sites right now.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1891864018056511689) I'm amused that some people got mad because they couldn't get a robot dog to attack them, no longer [[lion dance]].
>  >toodooda: I was not present today, but I have received a report that the management staff received a severe scolding from a visitor who missed the demonstration. It seems that they were satisfied with the irregular response of an unscheduled additional demonstration, but this exhibition is free of charge, and we do not normally make adjustments to accommodate individual visitors. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. x.com/toodooda/statu..

> [toodooda](https://x.com/toodooda/status/1892087322138534180) One dog robot seems to have broken the base of its head.
>  Good to have a second backup.

> [toodooda](https://x.com/toodooda/status/1892088046159286485) I guess it must have been bad that the LiDAR served as a fixture to the under neck stay on the head, so I had to move it while it was removed.

> [toodooda](https://x.com/toodooda/status/1892147247061881273) I ran to the distributor and received my new head.
>  I won't know the price until I get the bill, though!
>  Surgery now.

> [toodooda](https://x.com/toodooda/status/1892179108588875814) The grafting surgery was a success. I know the structure by taking it all apart once so it won't be a hassle.

> [kmoriyama](https://x.com/kmoriyama/status/1892155939895304338) I was watching the moment it broke. It's like you backdropped and cracked it yourself.
>  Sorry I missed you.

> [toodooda](https://x.com/toodooda/status/1892205934375588249) I see, I'm glad you were able to get this footage. After all, if it had a LiDAR on the jaw, it would not have broken this way.
