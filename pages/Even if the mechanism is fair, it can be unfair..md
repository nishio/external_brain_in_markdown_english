- [[fairness]]


[[Impartiality is not uniaxial.]]
- I recently wrote something with this title, look for it
- [[Reliable Neutrality]]

A system that generates differential returns based on the amount of resources you already have.

- E.g., the design "anyone can get 2 ETH for mining a block" is neutral and appears fair to everyone, and thus satisfies trustworthy neutrality.
    - Resources are given to those with the knowledge to mine the blocks and not to those without.
    - Some countries can buy GPUs (at a time when GPUs are useful), while others cannot due to export restrictions.

I don't disagree that it's much better than a mechanism that doesn't even have objective neutrality.
