Translation: [[anti-social media]].
The term comes in the context of social media becoming anti-social, breaking social connections and creating division, and the need for a "pro-social" social media that creates social connections.
- Synonyms: [pro-social media

- In English, it is "anti-social media," so it is easy to understand that "anti" and "social" are combined to become "anti-social.
    - Combining order: ((anti social) media)
- In Japanese, people who recognize "social media" as one word may misunderstand the combining order.
    - Join Order: (Anti (Social Media))
    - [[Ken Suzuki]] suggested "[[antisocial social networking sites]]"
    - I think the words on their own are pretty self-explanatory.
    - It's not going to sit well with this story being written in the "media" chapter.
        - The gap with the authors is that many Japanese do not recognize [[SNS]] as "social media" in the first place.
        - I feel that the delay in addressing the issue of [[false information]] on social networking sites has the same root.

[[anti-social]] / [[pro-social]]
