title: "Sentences that try hard to make you look smart."
---

> [philomyu](https://x.com/philomyu/status/1836776322028404898) "Sentences written by people who seem to be bad at Japanese, trying their best to look smart," while "sentences written by people who seem to be bad at Japanese" are completely unintelligible because the vocabulary is difficult but the structure of the sentences is messy, I have a suspicion that people who are not good at Japanese may not be able to distinguish between the two.

> [philomyu](https://x.com/philomyu/status/1836776327724388538) The hypothesis that can be drawn from this is that people who are not good at Japanese probably read and write in their native language in the same way as we do when we read unfamiliar foreign languages, picking up only words and phrases that we have seen or heard somewhere else, and then just reading and writing in their native language as if they understood the text just from the atmosphere. It is possible that people who are not good at Japanese read and write in their native language in the same way as we do when we read unfamiliar foreign languages.

Opinions that improve resolution regarding the difference between writing that tries hard to look smart and the writing of a really smart person.
- [[only vocabulary is difficult]].
    - This is [[borrowed word]], so
    - He's using some cool language I've seen somewhere.
        - If you understand and use it correctly, you're still better off.
        - I'm using a textual interpretation based on the mood of the words without understanding them very well.
        - So it doesn't make sense to people who don't know what the word means, and it doesn't make sense to people who do know what it means.
            - Well, it could be said that you will be promptly judged as "someone who is just [[playing smart]] with borrowed words," and then you will just be snickered at and passed over for writing small, difficult things.
                - I'm not so sure.
                - It's easy to understand people whose "vocabulary is the only thing that's difficult and [[sentence structure]] is a mess."
                - If you're using difficult vocabulary with strange interpretations but decent sentence structure, it's extremely costly to determine whether you're saying the right thing or not.
                    - tiresome

Programming experience makes it easier to understand the breakdown of this area.
- That program, you're importing and using an advanced library, but it's a [[syntax error]] to begin with.
- I don't know if it's an advanced library or a proprietary function, but it doesn't [[import]], so it can't work.
- I can run it because it's syntactically sane using the library, but I'll get a [[runtime error]] at runtime depending on the value because of improper understanding of the range of parameters.

- [[vocabulary]]
