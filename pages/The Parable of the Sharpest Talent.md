title: "The Parable of the Sharpest Talent"
---

- The expressions "[[sharp and talented]]" and "[[rounded person]]" are used to refer to human resources.
        - [[pointed]] stone and the image of a round stone by a river, etc.
    - The analogy of "a sharp stone becoming round" is often used.

- 'Sharp people become rounded.'
    - Some interpret it negatively, others positively.
    - How to perceive people who feel negatively:
        - The sharpest points are strengths and areas of expertise
        - Good engineers become [[mediocre]] cobblestones when their "sharp edges" are chipped away by the [[homogeneous]] pressures of big business.
    - How to perceive people who feel positive:
        - The sharpest point is the lack of [[cooperativeness]] due to youth
        - Sharpness causes unnecessary [[friction]] by bumping into others.
        - The sharp edges are removed while being struggled with, and they become rounded and "[[amicable character]]".
    - The fact that these two interpretations are not even independent makes the problem deeper.

The two correspond to the words "[[specialist]]" and "[[generalist]]".
