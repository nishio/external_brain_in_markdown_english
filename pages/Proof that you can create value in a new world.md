title: "Proof that you can create value in a new world"
---

I felt that the term "[[proof of power]]" could be improperly understood.
- What is "[[power]]"?
- For example, graduating from college used to be "proof of academic achievement."
    - It was [[signalling]] that there was power
    - It's still used as proof of power in a wide range of areas.
- As the environment changes, what is "power" changes.
    - For example, abacus ranks used to be "proof of computational ability," but with the spread of inexpensive electronic calculators, they have become less valuable.
    - In other words, which power you value depends on your environment.
    - We don't know if what was once "proof of power" will have the same value in the new world.
- We need to create [[proof]] of [[being able to create value]] in [[the new world]].

- [[Knowledge is outcome-focused information]]
- [[Knowledge must be proven by deeds.]]
