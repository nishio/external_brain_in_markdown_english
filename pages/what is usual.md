title: "what is usual"
---

If "X is [[natural]]," to whom is it natural?
- You're claiming it's the norm for everyone.
- You're merely saying that it's the norm for you.
- The former is a pretty strong argument

When you learn something in your field, you start to feel that a lot of things are "normal".
- This is remarkable when you write a commentary book
    - What is it? Should I explain this content? Should I write it down because it's obvious?"
- Even what you feel is "obvious" is not obvious to most readers, so you should explain it if the amount of space allows.
    - It's usually the quantity that doesn't allow for it, so you'll have to worry about it.

Bias to write about things that are not obvious.
- Maybe lower quality of output in the long run (untested)
    - [[Truth is the best policy in the long run.]] and related?
- The author's own sense of what is "natural" and the reader's sense of what is not.

Regarding readers who say "this is a matter of course" in response to something written about the obvious.
- This is someone who understands the subject of the commentary very well and should be respected.
- People who unconsciously generalize what they consider "normal" from their own perspective.
    - That "what is obvious to you is not obvious to other readers because it is not obvious to them."

When you take for granted what others have written.
- I tend to say "of course" too, but maybe that's not such a good thing.
- After all, "natural" is subjective, so the statement may not lead to constructive discussion!
