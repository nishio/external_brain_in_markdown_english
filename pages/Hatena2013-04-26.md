*1366914748* draft of draft
Writing a draft of a revised version of a book on my blog, although I said I would write a draft of a draft because that takes a lot of time

** string parsing (inserted after the grammar chapter)
- Read through the blanks to find aaaa.
- To cut out a string with a pattern like 123.456
- First, try writing in for (I think JS is a good language to use).
- state change diagram
- One line with a regular expression, great!
- Formal Definition of Regular Language
- Regular expressions are not universal, examples not in regular language, corresponding parentheses
- Context free language, BNF, yacc
- (Is it too deep to talk about PEG or Packrat Parser...?)
- (Column) Bacchus and Nauer
