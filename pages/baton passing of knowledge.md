    - [[Information distribution is diversion?]]
    - [[diversion]]
- Based on these two articles, I'll start with a brief summary and then give some additional discussion.
- Think of what would happen if you could make "diversion" correspond to a word that doesn't have a negative connotation.
- Put it all together with a new title.
- Various stories are mixed, divide them properly, then grant your new and interesting opinion.

1. value and background of information sharing (bridging)
- summary
    - Bridging (formerly "diversion") redefined
        - The act of connecting multiple communities and information sources and delivering the knowledge gained to another venue. In many cases, value is created not through copying, but through summarizing, translating, and editing.
    - Benefits from Sharing
        - My knowledge is organized.
        - Feedback from others deepens understanding.
        - May lead to reputation
    - Resistance to sharing
        - If your mental model is "information is given to me," it's hard to feel that sharing the information you've gained is meaningful.
        - It becomes "normal" for those who have practiced and experienced success.
- New Perspectives
    - Importance of sharing success stories
        - For those who do not know the benefits of sharing, the hurdle to action is high. Showing success stories will motivate them to give it a try.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's all about "how to motivate."

2. type of share strategy and ROI
- summary
    - A: Share to a specific few
        - Exchange information in a closed forum. Dense communication is possible if you choose the right partner.
    - B: Share to an unspecified number of people
        - Openly disseminate information. While connecting with a wide audience, the return on the effort may be unclear.
    - Arbitrage Status
        - If the information can be kept secret and made profitable, there is a decision to avoid disclosure.
    - Software-related examples
        - In fields where knowledge rapidly becomes obsolete, it is often beneficial to gain reputation through early disclosure.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Felt that clarification of [[What is Return?]] is necessary if ROI is to be discussed.
- New Perspectives
    - Use of temporary closed strategies
        - A "hybrid strategy" of testing information in a small community at first and then openly sharing the results and improvements is also worth considering.

3. copyright and etiquette issues
- summary
    - Copying copyrighted material is not acceptable.
        - It is not legal to publish someone else's work under your name.
    - principle of citation
        - It is OK under copyright law to cite only the necessary parts of a published work with the source.
    - Mixed Manner Theory
        - Some authors claim that "even re-summarizing is not acceptable" without providing legal grounds, but vague "manners" may discourage the sharing of information.
- New Perspectives
    - Dealing with the "local rules" of the community
        - Each gathering, whether it is an open source community or an academic conference, has its own mannerisms. Even if there is no legal problem, the key is how to deal with those local rules.

Reexamination of the term "diversion
- summary
    - Negative sounding
        - It is accompanied by images such as "illegal resale" and "just copy and paste."
    - Replace with positive words
        - Proposal to use designations that can be reevaluated in the context of creating value, such as "[[bridging]]," "[[information relay]]," and "[[baton passing of knowledge]]."
            - I like the baton pass of knowledge best.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- New Perspectives
    - Encourage redefinition of the act by calling it
        - By dispelling the negative image and emphasizing the contribution of "translation" and "editing," the act itself can be given a positive incentive.

Appendix: New opinions and ideas
- The "gradual release" model of sharing
    - Initial discussion in small closed communities → reorganize information and abstract further → open to public sphere
    - An approach that can both manage risk and improve quality.
- Bridging with a view to "co-creation
    - Not just copying, but multiplying the perspectives of other communities to generate new ideas.
    - New value can be created by bridging different contexts, for example, connecting the technical and artistic fields.
- Creating a mechanism for learning local rules
    - Guidelines need to be developed to make it easy to learn not only the laws and general etiquette, but also the unique rules of each community.
    - The sharing platform could be structured in such a way that it automatically provides "how to cite and points to note" before posting.

If we organize the above into four major themes and then consider them, it becomes easier to see the possibilities and cautions for bridging according to each area and purpose, rather than simply criticizing the "diversion" of information. Even a single change in terminology will change the way in which the act is perceived, and should lead to richer information distribution and co-creation.
