[[Megumi Hayashibara]]
Lyrics: [[Ritsuko Okazaki]],Composition: Ritsuko Okazaki

- [[Memories are always a sweet escape, but you have to break them to live tomorrow.]]

- [[The days are still raging, forever, going to heaven and hell and back again and again, let's make the flowers bloom that will revive again and again]]
