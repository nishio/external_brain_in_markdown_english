Practice [[English conversation]] in [Advanced Voice


- “Hello.”
- Hello! How can we help you?
- “Can you speak English?”
- Sure, I can speak English. How can I help you today?
- “I want to practice my English conversation skills.”
- Great! Let's practice your English conversation skills. What would you like to talk about?

English conversation practice started.
- In the pattern where I said "I want to practice my English conversation skills," I was given an explanation of how to practice in Japanese. I think "Can you speak English?


I was slurred trying to communicate a complex concept, but he returned it to me in beautiful English.
- “Yes, I'm interested in, uh...”
- That's great! What specifically interests you about Blue Sky?
- “I'm sorry, I want to say, I want to express my idea. I'm interested in how to introduce new components in BlueSky, which that is, I mean, that is, I want to put components which show an argument, an opinion, and the reader can react with it, voting agree or disagree. Could you, can I, did I make sense?”
- Yes, you made sense! So you're interested in introducing a component in Blue Sky that shows opinions and allows readers to react by voting "agree" or "disagree." That sounds like a great idea!
- “Yes, thank you for cleaning my sentence. I want practice to speaking it, so let's”
- You're welcome!
- “I tried to repeat your sentence earlier. I mean, I want to introduce a new component.”
- That's a good start!
- “to show opinion, which allows leaders to vote on it with agree or disagree, correct?”
- Perfect! You expressed your idea clearly. Keep practicing, and you'll become even more fluent!
- “Thank you!”

I thought it was nice, but halfway through the sentence it started getting interrupted and then stopped responding, still unstable?
- I'm not sure if the server side is unstable or if I tried to use it in the bathroom after leaving the room with the wifi access point, so I'll investigate in the future.

When I talk about broad listening, they say, "I'm familier with broad listening!
- “I'm interested in broad reasoning. Do you know?”
- Yes, I'm familiar with broad listening. It involves gathering diverse opinions to understand public sentiment. Are you thinking about how to implement broad listening in digital democracy?
- Overwhelming amount of knowledge!

- “I think it can be used for understanding a large amount of information, such as books, not only public opinion.”
- Absolutely! Visualizing data can help uncover patterns and insights across various forms of information, including books. It's a powerful tool for making sense of complex data.
- “Do you have any advice for that?”
- To effectively analyze large datasets like books, you could use techniques like topic modeling or sentiment analysis. Visual tools and interactive dashboards can also help you and others explore the data more intuitively. Have you tried any of these approaches?
- “I think sentiment analysis is not suitable for books because books is not expressing sentiment, it is a bunch of information.”
- You're right. Books often contain complex information rather than just sentiment. In that case, topic modeling or thematic analysis could be more suitable. These methods help identify and categorize the main topics or themes in the text. Have you considered trying those approaches?
- “I feel topic modeling is less powerful.”
- Topic modeling can have its limitations. For a more powerful approach, you might consider combining different techniques, such as network analysis or clustering, to uncover relationships and patterns. This could provide a deeper understanding of the content. What do you think?
- “I mean, the concept of topic is to”
- I see what you mean.
- “fine-grained, too fine-grained, too small piece of information. But the components to build up an understanding should be more large components.”
- I understand. Focusing on broader, more comprehensive components can provide a clearer understanding of the overall content. Have you considered using larger thematic categories or clusters to group information? This might help in building a more cohesive understanding.


Reflection.
- “Now, recap my conversation log and point out the mistake of English.”
- Sure, here's a brief recap and some corrections:
    - You introduced yourself as a software engineer and mentioned your doctoral work in visualization of high-dimensional data. You also discussed digital democracy and your use of Talk to the City for broad listening. Finally, we talked about improving Wi-Fi connectivity and using extenders.
- Your English is quite good, but here are a few minor corrections:
    - Instead of "I work as software engineer," say "I work as a software engineer."
    - Instead of "It become broken," say "It became broken."
    - Instead of "I should upgrade my Wi-Fi facility," say "I should upgrade my Wi-Fi setup."
- Keep practicing, you're doing great!

I probably can't do it now, but I hope eventually I'll be able to read a paper and talk about its contents, or watch an English YouTube video and talk about it.
