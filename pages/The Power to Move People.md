title: "The Power to Move People"

> [@toru_isobe](https://twitter.com/toru_isobe/status/1658810454955925505?s=46&t=gkSZtjGEtUZPO0JCzBxCBw): I don't think there is a good name for something like the power to move people. I don't think there is a good name for something like "power to influence people". I think [[communication skills]] is just telling people, [[influence]] has a strong image of influencing people by using [[authority]], and [[leadership]] has a nuance of [[lead (in a game, dance, etc.)]]. I want to give a name to the power to influence people regardless of the means.

- [[motivate a person]]
- [[name]]
[[Need a good name]]
- [[good name]]
        - [[Name]]
            - [[Peel off the name to create a blank space for a new name to be born.]]
