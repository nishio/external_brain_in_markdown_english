- > Our virtues are in most cases only vices in disguise" - as this well-known phrase suggests, the proverbs of [[La Rochefoucauld]] (1613-80) provoke the reader by exposing the karma of calculation and self-love that lurks beneath such beautiful names as love, friendship, and courage. In one or two lines, he provokes the reader by exposing the karma of calculation and narcissism that lurks beneath such beautiful names as love, friendship, and courage. This is the pinnacle of French moralist literature that pursues the truth of human nature.
