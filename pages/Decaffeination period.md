First they are reducing [[caffeine]] to reduce "[[fidgety]]."

from[/villagepump/2025/02/25](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/2025/02/25)
- Daily allowable amount of caffeine is 400 mg
    - Oi tea 100ml is 13mg, 600ml so 78mg
    - 2 liters of paper-packaged green tea (jasmine tea)
        - 260 mg, considering it is the same as Oi Tea.
        - It's amazing I can drink 2 liters of green tea.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/yosider/icon' alt='/villagepump/yosider.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Chocola BB 50mg
        - [[Alinamin Medical Balance]]  50mg
    - And I had coffee.
    - You're over the allowable amount without coffee!
    - Coca-Cola Plus 45 mg

    - [[Chocola BB Nightwell]] I bought it.
- Lately I've been using [[rooibos tea]] instead of jasmine tea.
- When I take caffeine, I set it with [[theanine]].
