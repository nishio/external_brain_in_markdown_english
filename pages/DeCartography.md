DeCartography: Building a Credible Neutrality Social Graph powered by Web3 Crowdsourcing
[https://decartography.github.io/docs/ja/](https://decartography.github.io/docs/ja/)
> As a user of Oracle: If you have data that you want to analyze, you send it to the DeCartography platform along with the required fees. After a certain period of time, the analyzed data will be returned to you. Currently, we are in beta and analyze mainly data from projects that have contacted us.
>  As a Crowdworker: You can earn cryptocurrency without the need for KYC by solving tasks from DeCartography as a crowdworker. Sign in to DeCartography using your wallet, complete the task, wait for the specified period of time, and your reward will be automatically transferred.

In the future, the "AI asks questions to a large number of Japanese speakers to collect a large number of subjective opinions" part of the [[Omoikane Project]] may easily be able to "collect diverse viewpoints" using DeCartography.
