- Model the knowledge acquisition process as follows
    - many-to-many
    - multistory
    - Upper layer knowledge cannot be acquired directly.
    - When you acquire lower layers of knowledge, you acquire higher layers of knowledge by luck #Abstraction
    - The more you know about higher layers of knowledge, the lower the cost of acquiring lower layers of knowledge.
- In this model, the amount of knowledge gained per unit of time is [graduated
    - Because the cost of acquiring knowledge at the higher layers gradually decreases and the cost of acquiring knowledge at the lower layers decreases, increasing the amount of knowledge acquired per cost.
- On the other hand, the number of upper layer knowledge per number of lower layer knowledge gains [saturation
    - When 0 → 1, any of the N higher layers of knowledge may be acquired, but when N-1 → N, the last one must be acquired, since there is an approximately N-fold difference in probability
- These combine to form an [[S-shape]] curve.
