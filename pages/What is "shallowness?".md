title: 'What is "shallowness?"'
---

What is "[[shallowness]]"?
- What specific characteristics do you mean by the term "shallow" with respect to the project proposal?
    - [[delving into]] I can't answer your question.
- For "I'll use technology X," I ask, "What exactly is technology X?"
- For "I want to do Y," ask "Why do you want to do Y?"
    - I think it is "[[shallow]]" to not be able to answer such obvious questions.
