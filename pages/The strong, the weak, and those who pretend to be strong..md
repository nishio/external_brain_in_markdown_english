title: "The strong, the weak, and those who pretend to be strong."
---

    - [[strong man]] A has [[answer]] in him
    - [[The Weak.]] B doesn't have the answer in him.
    - Trying to find answers in others.
    - [[People who pretend to be strong.]] C pretend to have the answer when they don't have it in them.
    - C. "What do you think the answer is?"
    - This statement puts those around them in the "let's look for the answer in C" atmosphere.
    - This has the effect of making those around you "weak."

- Strong Person A might say, "I think
    - "I think this, what do you think?"
        - A would not be pleased if I simply agreed with this statement.
        - Because there is nothing to gain.
            - Time just wasted.
    - A is pleased when developmental opinions are obtained
            - [[Propagation of new concepts]] had a similar composition.

- There was a time when producing weak people was beneficial.
    - A time when a few strong people set policies and many weak people followed them to make the organization run efficiently.
    - I believe the situation has a high probability of changing.
    - Computers are better than humans at doing as they are told.
    - In an era when what computers could do was meager, there wasn't much work that could be entrusted to them.
    - As computers develop, more and more areas are more efficiently left to computers than to humans.
