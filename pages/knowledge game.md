title: "knowledge game"
---

> "Knowledge game" statements by people without knowledge are [[sour grapes]], and "knowledge game" statements by people with knowledge are their [[I want to affirm past efforts.]] feelings. And since most things in the world are "more advantageous to those with knowledge", there is little information in those statements.

> "Knowledge game" is a term used by those who are at a disadvantage due to their lack of knowledge of a game in which knowledge gives them an advantage, to claim that it is the game's fault and not their lack of knowledge.
