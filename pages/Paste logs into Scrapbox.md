        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I want to explain how to operate the system.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of commentary is that commentary?
    - You can change the text string of the icon display. Changes are automatically saved in the browser and will be retained for the next time.
    - The COPY button copies the log to the clipboard. The "COPY AND OPEN SCRAPBOX" button copies and then creates a page in the specified Scrapbox project with the specified title.
        - Because of the size limitation of Scrapbox's new creation API, a human being is required to paste the log into the created page.
