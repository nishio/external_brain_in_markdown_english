title: "MEGA Cloud"
---

I saw a story called "I've been banned by Adobe Cloud."
- I've seen people say, "Well, Adobe Cloud is not for adults in the first place, so it should be banned."
    - It's tough being an adult content creator.
- Talking about how hard it is to get banned from Dropbox or something.
- I tend to think it's OK as long as you don't upload anything weird, but there was a person who was banned for uploading "baby pictures" that were judged to be child pornography, which is not pornographic in the Japanese sense of the word.

> [sudosan](https://x.com/sudosan/status/1952650978806673719) I would recommend MEGA Cloud to such people.
>  This uses a system where only the user has the encryption key and even the management cannot see the data inside, so the account will not be deleted by the data inside unless it is disclosed to the outside.
>  I recommend it because it won't disappear even if your home is flooded and it's inexpensive.
>  >drunkenAndo: I'm really afraid that anything pornographic in the commercial cloud will get your account banned (and it's up to them to determine the pornographic content).
>  Dropbox ban was really painful, so since then we have been using Qnap and Synology for personal NAS storage.

A note to say "I didn't know there was such a thing...".
- It's a relief to know that the operator can't see it either.
