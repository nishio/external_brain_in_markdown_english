title: "Borrowed subjectivity"
---

There are people who say, "I will [[Objective judgment]]," but judge based on "[[Subjectivity of others]]," that is, "because someone who is not me said it is so.

In the end, the quality of the judgment is not improved because it is subjective to someone else. Often that "someone" does not know as much information as you do to make a judgment. In that case, the quality of the judgment is more likely to be lower.

Because they are not confident in making [[proactive]] judgments based on their own subjectivity, they call borrowed subjectivity "objective" and consider it superior to their own subjective judgments, and by delegating judgment to it, they unconsciously escape from the "responsibility of judging themselves.

It is more difficult to judge whether "what you call 'objective'" is really "objective," but many people don't think about the validity of that judgment.

- [[subject]] of [[borrowed thing]].
- [[independent judgment]]
