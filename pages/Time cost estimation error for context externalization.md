title: "Time cost estimation error for context externalization"

- The problem of overdoing programming with AI agents is too much of a burden and makes me sick.
    - What I've noticed is that when I'm doing it as an inside job for "meetings and lectures that don't require such a close look," it doesn't get hard, and if anything, it's rather comfortable.
    - Consider why this is.
    - Maybe I'm usually too focused.
        - It's in programming mode.
        - Then you can't wait patiently for the AI to start something else.
            - ‚ÜíMulti-tasking confusion üòµ‚Äçüí´ painful
    - When I work in-house, my instructions to the AI are done in the gap in the first place.
        - When the AI waits, it just goes back to the original meeting.
    - Different modes of mind
        - It may have something to do with [[work video]] or [[work call]].
        - I'm not good at working videos, because I'm so focused on the work that I can't watch the videos.
            - This could mean that once you're in "work mode" you can't keep your attention on the video.
            - On the other hand, maybe it would be better to work on it as an inside job, with the main focus on watching the video?
            - We often see depictions in fiction of people playing games to keep their brains in check, or creators working while messing around, but maybe that style will become more important.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/sta/icon' alt='/villagepump/sta.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - How to create activities for those who mainly do it will be crucial. Videos, games, etc.

    - 1: 100% human work, generating 10 values.
    - 2: Letting an AI agent do the work creates about 8 to 14 worth of value 40% of the time.
        - Numbers are skin feeling
        - Nuance that 8-14 is greater than 10 on average, but sometimes less than 10.
        - Work in 40% of real time and the remaining 60% is waiting for the AI to react.
    - 3: At this point, you can't stand the presence of the wait and wonder, "Couldn't I do another one during this wait?" I would think to myself.
        - There is a point to be made that the mentality that makes people think this way is "workaholic" in the first place.
        - The desire to maximize the value you produce biases you toward putting all of your disposable time into the project
    - 4: However, "Couldn't we do one more?" will fail.
        - Two projects running in parallel make it impossible for the brain to retain contextual information alone.
            - Exceeds the capacity of the amount that can be retained
            - I think I can do as many tasks as I can fit into this capacity.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/yosider/icon' alt='/villagepump/yosider.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - Oh yeah. I wouldn't mess with washing dishes or anything like that.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Essentially, additional time and tasks are required to verbalize and externalize contextual information
            - This is a cost that should normally be paid when you're doing team development and you may not be the one doing the rest of the development.
            - However, unlike team development, the mindset of working alone is different from the mindset of team development, so the need to pay the same costs as team development does not ring true
                - Preferences and abilities?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/sta/icon' alt='/villagepump/sta.icon' height="19.5"/>
                    - On the other hand, I have a strong sense of [[future self is a stranger]], and I don't want to do things right now, and I don't have the ability to do things in a rush and trashed, so I tend to do things neatly, even by myself, assuming that I can externalize the language.
                    - By the way, the existence of a waiting time can wait.
                    - I also recalled that a similar topic like [[mental models of tidying up]] had been discussed before.
        - This results in "an artifact that has lost its context and is somewhat confusing.
    - 5: I think the essential problem is that you're missing the estimate in 3, in essence, when you've got it all sorted out so far.
        - It's a mistake to think you can do two without accounting for the cost of context externalization.
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/41eaa75c08233ebb88811a6b0bba1fcc/thumb/1000)
        - If you use the remaining time after properly performing context externalization, you can only do 1.5
        - It seems important to understand how to apply this load commensurate with your ability.
    - I thought it was a bit like waiting for the output of a 3D printer.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I had a feeling that the interval was too short.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/taktamur/icon' alt='/villagepump/taktamur.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - If we were dealing with humans, I think it would take a day or n hours for them to come back and say, "It's done, please check it out.
        - Mr. AI, on the other hand, works so fast, he'll come back in 30 minutes or 15 minutes and say, "Please check.
        - I imagine it would be tough if it was just one person, but if I got a "check please" every 15 minutes from n different people, it would be tough.
            - It takes time and energy for the human brain to reload an externalized context, and if the context switches quickly in a short period of time, the brain would be incredibly tired.
