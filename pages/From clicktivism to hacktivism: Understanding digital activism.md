- There are ten types of digital activism: clicktivism, metaboicing, assertions (spectator activities), e-funding, political consumption activities, digital signatures, bot use (transitional activities), data activism, information exposure, and hacktivism ( gladiatorial activities).
- These activities have different mechanisms and impacts depending on the participants, social movement organizations, and targeted individuals and organizations.
- Social movement organizations should promote activities that are consistent with their cause and avoid those that are not.
- In digital activism, participants may connect digitally without a common cause ("connected emotion").
- Digital activism is attracting more participants, leveraging tools, and creating greater impact than traditional social movements, including changing election results, wars, and disrupting businesses.
