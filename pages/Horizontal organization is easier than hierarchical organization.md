title: "Horizontal organization is easier than hierarchical organization"

> With the internet, everybody has more-or-less symmetrical connections, meaning they have an equal amount of bandwidth for receiving and sending. This makes “listening-at-scale,” as I call it, possible – i.e., one person can listen to millions of people, but more importantly, millions of people can listen to one another. This is a fundamental configurational change. And for the first time, it has made [[horizontal organisation]] easier than hierarchical organisation.   --- [[Audrey Tang]]

- (DeepL) In the Internet, everyone has a more or less symmetrical connection, i.e., equal bandwidth for reception and transmission. This means that one person can listen to millions of people and, more importantly, millions of people can listen to each other. This is a fundamental change in the organization. And for the first time, horizontal organization is easier than hierarchical organization.


Quite relevant to what I've written several times.
    - [[layered organization]] (2018)
    - [[Changes in organizational structure brought about by LLM]] (2023-03)
    - [[Plurality and Polis Study Group]] (2023-05)
    - Not only is the bandwidth equal, but machine summarization needs to take place

[[broad listening]]
[[Horizontal organization]]
