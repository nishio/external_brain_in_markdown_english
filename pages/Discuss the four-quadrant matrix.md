title: "Discuss the four-quadrant matrix"
---

I asked [[o1 Pro]] to discuss the same topic in the four different styles described in "[What is logical thinking?
Interesting to compare since we are discussing the same content.

# [[American Essay]] style
1: Conclusion
- The approach of representing things in four quadrants is not appropriate because it oversimplifies the complexity.

2: Argumentation
- Arbitrariness of axes
    - How the two axes are set up is arbitrary and eliminates important elements and perspectives that are not included there.
- Continuity truncation
    - In reality, many elements are composed of continuous quantities and multiple dimensions, so fitting them into the limited framework of the four quadrants tends to omit rich information.
- Fixed point of view
    - Once you fit the four quadrants, you are bound by that frame and may have difficulty understanding other methods of analysis and multiple perspectives.

3: Conclusion (reiterated)
- For these reasons, the approach of representing things in four quadrants is not appropriate because it does not adequately capture the complexity.

Go back and read the log and make a statement arguing that it is not appropriate to express it in four quadrants.
Follow the format below.
1: First, I'll draw a conclusion.
2: List three arguments to support it
3: Repeat the conclusion at the end

# [[French Disertation]] style
1: It is appropriate to express in four quadrants
- When organizing things in the four quadrants, it is a great advantage to be able to break down and overview complex phenomena on two axes.
- In the ancient Chinese book of I Ching, there is a phrase, "One yin and one yang is the way," which attempts to decipher all things based on the basic axis of the opposing dualities of yin and yang.
- Further development of these binary combinations would allow for a multifaceted understanding using a four-quadrant structure.

2: It is not appropriate to express in four quadrants
- On the other hand, the process of fitting the four quadrants tends to truncate ambiguous areas and continuous elements that do not fit there.
- For example, the ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus stated that "all things flow (panta rei)," emphasizing that the world is constantly changing.
- With such a constant transformation of situations and events, the criticism arises that the four quadrants, which are fixed on two axes, do not adequately capture the dynamic aspects of the situation.

3: Dialectical Development
- The four-quadrant method of organization has the advantage of aiding visual and conceptual understanding, but it can also lead to fixation and oversimplification.
- Therefore, while using the four quadrants as the entry point, we must be willing to dynamically expand the frame, adding other axes and dimensions as needed.
- This integration of both arguments into a higher perspective is the heart of the dialectical approach.

4: Summary of Discussion, Tentative Conclusions, and New Questions
- The four quadrants are a powerful means of deepening understanding of the concept as an extension of classical contrasts such as "yin-yang".
- However, from the view that "all things flow and change," there are continuous and fluid qualities that the four quadrants cannot capture.
- Therefore, when utilizing the four quadrants, it is necessary to break out of the fixed framework and continue to flexibly adjust and expand.
- Tentative conclusion: the four quadrants are a useful but inadequate method that needs constant revision and supplementation.
- A new question: how to capture the complex continuum while utilizing the four quadrants and minimizing the amount of undoing is a major challenge for the future.

Read over the log and make a statement discussing whether it is appropriate to express it in four quadrants.
Follow the format below.
1: Discuss that it is appropriate to express in four quadrants, quotes from the classics are preferred.
2: Discuss that it is not appropriate to express in four quadrants, quotes from the classics are preferred.
3: Combine the two opinions and develop them dialectically.
4: Summarize the discussion, present tentative conclusions, and then pose a new question.
```

It would have been better to put something like "Define what is a four quadrant matrix" in the front.

# [[Iranian Ensher]] style

1: Explanation of the background of the subject
- At first glance, the method of expressing things in four quadrants seems to provide an easy-to-understand and organized thought process. However, according to the descriptions in authoritative books, it is strictly pointed out that it is inappropriate to push complex phenomena into the limited framework of the four quadrants in the first place.

2: Explanation of the subject
- Overall Perspective
    - The four quadrants reduce many elements to two axes, thus creating a composition that is superficially simple and easy to understand. However, as authoritative texts have shown, such dualistic thinking runs the risk of greatly overlooking the complexity of reality.
- Middle Viewpoint
    - Inherently multilayered events have dynamic characteristics, with continuous change and multiple elements intertwined at the same time. The four-quadrant framework devalues these multilayered characteristics, and warns that once they are applied to a framework, stereotypes are likely to emerge, further inhibiting flexible responses.
- Detailed Perspectives
    - Therefore, in areas where rigorous analysis and comprehensive discussion are required, the application of the four quadrants can be misleading. Authoritative books, through numerous concrete examples, demonstrate the detrimental effects of the use of the four quadrants, which oversimplify the concept and cause important nuances and diverse interpretations to be lost.

3: Conclusion
- As mentioned above, authoritative books also clearly state that it is inappropriate to describe things in terms of the four quadrants. Hence, we must always be aware of multiple and careful perspectives and continue to search for new possibilities of thinking.
- As the saying goes, "A frog in a well does not know the sea," it is important to keep a vast perspective without being confined to a narrow framework.

Read the log again and make a statement arguing that it is inappropriate to use the four quadrants. It is clear from the statements in the authoritative books that it is inappropriate to use the four quadrants as a given.
Follow the format below.
1: Explanation of the background of the subject
2: Provide an explanation of the subject in three paragraphs, in an orderly fashion, from the whole to the details.
3: Summarize and conclude with a proverb, a verse of poetry, or thanksgiving to God.

As expected, there is no authoritative book describing the four-quadrant matrix, so it seems unreasonable. I think it would be more convincing to have the author argue that it is legal for AI to imitate the style of painting based on copyright law. This time, I wanted to do each style on the same theme, so I had no choice.

# [[Japanese Impressions]] style

1: Explanation of the background of the subject
- At first glance, the method of representing things in four quadrants appears to provide a clear and organized thought process. In reality, however, it tends to truncate multifaceted elements and continuity by forcing complex matters to fit onto two axes. For this reason, there is a persistent criticism that representation in four quadrants is inappropriate.

2: Personal experience of the writer
- I myself once used a four-quadrant matrix to organize disagreements and resource priorities when proposing a new project direction. At first I thought it was a convenient visual summary, but in the process I realized that I had actually overlooked important intermediate opinions and gradations that were necessary due to the nature of the project. As a result, I had the bitter experience of making decisions without fully reflecting the opinions of all team members, and was later forced to make corrections.

3: The writer's growth from personal experience and preparedness for the future
- Through this experience, I strongly learned the danger of getting caught up in the convenience of simplification. It is precisely with "easy-to-understand" methods such as the four quadrants that it is essential to carefully check for hidden assumptions and elements that may be eliminated. In the future, I would like to try to avoid falling into short-sighted assumptions by using multiple analytical frameworks together when necessary, and by checking multiple perspectives within the team.

Compared to the essay style, it is still difficult to understand. In order not to hurt the feelings of those who use the four-quadrant matrix, Japanese people often follow up by saying, "The four-quadrant matrix has some good points," which makes it even more difficult to understand what they are trying to say. Since they do not like confrontation of opinions, they seem to be trying to come to the conclusion that "this is what I experienced" or "this is how I felt", which is undeniable.
