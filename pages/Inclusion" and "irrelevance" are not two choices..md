title: 'Inclusion" and "irrelevance" are not two choices.'

- The words "[[include]]" and "[[unrelated]]" are not [selecting an option (from two alternatives)
- You would think the above illustration would be obvious.
- But the upper right is expressed as "B is A."
    - Then, we naturally come up with its negative form "B is not A".
    - I would consider this to be the top left state.
    - Misinterpreted as almost [[MECE]] with the combination of "is" and "is not"
- In reality, "part of B is A and the rest is not A" happens

- [[False dichotomy]]
