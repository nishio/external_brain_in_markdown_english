title: "Even if there is traffic congestion at the highway exits, it doesn't negate the value of the highway."

I question the statement, "Young people are programming with AI, but that's not good because they won't be able to understand the essence of what they are doing and will be in trouble later.
Even if traffic is congested at highway exits, it doesn't mean "let's stop using the highway".
The fact that a highway called AI was built does not negate its value due to traffic congestion.

    - [[Traffic jam after exiting the highway.]]
- [[value of highway]].
    - [[expressway]]
