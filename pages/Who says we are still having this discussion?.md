title: "Who says we are still having this discussion?"
---

- Some people are a few days late in summarizing a discussion and add their own opinion, "You're still having this discussion, this is -".
- It's an opinion already included in the summary, so it's not adding anything of value.
- I'm the one causing the "still debating."
