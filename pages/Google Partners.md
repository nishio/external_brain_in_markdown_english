title: "Google Partners"
---

- In addition to Google Search and Google Image Search, "Google Partner Search" will be added to Google Search and Google Image Search to suggest the best matches based on your search history on Google and browsing history on Chrome.
- You can search for business partners and not just dating ones.
    - Beneficial for gathering members at the time of establishment
    - Matching is possible even taking into account ideological beliefs and sexual preferences that would be illegal for a human being to hear during an interview.
    - More accurate than the person's self-report because actual activity logs can be used.
    - The success rate is higher than if the person were to find it on his or her own.
- Google could do it.
    - If Google doesn't do it, Baidu Search might.
