[[attention-grabbing]] by crying or cooing is
In effect, it's just "throwing packets into a communication channel called voice.
It is not known if the packet will be received by the intended recipient
That responsibility is not on the sender's side.
Whether the recipient is responsible for the reception depends on other circumstances.
Not receiving a [[notice]] from an app is a [[neglect]] for that app.
