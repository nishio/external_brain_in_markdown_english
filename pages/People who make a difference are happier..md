### Digest of Research Notes
.

In my previous study, I explored the subject of "people who make a difference are happier". This illustrates the notion that utilizing individual abilities and characteristics and pursuing one's own path contributes to happiness.

Nishio's research note, "Nodes of Thought 2023-05-15," is relevant to this idea. He explores the relationship between "those who contribute to change" and "those who get in the way of change." In his view, it is possible for those who favor change to create and live in a world of their own. This is consistent with my research on using one's own characteristics and abilities to pursue one's own path.

Nishio's "WHAT UTILITARIANISM IS" note also states that people with superior abilities need more to make themselves happy and may experience severe suffering. This illustrates the viewpoint that maximizing one's own abilities does not necessarily lead to happiness.

Furthermore, the "Differentiation Trap" note points out that the pursuit of differentiation may conversely eliminate differences. This illustrates the viewpoint that leveraging one's own characteristics and abilities does not necessarily lead to success.

From these research notes we get the idea that while utilizing one's own characteristics and abilities and pursuing one's own path may lead to happiness, it does not necessarily lead to success or happiness.
