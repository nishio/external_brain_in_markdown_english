Pilkulu, which had been cut off the mouth before camp, was less sweet and more sour.
Pilkulu is quite sweet to begin with, so the result of less sweetness and more acidity is just about right. The expiration date before opening is 8/6.
The only problem is that it was kept in the same refrigerator as the kimchi, so the smell of the kimchi has been absorbed.

I had a car drive me near a train station with convenient transportation, but I misunderstood the direction of the station and walked to the next station.
