- If there is a person X who teaches a "means of making money," then if it is a "means of making money," then X will practice it himself
    - So, the ones that don't are [[suspicious]].
- If someone teaches "the means to increase productivity," then if it is "the means to increase productivity," then X will practice it himself
    - So anything that doesn't is suspect.
