title: "OSS and Small Government"

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Comparing the concepts of [[OSS]] (Open Source Software) and big government/small government brings up the following perspectives.

OSS and [[small government]].
- The small government philosophy minimizes [[government intervention]] and emphasizes [[(the) market (as a concept)]] and individual [[freedom]] activities.
- In the world of OSS, individuals and companies are free to use, improve, and distribute software, which encourages a form of [[voluntary collaboration]].
- This is similar to the idea of small government, in that [[communities develop autonomously]] without government or central control.

OSS and [[big government]].
- In the big government concept, on the other hand, the government actively intervenes in the market and society to maintain order and [[fairness]].
- Given the mechanisms in OSS for managing licenses, setting community rules, or distributing rewards to fair contributors, these are more akin to the role of a large government.
- For example, certain controls and rules may be necessary to prevent certain contributors from profiting excessively from OSS projects or to prevent rampant fraud.

Conclusion.
- By its very nature, OSS represents a spirit of small government-like freedom and cooperation, but it may also require big government-like management and rule-setting to actually operate and maintain long-term equity. Both concepts can serve as different approaches to the challenges facing the OSS community.

- When we say "[[big government]]," we tend to think of nations, etc., but a big tech company could be the equivalent.
    - In fact, the [[Ethereum Foundation]] is a "public utility" that distributes funds for public goods OSS.
    - Reduce [[disparity of wealth]] [[redistribution]] is basically taxing it and using it for the public good.
    - [Ethereum can take [[gas money]] from users, and Microsoft can take tolls by occupying business "[[checking stations]]" that would be inconvenient to avoid.
