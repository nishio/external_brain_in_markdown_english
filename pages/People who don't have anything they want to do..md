title: "People who don't have anything they want to do."

- > In the past, the question "I want to learn programming, what language do you recommend?" was answered "First of all, clarify what you [[want to do]]". I thought that the times are repeating themselves.
- > I happened to see [http://dutoit6.com/183](http://dutoit6.com/183) that just now came through and thought, well, there are "want to do" types and "[[ideal]]" types, and the "I want to be a person who can program/understand machine learning" types don't have anything they want to do.
- > If you want to be "a person who can do something," there are many online programming/machine learning courses available, and you can take them and say "I'm a person who completed this course. socially impactful.]" They are trying to fulfill both objectives at the same time, so they can't find an option.
        - [[Objective Multidimensional Patterns]]

- [[There is nothing I want to do.]] People
- Not specific "[[I want to do great things.]]" is not "I want to do" but "I want to be perceived as a great person."
    - Evaluation by others
        - [[Goals involving other people's minds are harmful.]]
    - [[You can't make something great without making something crappy.]]

    - [[Social Impact]]
    - [[I want to be admired.]]
    - [[extrinsic motivation]]

I've noticed something in common with all of the humanities majors who are in agony, saying things like, "I want to be a writer and make a fortune," "I don't think I can work in a company," and "I wanted to be someone. They all refuse to work in sales.

> [rockwell0000](https://x.com/rockwell0000/status/1961795333140435398) Humanities majors who reject sales tend to aim for general affairs and accounting, but what lies beyond general affairs and accounting is a different kind of hell from that of sales. However, since the hell that spreads beyond general affairs and accounting is a different hell from that of sales, people who understand that try to avoid general affairs and accounting as well. This leads to the birth of "a mysterious person who is looking for a white-collar job, avoiding sales, general affairs and accounting, and technical work".

> [rockwell0000](https://x.com/rockwell0000/status/1961797803216364011) If you try to put it in a calm language, "people who are looking for white-collar jobs, avoiding sales, administration, accounting, and technical jobs," it makes too much sense. I'm not sure what kind of work I can do.

> [tweeting_drtaka](https://x.com/tweeting_drtaka/status/1962136840196194646) I've known for a while that all students who quip, "I don't have this or that thing I want to do after graduation," have something in common.
>  To begin with, all of us have never done anything tedious to voluntarily work on something off campus. There is no way that they could suddenly find a goal without doing anything.
