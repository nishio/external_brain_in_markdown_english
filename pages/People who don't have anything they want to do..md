title: "People who don't have anything they want to do."

- > In the past, the question "I want to learn programming, what language do you recommend?" was answered "First of all, clarify what you [[want to do]]". I thought that the times are repeating themselves.
- > I happened to see [http://dutoit6.com/183](http://dutoit6.com/183) that just now came through and thought, well, there are "want to do" types and "[[ideal]]" types, and the "I want to be a person who can program/understand machine learning" types don't have anything they want to do.
- > If you want to be "a person who can do something," there are many online programming/machine learning courses available, and you can take them and say "I'm a person who completed this course. socially impactful.]" They are trying to fulfill both objectives at the same time, so they can't find an option.
        - [[Objective Multidimensional Patterns]]

- [[There is nothing I want to do.]] People
- Not specific "[[I want to do great things.]]" is not "I want to do" but "I want to be perceived as a great person."
    - Evaluation by others
        - [[Goals involving other people's minds are harmful.]]
    - [[You can't make something great without making something crappy.]]

    - [[Social Impact]]
    - [[I want to be admired.]]
    - [[extrinsic motivation]]
