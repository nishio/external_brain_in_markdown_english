I see, if [[Claude 3 Opus]] can load 50 pages of books or something like that into a context, it can contain a day's work log of a normal human being.

Fifty pages of a book is roughly 120,000 words, so if you work 10 hours a day, that's 12,000 words in an hour, 200 words in a minute, or a work log at the rate of 3 words per second, that's a size that would not be filled!
