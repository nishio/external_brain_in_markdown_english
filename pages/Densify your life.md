>  99% of people ask, "Will this [[investment]] increase my money?" is the criterion, whereas "Wouldn't it be nice if life got richer even if the money decreased?" because it's a "yes" question.
>  They say living that way results in more money.

"Will this investment make me more money?" is the idea of converting [[financial capital]] into greater financial capital
- On the other hand, the idea of increasing "density of life" is trying to convert to something that is not financial capital
    - There is no clear language on what this is.
