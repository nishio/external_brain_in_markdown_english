I thought it was great Anti-FUD.

- It is difficult to claim that the probability p of a problem occurring, no matter how small, is "zero".
- Those who insist on "[[zero risk]]" can [[FUD]] by exclaiming, "There could be a problem!" can [[FUD]] by shouting, "There's a [[zero risk]]!
    - I can't say that p is zero as a response to this.
    - You can argue that p is very small, but even if you do that, the zero-risk group will eventually ask, "Is it zero? Is it non-zero? It's not zero!" It's not a solution to the conflict because you can
- Select "Settle by lawsuit" here.
    - If p is small enough, the assumed cost of payment is small enough.
    - If it is comparable to the cost of advertising, it is a promotional option.
    - This allows the user side to claim "zero risk, if a problem should occur, MS will take care of it.
        - Zero-risk group's basis for claim: "There is no zero risk!" can be squashed.
- What's more, by MS doing this, it sends a strong message that "p is very small".
