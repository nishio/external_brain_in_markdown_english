- As quantity increases, the utility of the consumer decreases: [[law of diminishing marginal utility]].
- The supplier's cost (creation cost) rises as the quantity increases: [[law of increasing marginal cost]].
        - [[The law of increasing marginal cost does not fit the reality.]]

- sublation (philosophy)
    - Supply is constant in the short term
        - Demand is the primary factor in price determination: [[marginal utility theory]].
    - In the long run, the producers can change the amount of supply.
        - Price is determined by the producer's convenience: [[work-value theory]].
            - It's not just a matter of convenience on the part of the producers, though.

    - In response, [[Marshall.]] points out
            - [[Marshallian stability]] : A stable equilibrium solution is reached by fluctuations in quantity.
