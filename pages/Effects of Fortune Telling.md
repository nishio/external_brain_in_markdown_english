    - [[options]] When you are having a hard time deciding between option A and option B.
- Unknowingly choosing procrastination with the three choices of "Option A, Option B, [[procrastination]]".
    - Psychological cost of [decision
- Procrastination is not necessarily a bad thing.
    - Because sometimes waiting can provide additional information.
    - But many people choose to procrastinate beyond a reasonable level.
- Troublesome means that the [[Action Value]] of Option A and the Action Value of Option B are almost the same
    - In other words, it shouldn't make much difference which one you choose.
    - And yet, the psychological cost of choice makes procrastination a choice.
    - [[fortune-telling]] erases the cost of choosing by randomly increasing the action value of one of the options
    - Turning it into a "should we act or should we wait?"

- Could this simulation show a case where divination is useful?
    - Given the tendency to procrastinate in making choices when there are many options that are close in value
