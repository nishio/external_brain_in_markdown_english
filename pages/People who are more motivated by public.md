title: "People who are more motivated by public"
---

Some people are more [[willingness (e.g. to do something)]] to pursue [[public interest (e.g. public good)]] than to pursue their own private interests.

These types of people can neglect their own lives and overdo the public
- But it's strange to discourage people who are more motivated by the public from going public.
- I think we need a system that supports them so that they can do public things spontaneously and then support them so that they can get on with their lives.

[[Funding the Commons]]
- It could be seen as a way to channel funds to those who are more apt to create public goods.
    - [[Personnel costs are the main expenditure in advancing the project]].

- [[Altruistic Motivation Improves Working Memory in People with High ADHD Tendency]]

Why is the public more motivated?
- Non-public, private information is created, and it is necessary to change the information to be given out depending on the other party, but personally, the cognitive burden of this is high.
- I want to put my thoughts immediately [[frictionless]] in the public arena, and I'm too lazy to think about how to show them.
    - There are [[positive externalities]] when what you write inspires a thought in the reader and it comes back
    - I am acutely aware of the value of this, which reduces my motivation for projects that cannot be made public.
