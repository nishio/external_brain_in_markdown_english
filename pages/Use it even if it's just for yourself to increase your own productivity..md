title: "Use it even if it's just for yourself to increase your own productivity."

> There are benefits to using git for your own productivity, independent of whether or not other members of your team are using it. Even if you are using it in a textile way, not even cutting branches, it is clearly better than not using it.

Episodes from 2011, when many people still did not understand or utilize the usefulness of Git.
If a tool is useful when used by one person, don't wait for everyone else to step up to the plate and introduce it.

In 2017, I came to believe that Scrapbox is better than blogging:...
    - [[The blog was dismantled and became a social networking site and Scrapbox.]]
    - [[Scrapbox period]]

As of 2023, I feel that connecting my intellectual production to AI is a compelling need.
- Maybe the 16,000 pages I've written in Scrapbox from 2017 to now make it easier to feel significant.
- There is no need for those who don't feel AI is useful to wait until they do to "get in line" with it, and use it on their own because it is important to them personally.
- Gradually try to introduce it to some multi-person projects

relevance
    - [[First, increase personal productivity.]]
    - [[Originality first before co-creation]]
