- I'm getting a headache.
- I finished at 5:30 p.m., so it would have been possible to schedule a meeting in the evening...
    - Well, I'm glad we decided we couldn't do it anymore, so we decided to do it another day.
- When I have a headache, I want the LED to glow red or green to tell me if I should gently sedate myself or if I should exercise because of lack of exercise.
    - Agreed. And I did a search to see if there was any information on this, and it seems that the type of headache defines how to deal with it, but I haven't tried it yet.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/Hiro Aki/icon' alt='/villagepump/Hiro Aki.icon' height="19.5"/>

            - Migraine types should be cooled ‚âí sedation, and those with generalized pain should be warmed ‚âí stretching, apparently.
- I rested a bit and it's getting cold.

- After an hour or so of sleeping, drinking warm tea, and reading parenting comics, it's fixed. 19:00
- [[that you were unconsciously cold from being in the ventilation fan wind all the time]], and that you became aware of the cold as a headache before you became aware of the cold.
- Glad I didn't have to set the meeting at night.
- I got up to go to the bathroom and it started throbbing again...
- 20:00 I was planning to leave when the work was finished...
- and it's 20:40 now.
    - I'm screwed. I'll just go home, take a bath, and go to bed.
- 21:33 Calm down, it's just a stiff left shoulder.
