The [[South Korean]] government is planning to fully introduce AI-equipped [[digital learning materials]] in elementary, junior high, and high schools from 2025 to realize [[individualized learning]] for each student according to his or her proficiency level.

The company will begin using AI textbooks in major subjects such as English and mathematics, with the aim of analyzing students' answer data to reinforce areas of weakness, and enabling teachers to monitor learning progress in real time and reflect it in their instructional plans.

While this kind of [[individualized and optimized learning]] improves academic performance, the pace of introduction is also being adjusted due to concerns about children's digital dependence.

Other attempts in the education field include online school-to-school and country-to-country exchange projects and VR/AR technology to provide immersive learning experiences. Education start-ups are also emerging, creating a variety of digital education solutions such as home study apps and AI tutoring services.
