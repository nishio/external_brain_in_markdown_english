title: "〜It's amazing what you can do!"

- [[Assumption that adults are superior to children]] said to a 30-year-old programmer who would say, "It's amazing that you can program even though you're 15 years old," he said, "It's rude to say to a 25-year-old designer, 'It's amazing that you can draw even though you're 25 years old.
As an actual example, there are cases where programmers say, "It's great that you can write Haskell even though you are a designer.
In other words, there is a pattern of thinking that makes people think, "It's great that you can do that even though you are -" and when age is entered into the equation, it becomes age discrimination, and when occupation is entered into the equation, it becomes occupational discrimination.

- > I've been subjected to a lot of occupational discrimination by IT engineers.
- > I want to say, "You guys really think that just because you have the title of 'designer' that your code skills are not that important," but to be honest, things haven't changed for about 10 years.
- > Think about the unconscious bias in the words "You're a designer "and" you can write Golang or Haskell?
