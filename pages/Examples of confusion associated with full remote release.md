> On December 13, [[LINE Yahoo]] announced that it will revise its remote work system in April 2025. Until now, each department has set its own frequency of coming to work, but from April onward, business departments will be required to come to work once a week in principle, and all other departments will be required to come to work once a month in principle.

Companies with employees who joined the company or moved to rural areas on the assumption that they would be "permanently fully remote" have suddenly switched to a work-at-home policy, thereby reneging on their original promise. This has caused employees to face a loss of trust and disruption to their livelihood. The difficulties in reconciling remote and in-coming work styles were highlighted, with various sources pointing to "immaturity in organizational management that does not assume remote work," "lack of accountability at the time of hiring," "opaque management," "speculation of restructuring intentions," and other issues.
