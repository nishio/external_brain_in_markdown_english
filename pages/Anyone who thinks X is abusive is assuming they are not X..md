title: "Anyone who thinks X is abusive is assuming they are not X."
---

Not an exact cutout, but I'll write it down anyway.

Suppose Mr. A believes that all humans are X.
Suppose you said to Mr. B, "You are X," using the logic that all humans are X, Mr. B is a human, and therefore Mr. B is X.
Suppose Mr. B interprets this as abuse.
Mr. B assumes two things.
- I am not X.
- To be X is to be inferior.

I have a feeling there's another pattern.
- Mr. B incorrectly interprets that "Mr. A thinks 'I am not X'".
    - A's misinterpretation that A is speaking with the intent to undermine him.
        - [[Assumption of intent in statements]]
- Mr. B implicitly believes that others are not X, but he is X, and that is inferior, and he is rebelling out of embarrassment because it was pointed out to him.
    - A feeling I'm thinly aware of but don't want to admit.
        - [[be extremely angry at someone for what they really are]]
