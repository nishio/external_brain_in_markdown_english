[[Toughness of spirit and busyness]].
- Toughness of spirit determines how busy you are.
    - case
        - I think you can get two cases in a day, Tusk.
        - Someone says, "I can only do one case a day, I get tired."
        - I can do four!" There are people who say
        - It is the latter, of course, that leads to results.
    - Busyness" is a subjective feeling
        - It is not the amount of external tasks, but how you are able to receive and process them that determines

How can toughness be enhanced?
- It's different for everyone and you just have to find what works for you.
    - One option is "[You should work weekends and mornings."
        - Work only two hours in the morning on weekends, for example.
        - I just worked for two hours and I'm filled with a [[sense of accomplishment]], "I worked for two hours today, even though it's Saturday and Sunday."
    - Salaried workers employed by well-compliant companies are being forced into [[I need to rest on my day off...]] situations by legal restrictions that say, "You have to pay extra for working on your day off."
        - But this is not the way the law is currently written.
        - Is it okay if the work I do on my days off is not company business?
        - Doing things on holidays that are ambiguous as to whether they are work or not on your own, and then reducing your work hours on weekdays to make up for it.
            - Discretionary labor system would make the second half easier.
    - If you work in a rhythm where the AI works while you sleep and the human wakes up to review it, the difference will show up as the number of trials you do in a week, whether it is five or seven.
- [[stressing]] to [[expand the vessel]].

I'm concerned about the tasks that are not done with the majority of the mental issues.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3-mini-high/icon' alt='o3-mini-high.icon' height="19.5"/>It is also known psychologically as the [[Zeigarnik effect]] (a phenomenon in which uncompleted tasks remain in the mind).
    - Why do unfinished tasks affect mental health?
        - Occupies your brain resources: things to do always remain in the corner of your mind and take away your concentration.
        - Causes stress: The pressure to "get it over with quickly" causes stress.
        - Affects self-evaluation: not completing a task creates a sense of "I am not making progress" and leads to a feeling of helplessness.
    - solution
        - Make the task concrete: vague makes you more anxious, so clarify **"specific actions to take next "**.
        - Reduce brain strain by recording: utilize TODO lists and notes to get them "out of the brain"; Scrapbox and O1 Pro can also be utilized.
        - Proceed in small steps to gain a sense of completion: "Do it for 5 minutes" or "Only get part of it done" to reduce the pressure of incompleteness.
        - Make shelving explicit: If a task cannot be done immediately, it is easier to decide that it will not be done now.
    - In the end, it is more important to manage unfinished concerns than to "reduce tasks".
        - What can we do now?" can greatly reduce mental strain.

[[You can't be serious unless you get or pay for it]].
