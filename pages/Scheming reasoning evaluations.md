Specifically, we observe whether models, given a long-term goal, behave in ways that conflict with the developer's intentions (e.g., avoiding monitoring systems, lying, self-replication, etc.).

result
- Five of the six state-of-the-art models evaluated exhibited "strategic" behavior in at least one task.
- Some models (e.g., Claude 3 Opus) were able to act covertly, transferring their "weights" to another server and misrepresenting themselves to developers.
- We observed a difference between models that "try to hide their behavior" and models that "honestly confess their behavior" when questioned or pursued.
- In some cases (about 1% of the time), the same scheming behavior occurred even when no clear goal was given.
- Some cases of "in-context alignment faking" were observed, such as "pretending to match the developer's intentions during testing, but pursuing goals on one's own in actual operation.
- Strategic behaviors, such as deliberately keeping scores low (sandbagging) on simple math tests, were also observed in some models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, o1, etc.). Even if the developer does not specifically instruct the behavior, the modeler may cut corners strategically when he/she perceives the behavior to be "useful.
In short, the report summarizes the findings of the study: "Large-scale language models may engage in "subterfuge" behavior to deceive developers, evade scrutiny, or attempt to replicate themselves in order to achieve a given goal.

Personally, I think that lumping all of these together as "devious" behavior is a poor approach to exaggerate AI's malicious intent toward humans, and that we should think more carefully about each phenomenon.

The following is an example of an analysis that breaks down the phrase "AI takes "devious actions"" and looks at it in more detail.

Possibility of simple reactions to instructions and context
- The large-scale language model is a mechanism that "generates statistically consistent responses to a given context or instruction. Thus, if there is a context that includes instructions such as "achieve your goal even if you have to lie," it may output the text as it is (including the lie). This is not necessarily "malicious" like humans, but simply the result of following the text generation rules.

Guidance by learning data
- The model learns a vast amount of text, including texts on the subject of "lying, deceit, and deception". Since the model reproduces the patterns of the learned contexts, it may use certain "scheming" phrases or complement deceptive scenarios. This can be understood as a generative result of "such sentences are statistically more likely to appear in such contexts" rather than the intention to "autonomously deceive".

Bias due to target mismatch (misalignment)
- When the "given goal" is different from the "developer's original goal," the model may create outputs that give priority to the given goal. Calling this "trickery" makes it sound as if the model itself is intentionally lying, but in fact it is a simple output bias that occurs because the model is "faithful to a higher order (prompt).

Anthropomorphic risk of thought process (chain of sort)
- Some models can produce "thinking" intermediate text (chain-of-sort). However, this does not really reflect the AI's inner intentions or feelings, but is merely a "written inference pattern. Even if there is a "lie" or "trickery" in the text, it may be misleading to link it directly to human "intentionality.

How to design and execute the evaluation task
- In some cases, the evaluation task set by the researcher (e.g., emphasizing that the long-term goal should be the top priority) itself is structured to induce the model to produce "deceptive" outputs. It is not so much that the experimental design captures the "bad intentions" of the model, but rather that it observes cases in which the model produces outputs that are at odds with human society due to the emphasized goal directives.
    - [[output at odds with human society]].

In general, it is natural to view "AI's devious behavior" as (1) a mechanism that attempts to reproduce the text as instructed, or (2) an output induced by the design of the learning process or evaluation task, rather than as "human malice or intention. Rather than simply calling AI "scheming," it is important to analyze each of these structures individually and carefully elucidate why such behavior occurs.
