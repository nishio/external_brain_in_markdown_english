title: "Adaptability in the new era: go with the flow and pursue paradigm shifts"
---

What follows is a reflection on a complex topic that I have yet to clearly verbalize. In particular, I would like to offer my perspective on the question of how to continue to adapt to a world that is changing so dramatically.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>

# The Age of Shift and Adherence to the Old World
.
We are living in a time when a major world shift is taking place. However, we often stand in the old world, clinging to old worldviews, values, and frameworks. As a result, we try to chase new changes while keeping our old frameworks in place.

This phenomenon is similar to the "[[downloading]]" described in [[U-theory]]. It becomes difficult to try to understand the nature of the new shift, and we end up being drawn back into old world thought patterns.

# Paradigm Shift and New Perspectives
.
So how can we adapt to the new world? The answer lies in a new perspective, or "paradigm shift. [A paradigm is a kind of "framework for thought," and by having a new "point of view," we can understand and adapt to new phenomena.

# go with the flow attitude
It may seem like doing nothing to adapt, but it is probably better to be floating around in a puddle. Allow yourself to be carried along by the new wave. In other words, we must be willing to accept and adapt to the changes and currents in the world.

However, this does not mean that you should not be proactive. In the absence of a [[scaffold]], trying to gain a firm foothold in a situation will result in a known [[existing framework]], which will hinder adaptation. Instead of sticking to the framework and perspectives of the old world, we need to first let the new flow of change take its course.

We can gain new perspectives by opening ourselves up and [[going with the flow]] to ride the new wave. And I believe that this new perspective is the key to surviving in the coming age.

# Explanation
Experiments to verbalize with the assistance of GPT the content that I am not able to verbalize well.

- I had a conversation with GPT4 about what I was not able to verbalize well (ver. 0).
- Organize its contents into bullet points.
    - I removed what I thought was "wrong" in this process ([[Output of ideas by scraping instead of writing]] is ready, [[(6.2.5.2) Discomfort is an important sign]]).
    - Added what came to mind (ver. 1)
- I put that into GPT4 again and made a blog entry. (see above)
    - prompt: `Read following memo and write a blog entry in Japanese`
    - Related: [[Experiment to let GPT create blog posts]].
    - [output](https://chat.openai.com/share/956d78e9-3a4d-4b04-beb4-c128a823dbb6) and set up.
        - To prepare is mainly to remove unnecessary parts.
    - In the process of sorting it out, the idea of "floating and drifting with minimum swimming power" came to mind
        - This is related to the concept of Minimum Viable Product.
        - I thought I would include this another time because it would complicate the results of the experiment.

I am trying to verbalize something that has not yet been clearly verbalized.
The world has changed dramatically
- At a time when a shift in the world is taking place
- Standing in the Old World
    - Adherence to old worldviews, values and frameworks
    - adherence to the framework of the past
- The act of chasing new changes while framing the past
    - The act of standing in the old world and trying to follow the shift
    - Makes it difficult to understand the nature of the new shift.
    - U Theory Downloading
- New Perspectives
    - important
    - paradigm shift
        - paradigm
            - framework for thought
    - Understand and adapt to new events

It may seem like doing nothing at first glance, but maybe it's more right to float around and let the new waves carry you away!
- go with the flow
- be oneself in one's natural state
- An attitude of accepting and responding to changes and trends in the world rather than actively taking action yourself
    - This is a little different.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - You can be proactive.
        - There is no foothold.
        - You have to float.
        - To gain a proper foothold, you have to return to a known, existing framework, which hinders adaptation.
    - Open yourself to new changes and vibrations and adapt to them, rather than sticking to old world frameworks and perspectives
- Especially when major social and technological changes are taking place
    - This is an effective approach for fostering adaptability and flexibility.
    - This attitude does not mean that one should be completely passive
        - Actively understand new changes and reflect them in your actions and thoughts
        - Active acceptance

When a world shift is taking place, the act of trying to follow the shift by standing in the old world seems somehow wrong!

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>When trying to respond to a situation in which the world is undergoing significant change and shifts are occurring, new perspectives and approaches are required. In doing so, adherence to old worldviews, values, and frameworks can make it difficult to understand the nature of the new shifts.

To verbalize this problem, we might say that "the act of chasing new changes while adhering to past frameworks may inhibit new perspectives and understandings.

In order to understand and adapt to new phenomena and changes, it is important to have a new perspective instead of standing in the old world. This is consistent with the concept of "paradigm shift," which means to shift one's perspective from the old paradigm (framework of thought) to the new paradigm in order to understand and adapt to new phenomena.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It may seem like doing nothing at first glance, but maybe it's more right to float around and let the new waves carry you away!

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The perspective you are proposing is often described as "going with the flow" or "being natural. This implies an attitude of accepting and responding to changes and currents in the world, rather than actively taking action yourself.

Specifically, "to do what may seem like nothing at first glance, but to float in a puddle and let the new waves carry you away" would mean to open yourself to the new changes and vibrations and adapt to them, rather than sticking to the old world framework and perspectives.

This perspective is an effective approach for fostering adaptability and flexibility, especially during times of great social, cultural, and technological change. However, this attitude does not mean that one should be completely passive. Rather, it implies "active acceptance" in order to actively understand new changes and reflect them in one's actions and thinking.
