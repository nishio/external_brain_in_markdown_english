title: "Instead of designing a generic system, do one specific thing first."

[[generic]]
- [[General]]
        - [[It is easier to function with specific data than with general data]]
    - [[abstract]]
        - [[If you can't think abstractly and move forward, think concretely.]]

- [[system]]
    - [[framework]]
- [[Library]]
        - [[Don't try to create a perfect library.]]
- [[who only makes libraries for games and never completes the game]].
    - → [[Syndrome of creating a game framework instead of a game]]

- [[concrete]]

[[Done is better than perfect]]
