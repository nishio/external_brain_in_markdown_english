<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>In project management, striking a balance between [[broad participation]] and [[agility]] ([[speed]]) is key to success. There is often a [[trade-off]] between the participation of many people and the rapid progress of the project, especially when [[urgency]] is high. This section discusses how these two aspects may conflict.

Advantages and disadvantages of broad participation
- Benefits
        - [[Diverse perspectives]] : A wide range of [[participation]] can lead to diverse ideas and solutions, fostering creativity and innovation.
    - Leveraging skill sets: Having members with [[different skills]] allows the project to take a more multifaceted approach.
- Disadvantages: -Disadvantages: -Disadvantages: -Disadvantages: -Disadvantages
    - [Communication delays: The more participants, the more cumbersome communication becomes and the longer it takes to reach consensus.
    - Delayed decision-making: The process of making decisions can be stymied by the many opinions exchanged.

Importance of agility
    - [Agility, or [[speed]], is especially important, especially when [[deadline]] is imminent or when the market is volatile. [Fast decision making and quick action are necessary to maintain a [[competitive edge]].

Managing Tradeoffs
- For urgent projects, encouraging broad participation can slow down the project. In particular, careful selection of participants is required in the following situations
    - Urgent: When a project deadline is imminent, a quick response by a select few specialists may be optimal.
    - Task specificity: For tasks requiring a specific high level of skill, a limited number of personnel with relevant expertise is appropriate.

Conclusion.
In projects, it is important to strike a balance between "broad participation" and "agility," but either should be prioritized depending on the situation. The [[project manager]] should carefully select the number and quality of participants according to the purpose and urgency of the project, with the goal of efficient and effective project management. While taking [[Brooks's Law]] into account, [[project managers]] should be resourceful in using the right mix of resources and skills, rather than adding people to a project that is under fire without a plan.
