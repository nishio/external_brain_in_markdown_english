title: "A little less, others more."
---

It is simple when drawn in a diagram, but when you try to explain it in words, it is so complicated that people get confused and think in a strange way.

- [[Even if the quantity doesn't decrease, the percentage will.]]

- If the quantity of one thing A does not decrease, but the quantity of another thing B increases, then the proportion of A in the total of A and B will decrease.
- Although it looks obvious in the figure, some people focus on the words "decrease or not decrease" and think in a way that blurs the distinction between [[quantity and percentage]].
- When we're talking about "decreasing proportions," it doesn't matter whether the quantity is decreasing or not, because even if the quantity of A is increasing, if the quantity of B is increasing faster, then the proportion of A is decreasing.

Error in considering 99% as 100%.

    - [[Narrow observation range]], [[unconsciously ignoring what is inconvenient]], [[simplification]] when it is not 100% due to poor thinking skills, etc.
- Mistaking or claiming "something that already exists as a fact" for "something that does not."
- The premise is at odds with those who know "there is."

[[error that I think the quantity will be maintained]].
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/6bad9ea71d62e9a6f625bf2e94a78038/thumb/1000)
- The fallacy that what we have now will be maintained in the future in the same quantity as it is now.
- Most of the time it will increase or decrease, but implicitly assumes that the same amount will be maintained without considering the possibility of such an increase or decrease

[[confusing decrease with disappearance]].
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/b1c3baf6693680f73ff4675ac2c8659f/thumb/1000)
- Some people argue that it's "going down" and say, "I don't think it's going away!" Some people argue that "it's not going away!
- You mischaracterize the claim of "decrease" as a claim of "disappearance," and then argue against it.
    - It's just useless noise because the premise is false.
