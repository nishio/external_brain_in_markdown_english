I should have written X or something on the green part.
- In the figure, A and B may or may not intersect.
- [[intersecting]].
    - $x \in A, x \in B$
- [[Not intersected]]
    - $x = (A, B)$
    - Image of an edge in graph theory
    - Of course x can have the same relationship with more than 3 sets
        - [Hypergraph.
- If we interpret that X itself is also a set, then by the "intersecting relation"[$ \sim
    - $X\sim A, X \sim B$
    - In that case $A \not\sim B$.
    - But in the figure on the left, $A \sim B$.
    - Intersecting and not intersecting seem incompatible, but not so strictly incompatible.
        - The difference between thinking of X as an element and a point with no magnitude, or as a set and with magnitude
                - [[Isn't it the size?]]
                    - [[It's not a point, it's a size.]]
